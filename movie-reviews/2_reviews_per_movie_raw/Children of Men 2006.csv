"gogoschka-1","10","194","230","11 January 2017"," A gut-wrenching look at an all too possible future - but also an immensely entertaining thrill ride featuring some of the best cinematography you'll ever see
","I first saw 'Children of Men' when it came out, 10 years ago, and while I liked it a lot, I kind of forgot about it soon. At the time, it failed to resonate with me on a deeper level - which in hindsight I find astounding. <br/><br/>Last month, a decade later almost to the day, I suddenly felt the urge to revisit the film (because it was mentioned in an article about ""long takes""), and upon re-watching it, it just blew my mind. This film is so, so, good! <br/><br/>It not only manages in many aspects to be the most prophetic - and most shockingly realistic - sci-fi film I have ever seen: it achieves that feat with a level of style and through such an abundance of fantastic creative choices and innovative camera techniques that I was simply left in awe. <br/><br/>I was forced to conclude that this film was a visionary piece of art (and how that fact had eluded me the first time around I couldn't - and still can't - explain). It's a cinéphile's dream come true; it's a masterpiece in the true sense of the word.<br/><br/>'Children of Men' is a gut-wrenching look at an all too possible future, but it also works as a heart-stopping, adrenaline-rush-inducing piece of entertainment featuring some of the most breathtaking camera work you'll ever see.<br/><br/>The performances are flawless. The artwork, the production design, the music; I could go on and on: this is one of those few real masterworks where everything just comes together right. And I believe the final 30 minutes of the film rank among the finest achievements in the history of Cinema.

"anton_lak","9","664","942","2 November 2006"," Highlights of the movie
","OK, I only got through the first 3 pages of comments but let me add my own. <br/><br/>1) Fantastic cinematography. Some like hand-held, some don't. It certainly worked very well here. <br/><br/>2) Related to (1), very long shots. There is one scene where the camera lens has blood splats on it for quite a few minutes. Hollywood would get rid of it, but for this movie it adds amazingly to the atmosphere that is being created. <br/><br/>3) Like ""Code46"" the technology is in the background. Just the way it should be, allowing us to focus on the story. <br/><br/>4) Theo as the central character NEVER picks up a gun, despite them being all over the place and easily available. As a viewer you are almost willing him to do so, to manage some of his challenges - but very deliberately the character does not. <br/><br/>5) I've read separately that yes this is a comment on current society. Being an Australian, with our controversial immigration laws and practices, that rings true. <br/><br/>6) Similar to (5), using the term ""Homeland Security"" in the movie is an obvious reference. <br/><br/>7) The revolutionaries/terrorists/fishes are shown to be just as political and militant as the government they oppose.<br/><br/>There are more, but that is enough. Overall a wonderful movie which leaves me thinking for a long time, which is all I ask.<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/>Anton."
"GregWolf","10","806","1150","22 September 2006"," Utterly transfixed
","I went to see this movie without catching any reviews, expecting something rather depressing and underfunded.<br/><br/>Let me stop there and start again.<br/><br/>This movie is a revelation from start to finish. A convincing future world, deftly conveyed with so many subtle signals that I'm sure it will benefit from further viewings. A completely ""other"" England which I was amazed to see realised in such detail. Clive Owen FINALLY has the heroic role we have been waiting for and is brilliant in it. Julianne Moore simply glows and I've never enjoyed Sir Michael Caine so much before. The soundtrack is beautifully eclectic. Aside from some excellent classical choices, there's an evocative and alternative Spanish take on ""Ruby Tuesday"" which is a signature on the film. Wait during the end titles to enjoy an excremental song from Jarvis Cocker.<br/><br/>The movie grabbed my attention right from the start, and never let go. Initially, it's the differences of this future world that intrigue. Then, when the action starts, what I found really surprising was the freshness of direction that made me react to bullets and violence as if I'd never seen them in a movie before. If the script wasn't so wonderfully leavened with wit, it would be a grim and scary movie at times.<br/><br/>Finally, the whole thing is lit brilliantly, from the authentic dim English days to the atmospheric ending.<br/><br/>One to watch alongside ""The Handmaid's Tale"" some time...."
"Youkilledmypine","9","669","957","23 September 2006"," ""The future's a thing of the past."" Tremendous from start to finish.
","The apocalypse arrives on film once again in a plot so simple it's horrifyingly believable. It's 2027 and the world is close to annihilation because no child has been born in 18 years. London office worker Theo (Clive Owen) is offered cash by a radical ex-girlfriend to escort a refugee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to safety. Their lives are soon at risk from both government and revolutionaries.<br/><br/>Although the camera work and cinematography is nothing short of stunning the focus always with our protagonist, ensuring we're kept in the middle of the action throughout. It is also undoubtedly one of Owen's finest performances to date. Theo is never far from danger yet he struggles on with convincing dignity. Occasionally baffled but far from stupid - Theo is essentially a reckless, underplayed action hero that doesn't jump at every opportunity to arm himself with a gun. This works well with the international ensemble of incredible talent: Michael Caine's charming pot dealing hippie, feisty Julianne Moore, key role Claire-Hope Ashitey, the wonderful Pam Ferris, the increasingly busy, excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor, Danny Huston and writer/director/producer Peter Cullen (gloriously sadistic Syd) to name a few... This is surely a casting coup to be jealous of.<br/><br/>The episodic nature of the story makes Children of Men difficult to place into one genre alone. Briefly glimpsed futuristic sci-fi technology is grounded in reality and looks entirely achievable while grey, graffiti ridden concrete locations provide an excellent backdrop for the near satirical look of our current social and political climate. There's poignant drama interspersed amongst exhilarating action and yet enough twists to call it a thriller. <br/><br/>This is not to say it's flawless. Some exposition is handled better in places than others for instance. However Alfonso Cuarón has achieved a completely remarkable experience. Arguably the film could have been longer given how strong most of it is. The only really hard pill to swallow is the comedy juxtaposed with some stark imagery that looks all too familiar to anyone who has ever seen the News from the past few decades. Nice to see a Pink Floyd reference though (pigs might fly!), and someone finally found a use for Battersea Power Station.<br/><br/>Ideally an audience should see this film with no preconceptions and know as little about the plot as possible. This will be unlikely though due to a staggered box-office release schedule, word of mouth and a plethora of reviews and trailers that are eager to give much of the game away. Ironic then perhaps that it must be said - Children of Men is a cinematic milestone. Great special effects and an effective soundtrack accompany this heartfelt, moving and thought-provoking film. Easily one of the best films in recent memory."
"adamk-2","10","525","778","23 October 2006"," Restored my faith in the art of cinema
","I've had a particularly bad film year, especially after having seen one particular over-hyped vacuous mess earlier in the year which all but killed my desire to see any films, no matter how interesting they looked or what the critics said about them. So, it was with a little trepidation that I went to see this, especially given that it starred Clive Owen (IMHO, the George Lazenby of British acting).<br/><br/>Well, I loved it and I'm not ashamed. It's unremittingly bleak and violent, but so beautifully filmed and realised that, at one point, I damn nearly burst into tears that someone could have created something so fresh and so moving, so provocative, so disturbing and so grimly beautiful. I thought it brought a real sense of imagination to the screen and that it was possessed of a fantastic visual flair. I felt that it ended on a note of hope, however uncertain and unclear, and certainly a note of redemption for the hero. I'll admit that Owen, while he still hasn't convinced me that he's a great actor, pulls off this role with a hangdog...um, doggedness that I found believable and often even moving.<br/><br/>I left the cinema strangely elated, relieved that cinema still has the power to move."
"green_fairy2","9","702","1058","2 September 2006"," Amazing Film. Truly fantastic! Mindblowing...
","I've seen this film and let me tell everyone that it was one of the most pleasurable surprises I've ever had with a film. I hadn't heard about it before and it totally took me by surprise. It blew me away and left me speechless. The acting is excellent by most of the actors, but Michael Caine deserves to receive a special mention for his amazing portrait of the old hippie Jasper. His performance is fantastic and he totally stole the show in the scenes he was in. Claire Hope is also fantastic in the role of Kee. Her performance is quite impressive, especially considering this is one of her first films. Clive Owen is also great as the reluctant hero who sees his life turned upside down and is given a huge responsibility. I've seen him in some other films and he's at his best here. A very good performance, you could feel what he was going through. In the technical aspects the film was brilliant, particularly Alfonso Cuarón's strong and consistent direction that is one of the best things in the film, and contributes a lot to its quality. Also director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki does wonders with images and there are some extremely beautiful shots all done in a naturalistic way, natural lighting, etc. It's an extremely well crafted film that makes you go through the emotional struggle the characters go through and makes you feel that you're in the middle of it all. Besides, it's also an extremely touching story that certainly touched my heart. One of the best films I've ever seen without any doubt."
"Philby-3","9","382","588","6 November 2006"," A thinking person's thriller
","Alfonso Cuaron has given us a very clever rendering of a very English dystopian novel. P D James, the ""Baroness of Bad"" is famous for her well-written and absorbing police procedural novels (""Inspector Dalgliesh"") but in the early 90s she produced a vision of a world only 20 years into the future in which for unspecified reasons all the women on earth have become infertile and no babies have been born for the last 18 years.<br/><br/>The rest of the world has lapsed into chaos but the British, stoically, have put the remainder of their civil liberties into the fire and have settled down under an oppressive dictatorship to ward off foreign boarders and await inevitable extinction, though there are some violent dissidents called the fish.<br/><br/>Theo (Clive Owen), a journalist with connections to the top, is ""persuaded"" by his ex-wife and fish member Julian (Julianne Moore) to obtain some exit papers for Kee (Claire Hope Ashity) a young black woman, who, it turns out, is pregnant. Theo is swept up in Kee's escape across a grim decaying landscape. Not only are there the security forces to contend with, but some equally ruthless insurgents. Cuaron builds the tension exquisitely, interspersing the adrenaline fueled bits with quieter bits.<br/><br/>Kee' projected saviors are a mysterious group called the Human Project who conveniently sail their well-maintained Greenpeace style ex-North Sea fishing trawler past offshore light buoys in the hope of rescuing the human race. But the improbability of this doesn't matter much because by the end of the movie Cuaron has effectively demonstrated what the world would be like if humankind suddenly stopped reproducing. Having children is our way of cheating death, without them there is nothing but death, and in this future there are none about but the living dead.<br/><br/>The casting is pretty well perfect. Clive Owen as Theo puts his haunted good looks to good use as he turns from cynical reporter to a hunted enemy of the state. The motley characters he meets along the way  his ex-wife, the fish rebels, the refugees who help him, the ""fascist pig"" border guard and above all Michael Caine's aging hippie are all wonderfully realized.<br/><br/>It has been suggested that Cuaron has really made a film about today, not 20 years into the future. The rampaging security forces we see might as well be in Bosnia or Iraq, or even Northern Ireland. In an age of terrorism, order without law very quickly becomes tyranny, which has never been the answer to terrorism. What he and PD James do demonstrate is just how fragile our civil society is.<br/><br/>As a film this is a very fine piece of work. The sets exude grimy Britain, the battles are hair-raising, the quieter moments intense. Cuaron would do a great James Bond movie. He has turned a rather rarefied novel into an exiting and engrossing thriller without obscuring the original message. He is a very versatile and enterprising film-maker and I'm sure he's going to do lots more good stuff."
"darth_random","10","370","582","28 October 2006"," Electrifying thriller may be best of 2006
","Of all the visions of the future movie audiences have been treated to over the past few years, the world of Children of Men may be the most frightening and allegorically effective yet.<br/><br/>Directed by Alfonso Cauron (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), and set in 2027 London, the film takes place at a time when the planet is in the grip of an infertility crisis. Societies worldwide have collapsed after no children have been born in almost two decades, and the survivors of the ensuing wars, atrocities and civil breakdowns flee to Britain, which still functions under a harsh regime.<br/><br/>Clive Owen (Closer, Sin City) plays Theo, a former activist now working as a paper-pusher in the Ministry of Energy and downing a large amount of Scotch to get him through the day. He walks to work past terrorist bombings, cages filled with illegal immigrants rounded up by riot police, and piles of garbage littering the London streets. When an old flame and revolutionary, played by Julianne Moore, appears with a request that he use his governmental connections to help her move a refugee girl across the country, he agrees on the basis he be compensated. When he discovers that the girl (Kee, played by Claire-Hope Ashitey) is pregnant, his mission takes on new dimensions.<br/><br/>Cauron and his team of production designers have created what is, perhaps, the most believable vision of the future seen in quite some time. Advanced technology exists side by side with squalor, and is never allowed to steal the audiences attention away from the proceedings for too long. As far as being a realistic portrayal of Britain in twenty years time, the film is light years ahead of last year's disappointing V for Vendetta, which stripped away British iconography and culture and essentially kept London as a rather two-dimensional metaphor for the United States.<br/><br/>As a thriller, the film is blisteringly intense and incredibly effective. From the bomb blast that caps off the opening credits to the frenzied urban warfare sequences that dominate the film's closing thirty minutes, Cauron never lets the film lag. Though it slows down enough to deal with character development and exposition, the film maintains a running intensity as Theo and Kee try to stay one step ahead of terrorists, the police, the army and random opportunists. Several action scenes are shot in continuous takes, and make for compelling and electrifying viewing.<br/><br/>However, the film works as a socio-political drama as well. Though Cauron's two central messages (that immigrants enrich, rather than threaten, Western society, and that the outlook for human survival is dim when operatives on all sides let ideology displace compassion and good judgment) are strongly put, he is never so heavy-handed that they dominate or displace the actual storyline. Similarly, while the film makes numerous metaphorical references to present-day events, they are never so contrived as to derail the narrative.<br/><br/>The film features solid performances from Clive Owen, who is at his rugged, rumpled best, and Julianne Moore. Supporting players also do well: Michael Caine is terrific as Theo's pot-growing hippie friend, the versatile Chiwitel Ejiofor is again in fine form as a revolutionary cell leader, and Pam Ferris is also good as another of Kee's protectors. It is, however, Claire-Hope Ashitey who stands out as the illegal immigrant who may well be humanity's hope for the future.<br/><br/>Children of Men is packed with explosive action, incendiary social commentary and some white-hot performances. As a result, it may well be the best film of the year."
"jflet","9","435","696","12 September 2006"," Carefully crafted piece of work
","This year I attended for the first time the Venice Film Festival in Italy. I was of course quite excited and bought tickets to some screenings of a few different films I found interesting. Initially Children of Men wasn't in my plans but I was convinced by a friend who was very enthusiastic about it. Now I say I'm glad I bought the tickets! What an amazing film this is. The science fiction genre is just a coat to project into the future the horrors and problems of our current days and many films attempt that ending up, in most cases, failing. This one however succeeds. Succeeds indeed but not only in this... The film blew away nearly everyone in the audience as one of the best action movies we have seen lately, with extremely exciting and brutal chases, gun fights, etc. Don't be put off by this though, the film is as good as it is not because of the action sequences but its amazingly emotional and touching story. The performances of the cast is impressive especially Clive Owen and the newcomer Claire Hope Ashitey who throughout the film develop the relationship between their characters and it's such a joy to see the development. I'm not very good at writing reviews so I think I'll stop know, but I had at least to transmit something to everyone who might be interested in watching this film. Don't pass this one, you won't regret it. In my view one of the few excellent films released this year."
"trpuk1968","9","316","532","23 September 2006"," Enthralling, haunting addition to the apocalypse genre
","Worthy addition to a very British literary, televisual and cinematic tradition of dystopian and apocalyptic narratives. H.G Wells, John Wyndham, SURVIVORS, 28 DAYS LATER.<br/><br/>These texts are revealing of the times in which they were made. Rather than looking forwards,they re often, at heart, deeply conservative. They frequently express a desire for a world where the centralised, industrial society has broken down entirely, replaced by an agrarian based model comprising small, rural communities. These narratives coincided with the rise in 'alternative ' lifestyles, interest in self sufficiency, organic farming, low technology and a different relationship with the Earth. Nostalgia for a pre Industrial past is more prominent than hope and anticipation of a glorious new future when civilisations been destroyed for a new, better world to emerge.<br/><br/>The grand narratives which we once imagined were going to change and improve the world no longer seem credible. Following the collapse of communism, there's a distrust of ideologies, especially those of the left. Arguably, the left has collapsed in the Western World. Thats the context this film arrives in, one where there seems no meaningfully effective counterbalance to the continued dominance of global capitalism, media saturation and environmental meltdown.<br/><br/>Arguably this film offers some hope but my overall impression is of something a lot bleaker than other apocalypse narratives. Without children there is, literally, no future left. Although emerging from a different context, this film shares with its predecessors a thoroughly revealing indication of the concerns preoccupying the time in which it was made. <br/><br/>Two scenes haunted me. The man in Battersea, isolated with his art collection and the set pieces of the illegal immigrants, rounded up and caged. <br/><br/>The Battersea scene uses its location and choice of Picasso's Gernika painting in the background to make a searing comment on a civilisation which, despite its pretensions to Art and Culture, has managed to engineer its own extinction. A civilisation whose intellectual and cultural elites, instead of challenging the prevailing discourse, isolate themselves, collusive in a form of collective denial.<br/><br/>The illegals scene is composed in such a way as to recreate images from the War on Terror, images which are now iconic. Both scenes link together through use of the painting which is an inspired device. This is definitely a movie to watch and work at. I was also intrigued by the recurring animals, and reminded of Tarkovsky, whose work is consistently loaded with symbolism. The scene at the empty, abandoned school was very reminiscent of the Russian director. Also praiseworthy is the astonishing use of sound, particularly in one of the key scenes when dogs can be heard barking in the distance.<br/><br/>Another haunting image is that of the flowers and wreaths laid very early on, after the youngest person on earth has died. Reminiscent of the mawkishness, sentimentality and mass hysteria of those laying floral tributes to murder victims they never knew, the so called 'Diana effect'. Again, a clear reference to todays world.<br/><br/>This is an outstanding piece of film making, I agree totally with previous reviewers comments, especially regarding the battle scenes, which have an immediacy, bringing to mind COME AND SEE or APOCALYPSE NOW. I ll give the last word to Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian newspapers film critic who called this 'a thinking persons action movie.'"
"EJL_1002","10","7","8","6 September 2019"," An Extremely Well Made Thriller
","Children of Men is one of my favorite movies. The emotional beats hit hard and all of the acting is excellent. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen, and the sets look so real. The OST is also amazing and is quite somber yet beautiful. It also has a well written and thought provoking script with interesting themes and symbolism. Would recommend to anyone."
"blestang","8","326","579","25 October 2006"," a must see= brilliant and fresh
","this film is one of the best things i have seen this year. It's an improbable cross between ""Brazil"" ""a clockwork orange"" and the video game HALF-LIFE2 (from which it borrows it's final sequences and use of on shot action-sequences) it manages to be both entertaining in the Hollywood way (with incredible action sequences and a very clever way of using digital effects) yet very sad and different with a very very dark and realistic overtone. No comic relief, no cartoon character bravery, only human behavior in it's best and most horrible way. This realistic overtone makes the main characters very engaging and moving. CLive owen (whose i have always disliked) is excellent as the man drowned into an adventure too big for him (sorry for my bad English)<br/><br/>It's the same kind of film than V for vendetta (both taking place in a futuristic fascist British society) different from the usual mainstrean studio teenager pleaser crap<br/><br/>GO see it! help intelligent cinema"
"DansLaLuna","10","137","235","5 September 2006"," A Wonderful Surprise
","I saw this movie at a screening a few months ago. I admit I wouldn't normally buy a ticket based on the premise, but I love Alfonso Cuarons work and I covet Clive Owen. Here was a review I posted at the time.<br/><br/>Last night I had the opportunity to attend a screening of ""Children of Men"" which I jumped at. Although I love Alfonso Cuaron's work, the driving force in getting me to see this film is Clive Owen. I didn't read the book, but I knew a little going in. It is a Sci-fi piece that takes place in the near future, and the world is infertile. This is not something that I would normally buy a ticket for but again, my boyfriend was in it, so I was there. Firstly I can say that though this piece is touted as Sci-fi, it is a far cry from it. The whole movie had a very realistic feel to it. The time is 2027 and the settings are almost post-apocalyptic. There is a huge crack down on immigrants, who at this day and age, are treated with disdain, hatred and violence. There are key scenes in the movie that are reminiscent of Nazi Germany. The movie takes place between London and the English countryside. There is filth, trash, rot, decay and death everywhere. The attention to detail in this stark life is prominent in every scene, it's brilliant. I loved this movie!<br/><br/>The movie opens with the death of the worlds youngest citizen, who was just 18. This kid was a celebrity simply for being the last human being ever born, and the world goes into mourning, the inevitability of becoming extinct has just become even more apparent to all. Clive Owen's reluctant Theo is pulled into a plot by his activist Ex-wife, Julianne Moore, to save a girl who has a little secret. This girl, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) is pregnant and an immigrant. Theo is pulled in different directions, not knowing whom to trust in a world which would embrace having a baby, but wouldn't acknowledge (and probably kill) the baby's mother because of her immigrant status. Theo is not a hero type, and would rather just take slugs off his Scotch Whiskey than save the world. He never even picks up a gun. Theo is aided by his friend Jasper, the Patriarch of pot, played to the hilt by Michael Caine. I couldn't help but smile every time Caine was on the screen, he was such a pleasure to watch, and you could tell he was having a hell of a good time with this part. Jasper lives in a house out in the woods with his sick wife and his pot plants. This house is the only place in the movie that translates to any type of peace or light, as are the scenes between Owen & Caine. Theo's ultimate plan is to get Kee and her baby to a boat that will lead them to safety and freedom. Along the way they learn that the people they should be able to trust, can't be trusted, and the ones who look a bit on the dicey side turn out to be OK, just a bit insane.<br/><br/>I don't want to go much more into the storyline, having been abused here before for including too much of the story. One thing I did notice early on, which became a main stay in the movie, was the presence of animals. Having not read the book, I am guessing that animals are more prevalent in families, to take the place of children. There are very few scenes in this movie where you won't see or hear a dog or cat. Also, this movie is a very visual one. I didn't expect as much violence as there was and some of it sneaks up on you and hits you on the head. There is a lot of hand held camera action, which can tend to get kinda shaky. And the use of sound in this movie is key. There is a scene towards the end of the movie done in long-shot where one sound literally stops the world, for a minute, it's literally breathtaking. It was also interesting to see how the immigrants were set-up in the camps. There was some segregation, but for the most part you had all different types of people from all over the world living together in these hovels; in the halls, on the stairs, every race and religion, crammed together, for survival sake. I guess some people might say the movie is slow, but Owen was on the screen the whole time and I AM biased, so I think at about 1 hour 35 minutes, it moved fine and overall I think it was a great film. I don't know how Universal is going to market this, but I think if they do it right they could have a sleeper hit on their hands."
"charliekusiel","9","14","19","5 April 2018"," Children of Men- masterful!
","Just finished Alfonso Cuarón's ""Children of Men"", and let me tell you, I did not see something of its scale coming when I loaded it into the DVD player. The first half an hour or so I was kinda confused, I'll admit, but eventually I caught on and got pretty engrossed in it. The acting was so phenomenal. Certain characters, such as the ones played by Clive Owen and Clare-Hope Ashitey stood out. Their performances intensified the story to an extreme point of me having to press pause and take a breather. The cinematography was also very impressive. The use of long shots were extremely effective, and at one point in the movie, a split of blood stayed on the camera lense for several minutes. These kinds of details have the film a unique style so in sync with the story. Something else I noticed that has never stood out to me before was sound mixing. They used layer upon layer upon layer to create this gritty realisticness. The sound department did a great job of bringing certain sounds out at the right time. Combine the sound, eye candy, acting and great story, and they've created not only a solid film, but a really phenomenal one. The plot took unexpected yet appropriate twists that pushed the plot and my emotions along, and I didn't see the events of the last act coming at all. But it all felt right. This was a really really good movie."

-It is very well produced and translates the absurdity of many modern age problems very well,

","Children of Men is one of my personal favorite movies thanks to superb direction from Alfonso Cuarón, Beautiful cinematography by Emanuel Lubezki, an incredible screenplay and premise and great performances from Clive Owen and the rest of the cast. Children of men has some truly jaw dropping moments of beauty and horror shown through some of the greatest long takes ever shown in cinema's history. The world is thought out and nuanced and has strong themes of what it means to be human. It would be my first choice for a movie to analyse on philosophy, themes and film making as a whole. It in my opinion at least is film at its full potential"
"sauravjoshi85","9","4","4","17 March 2019"," A perfect piece of work
","This movie is a real beauty and needs a lots of patience to watch. The movie is slow and it's add to the beauty of the movie. Screenplay is something to vouch for, although being a slow movie it's still holds you and didn't loose the grip. Acting is terrific and full credit should be given to Clive Owen to lift the major part of the movie on his shoulder perfectly. Background music is very gripping and acts as icing on the cake. It's a beautiful movie."
"mike-morgan","6","197","354","6 January 2007"," Not Deserving of its Present Rating
","After reading various reviews and seeing the previews, I was quite excited to see ""Children of Men"". Upon viewing the movie, however, I was unable to see why users were rating it so highly. I believe there is a predilection to highly rate any Futuristic Dystopia, as they graphically transport us to a time that we are ever so interested in -- our not-too-distant future. ""Children of Men"" does this better than most, since -- with the exception of the infertility theme -- it does not highly disconnect us from what our future is likely to be.<br/><br/>Other than that, however, the movie lacks what it was claimed to be; it is not ""Bladerunner"" Redux -- not even close. The movie does not operate on multiple philosophical levels, and those attempting to dissect it are having difficulty not because it is especially deep, but because it lacks much beyond its initial layer. As a futuristic thriller (and very graphically violent, at that) it works marginally well, as there were a couple of moments when I felt my heart pitter-patter in that movie-theater way. Outside of that, there is not much going on here, besides the obvious: the world is going to hell and there are too many guns. Get on with it."
"sean-421","7","8","10","30 January 2011"," Powerful images, questionable screenplay
","This movie actually reminds me a fair amount of Apocalypse Now. Obviously the premise is inverted; in this movie the protagonists are hunted rather than hunting (although they are hunting a boat, I suppose). But in both cases there is a ceaseless progression from one increasingly surreal episode to the next. The lack of exposition feeds the sense of uncertainty (and apparently leads to some great frustration in some of the other reviews). Where the movie succeeds is not in an overriding message or in the story as a whole, but in individually powerful scenes such as the birth of the child, the entrance into the refugee camp where people are being executed, the shooting of Julian. Where things break down completely into chaos I was also reminded of Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>The story as a whole has its weak points, and this is even if you accept the premise that hunting down a boat to give them a baby may somehow save humanity. I find it hard to believe that a large number of soldiers, seeing their first baby in 18 years, would allow themselves to be distracted by anything long enough to let it get away. I also found that the Fishes had an almost magical ability to track down the protagonists wherever they went. Jasper can hide his pot dealing apparatus from the authorities for years, but the Fishes sniff them out almost instantly. They disappear into a secure refugee camp where nobody knows who they are, but when chaos starts the Fishes show up. And for all the size of the Fish movement, it's the same three or four folks who keep bumping into Theo. I feel the story would have been more effective if the Fishes had simply not been seen again after Jasper's place (if they really even needed to be seen there). Fascist British troops and the denizens of the camp itself could surely have provided sufficient villainy for the dramatic tension towards the end, and it would have felt a bit less contrived that way.<br/><br/>Ultimately I ended up liking the idea of the movie better than the execution, due to these writing issues. Keeping things mysterious is a nice alternative to the exposition-laden alternative, but in this case doing so fails to obfuscate the internal inconsistencies that tend to drive some of us nuts."

","Children of Men is one of those movies that stand out in every sense, is one of those few movies with the special quality of leaving us a great mark after watching them. They move our feelings, alter our ideas and show us terrifyingly close or future probabilities, feasible realities that constantly haunt us, this work is responsible not only to present us with a constant and top quality, but is also a work that will make us feel every beat of the heart.<br/><br/>It's criminal to know that this movie didn't have the critical or box-office acceptance when it was released, I honestly can't understand why, but thanks to the power of the internet, in recent years it has been slowly but surely recovering its location as a master cult movie.<br/><br/>Each scene of the film is an artistic work, each moment is a fantastic inspection of cinematic art. The cinematography is totally beautiful, full of incredible moments, tense and realistic, that make us feel the pressure in our throat. I have to highlight the end of the film, which is probably one of the most fantastic, surreal and impressive camera works in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>The performances are of the highest quality, full of emotion and realism, during the development of the film we are shown a great contrast between the different people who appear in this world, the spectrum between the fortunate and the unfortunate, different secondary characters who speak different languages and belong to a variety of cultures, this only helps pleasantly to give a realistic life to this film.<br/><br/>The script, the story, the structure and the narrative shown in the film are incredible, without seconds wasted and without unnecessary exposure, each part of each scene is designed to convey an idea or a feeling and succeeds completely, a film as realistic as it is magical, that shows a terrifying chemistry between humans, with explosive reactions as well as wonderful reactions.<br/><br/>It is undoubtedly a masterpiece, I consider it one of the best movies in the history of cinema and one of my favorite movies of life. Extremely moving, tense, realistic, fantastic, brutal, reflective, entertaining and unique. An emotional journey presented through images of extreme quality and sublime narration. I really hope that this film will have the respect it deserves, because it is not a simple action movie, it is a work of art designed from head to toe with every detail made to perfection to present a fantastic, realistic and exciting story. A sublime, masterful film. A work that we should all see at least once in our lives."

","Unbelievable what I read about this movie! I don't have one single positive comment to make about it since during the entire movie I only contemplated whether to leave or see it through hoping to see it turn for the better and at least get my money's worth.<br/><br/>What a bore. What a lack of suspense. What an inane script. What a poor plot, it leads nowhere. The story totally fails to unravel, it is poorly acted, especially by Clair Hope Ashity who puts in an abysmal amateur performance and Julianne Moore who is just an add on to attract some viewers but more than clearly fails to impress during her way too brief appearance. The Human Project is mentioned continuously during the movie and comes up as a boat named Tomorrow? Please! Give us a break! <br/><br/>You would think that somewhere in the process of writing, directing, and producing this unmitigated disaster of a film, someone would have paused and said ""eh...guys....what 'TF' are we doing here exactly?"". The characters have absolutely zero depth, the setting is more artificial than a Borg cube, and the storyline....well, I'm still trying to figure out what the storyline WAS, exactly.<br/><br/>Things not explained in this movie include: the title, The Human Project, the infertility, the reason for the treatment of the immigrants, what happened to the rest of the world, why Julianne Moore is offed by the Fishes, what the Fishes actually DO to help immigrants (other than kill every native they encounter???), how the Fishes believe that having the baby will save THEM (not just provide hope for humanity), why the army wouldn't immediately take the mother and child into custody rather than letting them stroll through a gun battle, why they wouldn't have gone worldwide public with the news of a pregnancy or birth to begin with, given the celebrity of the youngest person on earth, and I could go on and on and on. If this is the thought-provoking side of this film everyone is talking about then I think I just wet my pants. That's not thought provoking, it'splain stupidity? <br/><br/>And the lack of logic in the movie is just stupendous.Starting with their ""silent"" escape from the farm, when they were opening and closing car doors and trunks with enormous noise 5 meters from their captors. And ending with the unreasonably hopeful mood of the terrible 'ending', despite the absolute uselessness of having one accidental baby for the restoration of the world. Sweet lord, some of you reviewers are seriously disparate for a hopeful state of mind, aren't you.<br/><br/>This is the third movie I recently saw based on high ratings and claims of superb acting, story, directing and cinematography and have been utterly disappointed with. We all know that there will be film companies out there writing their own rave reviews, but I'm beginning to question if there are not now rave review factories fixing the movie ratings on IMDb. Just as is done with internet search engines. I simply don't believe that a movie can get such great reviews and then turn out to be so blatantly poor."
"TrilbilTheThird","1","292","572","7 January 2007"," Derisory story poorly executed, pretentious rubbish.
","A good day to all.<br/><br/>Children of Men was not a good movie and although the subject matter logically has a mass appeal which has probably lead to the incredible high rating, I'd really wish people would quit voting purely on the entertainment aspect. Needless to say, a movie should score highly on a variety of aspects if it is to be anywhere near the level of a true top-250 film.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed e.g. Spielberg's War of the worlds, again because of the subject matter. But that is not to say that that is a great movie either. Great it truly is not, even though Spielberg did a much better job directing it and the cinematography and the acting can't even be compared to that of Children of Men.<br/><br/>Children of Men has an absurd premise. In stead of depicting a world where human fertility has dropped significantly resulting in chaos, we are to swallow that 'over night' women stopped giving birth period (did the aliens from Worlds finally get it right this time?) and that the only country which can deal with this is Great Britain partially due to the introduction of a nazi-like regime. Why the rest of the world failed to do so is never explained just like everything else which is thought up as the storyline progressed.<br/><br/>The story which is served is equally as absurd as the premise. In a nutshell we are to believe that the birth of a single baby doesn't sound the dawn of a new age but in stead will lead to scientists implementing what 'naturally' happened to this horribly acted Kee on a global scale? This to further the idea that despite the self-destructive nature of humans we are still in control of our fate? Or the proof of the existence of God since it wouldn't be possible for ordinary people to stroll through a warzone with a freshly born child being shot at with endless rounds of amo and survive? Again, this is not explained in the movie, narratives were absent much like any memorable acting, the cameo of Caine aside. <br/><br/>The baby being born into the childless world has no real enemies, only the opposite. Yet it is being hauled through a warzone on a tip by a stoned and aging hippie whose purpose in life is to have his fart-finger pulled, in order to reach a certain group of people who's intentions remain completely vague throughout the entire film? Sigh, how utterly stupid. In 2027 there are only two boats left? One in a warzone and one owned by the 'Human project'? Sounds more like a video game to me, hardly like the story of top-rated movie.<br/><br/>No plot development, no character depth, serious low-budget-feel cinematography and a script without any poignancy. Nothing in this movie that would make it worthy of its high ranking. Totally out of place action-shooter war-scenes and the cheap Hollywood appeal on the senses which initially seemed to be left out, magically appears (alongside the terrorist cell) during the urban shoot-out and henceforth during the so called ending of this movie. The boat being called 'The Tomorrow' came straight out of the Shallowwood textbook and made me bite my teeth till they finally broke off one by one.<br/><br/>The poorly developed chase story which CoM basically is, is just too one-dimensional and frankly just straight out flimsy and it got boring fast. And it is so filled with implausibilities that even the greatest mathematicians of our present world will not be able to count them all. <br/><br/>This movie could have been much much more if its back-story had been fleshed out to some degree and its storyline aspiring to be more than just covering a bunch of people constantly traveling from one dreary set to the next. Preferably with one or two strong and discerning messages (and not a score of them which are never explored and certainly had nothing to do with the actual storyline, making it the pretentious twaddle it truly became) and performed by actors worthy of playing next to Caine.<br/><br/>An unarguably over-hyped piece of pretentious rubbish. Simply a vehicle for art-director Lubezki to play around with his camera and editing-room and for Cuaron to bludgeon the audience with disjointed references to contemporary issues with no tale to tell. A typical product of the headline-society we've become with on par appreciation."

","I finished the year is despair, because though I've seen many good films this year, I've seen very few actually released in 2006. What a surprise to discover some late in the game.<br/><br/>This is one, and it really surprised me. That's because though I generally regard Hispanic filmmakers as the vanguard, he hasn't really impressed  not as a major talent. My how he impresses now. This isn't just an effective film, its effective in ways that show he really understands some of the theoretical mechanics.<br/><br/>Here's what I mean. I was greatly impressed by the opening scene of ""Casino Royale."" But if you look at it closely, you'll see that someone could have produced it by mere extrapolation. All they have to do is look at examples of things that are exciting in current movies and do the same, except a little more intensively.<br/><br/>But what Cuaron has done is go back to first principles. He knows how Welles redefined space. He knows how Tarkovsky created a whole new sort of eye by making the camera drift. He knows how Kirosawa invented the notion of layered planes. He's synthesized these in a new way, it seems to me. It isn't radical enough to not be readily digestible to a modern film-goer. But it also isn't much like what we had before, which I may typify with Ridly Scott's ""Blackhawk Down."" There's a scene toward the end which I imagine was where he started to imagine this project. Our escaping couple are detailed on the street by those who have been chasing them. This group is ambiguously evil, perhaps even the good guys. They prepare to kill Owen's character and perhaps do. From that point until near the end that seems to be one continuous shot. It isn't, but it seems to be, ""Rope"" -like.<br/><br/>He runs down the street and around a corner, being shot at. He runs into a bus and out. Then across the street in the middle of heavy combat where a building is under attack. All this is hand-held using a partially-stabilized camera, halfway between a documentarian's camera (at this point blood is spattered on the lens), and the other way toward stylized distance that surveys the planes of the spaces while they are animated with bullet hits.<br/><br/>We then follow him into the building, up several flights and down hallways to retrieve his ""family,"" then on out again. At this point he becomes ""seen"" by those around him. Before, he was more like us, there but disembodied, in a die hard sense. Now he becomes part of the texture and we later discover, wounded.<br/><br/>So on down and out of the building to be adored, as Joseph the partner of the Maddona and then a tank explodes and we are back into the space, leading to a tunnel, an expanse of water, and then something else.<br/><br/>Its so wonderfully choreographed, the camera, the narrator's stance, the dancing walls, the object that appear and vaporize, the shifting types of engagement among us, characters and place...<br/><br/>We know we are being set up. This is no Terry Gilliam who basically intuits. Before this scene we see all the bits from the other masters presented separately. The Tarkovsky bits were perhaps less meditative that I would have liked. One was a visit to an abandoned school where we see our mother outside through a hole in the window, and encounters happen that ""break emotional walls."" The other is the presence of a profoundly senile old woman, and how she is included.<br/><br/>You walk through other basic film vocabularies elsewhere until they all combine in this last sequence. A Kurosawa episode on a bus when the midwife is taken to meet her fate.<br/><br/>Quite apart from the visual vocabulary, he's done well with complementary notions of story. Its science fiction but without tedious explanations. The world just is. There's brutality as in the future of ""Vendetta,"" but one can see it isn't religious wars or jingoism that fuels it, but a far deeper existential concern. Julianne's character is the grand motivator, though wonderfully (in terms of story mechanics) she disappears early, effectively launching the real story: our hero is a storymaker.<br/><br/>Noir. Regular readers know I define noir a bit different than ordinarily. It has to do with ordinary folks thrust into extraordinary situations as if the existence of the viewer motivates a capricious fate that weaves and frames a story for our eye. What we have here is ambiguous noir, and the first real action noir. Quite an achievement. Quite an experience.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","It has taken me 13 years to get round to watching Children of Men and I have to say, it's an absolute masterclass in film making - the execution is astonishing (cinematography, sound design/soundtrack, set design, etc) and it's arguably quite scary in the way it paints a somewhat feasible vision of our future.<br/><br/>The acting and characters in this film are very grounded which reels you in and makes me feel invested. The social and political commentary of this film is still very relevant and quite powerful. It's not an easy watch at times, it's quite shocking but it's a very effective piece of film even if you didn't see it when it released."

","There's a remarkable long Steadicam shot in which the camera follows the hero, Clive Owen, through a raging battle -- buildings being blown up, bullets pinging around him -- and into a doorway and up a flight of stairs and through room after room until he finds what he's searching for -- the first woman to become pregnant in eighteen years. <br/><br/>Owen, and some supporters who come and go, are trying to get this pregnant African stranger to an offshore haven where, biology permitting, the human race will begin to reproduce itself again. I was unable to figure out how one baby will save the species.<br/><br/>Neither is the reason for the pandemic infertility ever explained but it doesn't really matter much. It's basically a chase movie. Owen and his charge don't have many friends. It's a Hobbesian war of all against all. London is a wreck. The ruins are filled with refugees from other countries, each eagerly killing one another, shouting slogans, waving their AK-47s over their heads. The air is filled with gun fire. A pox on all their houses; a midline granuloma!<br/><br/>As a chase movie it's pretty good, carrying a powerful emotional message. The gravid woman, who is quite ordinary, is a Life Force, kind of like Zorba the Greek. I guess that's intended to be good, and it is if you ignore certain inconvenient facts. (The tubercle bacillus has a Life Force too.) It's also easy to read a religious lesson in it. None of that's necessary though. It's tense and tautly constructed, even if it doesn't make much sense. The refugees have no one they can trust and few are anxious to help them. The best seem to lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.<br/><br/>I am, though, getting tired of this photographic conceit in which the sun never shines, everyone is grimy and greasy, it's either drizzling or looks about to, every object has an unhappy greenish tinge, and all the men need a shave. Enough already. I also have to wag my finger because there are plenty of dogs in the movie but no cats. My cat, Ajax the Lesser, pointed this out to me. Outside of a dog, a cat is a man's best friend. Inside a dog, it's too dark to see.<br/><br/>There is also a kind of paradox built into the movie. The only hope for mankind is a return to fertility. Yet what we see of mankind doesn't reflect well upon it. With all social niceties being eliminated, there seems to be nothing left of government but a horde of uniformed murderous fascists. Judge Learned Hand said, ""A society in which men recognize no check on their freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage few."" In this world, everyone appears intent on killing everyone else in order to be among the savage few. <br/><br/>The writers should have challenged some of their own assumptions. Look at what Homo sapiens has accomplished -- in 2027 and now. Do we really want to start it all over again? Is the Earth better off for our presence on it?"
"Vozzywuzzy","1","205","397","27 June 2007"," Waiting for a story which is just not there
","Watching Children of Men was a really odd experience. Expecting at least something above average, all I got was something almost amateuristic.<br/><br/>I don't know, but I like my movies with something of a story or plot to it. Especially when a premise as in Children of Men provides an abundance of opportunity to do just that. What they did with it, came off slightly B-movie-ish and so did much of the cinematography with that nauseating homevideo-style cameramatics and bits of the acting as well. Why this movie is adored by so many people I cannot begin to fathom. Was the polling rigged in some way?<br/><br/>The movie is basically a chase-flick in which a woman and her baby are escorted to a safe-haven while everyone helping her get offed during the travel. The whole premise of a barren world was completely wasted when the movie sloppily turns into this chase-vehicle, leaving its original dystopian backstory being merely an afterthought. The way they tried to pull it back in during the chase-sequences (e.g. the abandoned classroom scene) was clumsily forced, as were all the 'references' to: the immigration issue, Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, The Bush Empire and what have you more. If you have something to say about these issues then say it, a movie is a great format for that. But surely they deserve much more than just a lazy nod in their general direction in some underdeveloped chase-movie. <br/><br/>What I truly don't understand is why they didn't make the characters more likable. After all, we as onlookers are following their plight and should be concerned with it. When I watched this movie I had no sympathy or empathy for any of the characters or their predicament. This simply because they were either not very well portrayed (The sketchy part of Jullianne Moore), unlikable (Theo, Kee, the 'Fish') or Simpsons-like cartoon-figures (Sid, Jasper, that gypsy woman).<br/><br/>I am a sucker for chase movies and that was the only reason I sat through the entirety of this mess. But even the chase plot didn't work for me at all. So many improbabilities* in the shovel-fed storyline and the pacing was just so off, rendering it ultra boring. A patronizing script making sure that every imbecile and his five brain cells got what was going on and the jarring soundtrack suitably missed the mark completely while multi-featuring the worst Stones-cover to date. Which was rather annoying.<br/><br/>*I mean if Tom Hanks can build a raft from FedEx wrapping paper, I'm sure they could have built something seaworthy from the abundant piles of trash scattered throughout the sets.. did they really have to go to that refugee camp being exposed to all that violence with a baby? I thought they were trying to save it, not getting it killed...<br/><br/>A complete mishap as far as I'm concerned with a most embarrassing 'ending' when almost out of nothing ""Children of men"" is blazon upon the screen in bold print.

"jeniallenby","9","49","86","4 November 2006"," Animals in Children of Men
","All the important points about this film have been well covered by other reviewers, so I would like instead to draw your attention to a smaller sub text that is well worth keeping an eye on within the film's wider themes: <br/><br/>Animals are utilized in incredibly effective ways in this film, from the horror of watching piles of burning cattle carcasses in the countryside (drawing our attention to environmental / food disasters) to Theo's surreal encounter with a startled deer within a long abandoned school (reminding us we now exist in a world where the teaching of the next generation is no longer an issue). And of course domestic animals such as cats and dogs are shown everywhere, their presence as pets providing comfort for the children missing from everyone's lives.<br/><br/>Watching animals respond to Theo is something else again. I am sure I missed many of these small interactions because they often occurred during important scenes when my attention was focused on wider issues. But do watch for how pets react to him and follow him, often wanting to get as close to him as possible - for example, he invariably has a cat asleep behind him on the couch at Jasper's, and watch for the tiny kitten with sharp claws that determinedly climbs his trouser leg during a political meeting.<br/><br/>These interactions are never elaborated upon, nor can I recall if they featured in the original P D James' book. They can easily be missed as one gets caught up in the drama of the story. But I found they provided an excellent devise for moments of unexpected humour as well as insight into Theo's character, and most importantly revealed yet another example of the director's extraordinary attention to detail in this very impressive, and very moving, film."
"evycomelately","1","143","274","4 January 2008"," Betrayal of Men
","This film seems to have received incredible high praise and is currently listed in the Top250 of this website. I hate to fly in the face of such adoration, but this film left me completely indifferent and rather irritated if not highly annoyed. Sure, there are a few nice setpieces, but it's all set against a hack-handed background rendering them only a mild distraction from the otherwise continuous amazement at the film's triteness and mindboggling illogical plotpoints. The film is poorly structured and almost entirely if not completely un-engaging with the most lame and sappy ending I have ever seen to a film. <br/><br/>This film is supposed to be full of big ideas on Britain's dystopian future and the reactions of the public to an infertility plagued society. Angry youth throwing rocks at trains, the rails to Auschwitz have been reopened and are deporting the fugees (not the band) back to where they came from (hell) and even the spectrum of light is somehow compromised*. With this kind of background, you'd expect the movie to actually focus on any of it, something which this movie is acclaimed for. But apart from the main characters being in a bad mood for 90 brief minutes, there is surprisingly little this movie reflects on. The exposition on these theme's was simply replaced by endless shots of people being deported Nazi-style, the English countryside and mind-numbing dialog that was doing little else than driving the weary plot onward. The whole infertility and the world-gone-to-hell themes could just as well have been left out entirely and it wouldn't have made any difference to the actual storyline of two people on the run. <br/><br/>*Truly Amazing that someone would spent enormous amounts of money on expensive filming equipment only to make the actual picture look like it was shot by my Uncle Fred (who has Parkinson's) who just got his Handicam yesterday for Christmas and is still working his way through the manual which is written in Chinese and which apparently only describes how to deprive the picture of colour.<br/><br/>In Children of men subtlety was not allowed. Everything is as bad as bad comes and even good is apparently bad. The sets look over the top sleazy, our main characters are anything but likable, a pasture of grazing cows has been replaced by a smouldering pile of meat and bones, the rebels simply kill their leader over a dispute or kill policemen when they turn up at the wrong place at the wrong time. The overemphasized way of portraying such a dull and drab doomsday landscape as was done in Children of Men, surely would bother anyone who is not into cartoonistic film-making but in stead likes some subtlety on any subject matter if indeed this is presented in a serious movie. Maybe I misunderstood, but I believed that's what this movie was. <br/><br/>Meanwhile in the film, the script is pretty awful. Caine certainly tries his utmost with it, but his lines are one-note and much too viewer-informative only to result in a feeling of 'we get it already, move on please.."". Owen is his usual wooden self and thus type-casted perfectly in the role of Theo Faron, a morose lower government official who couldn't give a fart about anything. Although I really liked his performance, his character is screenplayed terribly and I couldn't give an equal fart about his fate in the movie. Next up a utterly forgettable cameo by Julianne Moore, some B-actors to play the bad guys lead by Chiwetel Ejiofor who since his performance in Serenity for me lost all credibility as an actor. And newcomer Claire Hope Ashity as the Black Virgin Mary who does little more than swear a lot, which by modern standards, is apparently good enough for a 'solid performance' in the books of the critics. Frankly, her performance wouldn't even cut it on Eastenders.<br/><br/>The story in Children of Men is practically non-existent and covered not much more than an action packed chase from the old peril to the land of deliverance. But this was done on purpose to not loose focus on the sublime messages it miserably failed to communicate because they forgot to include them. As a result many of the scenes drag relentlessly while jarring opera music and a hate-crime of a muzak cover-version of 'Ruby Tuesday' plundered that what was left of the viewer's will to live. Indeed, it's really all that bleak and pointless. But intentionally so! The end result of all this is an aesthetic crime against the art-loving moviegoer or the one with more than 2 brain cells to rub together.<br/><br/>The end result is also one that is critically acclaimed by nothing less than the entire society of professional movie critics minus one or two who probably didn't receive the letter which stated they would get a nice percentage of the movie's revenues when their review would be kind. Seriously, you'd think all these glowing reviews and those on this website, were written by people who had somehow managed to miss the entirety of Western cinema.<br/><br/>The gourmet-fare that is Children of men is actually a night out at the McDonald's of film-making where the second bite of your food is already spoiling the experience of the first. Let us all gather in prayer and hope that there won't be a sequel. Unless the sequel was already made when they created 'Shoot Em Up'. Another highly creative movie in which mr. Owen is once again protecting a baby that people are trying to kill.<br/><br/>Evy"

All I saw was a simple chase movie that was obviously done differently compared to what we are usually dished by the likes of Hollywood but also one that not for second convinced me. Worse yet, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this fake and contrived. <br/><br/>Apart from the fact that no reasonable explanation is given for the whole ordeal of getting the child through the violence to a ghostlike organization other than that it provided some sort of subterfuge for shooting the battle-scenes, no credible reasons are ever given for Anything that happened on the screen. The same goes for the motivations of most of the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>Sure, most mainstream productions hit us over the head with exposition making such productions not very challenging to watch, but to simply reverse it and unaffectedly explain nothing is just the opposite side of the coin and equally insipid even if it was shot from a first person perspective.

If you gave Children of Men 8 or 9 stars, what do you give to the really great movies?<br/><br/>Things not explained in this movie include: the title, The Human Project, the infertility, the reason for the treatment of the immigrants, what happened to the rest of the world, why Julianne Moore is offed by the Fishes, what the Fishes actually DO to help immigrants (other than kill every native they encounter???), how the Fishes believe that having the baby will save THEM (not just provide hope for humanity), why the army wouldn't immediately take the mother and child into custody rather than letting them stroll through a gun battle, why they wouldn't have gone worldwide public with the news of a pregnancy or birth to begin with given the celebrity of the last youngest person on earth, and I could go on. Michael Caine is a complete sidebar with no real purpose to the story line with holes that you can already drive a tractor trailer through. <br/><br/>Things explained in this movie: One fertile woman (and presumably, at least one fertile man) left on earth.<br/><br/>I want my two hours and my $8.50 back."

","I highly recommend that you watch the movie before reading the book. The movie is almost nothing like the book, they only share a title, character names, and the most general tag-line of a plot ""In the near future, people are no longer able to have children..."". If you read the book first the problems with the movie make it hard to enjoy.<br/><br/>Acting:<br/><br/>Clive is pretty good, I am assuming he was doing exactly what the director wanted (which is nothing like the character Theo).<br/><br/>Julianne Moore's 'Julian' is a very shallow character (as directed I assume), would have been a much better performance if she had been given the role of Julian in the book.<br/><br/>Michael Caine plays a caricature of a ridiculous hippie (again, as directed), he does it well. It has absolutely nothing to do with Jasper.<br/><br/>Cinematography - reminded me of 28 Days Later, not better, not worse, just similar, color and angle are the main things they share.<br/><br/>Writing - This is pure writing by committee, there are 5 writers (other than the author of the book this movie is supposedly based on). I would be inclined to guess that none of them actually read Children of Men, and what they came up with is basically framed in our current political climate and will not endure as an important work. <br/><br/>Directing - Well, he has a writing credit and should be blamed along with them for this travesty. I am sure he is a fine director, but let someone familiar with the subject matter assist with the storytelling. <br/><br/>**Major spoilers for the book follow, but hell, who out here actually reads books?** <br/><br/>(they have nothing at all to do with the movie I just watched) <br/><br/>Theo is supposed to be the anti-hero, the elitist self-serving Oxford history prof, who doesn't want the inconvenience of having old friends (Jasper and veggie wife, Jasper is another history prof, not a hippie) move into his 5-story apartment in the city, he is not the drunk/trustworthy guy. He is not poor. He is not a drunk. He is a smart-ass, who is always talking down to people.<br/><br/>Theo's cousin is the 'Warden of England' and rules very harshly with the council. Julian's group approach Theo to bring a list of complaints to the Warden.<br/><br/>After he takes the complaints to the Warden he goes on a very long vacation, after he returns the mid-wife shows up and tells him that Julian needs him.<br/><br/>Julian is not Theo's wife, and Julian is the one that ends up pregnant, and white, and the baby is male. The mid-wife is black, and there is no weird religious aspect to her, in fact she like many others in the book are agnostic, if not full blown atheists.<br/><br/>The 'fishes' main complaint is the 'suicides' that are called Quietus, where old people are drowned at sea, some forcibly (one that Theo witnesses which is why he decides to help the group). Other complaints are the treatment of criminals on the Isle of Man (lawless prison colony, think - 'Escape from New York'), forced (futile) reproductive testing on men and women, the treatment of foreign workers (nothing like the movie), and the state sponsored porn shops.<br/><br/>The main mention of religious extremists, are of the white variety, think televangelists, there is no parade of Muslims with ak-47s in the book.<br/><br/>When Theo was a young husband and father, he backed over his baby by accident, he wasn't wild about the baby and his wife knew it (which is why they got divorced). His wife is not a terrorist, she lives in a nice house in a nice neighborhood with her new young husband and their cats.<br/><br/>Julian, who Theo does end up loving, is deformed (physically), the priest/father (not her husband) is epileptic. That is why their fertility was unknown, they were exempt from testing.<br/><br/>The last generation of children are called 'Omegas', some of them rove about the countryside in gangs and kill people, but they only want to kill one person from a group, they also like to torch cars.<br/><br/>They never pretend to be illegal immigrants, they are never in custody, Theo is never in the vicinity when a bomb goes off. The 'fish' only blow up docks where the 'suicides' would be taking place.<br/><br/>Jasper kills his wife and commits suicide. He commits suicide by shooting himself in the head, and Theo takes the gun (only one bullet).<br/><br/>Julian, Theo, and the Midwife never get to the water, they turn back when Julian's husband abandons them and goes to turn them in to the Warden.<br/><br/>Julian with the help of the mid-wife gives birth to the baby in a woodshed (which is secluded). Theo, Julian and the baby are the only main characters that live, and they all live, and Theo becomes the 'Warden of England' after shooting the Warden with his one bullet."

","How utterly bizarre to see a movie like this getting so much credits. I tried to understand it from the reviewers point of view here on this site and found nothing comprehensible.<br/><br/>Realistic plot. Where? If it's likely that women will stop giving birth all of a sudden, then we can toss aside everything we know about biological science. 'The convincing future world' which results from the premise as being a totally chaotic world, almost reads as wishful thinking on the part of the reviewer. 18 years go by with no women getting pregnant and without any known cause, one suddenly gets pregnant? And this obvious fluke is supposed to be interesting enough to carry a whole movie and provide a feeling of hope in such a desperate world? And besides, surely any type of future world with this kind of scenario going on, has got some more interesting to tell than what is shown in this movie. And surely Great Britain wouldn't be the only country to be able to sustain that premise. Rubbish, fairytalestuff, unmitigated Hollywood bull-crap.<br/><br/>Excellent acting. Where? Owen certainly didn't impress, hes just doing his zombie-thing once again. The support cast and especially Ashity (Kee) made me laugh and being annoyed at the same time throughout the entire film. This movie certainly did not impress acting-wise, surely for everyone to see. Caine's cameo was the odd one out and made me feel like watching a completely different movie every time he's making an appearance.<br/><br/>Good story/complex story. Excuse me? It's just a plodding chase-story with zero depth, nothing realistic and about as complex as the basis of your average video game. One doesn't bring a child to a war-zone just because some drugged out old fart suggests that, especially when it's presumably the only one alive in the world. What made the story 'complex' was that nothing was explained about any of it (writers cramp?). Yet, this is considered one of the film's best traits! <br/><br/>Great cinematography. The natural look of the film, the documentary style if u will, was ultimately not what made the feel of this movie a positive or convincing one. It made me feel distracted from the events that were displayed and made me be aware of camera's and actors. They should have used that in portions of the film, but not in the whole of it. All the chase sequences seemed overpractised and what was up with the 'run after the car and get smashed by the door'-gimmick?<br/><br/>Comment on the world we live in today. Well, this movie didn't point out anything that can't be seen in any Newsprogram or documentary on the subject. Most of the theme's we saw, like the Islam-protest, seemed hopelessly and needlessly dragged in. <br/><br/>Dramatic ending. Yeah sure, if you consider vapid and cliché open endings which didn't give the film some sort of closure it desperately needed a dramatic ending, then by all means people...<br/><br/>The movie seems to want us to see a possible world future, and that's all fine. But why would I want to look at that grim and dismal future for two hours following a story-line with absolutely zero plot, no humor, no sfx, no build up of tension nor a decent soundtrack.<br/><br/>3/10"
"richard-1967","5","43","75","8 January 2008"," What's all the fuss about?
","I have to say I was shocked to find how mediocre I thought this film was. I mean people who I trust about movies loved it -- the people who raved about Million Dollar Baby, or Eastern Promises, or Amores Perros.<br/><br/>But this one I just don't get. Trite plot, obvious twists, trite AND obvious ending, superficial characters, and even Clive Owen wasn't as good as his usual terrific, intense performance. Compared to Inside Man, the role, the character, and the actor were nothing much at all.<br/><br/>Was it awful? No. I remained mildly interested though increasingly disappointed. But a great movie? Not a chance.<br/><br/>It's interesting that a comment has to run to ten lines when there's not much more to say here. But here goes: A good cast (Julianne Moore, Chewy Ejiofer, the wonderful Michael Caine) was wasted playing characters that were more caricatures: the faithful radical, the bad radical, the aging hippie. With the exception of Caine, they (incluidng Owen) sleepwalked through their parts -- and these are actors I love to watch. <br/><br/>That's ten lines, and enough said about this flic."
"cloakthedagger","1","89","166","14 December 2007"," A poor man's dystopia action/thriller
","It's 2027 in Children of Men. Through advertisements, commercials and newscaster innuendo we learn that civilization has broken down on a global level. Only England somehow manages to 'battle on' and is suffering from large streams of illegal immigrants because of this. They the government, deal with it harshly; killing or deporting them as soon as they are rounded up and put in cages. We also learn that the entire world has become infertile; no children have been born in eighteen years. No one seems to know why and the hinted causality of growing pollution, global warming, and food manipulation as a reason for the infertility makes little to no sense. <br/><br/>It is here where the logic in the film is starting to buckle, which is shortly after the opening credits. For the human race to fully stop being fertile all of a sudden, something more catastrophic and acute is needed. Also it would not explain why animals would be able to procreate amidst this eco disaster or why the term 'cloning' somehow seems to have vaporised from the dictionary. Obviously the existence of something acute did not fit writer/director Cuaron's agenda because it would ultimately lose the film's connection with the present world. Of course, if Cuaron had stayed true to the book, the problem would not have been so obvious. Too bad he (admittedly) never even read it.<br/><br/>All this hardly matters because Children of Men comes off the shelf of the so-called thought-provoking movies. Which in this case means that its OK to INvoke some thought, but surely not to get too carried away with it. Judging by the way the script is handled, presenting the scarce plotpoints through ham-fisted explanatory dialog, I don't think this movie was meant to be thought provoking at all. At best it's a silly reminder of things we learn in school at age 10 and up or see in the news every time we turn the telly on.<br/><br/>The film itself plays out like a big formulaic chase in which our protagonists, mainly Theo (Clive Owen) and a black pregnant woman, 'mysteriously' named Kee (Claire Hope Ashity), are chased down by a terrorist group named The Fishes who want the soon to be born child for themselves in order tocuddle it? Their motivations remain a complete mystery. The quest leads Kee and Theo through England's countryside, which is kind of a plod, also for the viewer. Fortunately we can listen to a jarring and bloated soundtrack that accompanies the bleak and unappealing shaky visuals the viewer is presented. The plot of the movie seems to revolve around getting Kee and her later to be born baby to another group called the Human Project that is not sure to even exist. But if they do exist, we can be sure that the human race, thanks to one little squealing baby human, will be saved.or something.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a clumsy experiment gone terribly wrong. Director Alfonso Cuaron is know to despise too much exposition in films and if he is referring to the 'Hollywood way' of telling stories, I would somewhat agree with him. But Cuaron fails to properly compensate for the lack of exposition in the way the story is unfolding and scenes are constructed. He compensates by making the dialog throughout the entire movie so unnaturally explanatory that it is far too obvious that he is just informing the viewer. Being taken by the hand through every reason and meaning of the plotpoints like a little kid is pretty infuriating. And this doesn't just hamper the acting by otherwise capable actors, it also ruins any character development in the movie which in turn is not compensated for. Furthermore the movie is pompous and monotonous with its one-sided political overtone. It is all the same evasive when it comes to answering, or even questioning the issues it nonetheless throws up. The symbolism and churlish nods to contemporary issues is far too conspicuous and highly annoying as such (The one captured immigrant they allow to be heared, speaks German!, yeah, let's deport a former Nazi...seriously people, who writes this stuff?) And the logic of the plot that a single baby/person will be able to save the world in a movie that is supposed to have a serious message, is, to put it kindly, ludicrous, puerile and as original as a beer commercial.<br/><br/>Although there is some fancy camera-work and editing in especially the last segment of the movie (a Kubrick homage?), I would not go as far as recommending this movie for just that bit alone as others have suggested. I think it is tragic that the talents of an artdirector like Lubezki were wasted on a bleak, rather predictable and messy film with zero likable characters, a questionable script and a too obvious political viewpoint which is shoved up the arse of the viewer over and over again. The film leaves out so much backstory and tries to compensate for this with so many minuscule silly details that even a second or third watch will not help to really put all the pieces together because too many important and interesting ones were simply left in the box.<br/><br/>Although the attempt is somewhat admirable and despite the absurd high rating, not recommended at all.<br/><br/>3/10"
"Oskado","1","78","144","10 January 2007"," A Stinker  Amateur, imbecilic. The Villains are the 5-Star Reviewers
","I've checked my voting record, and if I compare this wretch to the worst I've ever commented on (Auberge Espagnole and Capitaes d'Abril) those two stand out like cinematic giants. Actually, as I left the theater and hunted in my mind for another film as inept and devoid of dramatic sense and intelligence as this one, I could only think of Toxic Avenger, yet that film was shot with amateurs and a budget not more than 1000th of that wasted on Children of Man. And even Toxic Avenger adheres in its rough way to notions of Introduction (of some challenge, etc.), Development, Rising Action, etc., through to the Moment of Last Tension and Climax. Now imagine a film that begins with the Moment of Last Tension and carries that fever pitch through an hour and a half of senseless frenzy (like an insane contribution to the Theater of the Absurd) till it simply ends  with no true Climax, since there was never any dramatic plot development. In effect, this thing resembles a visual walkthrough for some shoot-anyone-who-moves video game.<br/><br/>The most sensible use of this material would thus have been to trash two-thirds and slice the remaining one-third into cut-scenes for another mindless action video game. The real challenge would be to create some vaguely coherent storyline to explain in the game booklet  something the makers of this film don't seem to have worried about. While the pathetic director and his compadres might object that Grand Theft Auto, for instance, hasn't much of a plot either, that would be somewhat misguided, in my estimation, as the player of an equally senseless video game is at least personally engaged as a protagonist, hence emotionally involved, however utterly stupid the environment or weak the plot.<br/><br/>Since some viewers or (I presume) paid reviewers have lionized this ""film"", please note the following:<br/><br/>1. Though the human race sees itself doomed because of the sudden infertility of its women (now that requires a simplistic mind), at no point can the script allow the word CLONE to be mentioned. We're a long way from Jurassic Park here - unable to even clone one of our own species in year 2027 or so.<br/><br/>2. Serious reviewers refer to the ""fascist"" state the protagonists are fleeing. What isn't mentioned is that our heroic dummies have transit papers and can legally exit - that is, till a group of violent illegals attacks them near the border and later their driver kills two traffic cops in cold blood. Yes, murderers on the run can understandably view policemen and straight citizens as fascists. But the reviewers? (Well, if they haven't thought of the ""clone"" word, who knows what's going on in their minds).<br/><br/>3. The film never shows us the Human Project, the land of deliverance our heroes are risking their lives to reach. Thus we have no clear vision of what they're striving for, nor understand why it exists. Shakespeare's The Tempest (et alia) need not depict the trials of London life to its spectators - they know it all too well. The play instead depicts the island - the land sheltered from all that. In this film, we're shown a world we all see clearly enough developing around us - and then superimposes onto is a non-sensical script.<br/><br/>4. The ""fascist"" soldiers engaged in a firefight with insurrectionists halt their fire to allow free passage to our heroine ""Kee"" and her baby - so stunned are they at the birth and so determined that nothing harm her or the child. Given that fact, what was the point to all the senseless action? And how great were the anti-fascists (I suppose) who only think of themselves and would have killed Kee at their first opportunity?<br/><br/>5. Some reviewers have seen ""Mexico versus U.S."" as some hidden motif to this junk film. I fail to see that. For instance, some of the illegals are Slavic. Apparently, Poland, Slovenia, etc., have been overwhelmed by in-migrations from the east, Turkestan, etc., causing their indigenous Slavic populations to flee their homelands. Yes, there is an implied similarity, in that unbridled inflow can result in the formation of non-integrated ghettos, and by extension, whole countries can become transformed into Bosnias. But, in this apocalyptic picture, presumably Mexico, too, is overwhelmed - though they have had tighter control over in-migration than has the US (thus slower economic growth - being just what they want)- to protect the rights of the criollos, who irrationally enough want nothing more than to leave their country but keep foreigners out. Just read Semarnat's (the Mexican Ministry of the Interior and Natural Resources) agendas and notes, posted on the Internet - for instance, documenting that the Zapotecs and Miztecs have been at war over ""their"" natural resources now for 500 years (per Semarnat), now using machine guns instead of spears, and are unlikely to ever change, unless they move out of the country. Obviously, neither group would be welcomed in by the millions of Mayans in the south, nor by the Masahuelas more to the north, etc., while the ""Spanish"" leaders of the country would love to be rid of them. In other words, Mexico already faces this demographic Beelzebub at its day-to-day domestic level. <br/><br/>Obviously, there is a superabundance of potential material for developing a more coherent apocalyptic view of the future - just read the newspapers.<br/><br/>I would score this film a minus-8, but I believe 1 is the lowest IMDb permits, sadly. And, BTW, if reviewers had simply told me in advance that this is an empty-headed action thriller, and rated it two stars out of five, I might have accepted it as a silly time-killer for a rainy day. In the end, the reviewer hype is the greatest villain - both to me and to a director who needs clearer guidance if his work's ever to improve."
"olihine","2","82","152","1 October 2006"," Awful
","An utterly abysmal, uninspired effort, as aimless as it is pointless.<br/><br/>Set in London in the year 2027, 'Children Of Men' gives us a glimpse of a harrowing, dust-choked, infertile dystopia, where hatred and suspicion has caged immigrants and no child has been born for eighteen years. Pertinent, relevant points, all, and the writers would have done well to dwell on them, but they are never allowed to become more than background noise. Instead, we are forced to tread wearily along with the journey of our main characters, Theo (Clive Owen), Julian (Julianne Moore) as they attempt to extract a young, pregnant black girl to safety. The trouble is, within twenty minutes, I had stopped caring about their plight.<br/><br/>None of the characters inspires much sympathy. The young girl whom we are forced to look on as the last hope of mankind is an unpleasant individual whose every sentence is spattered with profanities in the mistaken belief that this appears gritty and shocking. Clive Owen is his usual wooden self, silent and morose most of the film apart from the moments he tries to inject some bizarre humour into an otherwise bleak film with insipid one-liners. Julianne Moore may have done better had she been given the chance  she is able to wear the required look of disillusionment and inner pain with the best of them - but is dispensed with within the first thirty minutes.<br/><br/>Michael Caine does add some poignancy as an ageing hippie whose wife was tortured into catatonia by MI5 and who has since withdrawn into a woodland retreat where he spends the day getting stoned and farting when someone pulls his finger.<br/><br/>The film drifts slowly into absurdity: a giant inflatable pig soars regally past the window at Bucks House as Theo discusses how to obtain false papers, but my favourite line was shortly after the baby girl, sole hope for mankind, is safely delivered in a dank and grotty hotel room, leaving Kee, bloody and exhausted, looking up at Theo. ""Aren't you gonna cut the cord"" she asks, ""There's no rush!"" he replies.<br/><br/>This is a shame, as there are some parts to this film that I liked, or rather, some parts that I could have liked had I got to know them better. But instead one becomes almost indignant that the writers have chosen to fixate so totally on a weak and ineffectual plot line rather than tackling the wider issues the film nonetheless throws up. I would quite like to know how the world got so messed up so quickly. I think there are lessons to be learned there. After all, the nightmare world that is London 2027 is not so different from our own world that it is unrecognisable, or inconceivable. Xenophobia, internment, climate change, growing infertility, the encroachment of the state into our everyday lives, these are profound and pertinent points, and they deserve more attention than this frivolous and sloppy effort grants them."

Although I'm a big fan of Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and especially Michel Caine it didn't deliver in any part. <br/><br/>The good thing about the film is that at least its below two hours runtime, which now seems to be the ""least standard time"", given to any movie no matter if it has a story to match the runtime. <br/><br/>As Public Enemy stated: ""Don't believe the hype""."

","I'm confused. Very much so even...<br/><br/>I just saw Children of Men. A movie which currently holds a stunning nr 147# position on IMDb and is critically acclaimed. A movie with also little to no plot (and what it had was dumbfoundingly illogical and übersimplistic), wasted performances by otherwise fine to even great actors and a political or social slant so inane, so completely sophomoric that it's hard to believe this movie was made as a serious attempt at social commentary. Alas, the extra's on the DVD leave no room for ambiguity. No spoof here, this was meant to be serious...<br/><br/>So we have one fertile/pregnant woman amidst 3 billion who are not. We have an organisation presented to us in a lame stork-joke, which ocupies itself with getting the human race fertile again. That is, if this organisation even exists. They set out to find a raft to paddle to that phantom organisation which is said to bob somewhere around the coast of England. Why they chose to not just buy a raft but get one in one of the most violent parts of the country where bullets fly freely, tanks shoot at anything that moves and walking cameramen are trying to set records for the longest single-take ever made, all this with presumably the only infant alive in the world, is never even remotely tried to be explained. <br/><br/>I really don't mind that pompous, vacuous films are being made under the pretext of being subtle, deep and insightful. What gets a rise out of me is that people can't see a really terribly made movie for what it is, but in stead sing praise, forgive the exuberant defects they are willing to admit this movie has and vote it a ten anyway, without breaking a sweat. Like the headline-reading buffoons or game-console addicts they are.<br/><br/>Shame, especially to the professional moviecritics who along their careers surely must have seen movies like The Usual Suspects for plot and suspense, Full Metal Jacket for steadycam cinematography, It happened One Night for social commentary and God knows how many other quality films that have been produced over the years.<br/><br/>No, these movies were in fact never made. Apparently the line was drawn at October 2006, conveniently forgetting that a particular scene should display some profundity if you accompany it by long and abstruse orchestral manouvres. Forgetting that movies used to have some form of plot other than something any writer for Sesame Street could come up with using nothing but a broken pen and a paper napkin. And Forgetting that overexposing, completely plotdriven and patronizing scripts don't usually help the actors to do their jobs convincingly nor challenge a moviegoer in any way.<br/><br/>But..you've already seen this caper."

It's as if this movie and story was built around the three main action scenes and the storyline was just given a good once over.<br/><br/>It's quite strange that many professional critics found this movie to be worthy, at all. Some of the effects were really nice in this movie. The birth giving scene was done really well and I was impressed in how much effort they put into it. The shootout scenes were somewhat realistic in my opinion. But unfortunately, that doesn't make a movie for me. The story itself is the most important.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is one of my favorite British actors. He really didn't do too bad in this movie. But what was the deal with the middle aged white lady with dreadlocks? Was that really needed? I guess it was an attempt to look more futuristic but really, come on. I kept picturing the Queen of England with dreadlocks and wearing a wrinkled t-shirt.<br/><br/>I'd recommend checking it out when it comes to DVD simply for the action scenes and special effects but I'm still kicking myself and feel hoodwinked by the good reviews.

","Children of Men starts off looking like it'll be a rarity, a good Clive Owen film. It's not that he's suddenly learned to act, just that he's cast as a lifeless drone and that's about within his range. The premise is a bit been there, done that, with another future Britain that's sunk into the twin evils of repressive right wing xenophobia and terrorism, with infertility added into the mix as the raison d'etre. The lack of originality doesn't matter so much since like all ""serious"" sci-fi it's meant to be a mirror into our own times. What does matter is that the film becomes so predictable around the halfway point. Yes, it's another journey through a not-quite-post-apocalyptic landscape hitting every cliché from the Lazy Screenwriter's Book of Plot Points. Look, here's the ex-girlfriend to remind us of the hero's old idealism. Look, here's the aging hippy to show us how much things have changed. Look, here's the mad army officer to provide some threat. It feels too much like it's ordered from a menu and relies too much on the production design and fake documentary camera-work to sell a TV dinner as a fresh steak.<br/><br/>The film really falls apart in the end because no matter how right Owen is at the start of the film he's every bit as lifeless by the end because displaying emotions or growth just isn't what he does. You don't care about his character, the few amusing star turns get killed off early and you're just left with a big series of explosions and riots and shootings to wake up the audience who've switched off their emotions by then. And that end looks weirdly like a setup for Owen's next movie where he once again plays bodyguard to a baby people want to kill. At least that one looks like it knows what it wants to be, which Children of Men never quite does. Okay, but you've already seen it."

They've even found a cure for this in real life and have done so for many years , it's called IVF treatment , something that is conveniently forgotten in this vision of the future <br/><br/>Even worse is the confusing idea that because we're dying out the British government has become fascist and they're stamping down on illegal immigrants . I'm sorry but if Britain is an island why don't the government just block the channel tunnel and search every boat docking in the country ? Surely that's a much better sensible idea than allowing the scenario seen here ? Not allowing illegal immigrants on to an island ( Whilst allowing immigrants with much needed skils to stay ) merely takes some political will combined with some common sense and would be a vote winner with the indigenous electorate regardless of voters ethnicity so why the need of fascism when you can have populist democratic government ? <br/><br/>There's also something else wrong with this premise - why does the slow extinction of mankind lead to so much nihilism ? Put it like this: you've been diagnosed with a terminal illness meaning you have a few years to live so how would you live out your time ? Would you face the future with dignity and calm going about your life as you always have or would you become entirely apathetic about life or would you use the time you have embarking on hedonism ? I think most people would choose one of these options but very few people would genuinely become violent apocalyptic nihilists as seen here <br/><br/>It's been said that Alfonso Cuaron doesn't like to explain narrative turns similar to Michelangelo Antonio and it shows . The characters are often underdeveloped and their motives are often unclear. Like the government we never find out what motivates the terrorists and apart from casting Julianne Moore and Michael Caine in a rather cynical attempt to bump up the box office is their any reason for their characters to exist in the screenplay ? Neither Julian or Jasper contribute anything to the confused plot <br/><br/>Having said all this Cuaron excels in the visuals . The grimy London of the future is certainly memorable while the battle scene towards the end is right there with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN . Also well done is the ambush in the countryside with the burning car and it's those scenes that will linger long in the memory long after you've forgotten the often risible screenplay <br/><br/>All in all CHILDREN OF MEN is a very frustrating , flawed film . It's by no means the masterpiece many claim it is . It's interesting how many American critics enjoyed it . Could it be that America is more religious in its outlook and recognised an ecclesiastical subtext to the story such as having the protagonist called Theodore who sacrifices his life for the future of mankind ? Perhaps , but this screenplay won an Oscar nomination and if anyone thinks is a great screenplay then gawd help us all"

","I just finished viewing Children of Men which is said to be a thought provoking and intelligent movie that received nothing but praise from just about anyone who has seen it.<br/><br/>Disappointment is not the most accurate term to describe my feelings while and after viewing it. So let me just sum up this movie for you: The world is in utter chaos, for some unexplained reason all women are infertile, no children have been born in roughly 20 years. One woman miraculously gets pregnant for evenly unknown reasons. For yet again unknown reasons she is being chased down by various parties who seem to enjoy shooting automatic weapons at her. The baby is born and with the aid of a guy she makes it to some boat and Hooray! the world is savedintelligent stuff ey? <br/><br/>Well, if this is mankind's solution to end all the worlds misery then I got a great idea. Let's send babies to all the troubled regions of the world. We can drop them by parachute from airplanes called 'Tomorrow' and I'm sure the senseless violence will immediately stop. We will wrap the babies in flyers with incredible thought provoking slogans like: ""all governments are bad"" and ""Life's like a box of chocolates"".<br/><br/>And when the turmoil is over, we can send Alfonso Cueron to those regions to make action-packed chase movies out of local literature with profound religious overtones. He can start with the Bible and have Mary and baby Jezus being chased down by all the other characters in the Holy Book carrying heavy artillery while they are being aided by a young Judas.<br/><br/>In these movies we will see an even more realistic hand-held cam imagery than what CoM had to offer us. One of them can feature an unexplained global outbreak of a virus which causes diarrhea that will make key figures in the movie take endless dumps on toilets with dung-splatter on the camera-lens. The splatter will be handsomely edited out later on, for it is more important to handle the style than any real content. God forbid it wouldn't be an uninterrupted long-shot.<br/><br/>The movies will all be without closure and will all go black at the end emblazing the title of the movie onto the screen while in the distance we can hear Axl Rose vaguely doing a Bob Dylan cover which will later be explained by vivid fans of the movie that there is probably a new G 'n R album coming out.<br/><br/>The movies will all have cameo's of top local actors. The actors are all unceremonially killed off early in the film to save budget. Then 30% of the remaining budget will go into the cinematography and what remains is quickly wired to professional movie critics so say something really nice about the production.<br/><br/>Children of (wo)Men, Soon in a dumpster near you!"

Clive Owen and Chiwetel Ejiofor were great, but everyone else seemed to be overacting to me, Julianne Moore's, Clare- Hope Ashitey (as the character of Kee, and for all intense and purposes the virgin Mary), Michael Caine, and Pam Ferris's characters feeling particularly forced, and annoyingly so.<br/><br/>It was also trying too hard to make some deep, intellectual comments about our world today and the religious and cultural divides we are currently living in, hinting at the current political environment, and what consequences it could have, especially the last third of the film set in Bexhill.<br/><br/>I had read the other reviews on here before seeing this movie, but now I've seen it, I'm quite under awed by it all, and the ending does leave you hanging and several plot holes unresolved, leaving me with a sense of not seeing what all the fuss is about, so if you haven't seen it, I personally wouldn't get your hopes up of being blown away by it."
"amoralegria0602","1","48","86","28 January 2007"," completely missed the point
","I really don't understand the hype about this film. It was terrible - gratuitously violent and confusing - from beginning to end. I went to see it with misgivings (and got two friends to go along - they hated it as much as I did!) because I loved the book even though a review in the Chicago Tribune led me to believe some major changes were made to the story line. No kidding! The movie missed the book's point and philosophy completely. They made up half the characters and those that were actually in the book were completely different in the movie, and not changed for the better! Luke was barely recognizable (I only knew it was him because of his name), Rolf was nonexistent, and they created new characters (such as Kee - ridiculous character, racist premise) for no good reason that I could fathom.<br/><br/>The plot bore little resemblance to the book. I would be interested to know why those who made this movie felt compelled to make these changes - the story P.D. James wrote was excellent the way it was - and what the author herself thinks of this film. The book had religious overtones, and the violence in the book is as much the fear of violence as the violence itself. Also, the characters are well-developed and believable. Theo is a character who goes through a complete transformation as he deals with the people he meets (such as Julian, whose role in the book is central to the plot and she certainly is not a terrorist, but instead the first woman to bear a child in 25 years). He is also forced to deal with the issues he has ignored up to now. His cousin, the Warden of England, is reduced in the film to one confusing scene that doesn't add anything to our understanding of the story. The only character I sort of liked and who was even remotely (I do mean remotely!)like the original was Michael Caine's character, Theo's friend Jasper.<br/><br/>And the Quietus - what was with all the advertisements? They never tell you what it really is. In the book it is a crucial incident which leads Theo to join the rebels in the first place. In the movie, it's reduced to almost a footnote - ""suicide in a box"".<br/><br/>I could continue with this rant, but my real disappointment and anger is that an awful movie based on a wonderful book by a great author will not attract new readers. If I had seen this movie before reading the book, I would never have read the book."

"son_of_cheese_messiah","5","21","34","18 March 2011"," Visually stunning, poorly scripted
","This is a film that is somewhat difficult to rate due to being outstanding in some areas, but rather feeble in others. Unlike some, I did not have any problems following the plot but found it contrived, at best. The idea of breaking into the refugee camp in order to escape was not well enough motivated to be plausible. That the only rowing boat in England could be found there is utterly absurd, as was the ease with which they simply rowed away from this highly secured area at the end. <br/><br/>No doubt this break-in was to incorporate the hugely impressive battle scene that the director had in his mind. That this is one of the most compelling sequences I've seen in a film is no exaggeration. However, it also seems to be there to make a laboured political point. For a film set in the future, the immigrants appear to dress remarkably like Eastern Europeans from the 1940s and this seems to be a lazy Warsaw ghetto analogy, with immigrants as victims forced to fight back against ""fascism"". That this boneheaded analogy is directed against Britain, the country which stood firm against real fascism, is actually offensive given that there's no reason stated as to why such a scenario has come about. <br/><br/>Certain other tedious Hollywood tropes are worked in too. A Bush hating hippy (still crazy in 2027) who is a benign pot smoker (Michael Caine is very miscast); A Greenpeace-like boat of salvation; hints of government sponsored terrorism etc.<br/><br/>Another long sequence leading up to the birth of the child is almost as impressive, with a real sense of the lively chaos of the refugee camp. There are other stunning images too, such as the 'nativity' scene in the stables and a few visual in-jokes like the floating pig above Battersea power station. <br/><br/>The dialogue is excruciatingly bad and consists of copious use of the f word. The acting is generally bad too especially from the minor players. Still the action sequences are very well done. The plot has been constructed to create a maximum of set-pieces, which does lead to the video game quality which many reviewers have noted. The choice of music is very good."

","Set in a slightly futuristic world filled with racial hatred and terrorism, a former activist (Clive Owen) takes up the task to escort to safety the first pregnant woman in 18 years. He has to battle through extreme situations with danger lurking around every corner of a war-weary England.<br/><br/>Clive Owen attempts a rather melodramatic role in this war drama, not without success. However, his otherwise interesting performance is shadowed by the actual storyline. The film attempts to show a world in turmoil, filled with death and with no hope of new life. However, it fails to instill any hope and even fails to instill despair. It begins without any premonition of greatness, unfolds into something of interest but falters somewhere half-way, leaving the viewer with a sense of apathy.<br/><br/>Not that it is a bad film. The direction is rather good, the acting overall inspiring, the battle scenes giving the feeling of a BBC documentary of conflict in Iraq or Saudi Arabia. The storyline unfolds rather predictably, however, and the twists of the plot are more or less common and outdated. In the end, it's the atmosphere of the film that lets the viewer down. Where this could have been a glorious epic of hope amidst the ruins, it ends up being an indifferent film about some guy and a woman running around among people with guns."
"dbborroughs","5","34","59","16 September 2007"," Not one of the best films
","An explanation of why I don't think this is a great a film as some have said: Unremarkable film for people who don't have much imagination. Its well made and well acted but the script is not very good, either they explain too much or not enough and almost everything is geared to driving the plot. I felt like I was being force fed the story, which didn't seem to spin out organically.Characters exist purely to serve the plot with the sole exception of Michael Caine who is the only one with a real character. There is a sense of place, but also the sense that somewhere just off the screen there is something else , the film crew (in Bladerunner we got a sense of a bigger world- the space stations of the replicants exists- here I'd be hard pressed to wonder if anything other than England does). Indeed much of the film's world makes no sense, scene after scene I felt was staged in the backgrounds and not real. You have scenes where everything is chaos and others where there is some form of order, but it sees to be two separate films. Also in a world of declining population there seems to be way way too many cops.<br/><br/>The best ""new world"" film exist and don't have to explain things to you.In the best you learn stuff ""accidentally"" on the way.In say Reign of Fire the world's rules are given to you in ways that are natural, as part of conversations, glimpses at headlines. In the worst they either explain too much or so little that nothing makes sense. Here we get endless droning from the TV and on on the signs. But ts almost too much information that only rehashes what we already know. There are these statements from the terrorists when Julianne Moore kidnaps Clive Owen that are meaningless dramatically since Owen would know it already, but which are fed in to inform us. We shouldn't be told in essentially declarative statements about things. Look at Bladerunner, we're dropped in this world and we don't get an explanation of anything, the world is. Owens story is potentially a prequel to Dekers so its odd that the world here is not as complete.<br/><br/>And the plot goes on and on and on with out any real character development. There are few if any real characters, mostly its just odd people wandering in and out with no real sense of who these people are.It would be okay if there was something for them to do, but there isn't, they just move the plot along. What is it between Julianne Moore and Owen? Who are these other people? I don't know. there are huge streams of back story that are hinted at but never touched, which can be gotten away with if you have characters and not cut outs. It would also help if you had a writer who wasn't interested in just moving the plot, who could with a line say volumes, thats not the case. The words are constructed to move things along not build character and situations.<br/><br/>I know part of the problem is changes from the book (which I haven't read) Julianne Moore's character is actually two characters combined, and there are other changes that probably didn't help.<br/><br/>Again its not bad, its just not one of the best films of the year, technically maybe, and certainly Michael Caine should be up for an Oscar, but the story as told on screen doesn't amount to much."
"lance24","4","38","67","6 January 2007"," Slick production of pretentious claptrap
","This well directed first rate production can't overcome the film's pretense that it is ""deep"" or ""meaningful""; in fact, for all it's production value, the movie is, at its core, meritricious. Those reading the astonishing number of positive reviews beware--this is a classic example of viewers bringing preconceived expectations to a movie and then agreeing with their own pre-assessments even though the film they watched sorely missed the mark. At heart, the story is simple: the world has been infertile for unknown reasons for 18 years. As a result, everyone is in a bad mood for the entire film, except Michael Caine, who looks like a refugee from the 60's, growing marijuana, and giving avuncular advice to Clive Owen while getting high. Clive Owen, one of our great actors, is perfectly cast as an angry man working at a meaningless job while an apparent perpetual riot is ongoing in London, the last of the world's major cities not to have been destroyed. Ener Julianne Moore, divorced for 20 years from Mr. Owen. Nonetheless, she has him kidnapped to assist in a critical mission--the delivery to safety of a Young black woman (symbolically and obviously named Kee) who is about to have the world's first infant (obviously a woman) in nearly two decades. While one could think of twenty important issues raised by the premise of the film (religious, social, philosophical, etc.) the great failure of the film is that is doesn't deal with any of them--content to watch Owen scowl, Caine fart and various lunatics babble in foreign tongues. In any event, Owen undertakes this mission and effectively delivers the mother and child to safety. Left behind, however, is a nightmare of war, riot, lunacy, rival factions, and general mayhem. Are we supposed to believe that the birth of one child will transmogrify the ""end of days"" world she's born into? Who knows and who cares? The director's job is to make the issues surface--and not supply a story from which we can create our own meaning. As far as I'm concerned, the film was an equivalent of a blank canvass and the viewers are supposed to supply meaning to it. This ain't art history, it's film. In the end, I couldn't help comparing this film to Sam Mendes great failure ""Road to Perdition""; while it was technically superior, it painted a small story on a big canvas and, ultimately, had nothing to say to me. Potential viewers are on notice!"
"Carl_Tait","3","39","69","2 December 2007"," A disastrous adaptation
","*** This review contains HUGE SPOILERS for the movie AND THE BOOK ***<br/><br/>Although I don't usually write reviews with spoilers, this total botch of a film requires me to discuss several essential plot points in order to explain just how poorly the movie has been made.<br/><br/>Films need not slavishly follow the books on which they are based. Movies often need to remove minor subplots and to rearrange certain details for dramatic effect. With that said, however, Alfonso Cuaron's dreadful screenplay manages to take a pretty good book by P. D. James and turn it into a preachy, incoherent mess driven largely by fight scenes, chase scenes, and heavy-handed political statements.<br/><br/>Let's start with the climax of the film: for the first time in over eighteen years, a child is born. Excuse me, but aside from the novelty value, why should anyone in that sad world care? No one knows what's causing the sterility, so there's no reason to believe that the birth is anything but a fluke. Even if the child herself turns out to be fertile, there are now two fertile women in the entire world. Big deal.<br/><br/>This illogical point is nowhere to be found in the book. The novel makes it clear that only men have become sterile, so finding even one fertile man would indeed be a basis for hope that the world might regenerate. The father of the child is clearly fertile, and the battle for his sperm is charged with both dramatic and political interest. The child also turns out to be a boy, providing additional hope. Unfortunately, Cuaron ditched this logical and interesting story in favor of a soft-headed Christian/feminist allegory that doesn't work at all. Worse yet, he allows the movie to plod onwards through a mind-numbing half hour of tedious fight scenes after the climactic birth.<br/><br/>The book raises some thought-provoking issues about how such a society might function. Much of the book's thoughtful balance is achieved through the back-and-forth between Theo and his friend Xan. Xan? Who the hell is that? Xan is the nominal leader of England and one of the book's central characters. Replacing him with some minor bureaucrat who has about two minutes of screen time was a fatal error. The moral ambiguities of Xan's edicts -- should even minor criminals be carted off to some hell-hole prison to preserve order in a crisis? -- have been replaced by ham-handed and endlessly repeated scenes of illegal immigrants being mistreated and deported.<br/><br/>Cuaron could have taken this interesting story, tightened it up a bit (the book is too drawn-out), and ended up with a fine film of psychological and moral complexity. Unfortunately, he took the opposite route, grossly oversimplifying the ethical issues and focusing on the tiresome chases and fights that represent the book's weakest moments. A major disappointment."

","This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. If you must watch it, watch for the cinematography with the sound off to spare yourself the agony of bad dialogue delivered grudgingly. The Julianne Moore character is killed off early, probably at her request. Every discrepancy between the book and the movie is a mistake, and the film is more discrepancy than adaptation. That which was omitted should not have been omitted and that which was added should not have been added and there is no health in it. <br/><br/>The best work in it is by Michael Caine, the guy who plays Syd, and the mute paralyzed woman in the wheel chair, who obviously represents the unfortunate viewer. Think Golden Child, or Star Trek I, or possibly Liquid Sky, and revise your expectations downward. I kept watching, paralyzed, in silent protest, unable to comprehend how a film with such perfect sets, lighting, and camera work could actually be so bad. The director should consider a career in the food service industry.<br/><br/>Another point that bothered me about the film, and should bother everyone. In the novel, it is men who cannot sire children. P. D. James extends an actual trend, falling sperm counts due to environmental pollution, to its logical conclusion. In the film, for no reason that I could see, the ""blame"" is shifted onto women. Pathetic."
"paulk-20","1","46","83","31 May 2007"," A very poignant warning
","...to stop seeing movies that critics like. I had the unfortunate experience of viewing this ""film"" one evening. A friend was in from out of town so my family decided we'd buy a movie for the evening's entertainment. I was instructed to buy this critically acclaimed movie that had just come out titled, Children of Men. I remembered the previews, such an interesting premise. Why was humanity no longer bearing children? What sort of message would the film put across? Clive Owen was supposed to have been lucky to miss out on playing Bond for this role, so I was excited.<br/><br/>Wow, was I wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.<br/><br/>We watched. Slowly, our suspicions that the reviewers had duped us (misery loves company as they say...) were panning out. Now, normally I dislike when I see overly negative reviews on the IMDb. ""Just don't watch it,"" I think, ""please don't drag the rating down."" But, when I saw this was in the top 150, beating out such classics as Yojimbo, Annie Hall, The Princess Bride, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The General, and even Gone With the Wind, I couldn't take it lying down. What I will do is outline, briefly, the many problems I see with this film.<br/><br/>1. An obvious agenda with which the makers feel they must bludgeon the audience. Michael Caine's character is a pot growing ex-reporter hippie who lives with his disabled wife (whom he helps commit suicide halfway through the film). He has various stickers in his home that are common these days, rather brainless political stickers with slogans like, ""No more Bush,"" ""War is Bad."" I'm paraphrasing, but you get the idea. Kinda funny that even though the film takes place in the year 2027, this guy would still have anti-Bush stickers. Any message you're trying to get across, producers? Also, there is a constant ""big brother"" idea running throughout the film, any democratic government is pretty darn oppressive and evil. Also, the Greenpeace... I'm sorry, I mean a boat called the Tomorrow shows up at the end of the film to save the day. The people who own the Tomorrow are part of the never defined Human Project. The audience has little clue as to the identity of the people in charge of the Human Project and the movie sure as heck isn't going to tell anybody.<br/><br/>2. Constant uncomfortableness. In movies where the characters are running from someone, the audience needs occasional reprieves. The characters need to get to a place of safety, even if it's momentary. Otherwise, the audience begins to squirm. Children of Men, however, wants to make sure that you feel as though your television were chaffing you. This is indicative of a movie-making philosophy that is steeped in the literal rather than the metaphoric, and is indicative of lazy writing. Yes, the characters are uncomfortable, and that is necessary to portray, but once the audience is made to feel uncomfortable, the movie has lost focus. The main characters are always running, always being double crossed, always watching loved ones die, always getting in gun battles. They rarely get a chance for dialog, and when they do, it's out of place because their talking in the middle of a skirmish.<br/><br/>3. Neverending gore, shooting, violence, and gallons upon gallons of blood. For some reason, modern filmmakers have decided that their audiences want to see what it's like when a person gets shot, stabbed, blown apart, disemboweled, etc. The reason these things weren't shown much in the films of yore was not just that they didn't have the technology to accurately replicate the human anatomy, it's that graphic violence is a cheap way to toy with the emotions of the audience. It's why people look down on slasher flicks; they're gratuitous and unnecessarily gory. It's more artistic to see the facial reaction of the person who's doing the shooting rather than seeing the blood spray from the wound of the person getting shot (see Lawrence of Arabia, this was actually a plot point). In this movie, they show anything they can. Limbs are torn off (in the first five minutes, actually), people get holes put in their heads, blood pours everywhere. In the scene where Micheal Caine gets shot, it takes about five minutes and twenty bullets for him to die. I don't want to watch that. And I question the sanity of people that do.<br/><br/>4. Bland performance after bland performance. Everyone seems bored, high, or full of caffeine. Clive Owen's character is a typical indie film anti-hero in a movie that desperately needed a hero. I never felt a connection with him because the movie never presented a reason for me to like him. Owen's character is dissatisfied with everything, rarely showed any emotion other than squirming fear, and never makes a concrete decision that wasn't already made for him. The character of Kee, played by Claire-Hope Ashitey, never allows the audience to find anything likable about her. She smokes some pot while still pregnant with her child, she swears constantly, she admits that she has no idea who the father is, and instead of telling Clive Owen she's pregnant she decides to strip for him. I thought the ""Code"" in the 1930's, banning pretty much everything we plop into movies now regarding drugs, sexuality, and violence went too far. If the ""Code"" were still in effect, we would not have films like The Godfather, Braveheart, or The Matrix. But, I'd rather watch nothing but ""Code"" films if it means Children of Men is the crap that's going to get pushed on us.<br/><br/>So, if you like this film, please feel free to explain why. I don't mind the discourse, really. But please, put this movie in its place. Don't rate it higher than The Conversation, It Happened One Night, The African Queen, Duck Soup, and Groundhog Day."

","I've read so much hype and positive comments on this film before watching, and regretfully, it did not live up to the expectations.<br/><br/>The film starts with an interesting, original basic story point: a future where the human race has become sterile. This opening point has so much potential, but unfortunately doesn't take off anywhere from there.<br/><br/>The plot itself is pretty monotonic: Our 2 heroes running off together from one place to another. It's not always clear who they're running from or where they are going. The chase itself is not so action-packed, and directed rather slowly. The other characters in the movie are thin cardboard cutouts - no background, no reasonable motives. There's not much of a punchline or point to the story once it ends either.<br/><br/>The movie does present a convincing, depressing but realistic future reality, down to little details. It does have a strong political saying, warning and moral. But these are the only strongpoints. In all other aspects, the film is not bad - but just mediocre. From a storytelling perspective, the movie presents a thin story, loosely tied scenes, and not enough character development. It lacks momentum and is just not entertaining enough."

","I saw this movie after it was nominated for a Academy award.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is cool...somehow mankind can no longer reproduce. In other words women can no longer become pregnant. As a sub-plot there is this anti-immigrant story where country of England is shipping out all non-British people, maybe this is the reason this movie has resonated with so many people.<br/><br/>Somehow Clive Owen's character gets caught up in helping a pregnant girl escape to some save haven. Obviously her baby is special, but because she is a immigrant, the government is after her.<br/><br/>The movie does a poor job of clearing up the who's after her for what reasons. The ending is fairly meaningless. I guess it is some king of warning for ""developed nations"" where citizens are having fewer children while immigrants (legal and non-legal) are multiplying 3 times faster.<br/><br/>Wait for it to come out on Sci Fi for free or rent it for a dollar."

","I watched this movie expecting so so much more from it. I read and heard a lot of praise, and it was a bit of a let down...<br/><br/>Good things: - filming technique: brilliant, especially that legendary fight sequence in the ruins of the refugee camp. Absolutely brilliant! - Michael Caine as the old hippie. He steals the show in every scene. - the description of a possible future of this world, very realistic, bleak and filled with violence. - Theo is a modern hero, never touching a gun - Theo's cousin who is creating an Ark of all the great works of art of this world. A dying race, but with something beautiful to leave behind as a legacy to the unknown. Beautiful! <br/><br/>unfortunately the movie is so crammed with symbols that you have the impression the writer and director made a bet to see how many they can put in without people complaining. And some of the good stuff I evoked earlier become also negative points: - Kee is black (political correctness!), she's the modern Eve/Saint Mary, bringing to this world the first child/Saviour. - Theo is Joseph and the good Samaritan, never touching a weapon, even if he's in mortal danger.He lost hope/faith when Dylan died, and finds it again through this baby, to the point of giving his life for it. - the child is in danger (a lot like with Jesus and Herod) and is born in very poor conditions among refugees (Jesus symbol again!) - refugees camp: Nazi camps, Irak war, immigrant camps etc, you have your pick of examples of human oppression and cruelty towards your fellow men - Michael Cane as the old hippie...how many billion of times has that been done now? - the Fishes and the government act the same, terrorists and state police are alike - some type of disease/virus/catastrophe hits humanity with various effects: zombies, blindness, sterility, hunger/cannibalism. Humanity is a dying race, violence is everywhere.<br/><br/>All these symbols and ideas have all been done too many times in too many movies. There are just too many (obvious) messages the movie wants to deliver, from ""immigrants are people"" to ""terrorists and governments employ the same methods"". Maybe it's wrong of me to judge a film 4 years after it was made...but on the other hand, the review I deliver reflects perhaps also how a spectator DOES feel watching the movie 4 years after it was made. <br/><br/>It could have been so much better, but I guess for 2006 this was the hype at Hollywood."

","I was looking forward to watching this film, as its reviews were so positive. The characterisation was undeveloped and missed much of the thrust of the original story. There was a sense of annoying vision of the future with sites of London mashed together- the Tate Modern and Battersea Power Station became one! For those of us who know London, it was poor and shattered the narrative. The details of the future were also poor they made me think that production designer popped out to Camberwell to buy second hand fruit machines and a fiat multipla. The plot felt disjointed jumping the characters in unknown places to exactly where they were supposed to be, and the refugees spoke German. All in all the film was a bit of a poor experience and only benefited from good costumes, flip-flops and Michael Cane of course. The birth scene was so unrealistic and filmed from the other side of the room! How did this get awards?"

It headed nowhere. I can't spoil the ending because there isn't one really! What you see is just like a montage of scenes strung together. The middle section of a story.

"gus120970","6","12","18","28 August 2007"," Liberal guilt mates with Science Fiction
","The original P.D. James book about an apocalyptic global loss of fertility has been hijacked by Cuaron to produce a contemporary satire on Iraq, globalisation and terrorism, in a way I found crude, simplistic and intrusive. The white fertile heroine of the novel has become black, purely to make a point about race and immigration, an issue that saturates the content of the film and overpowers the central intriguing premise of a world without children. It's an ironic inversion of the apparent liberal ideal of colour-blindess, and made even more ironic by the portrayal of the equal dogma of Left and Right portrayed by the fascist regime and the revolutionary Fishes. Cuaron has purged his text of situations and character traits that don't suit his political agenda. True, he does make a pacier, more visually engaging film than the original book would have offered, and there are some tour de force sequences - the car reversing scene and a very Kubrick-esquire urban warfare scene. But I found the constant equivalence of Nazism to the current iraq conflict and security situation insulting to the intelligence. A man stands hooded like the Abu Ghraib prisoner, illegal immigrants are detained by the dept of 'Homeland Security' and most offensively, the adverts asking the public to be vigilant about immigrants are the same as those used in the wake of the London Tube bombings. Cuaron seems overburdened by liberal guilt and anger, which he indulges in two hours at my expense. And that of Universal - the film unsurprisingly recouped less than half of its production budget in the US, given its sentiments. Maybe it did better in Iran - if indeed a permit was granted for it to be shown. Cuaron doesn't need to look into the future to find fascist regimes. They're here and now: unfortunately, he's looking in the wrong hemisphere."

","If the future ever reaches a point like this movie there would be little point in getting out of bed.<br/><br/>It is a harrowing view of a very bleak future where there are no children. The cinematography is beautifully done and the acting is first class! However it is the very nature of the film that filled me with such foreboding, dark gloomy landscapes painted a scene of an era not seen since the concentration camps in 1940's Germany! The modern twist in 'Children of Men' is that we have the terrorist's threat which is a decidedly chilling undertone due to the fact the leaders of this group do not see themselves as such! (Do they ever?) The message to carry on even when the circumstances are against you is a common theme in many movies, and yes the theme of a golden child ushering in a brighter future or the beacon of light breaking down the cultural divides is one than can be inspiring, however, I came away from the film feeling glum due to the films unremitting bleakness and darkness of tone.<br/><br/>The film does leave you with a sense of hope, but only a slim chance of hope.<br/><br/>I'm going to watch 'Philadelphia' to cheer myself up"

Firstly, it is unrelentingly dark and depressing, then incoherent and very difficult to follow. It is practically impossible to empathise with any of the badly drawn characters. Clive Owen once again proves that he is not up to big screen roles (- don't get me wrong, he's fine on TV but simply can't cut it in films). Basically, it's pretty shambolic.

","I'm sorry, but the rating of this movie is crazy. It is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and I'll tell you why. For starters, this movie dragged on and on for me. The plot (did it have one?) never moved. It was just one machine gun battle after another. I think there was no more plot in the movie than what we saw in the theatrical trailer. When I saw the trailer to this movie, I figured that they were trying to get this woman to some place where scientists could study her. I figured people would regain hope, civilization would be saved, etc. But no, we don't get any of that. Instead we watch a 2 hour long movie with nothing but gun battles between various factions that aren't even explained. What are their motives? I still don't know. This ""human project"" was never explained and all we got to see of it was a boat in the water. When the end credits came, my wife and I looked at each other and said ""That is it?"" Usually when I watch a movie I expect to have had some kind of plot resolution by the time we reach the end. Instead, I felt like I watched a movie about somebody washing their car or doing the dishes. Nothing happened. I thought when the army stopped firing as the baby was carried across the battlefield that surely this would be the climax of the plot and that the army would call the government and tell them there was a baby and the war would stop. But no, they just start shooting at each other again as soon as they get across. How stupid is that?"

","I've read the first page on IMDb of, mostly ecstatic, reviews of this movie and I'm wondering if I watched a different movie. ""Children of Men"" is simply unbelievable. The book is far, far better and totally different from the movie. The idea of such a dystopian future is believable,after all the Patriot Act (such a detestable title) is already with us in the U.S., but the whole idea that ""Theo"" and ""Kee"" could survive to the final frame despite a whole Armour of ammunition being fired in their direction by almost an entire army of both soldiers and rebels is ludicrous, as is the idea that their little rowing boat could miraculously find itself at the right place at the right time despite thick fog and a complete lack of navigation aids. All you could say is that the English Channel can turn into the millpond it was portrayed as, in such weather conditions. I won't comment on the fate of Theo other than to say the scene was, for my wife and I, straight out of some local am-dram. Then there was Theo and Kee's escape from the hideout of The Fishes in a vehicle that had to be repeatedly jump-started. Totally unbelievable! There should have been far more emphasis on the despair felt by the population at the inability of mankind to reproduce than shots of London buses bearing adverts for ""Quietus"" suicide kits and ""Jasper's"" handling of and contemplation of the use of one of those kits. The book emphasizes the use of child substitutes such as the baptism of kittens and puppies but the movie focuses almost solely on shoot-'em up violence. Bruce Willis does this sort of thing much better. But who am I to judge; the senior movie critic of ""The Guide"" section of the Sydney Morning Herald, Doug Anderson, recently voted it his Movie of the Week when it was shown on a local TV channel last week. And David Stratton & Margaret Pomeranz, two of Australia's most respected movie critics both gave it 4 out of 5 stars. My wife and I must have missed something but for us it was a waste of our DVD-rental money. The only movie that I can think of that is more ludicrous is ""Face/Off"", the John Travolta/Nicholas Cage movie. I turned that off after 10 minutes so stupid did I think it was."

Why has society broken down so badly that there are revolutionaries? Why don't countries want immigrants? Why are government conspiracy theories so rampant with the revolutionaries that they start a violent uprising? The writers did not establish the rules for this world, making it impossible to connect with the characters and the story. What was the purpose of showing Luke and his band killing Jasper?

","""Children of Men"" didn't exactly set the box-office afire, and one look at it tells you why: the bleak film packs a wallop, but not the kind of rousing cinematic punch we get with most war movies. This one, set in 2027 London, hits too close to home for mass audience acceptance; it offers no hope for anybody, especially viewers in the need for a quick entertainment fix. Clive Owen plays a British working-stiff annoyed by (and, perhaps, immune to) the constant world-violence saturating the media; after nearly getting killed in an explosion, he agrees to help his ex-wife (and terrorist operative) with a mission to smuggle a young woman across the border. The hitch is, the lady is eight months pregnant--the first such occurrence in eighteen years! A horrifying vision of war, one with no good or bad sides, just senseless brutality and inhumanity. Though compact at one hour and forty-two minutes, ""Children of Men"" is a staggering achievement yet is a difficult one to get through. One almost recoils from it--but only because its lawlessness isn't very hard to fathom, which is both helplessly disturbing and cruelly enlightening. **1/2 from ****"
"marccolten-1","1","27","47","18 October 2007"," Very dumb movie
","Okay - I know many people seem to love this film but I was dumbfounded from start to finish. Well before the start - the entire concept as reported in ads, reviews and discussions on TV confused me.<br/><br/>***************** SPOILERS *************************************<br/><br/>1) The premise that all women everywhere (but not animals apparently) can't have babies - fine - as David Letterman said ""If you buy the premise you buy the bit"".<br/><br/>2) That this leads to fascism and terrorism - sorry makes no sense. I would expect depression and malaise but not violence. For example, if you look at the real world you would see that it's having children that causes problems. When people have children and see that they will never get homes, jobs, education or health care, you get violence. In COM who is committing the violence, people who want to get pregnant but can't? There was a scene where Theo is on a bus and young men are throwing rocks. All I could think of was ""Shouldn't they be out trying to get women pregnant?"". Any government would pay a million dollars for a baby, any baby.<br/><br/>3) Okay, so a woman is pregnant (again with the Christian allegory) who is somehow the savior of humanity. Fine, but why this leads to a chase and killings makes no sense. Who are the ""they"" who the woman has to be protected from? Although it was nice for the bad guys to occasionally pause to provide exposition and back story where Theo can hear it. And why is taking her out in a rowboat to find people who might not exist the answer? You're telling me that every lab in the world isn't working on this problem? Any 1st world nation from nearby France and Germany to the distant US and Canada would be glad to send anything that was needed to get her and find out the answer.<br/><br/>4) I get the reference to today and Homeland Security, but this is the one situation where attacking refugees would not be the answer. With no one under 20 in your country you'd be importing them, as slaves if nothing else. It's not like today where the anti-immigration people are terrified of being over-birthed out of power. They're drones, just like you, so why bother<br/><br/>5) The one real situation was after the birth, where all the people in the internment camp are crying and reaching out to touch the baby. Then the soldiers. Do they shoot? No, they put down their guns, some kneel and cross themselves. WHO ARE THEY RUNNING FROM? The kid has it's own army! They'd desert and march the kid anywhere, to a lab.<br/><br/>6) The end credits has the sounds of laughing children suggesting the problem has been solved. I hope they are not suggesting that one woman and her daughter will repopulate the Earth - not much of a breeding population to work with. So some organization (with a boat named ""Tomorrow"" - jeez) will solve the problem because (unlike ""The Human Project"") everyone else wants the human race to go extinct.<br/><br/>Sorry, just an absurd and stupid movie."
"WriterDave","7","27","47","9 January 2007"," Interesting but Overcooked Speculative Drama
","Alfonso Cuaron (most well known for directing the overrated and raunchy coming-of-age story ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and the third--and the best--of the ""Harry Potter"" series) does a nice job of setting the mood with his gritty and eclectic take on a dystopian future where women have become infertile and Britian is a volatile police state where the biggest crime is being an illegal immigrant. This central conceit is mildly interesting, but the screenwriters populate the allegorical fiction with stock characters: people and ideas painted with broad strokes and little development, and peppered with quirky side-stories and characters who are often more interesting than the overly symbolic main plot line.<br/><br/>What emerges is quasi-entertaining movie bubbling over with overcooked details and a few good scenes. Though dropping the ball in the intimate interludes that are supposed to add dramatic weight (the screaming match on the bus between Clive Owen and Julianne Moore about grief seemed especially staged and unreal), Cuaron directs the suspense and action scenes with appropriate zeal. Sadly, everyone in the film constantly looks tired (Owen taking a nap in a car and Moore actually yawning in one pivotal scene), so between the good stuff I often felt the same. <br/><br/>There are three really well constructed sequences that on their own are very thrilling: a reverse vehicular escape from a an angry mob that ends tragically, another vehicular escape at dawn down a dirt farm road where the car just doesn't want to start, and one of the closing scenes of a lonely rowboat in a choppy bay surrounded by fog. <br/><br/>The rest is haphazard filler that had me distracted most of the time. ""Children of Men"" eventually became of movie of frustrating details. For instance, the title makes no sense when you think about it. Unless sprung from immaculate conception, we are currently all children of men, so this would only be an appropriate title if all the women in the world were dead and men started having babies. The movie cost over $80 million dollars to make (and it looks great) but why couldn't they fork out the extra cash to pay for the real Rolling Stones' version of ""Ruby Tuesday"" instead of a lousy cover? The song plays a crucial part yet becomes aggravating to hear. Finally, instead of caring about what happens to the two lead characters during the excellently filmed siege of the refugee camp, I cared more about what was going to happen to some poor gypsy woman and her little dog.<br/><br/>Though it has plenty of interesting minutae to keep things entertaining, the film never coalesces as a whole. Despite three really good scenes, ""Children of Men"" unfortunately solidifies Cuaron's status as the best director yet to make a great film."

Second is the premise, which is what might happen if the extinction of mankind was inevitable. Yes, that's it. And if you don't want to see the movie, don't worry. I just explained the entire film. Nothing else happened, nothing. You don't learn anything, there's no morality lesson, and there's no storyline. No progression. No character development. You gotta wonder if the writers just smoked pot the entire time instead of coming up with a story.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that doesn't explain anything, and attempts to be ""artistic"" in doing so. You are left to basically write the entire story in your head. You never find out what's going on in the rest of the world, who, what or where the human project is, or if the newborn baby even survives. How can you have a movie about the world becoming infertile, then a new baby is born (unexplained how the woman got pregnant), and not tell us what happens to the baby in the end? WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS MOVIE??? Every character has zero depth to them and aren't even likable. (Except Michael Caine, who plays a good hippie) The ending was horrible. It was pointless, and actually made a bad movie even worse. As a joke, I told my girlfriend ""That would be funny if they ended the movie right now""... And guess what happened? This movie is honestly embarrassing. Not because it was doomed to be bad from the start, but because it COULD have been good. If only they explained everything instead of just mentioning it.

Cuaron can thank M Night Shyamalan for his atrocious LADY IN THE WATER that his film wasn't the bottom of my list this year.<br/><br/>This hokey, overwrought, noisy, ugly piece of garbage is film-making at its absolute worst.<br/><br/>First off, the BLADERUNNER comparisons are so incredibly superficial and undeserved, that I have to wonder if it isn't the film's PR machine putting out those comments. The one and only similarity is that they take place in the future. BLADERUNNER was a masterful amalgam of mood, music, art direction and story that you will never forget. (If you haven't seen it, go for the director's cut, and try to see it on a big screen revival if possible.)<br/><br/>CHILDREN is bleak, with no artistry or imagery to speak of. All I seem to recall are scenes filled with tenements, chain link fences and rubble. If it's derived from a video game, I wouldn't be at all surprised, with its exaggerated violence and action par for that medium. And the story is just so stupid. No babies have been born anywhere for 20 years, but there just happens to be one pregnant woman somewhere in London? What about New Guinea, or the deepest Amazon?

Michael Caine was totally miscast and performed as Michael Caine as he does in almost all his movies.

","Well. Just finished watching a movie I have been anticipating viewing for some time and I am utterly confused. How on earth this flick has got an 8.2 average review, I cannot understand. Sorry to all those who loved it, but this film, for me, was pretty dire. The photography was OK, the sets and costumes were good. I thought Owen did very well with what he was given, but the plot character development, script and the other actors were, to be polite, awful.<br/><br/>What was the director trying to say with the movie? I get the almost religious undertones, and the introspection of the human race as destructive force but these things could be inferred merely by reading the tagline for the movie. I spent almost two hours expecting the film to expand upon the issue, and have walked away feeling nothing.<br/><br/>I don't understand the rationale of the opposing militia groups. Why the baby was deemed to be the key to one side having a tactical advantage is a mystery. What was their goal? I felt no compassion for the main characters, I thought Caine's character in particular was weak. The pretentiousness of the whole thing was astounding; Several long orchestral movements suggest some profundity, yet there is nothing in particular to read of these scenes.<br/><br/>The only thing a walk away wondering is - has IMDb become over popularised? I used to be able to rely on it's ratings absolutely to find a great movie. It seems anything nowadays is capable of being a top 250 movie. Then again I didn't like Lord of the Rings either, so I guess it's just me. Hope you enjoy Children of Men, but on reflection I will consider it total and utter tosh."

","Very disappointing. After reading the positive reviews I was ready for a really good near future sci/fi fantasy, with amazing visuals, performance and of course a killer story line.<br/><br/>Children of Men unfortunately fails in almost all categories - primarily because the build up to the ending is HUGE and falls FLAT on its face. This is a chase movie (a fair one at that) with little storyline, lots of unanswered questions and wasted performances.<br/><br/>Spoilers: The one woman who can and has had a baby in 18 years, floats in a battered row boat through a dense fog, while a ship called Tomorrow arrives, the reluctant hero dies(?)unceremoniously and she announces to her newborn miracle... ""we're safe now"". An unsatisfying end to a messy production.<br/><br/>One of the worst endings to yet another aimlessly wandering apocalypse story that I've ever been subjected to. All of us who watched it kinda looked around with a that's it?!"" expression, staring with wonder that we were led on an overly long chase scene with unsympathetic characters to a mindless ending. There was very little to like about this film. <br/><br/>We're all infertile until a promiscuous young girl called ""Kee"" is having a baby that a terrorist group wants to keep for their own purposes... and oh yeah, half the government army stands by and lets the baby walk right past them when they have the chance to take her and the wounded hero without firing a shot (most of the film is written THAT well!) :)<br/><br/>What was good? Visuals were wonderful, the look and atmosphere were thoroughly well done and the images of London in collapse were excellent. The opening scene packs a nice punch but then its all downhill from there. Some of the side characters were well imagined and usually the only thing worth watching, with the exception of the terrorists who were cardboard cookie cutter characterizations.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore is completely wasted in the film and mercifully has her brains blown out early on. Michael Caine is the only character we ever really care about and he also is relegated to being cannon fodder. Clive Owen delivers his usual just above average part as he is whisked through this story-less but visually interesting waste of time. There's just no one to care about and no depth of story to keep anything together. <br/><br/>Children of Men never develops into anything remotely interesting and is just another excuse for CGI, big buck sets and a chase scene masquerading as Sci/fi - fantasy. <br/><br/>I have no idea if the story this was based on resembles the film, I would hope it had more flesh to it.

","The idea of human infertility in a global scale would have the potential to generate a great movie. Unfortunately this movie wastes this idea completely. It just boringly depicts a scenario that is at least very implausible. <br/><br/>No attempt is made to explain (or to encourage the audience to come up with its own explanations) why infertility would have brought the world to that dystopian state. It is much more probable that the world would get economically better in the first 18 years without children, since the costs of raising children would gradually disappear. It would only slowly start to get economically worse after the first 18 years.<br/><br/>With a diminishing population, resources per capita would increase across the world, and hence the amount of illegal immigrants who immigrate searching for better conditions for themselves and especially for their children, would decrease, instead of increasing as shown in this movie. The only explanation why the movie shows an increase in immigration seems to be the British xenophobia. Even under a condition (i.e. global infertility) that would actually decrease the number of illegal immigrants in their country, they manage to imagine that their country would be even more ""attacked"" by illegal immigrants. And as the movie shows, apparently they believe that such an increased inflow of immigrants would then justify locking all these immigrants in concentration camps...<br/><br/>It is improbable that, in a world where humanity faces extinction, people would start killing each other, instead of focusing on discovering what caused the infertility and solving it. The whole movie is just about escaping from these meaningless and random killings.<br/><br/>It is simply very boring. I cannot believe it got so many awards and a high rating in IMDb. And it is really a pity that this movie wasted its original idea of global infertility. Now, even if other movies do a better job with this idea, it will just not be that original anymore."

","I love sci-fi. Good sci-fi. This is not sci-fi, it's a war drama (to be shelved next to Full Metal Jacket) First let me tell you what I liked about the movie. The world is extremely well presented as desperate, morbid and hopeless. The contrast of the hope of a single baby is equally well presented and will make a grown man cry. And even I, a grown man, cried. It contains some of the most gut wrenching scenes of warfare turned into the most beautiful thing I have seen on film.<br/><br/>Too bad one or two scenes do not make a movie (at least for me).<br/><br/>Now for why I rated the movie so low. The story of Children of Men was nearly completely revealed in the trailers. There is virtually no character development, the story is pretty straight forward, and yet unbelievable at the same time. When I say ""unbelievable"" I mean several convergences of character paths were so improbably that, if it weren't for the intensity of the scenes, they would be exposed for what they are : ""deus ex machina"" story patches.<br/><br/>Moreover, the story is preachy about its anti-war, anti-immigration reform stance and makes it quite clear that if a disastrous, hopeless situation occurs those things would send mankind over the brink. It presents the terrorists not as the ""good guys"", but rather the ""not so bad guys"". Imagery from Abu Ghraib were directly duplicated and used in the background of some scenes.<br/><br/>A note on the DVD release: The extra interviews with the extreme left wing activists really rubbed me the wrong way and their simplistic view of the world didn't even measure up to the complexity posed by the film."

The major plot points were completely disregarded and the story torn to pieces. Even looking at the film from a non-biased point of view, the story got lost in ridiculous gun battles and was not pieced well together. It lacked flow that makes a film watchable.

","Having read 10 pages of reviews, the plot (what there is of it) has thoroughly been described. So, I'll skip straight to what's terrible about this film. When writing even a newspaper article, you're supposed to explain: who, what, when, where, how and why. In 2 hours of running time, this film barely explains any of these. Instead, the 2 hours are packed with mostly gratuitous violence. When any explanation is given, the soundtrack is so bad, the accent so thick, that even my British husband couldn't understand what was being said.<br/><br/>What isn't explained: Why women can't have children. Why no one cares who the father of the baby is. Why the ""fish"" need the baby to serve their purpose, or even what that purpose ultimately is. Why Julian is killed. Why immigrants are treated so badly, when there's zero natural population growth. Why young people stand around throwing rocks at trains and cars. What the Human Project is, and why it's the only hope for saving the baby, especially since it may not even exist. Why it's assumed that every other option is so much more dangerous, that it's preferable to put the mother and baby in the middle of a filthy, violent, unstable immigrant camp. Why they had to be arrested, go to the camp and risk their lives to get a rowboat. Why no one took the mother and baby into custody as they were walking through a crowd of soldiers. Why the unexplained birth of one single, female baby will ""save the world"" when taken in by the mysterious, mythical Human Project. But, again, plenty of time for random shooting, killing and gore.<br/><br/>Even smaller plot points were annoying. Why have Jasper telling his stupid fart joke repeatedly, as he's getting killed? Why is there a pile of cow carcasses burning in a field? And do they really expect us to believe that the ""heros"" can escape from the ""fish"" when they're making all kinds of noise, up to within a few feet of the guards, in a car that won't even start? Even the cover of Ruby Tuesday was horrible. Believe it or not, I could keep going. I'm not the smartest or most sophisticated film viewer, but I know when a movie is too smart for me and over my head. This one isn't. It's just tissue paper thin, lazy, insulting and sloppy. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the cinematography is good."

","'Children of Men' paints an interesting, detailed, and realistic backdrop. This should be said from the start, because in fact, the film does little else. Having created an reasonably realistic and viable starting scenario, the film contrives, in rather obvious fashion, to drag a small cast over that backdrop, permitting the camera to pick up every detail. The acting of the cast, as it poses with the backdrop, is often, if not universally superb, and if a bit of acting, and that marvelous backdrop are all that you require, the film is a great one. The problem is, that the plot is altogether lacking and incomplete. It is a rare episode in a television show or movie of any sort that does not have more story to it than this film. The lack of plot also reveals a deep and fundamental lack of meaning in the thoughts behind this movie. There is a distilled European angst, a pure and saccharine sentimentality, dribbles of ill conceived piety, and little else.<br/><br/>Rather than using an altered environment to enhance the message, 'Children of Men' uses a novel environment to replace making a considered statement and confronting ideas directly. This puts 'Children of Men' at odds with both Science Fiction, and quality film."

If you like a movie with a good story line and character development, I suggest you look elsewhere. I am not even sure who the good guys are-if there actually were any. The only way to describe this movie is Mad Max with a baby. Julianne Moore and Michael Caine are billed in this movie and usually that is a good indication. Unfortunately, they get killed off early in the film. Why? Probably because they read the rest of the script and wanted out. That was a couple hours of my life I will never get back."

The plot is poorly developed, leaving gaping holes in continuity and nothing but questions about who?, what? why? and how? Michael Caine's character is the most memorable but his relationship with Theo is never really explained. Indeed no relationships are either explained or explored. There is little or no character development and the viewer is left to fumble through the movie, avoiding sporadic and meaningless violence, without knowing why. <br/><br/>Some elements of this movie, particularly the use of animals and an apparent footwear fetish, add nothing to the movie except further confusion. To add insult to injury, there is no outcome. At the end of 2 hours of pure bewilderment we are left with no better understanding of what we have just watched. <br/><br/>I am dismayed by the number of positive reviews. The movie was poorly acted for the most part, gratuitously depressing throughout and failed to explain its premise. It reminds me of a TV segment I saw some time ago which illustrated the stupidity of so called art lovers who paid ridiculous sums of money for painting done by elephants. A bunch of supercilious nitwits standing in a gallery discussing the meaning and brilliance of randomly splattered paint from brushes wielded by an elephant's trunk.

Why has the world gone wacko? What's the issue with immigrants? Doesn't make any sense: In a world without children, you're going to need lots of cheap labor and, hey, that means immigrants! So, you have the wacko world subplot and the immigrant subplot and a black new world virgin Mary main plot. Interesting that little animals are still running around in the middle of this eco-disaster. So the rebels need to concoct a dangerous and elaborate ruse to kill off one of their own that could all too easily have killed the precious child just to later use the child as some kind of political rallying point?!? No one buys that illogic, except as an excuse for a very long camera take. And oh yeah, lets parade the baby past 100 armed soldiers who are just too dazzled to, lets say, grab all involved?

It is easy to believe that grotty, disintegrating world it shows is just how it will be, and the few futuristic gadgets around are all the more convincing because of the otherwise mundane and grungy setting. Despite the dismal greyness of this world, the film still has a strange sort of visual beauty, and there is an energy and fluidity in the images that are presented.<br/><br/>However when it comes to small details like, acting, dialogue and narrative, everything falls apart. The script is cringe-makingly bad in places - hard to believe it was written by an native English-speaker. Acting is fairly wooden - although there is some warmth and interest in the central relationship between ""Theo"" and ""Kee"".

There is little sense of jeopardy here; at one point a character turns up shot, but it doesn't seem integral to the story.

","Children of Men is about a future in which the human race has lost the ability to reproduce and beyond that doesn't develop any further.

The semi-orewllian future is well realized and believable but there is no reason given to why the world has fallen into chaos. A young woman, Kee, is secretly pregnant and people are trying to use her for unknown political reasons. Basically this is where the whole plot comes apart. The movie becomes an action movie and escape from the omnipresent bad guys and that's it.<br/><br/>Kee, the pregnant woman, might as well just be cargo that needs to be transported. Even her being called Kee sort of cheapens the plot - Kee as in she is the key to the future. There is no reason for why she was so special to get pregnant or what might have changed that allowed her to do so. There is also no profound idea given in that maybe what's special about her is that she isn't special at all. The movie can't manage to say anything.<br/><br/>This is an action movie that is a blank. Just action with a good premise that is never realized. The movie says nothing and doesn't have much of a plot other than random action scenes in which Clive Owen is transporting his cargo. The visuals do make it entertaining but that's it. I think the premise of the movie and the visuals of a bleak future are a smokescreen for a plot and a message and the only reason why anyone actually thinks this movie is good.

My feeling was that the summary provided by ""On Demand"" constituted most of the story, with each point separated by various large and enjoyable action packed scenes.<br/><br/>I gave this a six, which in my view was generous.

There's lots of chasing, people running and shouting, and I suppose that adds up to gripping entertainment for some viewers, but I'm being generous by giving this turkey a rating of 5 stars."

","CHILDREN OF MEN – CATCH IT ( C- ) Children for Men, Well I've been hearing about it since its been released. So, from last 4 yrs I thought I'll watch it but because of Clive Owen I was not interested at all. Well to be honest I don't like him at all, he has always disappointed me in every movie except for CLOSER! Let's talk about movie now, well it's a good attempt but it's not a classic as most of the critics and people suggest. The movie had its moments but I though everything was happening so fast that at one point it seems like too much. 1st Julianne Moore dies, 2nd then the people KEE is living with from months are evil, 3rd Michael Cain powerful security system villains finds in one night which looked like they all living in the same area, 4th out of the blue Mariam gets taken away and get killed obviously, 5th the whole villains gang enter into the refuge camp with full own guns, how even did they pass the security?, 6th in the end the whole army cease fire and gaze at the baby and then suddenly start fighting again and no-one report or try to snatch the baby out from them. Now that was just unbelievable. 7th Clive Dies thanks GOD and 8th we even don't know for sure weather people Kee is going to are even good or not. Anyways it's my Opinion. Clive Owen is like as always fed of his life, this time he actually had the reason to be Julianne Moore is delight as always. Clare-Hope Ashitey was a disappointment; I didn't felt her emotions at all. Overall catch it for its grittiness, the time flies by at least it doesn't let you bore!"

","There is nothing worth saying about this movie except don't watch it. If you are looking for a somewhat political sci-fi movie set in the future rent Brazil. Brazil is a GREAT movie. Children of Men is a TERRIBLE movie. Hope that comparison helps somehow.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being a bit hard on this film. I mean it would have been good if they had just included things like a plot, the slightest bit of cleverness/irony/thought in their political references, or even just something a little bit more entertaining than an old hippie hooked on strawberry cough weed. They should have just thrown in a good knock knock joke somewhere so we could of at least had a giggle, although I suppose coming up with a knock knock joke would have required 3 to 4 times the amount of thought that went in to making this entire film.<br/><br/>No, I'm not being hard on it. The movie sucked."

","If ""Children of Men"" has got something really good, that would be the verisimilitude with which the near future is painted. The apocalyptic atmosphere, the desolated and helpless crowd and destroyed terrains, make up for a good aura on the film: the woods whisper mysteriously and the towns for refugees are grim and violent.<br/><br/>But that's about all. The movie will start as a puzzle with many questions unanswered. As some are revealed, other questions are placed. There is a feeling of an incomplete process, of an ongoing question mark. The points that explain their constant running from the government are feeble and unconvincing, so ¿why are they running? ¿Why not go to the government? Clive Owen is ungestured as a statue, bringing no lighting features to the acting skills. Was it that the goal he was trying to reach, he fails to communicate his sentiments all the same. Michael Caine is the only bright star, shining on it's lateral role.<br/><br/>Besides, we have to stand a far too prideful and patriotic script, making England the best and an unique power. It also is filled with political insinuations that at no point hit the viewer, nor interest him. Movies don't need that kind of subdued messages. It's attack to the immigrant policies, to the police corps is uninteresting and biased. The book is responsible yes, but they could well have cleaned that off. Who really cares about those ""hidden"" critics to the system? <br/><br/>All technical aspects are flawless. But the story is twisted and, too dynamic loosing the string to trap the viewer. Some shooting scenes are vivid, with steadicams vibrating and sound really scratching your walls. But, besides that, there is little to expect and pretty much nothing to ground for with ""Children of Men"". It's nice to have a good time, but you will see that behind that curtain of dynamite scenes and political innuendos, you are left with...nothing much. Nothing that would make the movie worth of being classical nor great, just a spur of the moment."
"he_who_leads","6","12","19","17 June 2007"," It Had Potential to be More About Ideas
","The year is 2027 and no one has had a kid since 2009. Consequently, the human race is doomed. Emotions are running high and everywhere the world is falling apart. Conflict, despair, chaos and decay are everywhere. The premise is introduced very well as everywhere people are mourning the death of the world's youngest person - watching the future disappear before their eyes.<br/><br/>This film does convey the look and feel of the above quite well through credible character exchanges and technical work. However, the film's potential is hampered by the story - Theo (Clive Owen) trying to secretly transport a miraculously pregnant woman to the shadowy 'The Human Project,' who they have to trust have her best interests at heart as opposed to the openly brutal and corrupt government. Because all of this has to be hidden from the public's eye, the film's potential to explore this extraordinary development is limited to speculation by the small band of people who come to know that the girl is pregnant. So while the decaying world is continually depicted credibly, the film can't really grow and thematically build on its premise.<br/><br/>So the film mainly becomes a chase film - trying to transport the girl somewhere while avoiding detection from all sides. This takes away from the uniqueness of the premise and makes the film seem more routine than it should have been. I have to say, though, that the last 30 minutes is quite thrilling as the stakes have been raised so much. The camera following the progress of Theo through the torn-up streets as bullets fly everywhere is a gripping. But for those who want to see this film with the purpose of having grand philosophical discussions afterwards, you'll probably come out disappointed. The film does have things to say, but could have been more. <br/><br/>Finally, a couple of things deserve a special mention. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is just outstanding as he throws everything in the book at you - constantly inventive camera work, smoke, light, shade, saturation - so that many of the scenes you just want to frame on your wall. Also, a recurring musical theme from John Tavener's 'Fragments of a Prayer' is also very memorable and fits well."
"flame2ie","2","12","19","16 May 2007"," What is all the fuss about?
","I had waited a long while to catch this movie on DVD hoping that the hype surrounding it would die down enough for me to enjoy it. However I was constantly bombarded with comments from friends and even the video store clerk, that this movie was 'greaaaatt'. OK I said I'll see for myself.<br/><br/>Firstly the acting is absolutely awful and isn't really helped by a poor script with shoddy, cringe-worthy dialogue 'ohhhhh I forgot how beautiful babies were'...oh please. Clive Owen looks lost, he's got his next movie on his mind, either that or he's thinking about a holiday on the Med. I never related to one single character in the movie and couldn't care less whether they lived or died. That said there were numerous pointless deaths.<br/><br/>The dystopian future that is created is so hackneyed it's laughable. Kids throwing rocks at the train, that stuff already happens where I'm from, it's not particularly frightening. Graffiti, jackbooted thugs, small fires, people speaking in foreign tongues, sorry have I not seen all this before somewhere.<br/><br/>The plot or lack of it is probably the most fundamental problem. We drift from one scene to another with not much happening, we are given no credible back-story to get us interested. When Cuaron realizes he has a kipper on his hands he ups the pace a bit in the final few scenes, but unfortunately he goes too far and it ends up almost like a video game.<br/><br/>Finally numerous colleague's commented on how well it looks, mainly in reference to the cinematography. Sorry people, have ye been locked away in a closet for the last ten years. Lubezki is just trotting out the 'style de jour', there is nothing original in any of the cinematography. I have seen this style handled better by the likes of Kaminski in Private Ryan and Idziak in Black Hawk Down. In both these movies the DPs had to tackle the style on a grand scale, there is nothing like this in Children of Men. The scenes in the farmhouse are particularly weak and look out of place with the rest of the film. Too much reliance on practical sources made this overall quite a flat film, a muddy grey sludge of a palette, where there is no depth separation."

","This is my kind of genre and I love Owen and many of the other actors in this movie, so to watch them read poor dialogue like this and act un-actable scenes was painful. It's really that distracting.<br/><br/>Fortunately a bleak and interesting future makes for some face saving action scenes that are very tense. It must be warned however what passes for the future here is a mishmash of current affairs issues taken to the extreme. There is no insight, no real imagination here either, it's all as if they grabbed someone of the street and asked them what they thought the future would be like.<br/><br/>If you can get past the hammy acting, dialogue and concentrate on the more interesting scary aspects of this future world, I'd like to say you'll find a great story. But you won't. I don't ask for messages in my films, but there was no insight into anything here. Not the characters, not the idea behind it, no story metaphor (although plenty of heavy handed visual metaphor).<br/><br/>As for a thinking persons action movie, sort of an insult to thinking people really. I know a lot of popcorn movie goers who'd be just as happy to see this, though it is a fair bit more interesting than your average Saturday night flick.<br/><br/>To sum up, it should have been a thinking persons movie, and if the dialogue was better it would help. Even so, the story is so flawed, it's like you know something good is there but, it's been in such a horrendous car wreck you barely make it out. What a real pity, but thank god for the cinematographer!"

","PD James's future-nightmare novel of a world without children has been turned into an explosively violent and chillingly real movie, probably the best film in the Venice festival competition so far. It is directed by Alfonso Cuarón and brilliantly filmed in hard, flat, crisp detail by his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. The digitally realised vision of a reactionary, Orwellian Britain in 2027, with its seedy streetscapes periodically smashed by terrorist bombs, is eerily convincing, and the spectacular sequences of all-out urban warfare are electrifying and very scary.There are great cameos, chiefly one from Michael Caine as an ageing hippy who grows ganja in a secret woodland hideout and hooks Theo up with a counter-cultural support network.Peter Mullan puts in a bravura appearance as Syd, a border guard and one of Caine's weed clientele, who is able to smuggle them away from both the authorities and the terrorists. It's a smart and funny performance from the multi-talented Mullan, and it would incidentally be good to see him direct another film, as his last one, The Magdalene Sisters, won the Golden Lion here at Venice in 2002.Apart from everything else, this is a great action film, with thrilling and nail-biting moments that are all the more gripping for taking place in a ruined future world, which looks all too plausible. Added to this is Cuarón's subtle dimension of metaphor and parable: it is humankind's spiritual sterility and vanity which has made possible their catastrophic despoiling of the planet. This is quite an achievement for Cuarón, who must surely be a contender for the big prize."

The Department of Homeland Security has ordered a militarised Police Force to detain all illegal immigrants and hold them in a fortified and barb-wired compound .

Children of Men follows and restore faith for a future beyond those presently on Earth .

There no children , no future , no hope. <br/><br/>Exciting rendition that picks up every mote of bleak despair P.D. James's novel of a totalitarian future society in which a man whose daily work is rewriting history tries to help a pregnant young ; though in the movie, the infertility crisis is the result of all women being infertile and in the original novel , it's the result of all men producing no sperm . This interesting retelling describes an eerie future in frenetic Cinema Vérite' style , pointed ideological concerns and gripping familiarity . A hard , explosive , paranoid time when England is the only surviving nation and fertility crisis means no babies have been born for 18 years old , being well set in and around a dystopian London fractious with violence and warring nationalistic sects . Dystopian polemic story which contain a sour denounce to totalitarianism , gilded with some cheeky as well as unobtrusive social commentary . Thought-provoking and thoughtful script by Paul Chart who wrote the first version but it was re-written a few times by other screenwriters including Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Timothy J. Sexton and director Alfonso Cuarón himself ; finally the final version was written by David Arata, Cuarón and Sexton . Clive Owen's insights greatly impressed Cuarón and he contributed a great deal of uncredited work to the final script . ""Children of men"" is a workmanlike rendition of notorious novel that captures the desolation and misery found within those pages , though some liberties have been taken with the script . Nice acting by Clive Owen as a man man who holds the unexpected discovery of a lone pregnant woman and the desperate journey to deliver her to safety . Very good support cast such as Michael Caine , Pam Ferris , Chiwetel Ejiofor , Charlie Hunnam , Danny Huston , Julianne Moore and cameo by P.D. James: author of the book 'The Children of Men' plays the old woman in the cafeteria with Theo .<br/><br/>Colorful and evocative cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki , Alfonso Cuaron's ordinary . Atmospheric as well as imaginative musical score by John Tavener , including wonderful songs . The motion picture was well directed by ever versatile Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama También , Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban , Gravity) who carries out an efficient and energetic take on . Cuaron said in one interview that he wanted to shoot this film like La Battle of Argiels (1966) rather than Blade Runner (1982), almost like a documentary about something that happened back in 2027 . Here director Cuaron also uses his customary trademarks , as he utilizes long continuous and digitally blended shots . Rating : Above average . Worthwhile watching ."

The purpose was never explained.<br/><br/>Acting was average and the movie features a few novel cinematographic tweaks, which saves it from being totally bereft of watchability.

","Why is this movie so loved? Do people not give a crap about character? This is one of the few films that was so unengaging, my entire group agreed to quit before we got halfway through. You can say we ""lost hope"" that it would be good at anything.<br/><br/>The premise has one of the laziest executions I've seen in sci-fi. The entire human race has become infertile. Why? Because of a virus? Chemicals in our water? Divine intervention? Never explained. Its a mystery to the human race, and not a single line points to a possible answer. Nor is there any reason given to the lone exception. Nor do we understand why the world has gone to Hell because of this issue. Why should we believe that, without a next generation, all nations but Nazi Britain will break apart? The film doesn't provide answers there, either. Even bad sci-fi films at least try. Off the top of my head, this is the worst sci-fi film in terms of world building, which made it difficult to get immersed.<br/><br/>Equally bad is its characters. They're so drab in personality, I'd struggle to call them stock. Not a single one was interesting, and I couldn't care about any of their fates. Combined with a bare-bones setting, none of the themes take off for me.<br/><br/>I never finished this film. But after reading the plot synopsis, I'm glad I didn't. It just changes from a dull dystopia film to a dull action film. I've seen clips from these scenes - and while they are well-shot, they mean nothing without context. Both sides turn out to be bad, but why should I care? Neither side interested me in the first place.<br/><br/>Some people may like this. But you won't be hearing recommendations from me."

It had good actors and seemed to have a great story line! Where could I go wrong? Oh, and it has Sigur Ros playing on the trailer!! Boy, was I wrong! From the very beginning you're just throwin into a chaotic jungle of craziness. You find out that the world hasn't had a new born in a long while (of course, it never explains why) and (of course, you find THAT out in the trailer itself)....<br/><br/>I very excited to see Julian Moore in the cast, but she dies within the first 20 minutes of the movie and doesn't serve any purpose to the story line. Well, she does throw a pregnate lady at the main character (whom I guess is the main character?) and then dies shortly after (apparently they have some past romantic life with him, but who cares??? SHE DIES). There are a whole bunch of other ""terrorist"" that help her out, but it never explains their roles either.<br/><br/>There are also these people that are also trying to help the baby out, but it doesn't explain their role either. Why are they helping? Who knows! Why can't they tell anybody else? Who knows! The main character played by Clive Owen doesn't even know why he's helping out this girl, except for the fact that she has the last born baby....but, why does he care? It's not going to save his life? But apparently, Julian Moore told him so! Umm, what else? So, there's this really crazy, hippie dude that is friends with Clive Owen...we don't' know their history together, but the audience only knows that their friends. I had no emotional attachment to the guy, but of course..he dies...and I guess it was kinda sad to see an old man die.<br/><br/>So, here's basically the story line.<br/><br/>A girl who's pregnant runs around England with Clive Owen (with some random lady with crazy hair *not sure why she's there either*). There world is out of wack and England has a Nazi-like regime. There's a thing called the Human Project, and it apparently saves babies. There's a crazy lady at the ending who helps put Clive and the baby's mama in a crappy boat. And Clive dies at the end...with a horrible open ending (probably one of the worse open endings i've ever seen)....<br/><br/>I never write about movies, but I felt strong enough to let the world now I disappointed I am.

First,the acting was pedestrian. Second, the film had no character development. Third, the music was so out of step with anything that it defies description. Fourth, the attempt to use guttural English made much of the dialogue difficult to understand. Fifth, there was no plot development beyond a rambling incoherent odyssey from one improbable scene to the next.

She too is a wasted talent in a film that does not benefit from the display of military might. Michael Caine emulates a typical 1960's aging hippie with flowing gray hair.

Children Of Men may have an interesting story that is smart and intelligent but a movie's purpose is to tell that story in an interesting way and Children Of Men doesn't not deliver good ""film"" qualities. Whether or not they were going for a Blair Witch feel the movie is filmed like a one camera sitcom or documentary with brutal shaking and extremely bad and unappealing visuals. Despite that, i'm sure they intended for this to add to the realism it does but you know what? real life is and looks boring that's why people watch movies. The flaws in the film technique keep you from concentrating on the plot which is complex and requires thought and attention but the sheer boredom of the movie keeps the mind uninterested and antsy. Clearly i'm alone here due to the enormously great reviews this film has gotten so bear in mind this is just my opinion for all i know you could love the film but hey that's what the internet is for free expression right??? It's just so difficult to get into this film because it doesn't even really catch your attention nor does it hold your attention but turns into one of those movies you impatiently and angrily await to end so you can know the plot's resolution obviously that means Children Of Men has great storytelling. If the only thing keeping you from shutting this off or walking out of the theater than you know the writers have done their job and it's the production team that has screwed things up. The acting is so so i generally enjoy Clive Owen but he seems less emotionless than usual which doesn't work when he isn't playing a bad@$$ action hero. Julianne Moore is great as usual but doesn't end up saving the film. The acting is really not bad at all Naomie Harris is awesome it's just the way it's shot, the pacing, the character development, everything is just so slow and so bland.

The story put a big question in front of the audience that never successfully addressed, the central theme that was screaming at me was ""where did this fertility crisis come from?"" Their treatment of that question was superficial, cursory and completely unsatisfying. This could have been a great film if they'd found a good way to answer that question. But they didn't even try.

As many before me I suspect that there were trolls here (studio paid reviewers, family members) who extolled the virtues of this amateurishly made and poorly produced flicker. Simplistic plot, bad cinematography, superficiality of acting, or voice cast, implausibility of details (Clive Owen getting to and hijacking a car at the farm under the nose of the guards, etc.). A movie made on the cheap. I am SO disappointed. A friend of mine - she actually liked it, but my sophisticated family members and savvy movie goers did not. I know whom to trust in the future."

","Children of Men is a truly fantastic film, which has ingredients for everyone - action, romance, gore, tension, wit and political meaning. All given enough space to satisfy, but also enough breadth that they can be ignored if you're not into it. As a piece of cinema it is a well shot, reasonably well directed movie, with a few scenes that are outstanding enough to merit awards in themselves. The acting wasn't anything to shout about, but neither was it anything to complain about either. The story, coupled together with fantastic political symbolism and many many influences from other films and news footage paints a scary, depressing and stark warning about the future we are being forced towards. Don't believe the holocaust could happen again? Watch this film! I was really disappointed to read other reviews on IMDb, which said that it didn't explain everything (god forbid a film leaves something for us to ponder on our own!) and even more disappointed to see the review that said that the key actors were killed off early...this film is so not about actors. Some complained the film was depressing - but it is so nice to see a film that doesn't have the Hollywood happy ending. My only explanation for these reviews is a misunderstanding, perpetuated by the person sitting behind me in the cinema who said to their friend: ""What exactly is a fascist anyway?"" . I hope a lot of young people go and see this film and feel motivated to make a change...I'd hate for any part of this wonderful and amazing fiction to become a reality!"

Ruby Tuesday song sucked. Bad editing and an utterly pointless moment at the end when unexpectedly ""CHILDREN OF MEN"" is emblazoned on the screen. It worked for Gangs of New York, but not this turkey. I got all fidgety desperately wanting the movie to end... crappy dialog and super-bad acting with this cast of nobodies... If I was the executive in charge of green-lighting this project, I would have quietly set the finished product ablaze - or sent it directly to DVD.<br/><br/>Good lord, avoid this at all costs."

","I had high hopes going into a screening of this film after seeing the trailer on the television and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The story is simple, the scenery is beautiful and the direction is executed perfectly.<br/><br/>The whole world has gone infertile and mankind is on the brink of extinction, but one lone pregnant woman holds the key to the world's problem, in her young belly. 'Theo' (Clive Owen) is dragged into the 'mission' by his ex-wife Julianne Moore and must battle enemies from both sides of the fence if 'Kee' (Claire-Hope Ashitey) is to give birth to the first child in 18 years.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuarón directs this film beautifully, at times it felt as if I was watching the cinematic beauty of nature evolve from heaven to the hellish land of industrialism as every detail, angle and shot was done down to a tee. Instead of opting for a 'Hollywood' stance or trying something new/inventive, Cuarón uses the surroundings and the people he works with instead to the visual beauty of a film which must be an Oscar contender. He also created a beautiful, yet believable futuristic vision of the world marred by immigration problems and more enclosed-topia than utopia.<br/><br/>Clive Owen has given the Oscar selectors a little prod in the back with a magnificent performance in this film, he plays 'Theo', a depressed worker of society who is horrified by the violence he witnesses day and day out, yet his character transforms throughout the film leading to a newer, more refreshed 'Theo' who has taken over from Julianne Moore (Julian) as the lead protagonist in the film. He is also backed up with some superb supporting acting from Julianne Moore (Julian), Michael Caine (Jasper) as the laid-back futuristic 'hippy' of the modern world and Claire-Hope Ashitey (Kee), a young actress who has taken to such a large role with so much professionalism and enthusiasm that you think she'd been acting for years.<br/><br/>The film itself contains a large amount of action and aggression as it shows the repression of immigrants looking for new life in Britain and the way the masses are dealt with reminds the viewer of totalitarian regimes such as Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia, however the action is portrayed brilliant, at times with just the sound of rapid gun fire in the background to intimidate and give the viewer a sense and perspective of the location in which the characters currently stand. The 'Coup D'Etat' scene shows the masses rising up against the elitist minority and gives the viewer a large sense of satisfaction; however this is culled quite quickly with the bleak and up-close killing taking place of those who are both guilty and innocent.<br/><br/>I went into this film with high expectations and came out wondering what would challenge it for the 'Best Oscar' gong next year. Alfonso Cuaron's directing is hard-hitting, beautiful, bleak and brilliant. Clive Owen steals the show with his emotional rise to the protagonist of the world and the supporting actors just build upon his performance and the film as a whole.<br/><br/>9/10. Definitely one of the films of 2006.<br/><br/>Written by Jordan Winter."

There is no desire to sympathize with the characters, and the idea that the whole world has gone to hell with the exception of Great Britain is implausible. Amazing that Julian's terrorist group magically appeared at both Michael Caine's home as well as the obscure refugee camp at the end... How would they be able to know about either place? Caine gave no information before they executed him, yet there they were at the conclusion of the film.<br/><br/>Imagine the ""Wizard of Oz"" stopping before Dorothy ever meets the wizard.

","I could see it was a professionally crafted movie with high production values and with a good Directing effort, and it's always a pleasure to see Michael Caine and Julianne Moore. But the premise just didn't work for me. If you love senseless, extreme violence with no cogent motive for the protagonists, this movie is for you. I kept saying out loud, ""why are they killing each other? Did I miss something?"" Let me get this straight, massive civil unrest and armed revolt occurs and the government and the people go on killing sprees because women cannot get pregnant. People attacking in groups like zombies and everybody turning into cold blooded murderers. Killing each other for no reason and swarming strangers like the infected in 28 days later. Why was that mob of people in the country chasing their car and shooting at them? They didn't explain that, they explain nothing. The military and police treating the population like Jews in Nazi Germany. Their alluding to the Nazi thing was anything but subtle. They even huddled the common people into a Ghetto! For what reason? Why were the military treating so harshly the innocent civilians in the train station? Yet another thing that remained unexplained. It's one of those movies in which they refuse to explain anything. They'll hook you, keep you watching to see if they will explain what is happening. But they never do and it's a tease with out reward. The same type of thing they did with the Phantasm movies. A lot of weirdness, and you're expected to invent your own explanations. Like an old plot method installed by a recent graduate of film school. This is England, but there is an Army of militant armed Muslims marching in the street, yelling Allahu Akbhar. Mega-weird. Why was that scene in the movie, and what was it supposed to add to the story? And why are half the English people Arabs? I think it was representative of the Director's challenge here. Keeping things moving along quickly with constant tension, weird scenes, and dramatic scenes of suffering and brutality. He has to keep it moving fast (The main characters never stop moving. They're always in flight and being pursued) so the viewers won't think about the absurdity of the premise or try to figure out the many absurd things in the movie. Not the infertility thing being absurd. But how society reacted to it. I think the reverse would happen from this premise. People would be humbled, sensing God's judgment, and society would become more peaceful in a reflective age of waiting for the extinction of mankind. They'd blame God and then blame each other and then blame themselves and then pursue redemption. It would be a multi-step process to acceptance such as people have with grief. People wouldn't kill each other wholesale, go berserk or burn down cities just because all women became barren. I don't think the author really understood the human race. I suspect the author wrote this book or story at a young age."

How could the human race exist for even ten minutes without children? For instance, would do all the sweatshop labor all over the world that keeps things rolling? And don't you think the population would be fairly well freaked out into a total frenzy instead of blithely going about their daily routines, going to dog races, etc?? This is like those dumb sci-fi flicks of the past where Imminent Doom is upon the planet and the populace patiently goes about their normal business while waiting for the fearless leaders to Save The Day. Give me a break! In addition, I was annoyed that the big name actors were so ill-used. Moore and Caine were little more than cameo props. And why did Julianne Moore's character have to be offed so soon? To save $ for all those ""exciting"" chase scenes?

Why? it is a timid attempt to say something strong. it has ideas we have seen before which were done much better. the film's script relies on confusing loopholes and contrived plot lines. the war scenes are very unbelievable to me and the amount of 'luck' which Clive Owen's character has makes him seem like an unbelievable cat with 9 lives. very unnatural and unbelievable film. and without giving away too much information for the poor people who do want to endure this film, i will pose only one question out of many which bother me about this movie. Why? Why? can all of the animals in this film reproduce, however, for some strange odd reason the women can not? birds, dogs, livestock, fish, etc etc etc are having no problems (evidently from the sight of them all) reproducing, however, there is no human life being born for 18 years? questions like that are not even attempted to be answered in this movie because no thought was ever put into the script. this movie represents the mess which the year 2006 has left us all with. i hope we can move on and realize what a shallow attempt this movie really was, in a shallow, miserable year."
"mstomaso","9","18","32","3 June 2007"," Can an infant's voice hold back a world at war with itself?
","Bottom-line at the top: If you are an ultra-right wing retrogressive this film will probably anger you. Avoid it, and don't bother reading my review. <br/><br/>Set in mid-21st-century London, Children of Men is a cyber-punk dystopian nightmare which extrapolates from the worst of contemporary political trends to a bleak future where people have stopped procreating and totalitarian militaristic governments have obliterated civil society, closed national borders, and branded everybody expressing dissatisfaction 'terrorist'. And the 'terrorists' themselves are no better.<br/><br/>Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is a disheartened ex-activist and the love of his life - Julian (Julianne Moore) - has just resurfaced asking him for a very big favor. Julian is the leader of a quasi-terrorist organization which wants to reopen Great Britain's borders, and they are trying to help an illegal immigrant who is about to give birth to the first infant the earth has seen in about twenty years to escape to a safe location. Or so it appears at first.<br/><br/>Owen gives the best performance I have seen out of him. Michael Caine lends excellent support (and is particularly well cast in his role). Moore, always good, meets her own very high standards with ease. This is my first film experience with Claire-Hope Ashitey - who is as much the star of this film as Owen. All I can say about Miss Ashitey is ""bravo!"" - spectacular job with a tough role.<br/><br/>Contrary to many of the comments I have read concerning Children of Men, the film is definitely not low-budget. Seventy-two million dollars is no shoe-string budget, and one does not hire Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine without a decent budget. What's remarkable about allocation of financial resources for this film, however, is how invisible the budget is (besides the expensive cast). The special effects are so well done that they achieve subtlety and are almost unnoticeable - very rare in contemporary sci-fi.<br/><br/>Cuaron's direction is equally invisible, and flawless. Without resorting to shaky-cam clichés and intentionally degraded cinematography, he achieves a documentary feel - but only when he needs it. The sets are perfect, as is the lighting and camera-work. The cinematography creates more than just mood - it embellishes a completely immersive and quite disturbing context for the entire film. Dark, dirty and degraded, Cuaron creates a world where hope survives only despite life itself, and only in a few. Whether you interpret human infertility as a wake-up call from God or a natural evolutionary process is your own muddle - don't bother spreading it, the result is much the same.<br/><br/>This is a heavy film, but does not present its subject in a heavy-handed manner. What is disturbing about it is how easy it is, given the state of the world's politics and the expert craftsmanship of the film, to believe. The connection between the world of today and that of the film is made particularly clear by the set shots in Jasper Palmer's (Michael Caine) house. Palmer, a former journalist who has exiled himself from 'civilization', has newspaper clippings all over his walls which decry the invasion of Iraq and several yet-to-happen humanitarian catastrophes. Sure, none of what this movie predicts is likely to happen but what's frightening is how possible it actually seems. <br/><br/>Highly recommended for open-minded, thinking people."

To my astonishment, there was no beginning or ending to the movie and most of the time we were lost, trying to understand what in the nine hells are we watching.<br/><br/>The movie contains long, tiring scenes of NOTHING, including the famous 30 second slippers shot, which summarizes the whole nothingness thats in the movie. The only good thing in that film was the camera directing at the whole battle scene, which made it look like some kind of a video game, like Call of Duty or Medal of Honor, that makes you experience the war from a 1st person view.<br/><br/>Other than that, there's really nothing to say about the movie, since it didn't really began or end. There's no point or essence to the story line and you spend 100 minutes or your time watching a man that has no clue (like yourself) of whats happening around him and does nothing to get a better understanding of that.<br/><br/>How come there wasn't any logical or real explanation to the whole ""Ban immigrants"" or ""no fertility"" issues that are the main subjects of the film?!

Julianne Moore is my favorite actress but after this and Freedomland I'll be a little more wise when it comes to seeing a movie just because she's in it.

","I was lukewarm about the book, but the film is atrocious. The Mexican director has thrown away almost everything that was good about the book - mostly the first part - and retained just the concept and the names of the characters, and written his own left-wing political thriller about illegal immigrants and Guantanamo Bay. He has produced a trivial shoot 'em up, noisy, foul-mouthed story with poor continuity. If you want to hear the dialogue, turn the sub-titles on, but if you don't, you will hardly have missed anything. I looked in vain for how people would really react to a world without children. Where was the use as pets as substitutes? Where were the deserted playgrounds? Instead of ennui from Clive Owen, all we got was a colossal sulk. Too little was made of the idea of Quietus. I can understand how a movie like this fits with the current tribe of critics, armchair revolutionaries to a man, but PD James is a Church of England old lady, regretting the passing of pleasure and deserves better than this."
"Jeeves_Albright","1","17","30","11 May 2007"," Much ado about little
","Praise aplenty for Children of Men, yet even after a second viewing I still totally fail to see why.<br/><br/>The movie starts out well with depicting a world in chaos due to humanity seemingly being punished by being unable to procreate and no signs of handling this predicament well. England seems to cope relatively amply with the situation but is plagued by revolt against the fascist way the government maintains some form of order. Think refugee. This background should be enough for a compelling story to develop.<br/><br/>But between the uninspired dialog, which is basically plot driven, and the poor character development there is also very little story- and or plot development. With an overly use of the hand-held camera style the movie quickly turns into a chase the rabbit style of film with a lot of muddled action sequences which reminded me of first person-shoot-m-up's. Scattered throughout the bleak set pieces there are less than subtle comments on the world we live in today, presented to the viewer in a blunt tabloid style. They make absolutely no sense as to being in this chase/action movie.<br/><br/>This film simply lacks a heart and consistency in what it was meant to be. As a social drama it lacks character depth and a less obvious script. As a science fiction movie, it lacks science fiction. As a thriller it plods too much and again some character depth would have been nice for I truly couldn't care less for any of the characters.<br/><br/>I can only recommend this movie for some impressive editing of some of the action sequences near the end and parts of the cinematography. Beyond this, I'm still baffled at the praise this poorly scripted movie with its shallow messages, dramatic clichés and average acting has received."
"bob the moo","Null","16","28","30 April 2007"," Engaging and exciting sci-fi that is interesting and technically impressive in its delivery
","It is the year 2027. For some reason mankind has gradually ceased being able to reproduce, with the last human born being ""baby"" Diego in 2009. When he is murdered in a brutal attack it stuns the world, only further sapping the hope in a world where the aging population has given up, economies have collapsed, terrorism is rife and Governments are focused on control rather than improving anything for anyone. In the middle of this former activist Theo is approached to help transport a woman across checkpoints to the coast where the mysterious ""human project"" is working to save mankind.<br/><br/>Interesting to look back on some groups of films and see what they tell us about the times they were made in. The sci-fi's of the 1950's point to an external threat that is different from us and must be feared an conquered for example. It will be interesting to look back on Children of Men and other recent sci-fis such as V for Vendetta because already they seem so attuned with the world we now live in. Children of Men jumps just into the future to a world crumbling with no real hope for anyone other than those clinging to what little privilege power offers them. This is the strength of the film as it builds a futuristic world that is so palatable  remote from our own but yet so easy to believe. There are problems with the narrative in regards pitching it to a mass audience though. Many (including myself at times) will struggle with not understanding and knowing everything about this world.<br/><br/>This did bother me at times but mostly the central story was exciting and interesting enough to engage  so what if the story doesn't fill in the whole history of where we are now, or if the film finishes where it does rather than giving us a firm conclusion? That is not the nature of the story and it is part of the telling. For something so downbeat and with these open aspects, the film does a great job of gripping. The background detail of this future makes for a strong foundation for Theo and Kee to move through, producing some interesting plot points but also a surprising amount of action. The ambush on Julian's car is exciting but it doesn't compare to the final scenes where Theo attempts to rescue Kee; not only is that scene gripping but it is technically very impressive as it is delivered in long, complex takes where you feel you get no respite. The script is not perfect though and some of it is clunky and not as intelligent as it thinks it is (lest we forget that this is script that calls the character holding the future of mankind ""Kee"") but mostly it is very strong.<br/><br/>Owen holds the film together with a central character that is hardly off the screen but yet we never tire of him. There are a lot of stars alongside him but he owns the film by far. Moore has a small turn that is effective albeit more because of her surprise fate rather than her amazing turn. Caine is amusing but is wisely kept to the sidelines while Ejiofor, Mullan, Huston and others all fill in the smaller characters. Ashitey is OK but not as strong as I would have liked; she didn't convince me in her skin and it was too easy to see her character as a plot device rather than a character. As director, Cuarón delivers the goods with an impressive group effort that makes this future so convincing and gritty. The sets are well done and London etc locations are subverted just in the right way to keep them real as well as different. Lubezki's cinematography is impressive throughout and personally, having seen both now, I think he should have had the Oscar that instead went to Pan's Labyrinth.<br/><br/>Overall an intelligent and interest sci-fi that says a lot about the times we live now in how it views the future. Despite some issues with the script and total pot, the film is engaging and exciting, producing a credible and depressing future-view but also being a technically impressive film in regards the design and delivery."

There's no explanation of why the miraculously pregnant woman must reach something called the 'Human Project'. There's no explanation of why, at this time, the activists are trying to stage an uprising.

The hero fights to transport the pregnant woman to a boat whilst being hunted by both government forces and the would-be revolutionaries; he succeeds but at the cost of his own life and those of his friends. The first half of the film plods along whilst it puts a few plot devices in place. The second is faster paced and generates a modicum of tension. However, at the end you are left thinking ""what was all that for and what happened next?"".<br/><br/>It's almost as if somebody scripted a great story about a dystopian future and somebody else was briefed to strip all the interesting stuff away and leave a fairly brainless 'damsel in distress' film in its place. What results is a poor, poor effort."

","Now, to be fair, this movie deserves a 6, but I feel I have to downgrade to 3 to offset the 85% of the viewers who don't seem to realize it only deserves a 6 or less, not a 7.9. Yes, the visuals and action and scariness are not bad, and the movie could easily be a 9 based on that if it had a plot. But the plot fails so spectacularly that is is painful, yes painful, to even reflect on it in any detail. It just makes no sense, cannot withstand even the teensiest probing. Nothing any character does follows from anything. Nothing about the society holds together. The only thing that lets me get to sleep at night is the comforting thought that the screenwriters didn't care whether any element of the story made any sense, they were only looking for visual appeal. The movie can only be enjoyed by non-English speakers (without subtitles), and those who are immune to thinking."

"sol-grazi","4","8","12","15 April 2007"," As a story, it is a promise unfulfilled...abridged review
","As a movie, director Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men is state-of-the-art. It has incredible action, sound and visual effects. The acting is believable and compelling. However, as a story, it is a promise unfulfilled. It starts with a premise pregnant with questions, implications and possibilities. They are left unasked and unanswered.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Theo ( Clive Owen) who is contacted by his ex wife and former fellow activist, Julian (Julianne Moore). As a leader of Fish, a terrorist organization, she has a special project for him- to smuggle the only pregnant woman in England, a black immigrant named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to the coast. They must take a perilous trek across the countryside, avoiding the police and the terrorists. It is a trip which gives the audience a slice of this dark land and era, purportedly the best the world presently has to offer.<br/><br/>Upon reaching the coast, Kee will be picked up by a clandestine ship sponsored by a mythical organization called the Human Project. It appears that all of humanity's hopes lie with this child. The Human Project, about which no one appears to know the truth- even of its very existence- becomes the Holy Grail for the few honest brokers in this morass. When it appears that they are safe (mother and child are the only ones to get there), the movie ends with the promise fulfilled.<br/><br/>For some inexplicable reason, only humans became infertile. There was no plague, no nuclear explosion, no increase in the ozone- it just happened. This is an event of Biblical proportions, like the Death of the First Born. How can science explain a disease or event that singles out only humans, and all over the world simultaneously, not spreading to reveal some epidemiological source? It doesn't occur in animals or plants. The world's food supply appears to be intact. In fact everything appears to be intact except this single, and singular, event. Yet there is no peep of wonderment about this gargantuan, universal, and still personal, catastrophe. The only response offered comes out of a B.F. Skinner laboratory. The stimulus is infertility- the reaction is despair, aggression and rage. The egocentricity of this society reeks. Everyone is feeling sorry for himself for not seeing a future in progeny. In this self pity, they destroy their personal future and well-being. It is no surprise that this self-indulgent society's favorite drug is a suicide pill.<br/><br/>Are these truly the only possible human responses to a severe crisis? Does Cuarón really believe there is no nobility in humankind, that the sum of his miseries point to governments, militias and events beyond his control? Are peoples' resources really exhausted when science fails to come up with a solution? Is there nothing an individual can do to elevate himself? This appears to be more a reflection of the director's own cynicism than the reality I live in. If the viewer accepts this premise, to what extent has he limited himself? Whatever the cause of the disaster, the response to it is adolescent. Peoples' willingness to allow themselves to be further subjugated in order to maintain the comforts they have condemns them further. Cuarón would have you believe that dignity was wrested from them, but they removed their own dignity.<br/><br/>If anything, this is a deep condemnation of our modern world which promises fulfillment with things, removal of distress with drugs, relationships without commitment, and its concomitant decreasing demographic. If the movie is any reflection of an outcome to our present circumstances, it is to show how detached we are our from feelings and actions, and how irresponsible we have become as a result.<br/><br/>But Cuarón painted a monochromatic picture. There are people who live with meaning. Some genuinely believe in a Creator who is intimate with the world and who deliberately placed us as stewards of the earth. They will say that there are no coincidences and no accidents. They see themselves as responsible for their actions and that they do affect the world around them, even when they do not know precisely how. In response to the catastrophe, some may pray for forgiveness for themselves and all mankind in the belief that redirecting thought and vision does manifest in the concrete. And they know that thought precedes action. Some may accept personal responsibility for not having done enough to ease the suffering of their fellow humans and redouble their efforts to reach out. And they are not for themselves alone. Some may work to find those in despair and offer personal comfort and support, not the anonymous chemical soporifics which offer only unconsciousness and death. And they are the ones who would burst Joy's grape, knowing full well that its companion is melancholy; so would empathize with the despairing.<br/><br/>As to the future, there is an unbearable focus on a single baby being the salvation of the world. The Christ-like image oozes like a sour sauce from old meat hoping to be made fresh by removing traces of spirit. People fighting and killing each other pause in their killing at the sound of an infant's cries, momentarily fascinated by their vaunted hope. Clearly it is only a passing fancy, for the baby barely moves beyond the perilous domain when the shooting resumes. If their aggression and despair was for lack of progeny, it would seem that the presence of a baby would attract more than a passing interest.<br/><br/>For the full review see http://orderfrochaos.blogspot.com/"

","I have just watched this film and I am flabbergasted that it has made it into the top 250. Clearly a lot of money has been thrown at this (because it has a good hook) and the producers have got an exciting and upcoming director attached to it as well as 2/3 biggish names to act in it. 10/10 for marketing because I was quite sure this was going to be a decent film. How wrong could I be? The structure is awful. It's a horribly messy plot that makes little or no sense. There's a baby! So what? How is one baby going to save the world. Just one of 100 unanswered questions. The acting, meanwhile, is frighteningly bad. Even Clive Owen (who was excellent in Inside Man) is like a poor Nicholas Cage in this. The lesser known actors are laughably bad. This is the worst casting I've ever witnessed; the casting director appears to have just hired lots of women and black people to create a nauseatingly politically correct vision of the future. I spent the entire film feeling as though as I was in a big budget BBC drama. The expensive assembled scenes for the war scenes look soulless and frankly pathetic compared to, say, Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. The editor has taken the colour out of the film to make it look bleak. How clever. Worst of all, from the first to last minute I didn't care about the protagonist. This film could, and perhaps should, have been great. How sad that it was given to Cuarón, and how disturbing that most people are impressed with this farcical 'futuristic' England. Did Cuarón even visit even the UK to research this travesty? I doubt it."

","While the movie had excellent effects and potential and good acting it still managed to fail. At the ending I felt like it was an intermission, there was no conclusion, it was like cutting something off at the climax. It could have been such a strong movie with all of the build-up but they didn't carry it through. I was very, very disappointed and shocked that it received such high reviews. See it for the sets and acting but don't be expecting anything in a bigger sense. I loved Jasper especially and everyone in the cast did an excellent job it honestly would have been excellent if they had just continued with it, or done a 5 minute epilogue.

Come on-the world's youngest person is beaten to death? When Kee has her baby in that filthy room, and they go on the run again, everybody who hears the baby cry acts like it's music to their ears, then they go right on fighting as soon as they are past. There's no reverence for life. I thought it was a bit scary to find white supremacists directly in charge of caged immigrants. Or crazed evangelicals loaded down with assault weapons. No wonder the society broke down. Those people rendered the government troops mostly ineffective. When a country can no longer provide security and basic services, the stage is set for anarchy. The movie reminded me of 1984. Regardless of the quality acting, the plot was sketchy and the story line was uneven. Even the chaos of war has a certain amount of organization to it."

","I was very disappointed of the drama of the movie. It seems that the message desire to be delivered was focused on the chaos of an inevitable end of humanity. Although inhabitants of all over the globe were devastated about the impossibility of having newborns, they kept killing each other and not just in the form of vandalism. These two points of the movie are completely contradictory and they just did not make sense. Acting was good overall. I love Clive, but the movie just did not follow any logical events connection.<br/><br/>Another disappointment was the dead of Moore's character. Frankly, I wanted to watch the movie because I knew she was on it. Five minutes after it started, Julian dies.

The movie is a full on anti western propaganda screed, intent on presenting a very one sided, one dimensional view of certain issues. As such, it is nothing more than a nasty polemic which does not attempt in any way to present a balanced view, or a balanced projection of the future. It is loaded with anti-west, anti-establishment clichés. The greater hypocrisy is that this message is intended as ""free speech"" - the same freedom they deny to anyone who disagrees with them.<br/><br/>I feel this film is contemptible in every way, nothing more than agit prop to push the same tired old barrows that have actually caused the current fouled up situation in the UK."

The movie just isn't very logical. There are a lot of hints about various items throughout the movie but don't expect any clear explanation.

"lemonsaresweet1","1","11","18","8 September 2012"," Boring, stupid and the list goes on
","Please, everybody rating on IMDb stop having a field day with any movie slightly ""original"". I could make an original movie about a dog with two heads that eats children and excretes goblins but that by no means would make a good movie. My point being, the premise of Children of Men is promising, and indeed if directed and written differently could have made for a very interesting, original film. Unfortunately, Children of Men fails to do this in any regard. I will list just a few of the infuriating mistakes made throughout this film:<br/><br/>1) Children of Men, despite being made in 2006, assumes that the United Kingdom (and other parts of the world) are not civilised developed societies. For example instead of assuming that in such a catastrophic situation the world would turn to science, new ways of creating life, cloning, improving in vitro fertilisation etc etc etc, the film of course creates a world of chaos in which the educated population turn to a fascist regime. Granted, jobs would be lost amongst teachers and there would be less business because of a loss of demand but no way would the world come to a hault, and even worse, become a warzone within the first 18 years. Science. Unlike most other futuristic films, this film entirely lacks science. Explanation. Discovery. Nothing.<br/><br/>2) Why didn't they make the baby public? Considering the adoration for the youngest person alive, despite being described as a ""wanker"" by Jasper, you would surely think that they would cherish new life in the same respect (which is demonstrated in the penultimate scene as the soldiers stand back and make way for the child).<br/><br/>3) Why would the soldiers not take in the child and create a safe place for it?<br/><br/>4) Why was the UK the only place that had ""survived""? Although in my frank opinion, it had not. Despite being set in the future it was drab, there had clearly been no developments in technology, for example the bus which was a standard ARRIVA 2002 (most likely).<br/><br/>5) No character development, don't become attached to any of the characters, lack luster performances<br/><br/>6) No explanation for why women can't have children in the first place?<br/><br/>7) THERE IS NO PLOT. It's basically a chase from near beginning to end of a man and pregnant woman in tow, with everyone involved being killed at some stage along the way, and yet miraculously she survives through gun-shot central! It is never eluded to that the baby is going to bring hope to humankind, never suggested that scientists are going to be able to collate research from the ""miracle"".<br/><br/>8) Worst ending to a film ever. Well, with the exception of the Wicker Man. That film left me reeling at the end. But this ending does not even provide a solution! There is no equilibrium! IT JUST ENDS AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE IS DEAD OR IF THE HUMAN RACE IS GOING TO BENEFIT OR WHAT THE ORGANISATION IS. IT'S. JUST. SO. MADENNING. IT. MAKES. THE. WHOLE. FILM.

","I feel that this film could have been so much better. The concept is amazing and it could have been so much more exciting and believable if they had shot it on more than a high school production budget (see my comments re props further down). I mean of course, as believable as a science fiction film could be. The reason I say this is because there are several elements in this film which you really can see potentially happening in the future if politics goes stark raving mad and society decides to denigrate to the extent of reverting back a couple of hundred years. But none of it is done convincingly. And it just feels like it takes one heck of a long time to get nowhere.<br/><br/>OK.. so the film is being marketed as starring 'Clive Owen, Michael Caine, Julianne Moore'... all names we are familiar with and giving the film that pre-audience prep designed to make you feel like you are setting out to see a real star laden blockbuster of a film.<br/><br/>I was happy with the prospect of seeing Julianne Moore with my fellow countrymen Clive Owen and Michael Caine star in a film widely touted as 'Blade Runner for the 21st Century (forgive them Ridley for they really don't know what they say!)... um... except Michael Caine was only in a few brief scenes then killed off... and Julianne Moore fared even worse... as leader of the Fishes she was killed off unceremoniously after her own few brief appearances. Which just left Clive Owen, who looked for the most part as if he had just graduated from the 'Zombie School of Acting' (along with Pam Ferris) and a relatively unknown cast of actors hobbling around for the greater part of the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand this comment... if the film was touted as 'low budget relatively unknown cast with star cameos' then at least you would be prepared to see the film on those merits... with no expectations of the Blade Runner type action and star studded scenes that you are lead to believe you are paying to see. Please... never mistake this film as a contender for the mantle on which Blade Runner rests... Blade Runner is a far superior film in almost every aspect.<br/><br/>The prop budget... in an ever evolving techno age society such as we live in, did the producers really think that the audience wouldn't be fooled by an old Citroen CX with a thinly disguised hood bra to make it look 'futuristic'! And a Fiat Multipla.... is this the future of automotive technology?. Even the rich guy had what looked to be a brand new Rolls Royce, yet it was an old model... will they still be making this car in 20 years time? Did vehicle procreation come to a standstill also? It's laughable. Please, if you are going to make a futuristic film then at least get or make appropriate props.<br/><br/>This is too funny.... in a world of stagnated pro-creation... cats can still have kittens!! I mean, if it truly has come to a standstill, what on earth was that kitten doing in the film! Was that an 18 year old kitten! Other 'simple mistakes' that should have been edited out were.. for instance... a woman trying to push a car uphill on her own in the mud to jump start it... have you ever tried that! I'm not even sure that this would have been believable if Mike Tyson had been pushing it...<br/><br/>And the ending... ahhh... poor Clive... even he doesn't make it to the end of the film without demise... which was not really necessary or essential to the plot... which kind of tails off into nothingness anyhow.<br/><br/>After sitting through this meager and bleak film, which felt like it was being shot with a handy-cam by someone who had just bought one but had not yet read the operating instructions... I'm still scratching my head wondering where all the high praise comments on IMDb are coming from.<br/><br/>Again, I feel that this was a fantastic story spoiled by bleak, cheap looking filming with unconvincing and somewhat low key performances which ultimately fell flat on it's backside due to... um... budget constraints? My disappointed sighs weren't the only ones I heard in the cinema... sadly. I expected more."

","I was greatly looking forward to this film, as I like Clive Owen and am a big fan of Julianne Moore. I had done some work on some of the locations and was intrigued by the vision of the near future that was displayed. As it turned out, the film was a complete turkey. There was absolutely no narrative drive, the various fighting factions were not explained, the sight of the young mother and her baby surviving explosions and bullets ad nauseum was ludicrous. The characters were unsympathetic and (in some cases ) poorly acted. I lost interest well before half way and was praying for the film to end. I almost walked out, I was so bored! This is a shame, as there were elements that were quite interesting. I liked the look of the film and the little visual jokes such as the Pink Floyd pig, the broken David etc. The Michael Caine character was o.k. The total decay of everything, the dirty vehicles, the rickshaws were all well done. However, at the end of the day the drama of the first child born in 18 years was never given the power that it deserved and the film was just one long chase. I am at a loss to understand most of the positive views expressed on this forum. in fact, I am stunned. When I left the cinema, I had the general impression that people shared my view that the film was a dud. This is the first time I have been at odds with the contributors to this site."

","Am I the only one who found this movie pretentious, annoying and unnecessarily violent? Granted, being more familiar with the previous string of post-apocalyptic stuff from the 70's and early 80's, I might be biased (Soylent Green, Logan's Run, Omega Man, ZPG, Blade Runner, etc...). Whenever the political climate is negative and depressing, filmmakers feel the need to comment on the culture, usually with unsatisfying results. Generally, these films fail to withstand the test of time as the culture shifts to something a little sunnier and less humorless. This film seemed dark for the sake of being dark, with the frequent use of heavy-handed allegory (the Human Project ship is called ""Tomorrow""). I prefer my social commentary with a little more subtlety."

","When I read the book by PD James on which this film is based about 15 years ago I thought it was a terrifying concept, a world without future. No more Christmas, no schools, a death of everything that determines the future of man. It put me in touch with how much we, as humans, are driven innately by the knowledge that there is a future beyond our own existence. As it is in most cases the film was not as powerful as the book but I was impressed by the depiction of futuristic London and the glimmer of hope amongst the war zone into which humanity had descended. Michael Caine shines as the eccentric hippie who lovingly attends to his disabled wife and Clive Owen extends himself as the chain smoking hero who doesn't need a cache of firearms to justify this mantle. 'Children of Men' did not descend into 'Hollywoods empty servings' of a film with a neat, predictable platform for the 'major' actors, and instead made the viewer experience the sense of a world that has lost its direction and predictability in deploying the Hollywood formula."

While I am not a fan of putting art into a movie for art's sake, this movie could have used something other than dark, dreary settings and two faced people. The points that the writer(s) were trying to make may have come across a little easier if I was so depressed. The characters were supposed to be living in desperate times, this we know, but to have a movie plot with no hope and then make settings that add to the hopelessness makes the movie a little hard to stomach.

"Woodyanders","9","15","28","14 January 2007"," An excellent, exciting and above all intelligent bleakly futuristic science fiction winner
","2027: Society has collapsed into total violent anarchy and no children have been born in the last eighteen years. Glumly indifferent Theodore Faron (a superb Clive Owen) gets shocked out of his morose apathy when his underground revolutionary ex-wife Julian Taylor (the always fine Julianne Moore) enlists his aid to get the miraculously pregnant Kee (beautifully played by radiant newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of the country before the authoritarian government finds out about her. Director/co-writer Alfonso Cuaron brilliantly creates a plausibly bleak and depressing future where chaos is the dismal norm and mankind has lost its ability for hope. Cuaron wisely downplays needless flashy special effects in favor of emphasizing both the intriguing plot and equally interesting complex characters; he brings a sense of true heartfelt emotion and heartbreaking tragedy to the picture that's both poignant and powerful. The sparingly used special effects are seamless and convincing. The action sequences are fast, brutal, thrilling and harrowing as all hell. The uniformly terrific acting from a top-rate cast rates as another substantial asset: Owen delivers a very strong and touching portrayal of a man who regains his capacity to care and feel, Moore shines in her regrettably brief role, Ashitey brings a terrifically brassy'n'sassy strength and humor to her part, and Michael Caine is simply wonderful as Jasper, a blithely irreverent dippy hippie pothead who helps Theodore out when he's on the lam from the police. But what truly makes this movie so special, resonant and remarkable is its thoughtful and affecting central message about the immeasurable value of human life. A real lovely and extraordinary gem."

"supertom-3","10","8","13","18 January 2007"," Visionary! A remarkable technical achievement.
","This brilliant and understated sci-fi thriller, is a truly revolutionary movie. As a technical achievement this ranks as one of cinema's, important achievements. Technically yes, it's superb, but equally the film has meaning too, and challenges. The dystopic future sub-genre is one that often can be overdone, overblown and overwrought, but not so here. Under the guidance of most other directors doing this sort of film nowadays, this would have been laden with CGI, and without the meaning underneath the visual sheen. Here director Alfonso Cuaron puts the audience in a world that's believable and within possibility. This is not a future staring at oblivion to come in a flash, it's a future that has long been slowly crawling to the end of humanity.<br/><br/>The human race has been slowly dying out for 18 years, since women have become infertile. Clive Owen plays a man watching in quiet, dismal contemplation at the hopelessness around him, until he's contacted by his ex-wife, played by Julianne Moore. She's part of a group called the human project, part rebel, part terrorist, who oppose the fascist government that is running, and ruining what's left of Britain. Refugees, immigrants are illegal, no longer welcome, and the rest of the world isn't in much better shape. Julian (Moore) wants Theo (Owen) to transport a girl down south, from London. The importance of this girl becomes paramount when it's revealed she's pregnant. The first pregnancy in 18 years. Different factions would no doubt want to use this to their own ends, and Owen takes it upon himself to take her to hope, or to the human fund. Of course there are many obstacles in the way. The premise is dark, and similarly frightening. Amongst it all, Cuaron ensures the dialogue, the actors feel natural.<br/><br/>The film is of a genre done before, yet feels fresh, from the scripting, to the look of the film. Indeed Cuaron's earthy, un-showy look, using a dreary, almost dead colour palette and a lot of handled work, evoke a sense of reality. As does his tendency for lots of extended single shot takes. It would be interesting to count the amount of cuts in this film, but it would be a hell of a lot lower than the average Hollywood movie. Indeed this is a daring, and engrossing move from Cuaron. The extended takes, keep the audience right in the action, engaging, pulling you in. None more so than during the exhilarating action scenes with some of the most technically astounding sequences, all in one long take, one shot, and you can't help but be amazed. It's not some overly showy, hollow and cold CGI exhibition, it's down to meticulous planning, timing and execution. We've seen things such as Superman, Star Wars in the last couple of years thanks to the glory of CGI, but the action scenes in this are far more exciting and far superior in concept and execution. The simple fact that the actors are put in a situation whereby they must be in perfect sync with the stunt guys, the cameraman, and remember their cues, their positions etc, it's a miraculous technical and artistic achievement. The first action scene, as well as the finale (which is an insanely long single shot) are awe inspiring.<br/><br/>The cast too are brilliant. Clive Owen continues to fly the flag for Britain, and make a good name for himself. Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetal Ejiofor, and Pam Ferris are all superb in support, while the young Claire-Hope Ashitay is also impressive as Kee. All under the expert and visionary direction of Alfonso Cuaron, who surely is one of the next big names, and perhaps in the new wave of excellence in genre films, once taken up by the likes of Spielberg, Cameron, Scott. Children Of Men is surely a landmark in cinema, and will certainly gain in reputation as the years go by. This will be a revisionist film. *****"

","First off, I hadn't heard much about this movie before going to see it; I went mainly on a whim and at the request of a friend. Overall, it was fairly entertaining, but that was about it.<br/><br/>The thing that bothered me the most about this movie is that the message that the movie makers were trying to get out seemed to take precedence over making a good movie. The cinematography is decent, not overwhelmingly bad, but not very great either. The plot is intriguing, but moves quickly with little explanation. Perhaps given more time and development, the plot and characters could have really added something to the movie, as it was, they seemed to mainly be drivers for the message of the movie as opposed to part of the movie itself.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were very well done. As was the explosion at the coffee shop in the beginning. They were chaotic, loud, and very convincing.<br/><br/>However, other than that, the movie seemed to lack quality. I simply feel that they could have done much better. Overall, a good movie, I'd watch it if it came on TV, but I wouldn't spend money to see it again."
"John_Truby","Null","6","9","8 January 2010"," Gets the big picture but fails in the details
","As the most creative, literally, of all genres, science fiction places a tremendous burden on the writer. You have to create the world, in detail. Children of Men gets some of this right. But there's a lot missing, too.<br/><br/>The first rule of science fiction is to remember that you're writing about the present world, not the future. Indeed, the biggest mistake science fiction writers make is they place the story in such a bizarre and unrecognizable world that the audience can't identify with it. The viewer takes a clinical attitude toward the story, and all emotion is gone.<br/><br/>The world of Children of Men is just weird enough to feel like the future, but it is also horrifyingly present tense. Immigrants are outcasts, torture is justified, bombs explode anywhere for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>It is in the details, however, that Children of Men runs into problems. The most important detail of any science fiction world is the basic rules by which the society works, and that is not clear here. Why all the deportations? Why the war with the immigrants? Why is a baby born to this woman and no others? I can guess at these things. But the writer doesn't want the audience to guess, because that means they are thinking about the construction of the story and not the story itself.<br/><br/>Children of Men also fails to explain or justify the desire line. This is the motive for the quest. Everything else relies on it. So it must be very strong and completely believable. Why is this guy facing almost certain death to escort a woman he doesn't know? Telling us he needs money and is a former activist doesn't cut it. Why does the woman have to go on this trek at all? Saying the British government won't recognize a baby born to an immigrant woman is absurd.<br/><br/>And that leads to the biggest problem with the script, one that is very common to science fiction stories. Science fiction often borrows the journey technique from the myth genre in order to structure the story. The problem with the journey is that it can easily become episodic. The hero encounters a series of opponents on the road but each attack is essentially the same beat. Which means that this kind of science fiction story has no plot. Sure enough the plot in Children of Men quickly becomes tiresome. The two leads drive for a while and then get attacked. Then they drive some more and get attacked again.<br/><br/>This film has some amazing cinematography that goes a long way toward making this world seem intensely real. There is a single take during the battle scene - about ten minutes long - that will take your breath away. But ultimately any film, including science fiction, comes down to story. If you don't set up the story world and the plot properly, no amount of camera work will cover the holes.<br/><br/>If you would like to learn all the techniques for setting up a detailed world and a plot that builds steadily to the end, take a look at the Horror, Fantasy, and Science Fiction Class or the Science Fiction add-on to Blockbuster.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS please visit www.truby.com"

The story is poorly developed, there is no drama or tension, it is boring, it is absolutely far away from reality in all aspects. You could start watching the movie at any time and would loose nothing. The basic idea is not bad; but so much more could have been made out if it, without risking to run into exaggeration. This movie shows that to make a good movie it takes not only good ideas, but also the ability to transform them into something. A movie is entertainment, it is a stimulus for reflection, it produces an emotion, this one here tastes like cold coffee (not iced), like a soup without flavor, like a dead pond."

","I think that your opinion of this film is going to greatly depend on your expectations beforehand. It seems that a lot of people went to see this film not expecting much and were pleasantly surprised by its intelligence and non-derivative execution.<br/><br/>However, having seen that this film was in the IMDb top 250 I came to it with somewhat higher hopes and came away slightly let down.<br/><br/>The plot is fine in so far as it goes and there are some nicely done set pieces - the giant shoot out among the street ruins is particularly impressive and realistic - but really the only outstanding performance is from Michael Caine. I don't remember a great deal about what the main characters motivations were and that doesn't say much for the strength of either the plot or the cast. <br/><br/>For me the most enjoyable section of the movie was in Jaspar's (Michael Caine's) house - there was some strong acting here and some humorous and effective scenes. But beyond that, I think that people who rate this film highly are doing it because they are impressed by the director's bleak and believable presentation of an anarchic future for mankind. <br/><br/>I concede that it is well done - but I don't believe that the plot or the acting match the strength of the visuals.<br/><br/>I don't think that this is a film I would watch again and that tells me that it is not deserving of its current ranking as a classic. I would rate it as above average - an interesting concept, nicely brought to the screen but with not enough depth to really draw me in."
"Jonny_Numb","6","7","11","17 April 2008"," Visually stunning, emotionally sterile
","One of the arguments (in my mind, anyway) against ""A.I."" was that the project, long-gestating with Stanley Kubrick prior to his death, and taken over by Steven Spielberg after, was at odds with the former's emotionally sterile obsession with style, and the latter's fixation with sentimentality and family values. And in a sense, that film-making dichotomy is just as much on display in ""Children of Men,"" only instead of Spielbergian emotion, director Alfonso Cuaron opts for the frustrating detachment of Kubrick, to the point where no matter what fantastic visual is being displayed on-screen, it's hard to care all that much because the characters--no matter how well-played--are little more than genre ciphers. The film forgoes whatever literary quality P.D. James' source material possessed, instead going for gritty, in-the-moment documentary realism; and while Cuaron shows impressive skill with long, complex takes and CGI, the film feels shallow (and sometimes shrill) in its overall narrative. What we have is essentially the tale of mankind's death knell due to women becoming infertile (it's none-too-subtly implied that this is the source of terrorism, death, and destruction the world over), until an immigrant girl (running afoul of some eco-terrorist types) turns up pregnant, resulting in an unbroken chase to get her to the ""Human Project,"" a fabled safe haven that may not exist. The performances are excellent if not truly transcendent--Clive Owen as the reluctant protector; Julianne Moore as his radical ex-wife; and Michael Caine as the cerebral, aging hippie who clings to hope--perhaps because the characters don't get the faithful fleshing-out they deserve (some only get a few minutes of screen time before making their exit--is this a comment on the film's own ""time is fleeting"" theme?), leading to an experience that kept me at a distance. Don't get me wrong--""Children of Men"" is a well-done film, albeit sometimes a bit thick with its philosophy, but a step away from Kubrick would have been a step in the right direction."

","If you're looking for a stylish and technically interesting film then Children of Men is worth your time. The cinematography, editing, sound design, art design, and other technical visual and audio elements of this movie are outstanding. There are a two amazing extended scenes shot as one continuous take, although my guess (haven't watched supplemental materials) is that the scenes were digitally stitched together. No matter how it was done, what matters is how it looks on the screen and IMHO they look amazing.<br/><br/>However, that's really all the film has. The plot is simplistic and the acting mediocre. Michael Caine brings the screen to life a bit when he's on screen, but the rest of the cast phones it in. Regarding the plot, here are two examples of laughable elements (and I haven't read the book so maybe I should blame the author): <br/><br/><ul><li>We learn that the main character's son died....from pandemic flu! So 1/3 of the way into a film about how humanity is dying out due to worldwide sterility the writers feel the need to heap another catastrophe into the mix. I laughed when it was revealed the son died from pandemic flu.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There's a ""bad guy"" henchman right out of James Bond films. He guns down a character in one scene (amazing long scene #1), shows up a few scenes later at a hideout, and then shows up again to try and kill the main character in the second amazing long scene. He's almost a caricature of screen villains...evil yet mildly incompetent.</li></ul><br/><br/>I must admit that I'm a film geek when it comes to technical style elements, so the long steadicam shots were a bit distracting to me. However, they were amazing to watch, and the film was entertaining in an escapist sort of way."

","You certainly have to credit Children of Men with originality. Rooting a dystopian vision in a real life social or political problem is just so passé.<br/><br/>Apparently by 2027 women can't conceive anymore (isn't that always the way). Women have destroyed the world again; when will they ever learn? Civilisation has, predictably, broken down. The world beyond the English Channel has descended into howling, woad-smeared anarchy. Oh, and the government is evil because it doesn't like refugees.<br/><br/>The problem with Children of Men is that it seems to have been assembled backwards. Most dystopias start with a topical problem or issue they want to explore and then build up to an extreme conclusion. Orwell and Bradbury had totalitarianism; Huxley and Burgess had social dislocation; Atwood had chauvinism; Niccol had genetic enhancement. Children of Men, though, appears to have begun with its funky dystopian backcloth and then realised half way through that it didn't actually have anything to say. Thus we have to listen with increasing impatience to all this guff about hating 'fugees (this caused me a momentary confusion: ""don't like The Fugees? So what, I mean, who does?"") <br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I'm a liberal kind of guy; I like immigration (as I discovered the disconcertingly confusing contraction of refugees to mean). But this Salford Poly, bed-sit politics is a bit preposterous in a post-apocalyptic society don't you think? Somehow, I don't think Neil Pye from the Young Ones would have survived the post-infertility thought police holocaust. Just guessing.<br/><br/>What Children of Men does, it does quite well. It develops atmosphere and pace well and there are some good performances (particularly Clive Owen and Michael Caine) to set against the slightly hammy performances of the NUS fish warriors (I'm not kidding). But in the end it is impossible to escape from the infuriating, TV-shaking pointlessness of it all. Fecundity problem? For Pandas, yes. Are we Pandas? Government doesn't want to turn Britain into a hostel for the entire population of the world? How could they not; what would the Guardian say?"

And you get two leading ladies for the price of one.<br/><br/>I do wish the trailer had not given away the shock opening. It made me jump anyway. Those expecting a bleak drama from said trailer will be surprised by how funny the film is, although the writer often wipes the grin from your face with a wallop to the jaw. There is some grinding agitprop to get through but it is the director's eye for the little details of life that wins you over in terms of authenticity, although there is one glaring cliché when a man is about to meet his maker.<br/><br/>'Children of Men' may not be a keeper, post-apocalyptic dramas being a dime a dozen nowadays.

","I just saw this film and found it rather boring. The plot seems to make no sense at all, we are never told why the hero is embarking on this rather futile journey, and the film is full of pointless moralising about the horrors of the futuristic society it depicts. There are numerous heavy-handed didactic visual references to contemporary political issues - the Iraq war, refugees, police brutality, Guantanamo bay, Abu Ghraib that have nothing to do with the plot and are rather irritating. The characters seem totally unbelievable - one-dimensional cut-out figures with no plausible personality. The film is also full of the kind of senseless and gory blow-them-away violence that characterises so many empty-headed American action films nowadays, except it is even more objectionable here as this film obviously has pretensions to be a serious product. I haven't read the original book, so I am unable to determine if these flaws are in the book, or are the result of the highly didactic objectives of the director. Either way, this must be one of the worst films I have seen for the past several years - boring, irritating and entirely vacuous."

The whole world went down since all women lost the ability to get pregnant until one woman miraculously got pregnant and the movie goes on until she gets to a safe place called ""The Tomorrow"".

I think what it wanted to tell us was that we, humans, don't cherish what we have until we lose it. It's a possibility that one day we might not be able to survive and bring war and misery upon each other but it's not today, so why are we still going to wars and destroying everything good and pure in this world?

The utopian stories explore about a future, which the society is perfect, where the people live without getting lost. The main characters would mostly live the adventures, through philosophical questions about their purpose and how they can solve some issues which were not solved yet. The dystopian stories explore about a future, which is chaotic filled with darkness, where the people are completely lost. As it seems there is no hope for the humanity, until a light comes out by showing nothing is lost yet and the main characters would do anything to bring hope. Some of the dystopian and utopian stories use realism, by giving the audience reflections, about how the main characters would move forward to get their purpose. Other stories would use horror elements, by letting the audience feel the fear of the main characters, who are facing the darkness in their roads. Some stories would end with the main characters, who survived from the danger, by then accomplish their missions. Other stories would end with the main characters dying, once they have accomplished the mission with hope. The auteur filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón seems interested, to release a dystopian movie, by adapting the book The Children of Men by P. D. James. As a story filled with reflective and poetic scenes, in every single angle shots, by making an emotional and realistic movie. In 2006 came out Children of Men by Alfonso Cuarón with Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Clare-Hope Ashitey, Michael Caine, Pam Ferris and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The movie's plot: In the year 2027, the humanity is living in the chaotic world where the women are infertile. The people live in the sadness, as it seems there is no hope, for the humanity to find another little newborn child. Until a former activist Theo Faron (Clive Owen) gets asked, by the militant group called Fishes, to help them by accomplishing an important mission. It is about to help Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), an illegal refugee, to get to the sanctuary at the sea. The movie would immediately capture the audience attention, from the beginning to the end, for how the camera shots long takes to give all the emotions and the realism needed to make the scenes unforgettable and poetic. The lightenings and the shadows help as well, by letting the audience feel the emotions of the main characters. By making the story powerful in every scenes, without ruining the emotions of the movie. The sound design was particularly elaborated, by making the specific sounds unexpectedly loud, for some of the most thrilling moments of the story. By increasing the audience tension, in the most unexpected ways. The screenplay was elaborated to be clear, how the story would be told from the beginning to the end, without ruining the narration's rhythm. Especially to see how the main characters, get through the dark and chaotic roads, to bring hope for the humanity. The editing was specifically elaborated, by making the story's narration clear, about how the characters would face the danger, in the most unexpected ways. Clive Owen was excellent as Theo Faron a former activist, who has a dramatic past that makes him feel hopeless. Until Theo changes his mind about the hope, once he gets involved in the mission by the Fishes. Julianne Moore did a well done performance as Julian Taylor, former wife of Theo and the one who takes part of the Fishes. Julian would convince Theo to be part of the mission, for the trust she still has on him. Clare-Hope Ashitey was really good as Kee, an illegal refugee, who is the main reason for the mission. In the course of the story, Kee and Theo would trust each other, as he makes her understand what she should do to move forward. Michael Caine was extraordinary as Jasper Palmer, a former political cartoonist and a friend of Theo, who takes care his wife and the dog. Jasper would help Theo whenever is needed, as they know each other for a long time. Since Theo gets involved in the mission, Jasper would show Theo a way to arrive at the sanctuary. Pam Ferris did a well done performance as Miriam, a former midwife who takes care Kee. Initially Miriam would look to be an annoying character, until there would be a moment where she shows to be a much serious character. Miriam would do anything to protect Kee, she also explain Theo some important things, he needs to know in the course of the story. Chiwetel Ejiofor was really good as Luke, who is member of the Fishes. Luke would have no mercy with anybody, as he focuses on his purpose. Luke would also show some emotions, which can explain the reason of his behavior. The score of the movie makes the story powerful, in every musical notes to be breathtaking. Especially in the most emotional moments, as well as the most thrilling one, to make the story unforgettable. Children of Men is one of the greatest masterpieces of all time, also one of the best Alfonso Cuarón's movies."

","This film created an intelligent surpassing theory in a future that felt like a mocking sordid sketch of our world today.
For 2006 this movie is definitely ahead of its time in regards to the amount of detail and realism the continuous shots capture, more especially the IMPRESSIVE choreography within the cinematography & acting- Or to put it simpler, the camera and acting were synced to a suspenseful perfection.
The follow scenes through the refugee camp were horrific and captured a real/true disaster that goes on in our world today.
Plus, Clive Owens' own acting was VERY GENUINE (Hugs and kisses to him).
That said I wouldn't watch this movie again because it just wasn't a classic.
As a whole, it felt like there was a layer of neutralizing gloom over it.
This is more-so a salute film that is fired off for nobility and a one time impact-ful experience, AND, at the end of it all I didn't walk away feeling empowered but more so questioning and reflecting on the moral of the story."

"Enchorde","7","2","2","6 September 2008"," Ordinary chase in grim future
","Recap: It's the future, and it's not looking good. Mankind have lost the ability to bear children and the youngest human, now over 18 years old, have just been murdered. Most societies has collapsed, and the few that remains, Britain for example, are overrun by illegal immigrants. In response to that, Britain has turned into a militant (fascist) society with an oppressive police force and frequent identity and security checks. And in response to that outlaw groups form to fight the oppressive system.<br/><br/>Theo Faron just got kidnapped by one of these groups, the Fishes. His ex-wife Julian runs it and she needs some papers that allow travel through the country. For she has found a pregnant woman. But she is not the only one that wants the baby.<br/><br/>Soon Theo and the young woman, Kee, is in a run for their lives.<br/><br/>Comments: There is basically two parts in this movie. Two parts that unfortunately don't mesh all the way. Not that they contradict each other but there is very little symbiosis between the two either.<br/><br/>The first part is the surroundings, the environment, the setting. The fascistic and dystopian future. The loss of all the children. All the immigrants and the camps they are interred in. The general breakdown of society and human rights. Very interesting and could be discussed at length. But aside from setting the ground rules it doesn't have much of an impact on the rest of the story.<br/><br/>The story is the second part. The mission to get the pregnant girl and her baby to the coast and into safety. And the ensuing chase by the military/police and mostly by the underground group the Uprising who wants the baby as a political tool in their violent uprising against the government. Suddenly Theo and Kee find themselves alone and nobody to trust.<br/><br/>The problem is that the chase, apart from the prize being a kid, is not really dependent on the setting. It is mostly a chase that could take place anyplace anytime. Not that it is bad, it is not. It holds unexpected twists and turns, it has suspense. The actors are good, especially Clive Owen who fits nicely as a rugged and depressed man that becomes the unwilling hero. He looks the part and he acts the part. Very good.<br/><br/>But going from good to great is a steep climb. You need the two parts to interact, to evolve together. You want some questions raised, questions to ponder while (and after) you're watching. Children of Men does not. It accurately describes the setting and then launches a story, straight from beginning to the end.<br/><br/>It was a good movie. Entertaining to watch. But for me, it was not great. And surely not one of the top 250 movies on IMDb as it was when this was written.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Just finished watching this movie and am astounded at the fact that I have no idea what it was about, what was happening, or why I should care. Is it about the mysterious world-wide infertility? Well, it does not seem to be, even though that theme is established, it does not seem to bear on the (non-existent) plot.<br/><br/>Who are the various groups incessantly shooting at each other? What are their motivations? The movie gives us not a clue! And, is this not the easiest childbirth in recorded history? What is the significance of the baby? Who knows! The movie never even implies what will happen once the main character's escape is achieved.<br/><br/>Acting: There isn't any. Even old pro Michael Caine is really just doing Michael Caine. It just so happens that any Michael Caine is a relief in this depressing and inept chase movie. Hollywood's most over-rated actress, Julianne Moore, graces the picture for a short time, until she is mercifully assassinated. Clive Owen does not act, but rather wanders through the story trying to smoke a complete cigarette and have a swig of whiskey. If Mr. Owen has any acting chops, this script effectively prevents him from showing them.<br/><br/>Visuals: The picture is unrelentingly dark, dirty, and depressing.<br/><br/>I have no idea what this picture was about, and it provides no incentive whatsoever to find out. Avoid this one!"

","Decent marks for production design, but enough plot holes to drive a Mack truck through and bad contrivances galore, i.e., car chases, an over aged hippie whose sole attempt at comic relief is to tell everyone to pull his finger. Clive Owen isn't bad, Julianne Moore mailed it in and Michael Caine, well, no need to revisit. I liked the cats and dogs, but all the humans were despicable, which is perhaps the point of the movie/book. Most of the people leaving the movie shook their heads, filled with unresolved issues. While I agree that the objective may have been to provoke thought, I don't like movies that leave too many questions unanswered. After all, the aim is to tell a good story, with a beginning, middle and ending. This has no ending and not much of a beginning or middle.<br/><br/>A ship named ""Tomorrow,"" is that supposed to suggest that humanity has a future after all? One baby, whose existence is unexplained, is the hope of mankind? All the fighting suddenly stops when the kid manages to cry for a solid 10 minutes, right on director's cue, and then it all starts back up again? Please, don't insult our intelligence with tripe like this. Sci-Fi only works when the imagination can find a glimmer of plausibility in the premise. One simply cannot believe that in a mere 20 years, 3 billion people on the planet will suddenly lose the ability to bear children. And, then, we are asked to believe that only one, without explanation of any kind, will regain that ability.<br/><br/>I'd like my $8 back."

May be some people really enjoy looking at suffering, poverty, garbage and blood, I can't help but pity them.<br/><br/>The whole movie you are looking at burning garbage, depressing dark colors, crying people and murders. The people who enjoy such movies should be isolated from the rest of the society, because there is something wrong with their perception of the world.<br/><br/>And the lack of logic in the movie is just stupendous. Starting with their ""silent"" escape from the farm, when they were opening and closing car doors and trunks with enormous noise 5 meters from their captors, and ending the lost of attention to the only child in the world once soldiers started shooting in the refugee camp. Let aside the unreasonably hopeful mood of the ending, despite absolute uselessness of having one accidental baby for the restoration of the world. Just look at the war in Iraq  even the fact that they can have babies can't save this country from the suffering and war.<br/><br/>Overall  stupid, depressing and hopefully useless movie (may be except couple of nice findings and tricks in the filming practices)."
"evgueny","3","10","18","11 February 2007"," Pointless and pretentious
","What other reviewers consider an advantage of this movie, I consider serious drawbacks. In my opinion, an anti-utopia is supposed to be thought provoking, to have an agenda and to be highly psychological. Unfortunately, this movie has none of these. The behavior of the characters (especially secondary ones) is often rather illogical, which makes it impossible to understand their motives and what is really going on, and why. A few scenes are very emotional, however, their ethical side remains obscure because, again, you cannot understand what people really think. It is definitely not the result of poor acting -- on the contrary, the acting is pretty good, it just does not help. Overall, Children of Men would have qualified for a typical entertaining and pointless action movie if it had not been so dark and pretentious."

","You would think that somewhere in the process of writing, directing, and producing this unmitigated disaster of a film, someone would have paused and said ""hey...guys....what are we doing here exactly?"". The characters have absolutely zero depth, the setting is more artificial than a Borg cube, and the storyline....well, I'm still trying to figure out what the storyline IS, exactly.<br/><br/>The basic premise seems to be that nobody in the world can have babies any more. Instead of enjoying the last days of the human race by having as much unprotected sex as humanly possible, all the people of the world decide that Armageddon isn't coming soon enough, and try to help it along by killing each other whenever possible.<br/><br/>In a similar line of logic, one woman finally has a child and instead of rejoicing the whole world seems intent on chasing her down. Also, they seem to think that the best way to keep her baby alive is by pouring massive streams of bullets in her general direction.<br/><br/>The movie ends with no real conclusion, no closure, and no suggestion of what the future is supposed to hold. All in all, I wouldn't watch it again if someone held a gun to my head."
"Superunknovvn","7","10","18","17 November 2006"," Terror has never been depicted more realistically
","""Children Of Men"" might go down in history as the movie that did for the depiction of terror what ""Saving Private Ryan"" did to battle scenes. It's gruesome, it's brutal, it's real. The whole movie is like a kick in the guts. Although the story is set in the future, it draws a lot of parallels to what is happening today with some references to the prosecution of Hitler's regime and the biblical story of the birth of Jesus Christ as one precious life is being protected in the midst of chaos and mass murder.<br/><br/>With the shaky camera-work this movie sometimes feels like watching the news, which is not to say that ""Children Of Men"" hasn't got any storytelling offer. This is an exciting and thrilling movie. Every time you think that the movie is starting to get slow another plot point is made and keeps you interested.<br/><br/>The story itself sometimes seems a bit holey. We never really know who exactly is fighting who and for what reason. The main characters' moves sometimes aren't comprehensible and some details and developments seem a bit implausible.<br/><br/>However, Alfonso Cuarón more than makes up for these flaws with his fantastic direction and the bleak atmosphere he creatrs. There are three moments in particular that I found totally amazing. The first is a scene where the main characters are being attacked by terrorists in the woods. The second is a car chase with cars that have to be pushed. It's like the reverse of a high speed chase but it's twice as thrilling. The third key moment is a sequence near the end of the movie where all hell breaks loose in a ghetto. In an amazingly long and well executed tracking shot we are shown absolute mayhem. There's blood sprinkled at the camera, it's as if we were right there with the main character. This is the sequence that I was talking about when I said terror has never been depicted more realistically and it is this scene that will stick in your mind after you have left the cinema.<br/><br/>This is a very unusual film, comparable maybe to ""12 Monkeys"" or its predecessor ""La jetée"". This one has got a message that comes through in its pictures more than in the actual story. Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro González Iñárritu are still fighting for the title ""Best Contemporary Mexican Director"". I haven't seen ""Babel"", yet, but to top ""Children Of Men"" it must be really good."
"matjusm","10","10","18","11 November 2006"," A film that blew me away
","It has been a long that a film like this has so pleasantly surprised me. Anyway, the plot is quite straightforward: It is the year 2027 and the world is in deep trouble. For around 18 years or so, no woman has given birth to a baby and nobody knows what is the cause of this infertility. The story takes place in a semi-totalitarian Britain where Clive Owen plays a reluctant hero who by his ex-wife (Julianne Moore), the leader of a resistance group known as The Fishes, is caught up in the events surrounding the rescue of a young immigrant woman who happens to be pregnant. I mentioned immigrant woman for in the British society in this film, all illegal immigrants are being hunted down and put into camps. Michael Cain also has a somewhat small role as a hippie who is a friend of Owen's character. <br/><br/>I have nothing more to say than wow when talking about this film. The concept is great and it is well executed. Cain, Owen, Moore and the few other main characters all put on top notch performances. They are believable and Cain I fond to be a big delight. Although the film takes place about 20 years in the future, everything doesn't seem all that futuristic. That however doesn't bother at all since the production designer went for a more rugged and broken down look which works excellently and adds to the mood of the film. <br/><br/>The direction, done by Alfonso Cuaron, is what I found to be the strongest aspect of this film. Together with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki they go for a very shock and awe approach. Everything feels fresh and shocking, a trait that is amplified even further when viewing this in a movie theater. You never know when somebody might get shot and when that person does, it happens then and there, blowing you away. The cinematography is beautiful. It is mostly long hand-held shots but fortunately those are quite stable hand-held shots. Never is there a sense of confusion that sometimes happens with other films where you can't tell what is going on. I especially adored the scenes of a battle between the resistance group and the army in the middle of which Owen is trying to escort the pregnant woman to safety. That was quite possibly one of the best battle scenes I've ever seen. The soundtrack relies a lot on characters in the film listening to music and not so much on music accompanying the action. <br/><br/>All I have to say is that I recommend this at all costs. 10/10"
"mbilbetaylor","7","16","32","21 October 2006"," Amazing cinema, let down by poor story.
","Children of Men (COM, as I will now refer to it as) is not a movie you recommend to your friends. Yes, it's violent but who doesn't enjoy a good dose of violence. What COM lacks is substance and without it, the film feels slightly weak.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cauron set out to accomplish something other than entertain his audiences with COM. You could argue that he is making a point about present day issues regarding racial profiling and fear mongering. But then, what film these days isn't trying to deliver a message.<br/><br/>After viewing COM I have a lot of respect for Mr. Caurons eye as a director but I feel that the message he was trying to express have ultimately been sullied by the films lack of back story and information. Not to give away any of the plot it's suffice to say this movie lacks the padding it needed to make it truly acceptable to audiences expecting 'more'.<br/><br/>This however should not deter people who can look past such misdemeanors and go and see a film that is incredibly engaging and extremely well shot. Even without the information you so dearly crave as the credits roll any lover of cinema will be able to sit back and appreciate the creative prowess so apparent in this film. Not since Kubrick have I been so stunned by such rock steady camera work.<br/><br/>The opinions expressed in this film can be interpreted as many different things, depending on your own opinions about standard of living and racial acceptance. The closing 45 minutes of COM illustrate a world we so often view many miles away through the lens of a CNN or FOX camera, devoid of any true emotion. COM makes you walk the path of the deprived and forces you to accept what you see.<br/><br/>Whilst not a moving picture in my opinion, Children of Men is an important film due solely to the fact that Mr. Cauron set out to shoot the film HE wanted to shoot. It is reassuring to know that there still remain film makers daring enough to pursue their own ends and not bow down to others. <br/><br/>Perhaps the scariest idea to take away with you after viewing is that often in this world the truest face of evil in this world is the most familiar.<br/><br/>A sterling effort by Clive Owen, who I believe held the film together with his down but not out performance of a man fighting to make a difference. Michael Caine injected some much needed comic relief which helped keep the film fresh in the viewer's heads. <br/><br/>I want to give COM an 8, but due to the many questions left unanswered it slides to 7.5 out of 10. Once again, this films main attraction is its simply amazing cinematography, the best in recent films."

","I had high hopes for this movie after seeing the high rating, but after it was over I was confused and appalled (mostly at the complete waste of 2 hours of my time). It started out interestingly enough, but soon degenerated into a confusing, pointless mishmash of meaningless violence. Not only is this movie unrelentingly grim, none of it seems to have anything to do with anything else. One premise is of a world with no children, and the other is of a world gone mad with violence. Unfortunately, the connection between these is never made. What led to this situation? Who are these oddly-named rebel groups (the fishes???)? What do they all want? Why is the British government doing what it's doing? You'd think with no children, there would be plenty of space available. Why is Kee really important? (there's only one of her, after all; hardly enough to make a difference in the entire world!) What do they want to do with her? WTF is going on? There are no answers or explanations. In short, this movie is a giant steaming pile of crap masquerading as arty social commentary."

","""It is the year 2006 (not 2027), and the dumbing down process is nearly complete. Moronic children of moronic men have gathered to make the ultimate left-wing propaganda film masked as a futuristic thriller. The masses loved it; they are brainwashed sheep, their average IQ having sunk considerably in recent generations.."" <br/><br/>This might as well have been titled ""V For Vendetta 2""; the same kind of thinly-veiled pro-terrorist message, a Far-Right Britain of the future, and some truly bad acting.<br/><br/>The question isn't why everyone has become sterile (except the animals - why??) but who has produced the lovely low-IQ individuals who created this mess. Wasn't this the director who did ""Harry Potter 3""? (I saw interviews with the man on that DVD; he seems very wide-eyed, very silly, and not too bright.) The terrorists are the good guys. The Iraq war was a mistake. The government hates you. It lies every time. And fundamentalist Islam is harmless. So what else is new from Marxists who side with other extremists while opposing the much-hated Capitalist West (that gave them the opportunity to make this crap in the first place)? And just like ""V For Vomit"", this propagandist left-wing trash saddles this supposed ""future"" with so many present-day issues that it made me wonder: why bother pretending this is about the future? Why not just set it in 2006 and spell it out loud and clear: WE HATE America, CAPITALISM & GLOBALISM. VOTE LEFT. That should be the movie's marketing punchline. However, marketing in its essence is dishonest, and directors always prefer to send out their political messages sneakily.<br/><br/>The world today has a major problem with over-population, yet this ""reality-based"", ""serious"" futuristic thriller drama wants us to buy the extremely far-fetched, cockamamie premise about mass sterility - and EVERYONE has got it! (Well, except the joke-spewing black girl...) Has some mysterious gas entered all of femalekind's genitals, chocking all the eggs - while cleverly avoiding damaging the genitals of the world of fauna?... A THINKING gas: a Cuaron gas. (Or maybe someone just f****d very hard...)<br/><br/>I laughed during the very first scene, and then wondered if this wasn't a comedy after all. The bit about the youngest man on Earth getting killed because he refused to sign an autograph had something distinctly pythonesque about it: a bleak future, dark colors - and then this nonsense on the news! Very funny, indeed. I laughed on other occasions, too; especially hilarious were the various looters, rock-throwers and the like. They were filmed with such UNauthenticity. There was an old, imprisoned woman talking in Serbo-Croatian, which was also very funny, and only seconds later an old woman complained in German about being ""placed to stand next to a n**ger"". Awful. Also very funny were Owen and the two women running away from the terrorists; so unconvincing... Plus the cretinous dialog, which permeates the entire movie, offers several amusing moments. The idiotic sterility premise would have been a good basis for an ""Idiocracy""-type comedy, but THIS?? Give me a break. COM is somewhat influenced by ""Brazil"". However, that movie is a dark comedy, which is a far more effective approach.<br/><br/>""Morons Of Men"" was based on a novel. Let me guess: ""The Independent"", ""The Guardian"", ""Liberation"", ""Berliner Zeitung"", and other Leftist dailies gave it rave reviews. Right? No: left.<br/><br/>The entire movie is loaded with paranoid cliché nonsense: ""the government did this, the government does that"", etc. The movie reeks of cretinous conspiracy theories, much in the ""they are hiding a UFO"", ""Bush is Al-Qaida's friend"", or ""masons are controlling the world"" vein. Food for the gullible and the illiterate. The people who conceived this dull, inept and unintentionally funny political drama are counting on the anti-Iraq-war, anti-globalism sentiments propagated in the media - especially by the likes of the BBC. Hence to portray the BBC as a tool of a Right-wing government is laughable (wouldn't even work in a spoof). Maybe in 1000 years, but certainly not in the near future - mass sterility or not.<br/><br/>Besides, if anything then Britain is more likely to become Marxist in several decades, rather than Right-wing, what with the leftist media's very successful brainwashing of most Europeans and half of America. In other words, if you're looking for extreme scenarios in the year 2027, then this one is far more likely: a Leftist tyranny fighting the problem of OVER-population (and not the other way around).<br/><br/>However, all is not bleak in the world of COM: Julianne ""Ping-Pong"" Moore gets killed off after only 30 minutes. I was overjoyed by this twist, because I was afraid I might have to watch her for the duration. Miscasting her as a leftist guerrilla leader in COM is even worse than her playing a porn bimbo in ""Boogie Nights"". And some serious leader she is! While driving with Owen and the pregnant girl she plays a silly game using a ping-pong ball, instead of looking out for danger, which evidently lurks at every corner in this ill-conceived world. If only Bin Laden were this incompetent and childish... (Maybe he is! Maybe we should give him ping-pong balls to play with as a distraction. It worked with Moore...)<br/><br/>A long-haired Michael Caine, who embarrasses himself here like never before, often said that he'd do almost any movie for a substantial amount of cash. COM is a perfect example of this approach. After old fogies like Connery and Hopkins got silly long grey wigs to wear, why did they have to make Caine look stupid that way, too?<br/><br/>If a movie like COM is liked by most people, then perhaps mankind truly deserves to become sterile by 2027 - or much earlier..."
"The_Void","8","9","16","20 May 2007"," Perhaps not as good as the hype, but still a major highlight of 2006
","After reading all the reviews and praise for Children of Men, I can't exactly say I was blown away by the resulting film - but it's certainly a very good movie in that it manages to make you care for the characters and makes you think; something that can't be said for many movies released recently. The film is based on a novel by P.D. James, which I haven't read. The story takes place in the future, although it's not the futuristic world seen in most other films set in the future. Rather, the landscape of the film is a lot like the present world, and if anything seems even less technologically advanced. The basic plot revolves around the idea of women, for some reason, becoming infertile. No child has been born for over eighteen years and the only hope of saving the human race is a rumoured organisation known as 'The Human Project'. However, there seems to be hope from elsewhere as after being dragged into a plot by his ex-wife, Theo Faron discovers a pregnant woman and agrees to help her get the baby to safety.<br/><br/>Director Alfonso Cuarón has managed to walk a thin line between style and substance, and he's done it well. The film features a handful of star names who all deliver good performances, but these are never at the centre of the film and the director always makes sure that the story remains at the forefront. The film is not exactly a visual feast, but the downtrodden locations have a sort of eerie beauty to them, and the special effects, when used, are dazzling. The build up to the climax, the sequence that sees an army firing at a dishevelled building was a particular highlight in that respect. Clive Owen takes the lead role, and while he's still his usual one-note self; his role here really suits his on-screen persona. He receives good support from experienced performers Michael Caine and Julianne Moore, while lesser known actors such as Pam Ferris and Claire-Hope Ashitey perform well alongside the bigger names.

"johnrp2020","6","9","16","11 January 2007"," Premise better than the movie
","The Premise of this movie was excellent, the fact that there had been no births in the world for 18 years. The movie starts out encouragingly enough with news that the worlds youngest person, Diego who was a celebrity at 18, is dead.<br/><br/>****SPOLIER**** The plot falls away from there. There was no tension or deliberation when Theo decides to help Julian, which he knows will alter his life dramatically. Heck, he doesn't even know Kee is pregnant at that point. The movie seemed to gloss over that point.<br/><br/>The second thing that bothered me was the locking up of illegal aliens. OK, no babies born for 18 years, and the ""big"" focus of the government is keeping people out of the UK? First, don't you think that they would be focused on bigger things....like REPRODUCING! Also, if the population is dwindling, wouldn't you want as many people as possible in your country, considering that in 50 years no one will be left! It just didn't make sense.<br/><br/>****SPOILER**** Third, there was no clear reason as to why Luke and his gang wanted to kill Theo. I know it was necessary for the story to go forward, but they could have given a plausible reason for it.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the fact that no baby has been born in 18 years is so interesting, so chilling, that it should have been used more in the script...almost like a character unto itself. What happened to all the school teachers? What was society's plans for the next 50 years...when we would become extinct? What would happen to armies and sports teams in 20 years? Run by 50 year-old's? Even Theo's ""London 2012"" Olympic shirt could have been used by saying organizers of the Olympic games say 2040 is the last year of the games. Also, the reason why there was this mass infertility could have and should have been explored more. Miriam's character did touch on it in the school room, and it was reverting, but it left me with a feeling of wanting more.<br/><br/>****SPOILER**** Finally, this movie did have its moments, one dramatic one is the baby crying as all fighting stops. Soldiers fall to their knees as the sight of the first baby in 18 years. But as pleasing as that scene was, the end of the scene was as bizarre. How do hundreds of soldiers witness an infant for the first time in 18 years and then COMPLETELY IGNORE her when the fighting starts back up, leading to the final escape? All in all, the premise almost carries this movie...but I would be hard pressed to give it a thumbs up?"
"BillB719","3","9","16","7 January 2007"," See the movie before reading the book
","The book is thought provoking and a bit disturbing. When I finished reading the book, I was struck by Theo's transition. At the beginning, he is self absorbed and not empowered. At the end, hope and love transition him to a fulfilling life.<br/><br/>What struck me about the movie is it's focus on Baby Boomer's. The movie relies on Beatles style ""all we need is love"" music; leans toward 60's activists ability to finally make the world right; and a key character, Jaspar, is transformed from an aging, traditional professor in the book to an aging hippie in the movie. This movie shamelessly panders to the Baby Boomer generation. (Yes, I am a Baby Boomer) Boomer's leave the movie theater being even more self absorbed then when they entered the theater.<br/><br/>The movie also beats an old drum, war is bad. Vietnam Era generations have this well ingrained in their belief system. The message in the movie is not delivered with enough weight to sway the belief's of the Hawks in the world.<br/><br/>I found the book to be thought provoking. I found the movie to be shallow by comparison."

"nobbytatoes","9","15","30","18 October 2006"," engaging, greatly crafted film
","One of the staples in sci-fi is a dystopia future. Film makers have constantly from films inception, imagined where we are heading into the unknown and unforeseeable. The deterring part is our future is a dystopia hell, utopia is not even a shimmer light in the distant. Based upon P.D. James's, not so distant future, novel, Children of Men shows humanity in its decline, sliding to extinction. Women are unable to become pregnant, with no answer to this mystery. Humanity rests its hopes on the worlds youngest man, Diego Ricardo, who was murdered along with the worlds hope.<br/><br/>Ex-activist, now bureaucrat Theodore Faron, lives in war ridden London. Along with womens infertility, the world is struck with climate change, pollution, illegal immigrants, terrorism and society just falling apart; the seems about to explode. Theo's only escape is friend Jasper, an aging hippie selling marijuana. Theo is contacted by his past lover Julian, who wants to get a refugee girl, Kee, to the coast. Things are complicated when Theo discovers that Kee is pregnant.<br/><br/>When film makers started to predict our future, their vision was decades away, and the likely hood of it coming to fruition was minimal. Lately films of our bleak heading, lurk around the corner, with Children of Men set in 2027, with the plight of womens infertility only a few years away, starting in 2009. Children of Men is basically holding a mirror to our faces, this is where we're heading if things don't's change. An apocalypse not high from above but of our own creation.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuarón has crafted a master piece of art. Visually Children of Men is exceedingly detailed. So much information, references and detail is placed in every scene. To Alfonso's credit, it never reaches visually overloading, with a style reminiscent to Blade Runner. The cinematography is amazingly shot, with grainy visual harmoniously working to Alfonso's bleak vision; dragging us through trenches, war zones and refugee camps.<br/><br/>With fat to chew, intelligent sub-text is injected. Current war on terrorism, global warming and pollution, governments treatment of illegal immigrants, and the all world collapse with society tear itself inside out. Its looks like time has gone cyclical and humanity is reverting back to caveman ideals; not the sophisticated utopia we always dreamed about. Offsetting the constant downtrodden view, is a wicked slice of humor, perfectly formed in Jasper, and one strange, yet highly effective soundtrack.<br/><br/>Clive Owen believably shows Theo's turn into his unwanted hero status. Dropping his activist dealings, unpleasant being dragged back into the world he left. Michael Caine is solid and heart warming as Jasper, with his childish jokes. Julianne Moore is also strong with hidden strength in Julian. Claire-Hope Ashitey is beautiful and wonderful as Kee.<br/><br/>With so much going on; ideas, concepts and sub-text too dig into, Children of Men is one of the most intriguing and unique films."
"allenbell","9","15","30","22 September 2006"," Virtuoso film making from Cuarón
","OK lets get straight to the point, this is the easily the best action movie I've seen for several years - a gripping story, believable character acting combined with taught direction and thankfully sans cringe-making dialogue and Hollywood sentimentality.<br/><br/>Whether the plot line bears any resemblance to the novel is frankly irrelevant - the screenplay successfully creates a recognisable (near) future world without relying on hover cars and camp Space 1999 type fashions.<br/><br/>The extended scene following Clive Owens character as he battles through the immigrant compound betters in intensity and realism any movie battle scene I can think of (yep including the beach landing in Private Ryan) - it looks like its been shot in one continuous take. That being the case I'm still trying to work out how Cuarón managed to stage such a frantic, exciting and bloody scene.<br/><br/>Sadly, the local Odeon where I watched the film had only about a dozen or so in the audience - pretty rubbish for a first night, especially considering the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>Children of men works on several levels; as a thriller it betters recent Hollywood action flicks; as an example of virtuoso film making (stunning cinematography) and on another level it offers a damning indictment on the increasingly right wing political morality currently prevalent in UK and US government (but you don't have to read that into it to enjoy the movie).<br/><br/>And as its sort of a British movie, you should go see it."
"Sevenmercury7","9","15","30","22 September 2006"," A grim and gritty masterpiece
","The basic premise of 'Children of Men' is so wonderfully simple, it's almost mythic. The women of the world have been infertile for 18 years; hope has vanished from humanity; then... we meet a lone, pregnant girl, and her survival becomes the epitome of mankind's struggle.<br/><br/>All political and religious subtext aside (and there's a fair bit), this apocalyptic tale really grips through that central idea. A disillusioned man (Clive Owen) is tasked to lead the young mother through nightmarish southern England, to freedom and the 'Human Project', a secret organisation that may or may not exist. What happens on the way is riveting and often shocking. This is a vision of the future both gritty and disturbing, and director Alfonso Cuaron has a fantastic ability to evoke setting.<br/><br/>Owen's character arc is traditional for this type of reluctant hero, but he's highly effective here. I don't think I've ever seen him overplay a scene. Michael Caine is good as an eccentric old hippie with it all figured out. What impressed me most about 'Children of Men' though, was how real everything seemed. Set in 2027, it could've been tomorrow but for a few clever touches here and there to show where we might be headed.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with the choices made by the filmmakers, and I expect you will be too."

Forget all the rave reviews and judge the movie on it's own merit.<br/><br/>I am not going to throw in any specific spoilers here. I knew the movie would be very dark and not have an optimistic tone which is fine by me. However, the characters are throw away. There is zero sympathy built for any of the characters and I didn't care what happened to them. In fact, I didn't care what happened to the world in this obnoxiously filmed movie overusing hand cams and making the future look the present.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is so anti-climatic and ridiculously inane that it makes you wonder how this movie got the green light.<br/><br/>For the life of me I cannot figure out where the $80 million was spent. It looks like 2 million was spent on the movie and $78 million was handed over to critics to say how great the movie is.<br/><br/>There are better episodes of the Outer Limits and a similar episode exploring the same themes done much better.<br/><br/>I gave the movie a 5 out of ten which is generous only because of what the movie tried to accomplish. Unfortunately, it falls way short of being anything great.<br/><br/>If by any chance you are watching it because of the references to Blade Runner then skip this one and watch Blade Runner again which was a dark toned movie about the future done right."

","When I asked my friend Eric why he left the stereo on when he left the apartment, he said he was creating a soundtrack to his life. Two things: One, does this mean his life is at his apartment even when he isn't? Two, you need a first rate taste in music to go with a line like that. Eric may have it, but one guy who sure as hell doesn't is prolific screenwriter/director Alfonso Cuarón. His ""Children of Men"" relies heavily on music to set scenes and moods, but his choice of music is gruesome. Khan the tone-deaf doorman (in ""Music & Lyrics"") has better taste I'm sure. Here is the tragic case of a mostly well-made movie with a serious message ruined by the cheesiest, sleaziest soundtrack in motion picture history, featuring, among other abominations, a hate crime of a muzak cover version of ""Ruby Tuesday"" by one Franco Battiato, John Lennon's bland ""Bring on the Lucie"", and culminating in Jarvis Cocker's (Cunts are still) ""Running the World"", not a bad song in itself, but in such poor taste as the final chord in a story about infertility that I don't know what to say."

","I usually do not respond intensely to films of future dystopia, so I was not expecting much when I went to Children of Men. But my heart was racing while watching this movie, and my mind is still reeling with its images and depictions of Britain as a war zone of refugee camps, random violence, omnipresent police, religious sects and the disillusion of humans who for a generation haven't heard a newborn baby's cry. I'm sure my strong reaction to the film comes in part from the breathtaking camera-work, including several exceptionally long takes during action sequences which must have been incredibly difficult to shoot. Yes, there are plenty of explosions, stray bullets and blood, but the technical effects entailed are not what draws one's attention.<br/><br/>To avoid being a spoiler, I can't share all the various images and features of the action that add up to one of the most unsettling, apocalyptic visions I've ever seen. But I will say that part of their effectiveness comes from these being presented as a given, not something to be laboriously explained. Clive Owen gives an excellent, understated performance as a once-idealistic bureaucrat propelled into a battle. This film would be pretty awful if some sort of hammy Hollywood actor like Tom Cruise were in the lead. But such an actor was not chosen because this film has far more intelligence in the making than most."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Based on P.D. James' novel, stud-director Alfonso Cuaron (Y tu mama tambien, last Harry Potter movie) delivers a stunningly bleak and intense version of the future and the human fight for survival.<br/><br/>If you have seen the preview or read the book, you know the premise. Claire-Hope Ashitey plays Kee, the first woman to get pregnant in almost two decades. With non-stop warring between multiple factions (that we never quite understand), a smaller though equally intense battle is on to save and control Kee's new baby. Getting involved with the mission are Julianne Moore, Clive Owen, Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Owen and Moore are former spouses who lost their kid and Ejiofor has ulterior motives.<br/><br/>Caine is a hoot as Owen's friend and guru and Owen himself probably offers up his best film performance to date. Make no mistake, this is a bleak and extremely intense chase movie. Mother-to-be Kee is a bit ""wicked"", but we can't help but root for her to make it through to the good guys ... the mysterious ""Human Project"". Yes, I know all of this sounds a bit ridiculous, but it is such a well crafted movie and story that it somehow not only works, but sucks you in.

","This film presents a very disturbing future. A mystery complaint causes all the women in the planet to become infertile. Rather than worrying about the end of mankind the planet seems more interested in the death of the youngest person. The world has descended into chaos and Britain is close to being a fascist state. Yes, this is a very disturbing vision of the future, but somehow it didn't ring true. I'm all for suspending belief when I go to the movies, but it just didn't ring true to me. I certainly hope that's the case anyway.<br/><br/>The plot is slightly disappointing, but the acting and the action clips make up for this. I've always been a big fan of Julianne Moore and this film sees another fine supporting performance. Michael Caine also puts in a good performance and Owen in the lead role is very competent. Well worth checking out."
"PeadarG","1","21","46","31 October 2006"," Bad basis for story
","I had high hopes for this film before seeing it, however after about 15 minutes I knew we were on a downhill slide.<br/><br/>The background of the story (the idea that humankind has become infertile) was always a bit far-fetched. There were other overtones, such as Bush's influence (which seems improbable considering that the film is set a number of years into the future), which made the whole endeavour look silly.<br/><br/>One thing I will highly commend this film on is the scenery, a well-done fusion of Britain with a pre-1990 Eastern Bloc influence. The attention to detail in the portrayal of the destruction, decay and rot that visited British society was simply superb. Broken lifts, windows falling out, people living in scrapped buses - very well done indeed.<br/><br/>On the whole I found the film monotonous and boring. I felt little personal empathy with any of the characters, in fact it was hard to decide who was even good or bad. None of the characters made any substantial development from the first few minutes of the film - we knew little if anything about any of them that we didn't already know at the beginning. Many of the confrontational scenes went on too long, we were none the wiser for seeing them for 5 minutes instead of one.<br/><br/>I found this film tedious and could not wait for it to be over."
"fwomp","9","13","26","9 January 2007"," Hits You Deep Down
","After watching CHILDREN OF MEN, a very strange thing happened to me in the twenty-four hours since seeing it: I'm actually growing to appreciate the film more and more every minute. That's a distinct strength of this film over others that are trying to crowd it out for your almighty box-office buck. There's no instant gratification, no sex/nudity just for their own sake, no violence for the sake of violence (although there's plenty in here, it's just threaded into the story exceptionally well).<br/><br/>Based on P.D. James' novel by the same name, Children of Men focuses on the death of birth in the year 2027. That is, the sudden and unexplained infertility of all women (and possibly men). Birth rates rapidly hit the zero mark, playgrounds fall into ruin, and mankind decides that war is the only answer. This is an interesting paradox as the premise is on the fact that men will fight over anything, including the death of life. Some sort of inherent gene is sparked in mankind whenever a perceived loss is fixated upon (democracy, oil, land, etc.), and when children disappear from that equation, it's time to pull out the gun. This isn't stated specifically in the film, per se, except for once when Theo (Clive Owen, the main character) and Miriam (Pam Ferris, a nurse) are looking out at a defunct swing-set and Miriam comments on how much the world misses the sound of children. ""We never knew how much we'd miss that sound,"" she says. And so the loss is given mention just this once, but is ""felt"" throughout the movie.<br/><br/>But all is not gloom and doom. Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) is the only pregnant woman on the planet and is hidden away by an underground network of freedom fighters who's main goal is to try and gain rights for illegal aliens in Great Britain (many nations have closed their borders in order to prevent the spread of any possible infection that might be causing the infertility). Julian (Julianne Moore) is the leader of these fighters and approaches Theo in order to obtain traveling papers for Kee (Theo having family that can access to such things). Initially Theo refuses, but money enters into it as does Theo's own curiosity toward Julian (they were once married and had a child who'd died during a flu pandemic). Initially Theo is unaware of Kee's pregnancy, too, and once he learns of it you can see on his face the sense of importance that this new life might bring to mankind. Theo plods on through war-torn streets, pulling Kee along with him in an attempt to make it to ""The Human Project."" This project is never fully explained but enough clues are dropped to infer that this is the one place where babies might be born. Kee and Theo must make it to a ship off the coast of Britain in order to secures Kee's safe passage. But death lurks around every corner for Theo, Kee, and her baby. Everyone who comes into contact with this trio eventually dies off, denoting the need for death in order for new life to spring forth. From Michael Cain's pot-smoking persona as Theo's oldest friend, to Julianne Moore's forced martyrdom, no one seems able to escape the clutches of death that surround Kee and this unborn child. Maybe even Theo, our main character.<br/><br/>The biggest strength of the film is the screenplay. It seems to have been very well thought out, letting the audience run through the film with the characters rather than forcibly monologuing information to us. The acting is good and the stark city streets are achingly morbid in appearance (shot using lots of gray color), giving the viewer the ability to see and feel humanity's decline.<br/><br/>As stated earlier, this isn't your instant gratification-style flick that'll have you applauding at the end. It hits the watcher deep down on a visceral and subconscious level, an appreciative ember that'll grow the further away one gets from the theater."
"davideo-2","4","17","36","11 October 2006"," Nice spectacle, but I noticed little else
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Nothing like a science fiction film with an interesting concept and Children of Men certainly has that, if nothing else. Adapted from a novel by PD James and directed by Alfonso Cuaron, we open in a futuristic London with police marshalling the streets, immigrants being rounded up and caged like animals and a devastating fertility crisis drying up the population, making it a worldwide tragedy when the world's youngest man and the hope for humanity's future, an 18 year old soccer player, is killed. In this depressing climate, dejected office worker Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) ambles about just trying to get by in a world gone to pot. But he gets a rude awakening when old flame Julian (Julianne Moore) quite explosively arrives back in his life and propositions him to help her and her rag tag henchmen transport a pregnant immigrant named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to safety under the noses of the authorities. With no other meaningful purpose in his life, Theodore agrees- but it doesn't go as smoothly as he'd have hoped and no one appears as they seem.<br/><br/>The film grabs you with it's interesting concept and bleak depiction of the future. Owen's not an actor, shall we say, who prepped me up when I learned he was in the lead role (as I'm sure may have been the case with others) but he's credible enough here, a far cry from his wooden worst. Moore does the best with her limited screen time and the unfortunately named Ashitey is effective in her role. There's good work from Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Pam Ferris in supporting roles as well. Performances and spectacle wise, there are no complaints with the film. Strangely there's just nothing to make the film truly memorable or one I'd want to see again. The interesting subject matter has evaporated by the end, by which time the film has become a slow and plodding drag which seems to go nowhere. <br/><br/>The film bears a similarity with another British film from a few years ago called 28 Days Later. As a futuristic/zombie film, that one worked much better. **"
"ts_error","6","7","12","9 August 2007"," Good, but over-rated and disappointing
","Children of Men was highly rated in 2006 and, as I write this, it's in the IMDb top-250. I saw it yesterday and I was slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>Children of Men is based on a novel by P.D. James (which I haven't read, by the way). The movie depicts the UK in the year 2027. Women can't have children anymore and the whole world is in chaos. In the UK illegal immigrants are put into refugee camps. Theo Faron, a former activist, gets located by his ex Julian and discovers that a woman named Kee, an illegal immigrant, is pregnant.<br/><br/>That's pretty much the whole story and there are problems with it.<br/><br/>First of all, it's incredibly shallow. No real explanation is given to the question ""Why are women not capable of having children"". Some thought should have been put into it. It's one of the central themes in the movie. Second, characters lack depth, especially the main character Theo. I think he is a lame excuse for a main character. Even though he's had a tragic past, I just couldn't sympathize with him at all. Clive Owen's mediocre performance didn't help, either. However, Michael Caine made a great performance as Jasper, the weed-loving cartoonist.<br/><br/>Although the story itself is flat as a pancake, the other elements of the movie work well. The dark tone of the movie is excellent, the camera work has been done in a beautiful but grotesque way, especially in the later scenes of the movie and the chaos is portrayed well. Those are the factors that tighten the grip of the movie.<br/><br/>But these elements can't completely save Children of Men. I think it's one of director Cuaron's worst movies because of the lack of a decent story and the emptiness of the characters. I think that at a length of 2+ hours this would have been a much better film. Now it's too compact for its own good."

Maybe it's a ""read the book first"" kind of movie, because I honestly don't understand how it was rated so highly. It's currently ranked higher than Gone With the Wind, for goodness sake! <br/><br/>It's a shame, because Children of Men has a great premise worthy of a more global exploration.

Also, the concept of an infertile human race is intriguing and original.<br/><br/>However, i failed to make a connection with any of the characters, making it harder to really care what happens to them. I haven't put my finger on why i didn't care for the characters. I think it's because they didn't seem real enough to me. They seemed very written. Clive Owen did a fine job in the leading role and i actually did care a bit about him, and Michael Caine was kinda fun, but other than that, the characters seemed like they didn't even care that they found a key to to saving humanity.<br/><br/>Perhaps on a second viewing, which i am totally not against, i'll see something i missed and make a more emotional investment in the film.

"uvcyc","10","7","12","16 February 2007"," The Lasting Message - Wrote this for my English class
","It is the year 2027. Women have been infertile for a generation, and the world has fallen into chaos. Britain, the only remotely stable country remaining, is plagued by terrorist attacks and internal strife. Enter Theo, a former political activist who has given up his rebellious ways for a dismal, bureaucratic job. He is coerced by his former lover into helping a refugee, Kee, escape the country. Kee would otherwise be forced into a labor camp  reminiscent of those used by Nazis  like all other refugees. But Kee must be saved from imprisonment, because she has a secret. She is pregnant.<br/><br/>This is Children of Men, a film utterly depressing in its view of things to come. The sky is almost perpetually grey and human rights are crushed under government oppression. The film is shot with Theo in every frame, giving the audience an intimate view of the decaying world and how it affects him. This perspective particularly reveals that in such misery, there is still a ray of hope for mankind, and it lies in Kee's womb.<br/><br/>The central theme of Children of Men is debatable. Is it a political film criticizing current world affairs, likening modern government philosophy to Orwellian totalitarianism, or is it a story of humanity? The political viewer finds support for his opinion in the very first scene. Theo ducks behind a newspaper stand as the coffee shop he just left explodes. It is easily mistakable for the many bombings that occur on civilian targets in the Middle East. The political undertone of the situation: the government planted the bomb in the coffee shop.<br/><br/>To defend a political interpretation, one might recall a television ad Theo sees. It hails Britain as the last bastion of freedom in the world and orders all loyal citizens to report refugees so they may be sent to labor camps; the ad bears an uncanny resemblance to the nationalist, pro-war bulletins broadcast on American news networks. One might notice the powerful symbolism evident as Theo walks into the entrance of the labor camp under the sign ""Homeland Security."" One might remark that the rebels marching through the ruined streets of the labor camp firing guns into the air parallels the current situation in the Middle East, where men calling for change also take to decrepit streets with revolution on their minds and weapons in their hands. Theo's friend and confidante, with whom he shares his most secret thoughts, is a former political cartoonist whose every comment insinuates dislike of the government. And, in perhaps the least veiled criticism of all, the government and those with political aspirations are the antagonists.<br/><br/>However, there is something to be said for the fact that the most memorable images in Children of Men are not of political symbolism, but of simple displays of humanity. Audiences are speechless with wonder as they watch Theo deliver Kee's baby in a crumbling apartment. The shouts echoing from the streets disappear, there is a deep silence, and then Kee's baby begins to cry. Such a simple human thing, the first breath of a child, is magical in this film.<br/><br/>Later, Theo and Kee are separated in a standoff between militants and British soldiers. As Theo runs through the tenement looking for Kee and her child, artillery shells destroy the building around him. Refugees fall to the ground as they are hit by bullets streaming through broken walls, yet Theo sees none of this; he hears none of this; he is oblivious to the death surrounding him. All he hears is the sound of Kee's baby crying.<br/><br/>In what is the most emotional moment of the entire film, Theo and Kee emerge from the tenement. They are unarmed, and Kee carries the baby as they face hundreds of armed soldiers. Yet these men, ruthless and trained to kill, are rendered speechless by the noise they hear: the cry of an infant. They lower their weapons in disbelief. Some fall to their knees and pray. It is a scene both terrible and beautiful  on a battlefield where so many have died, everything is silenced by Kee's baby.<br/><br/>Yes, it can be argued that Children of Men is political, however it would be an insult to the film to brand its legacy with something as transient as politics. It has a timeless message, one that transcends any political situation. This is especially clear when Theo and Kee emerge from the tenement. Soldier and refugee forget their differences. They are the same under the spell of the infant's cry  they are human. This, if anything, reveals the film's ultimate point: humanity conquers all differences."

","This wasn't released in these parts till mid January 07 so its an 07 movie for me. What can I say about this movie?!?!?!?! The animal metaphors are rampant throughout other than that you have great performances from pretty much everyone across the board. In the not too distant future women are infertile and an expected extinction date has been set. That is until a woman finally becomes pregnant and is the hands of guerrilla terrorists who are trying to smuggle her to safety. The backdrop is a world unhinged and in turmoil and England where Men is set is pretty much the only country still standing-barely. War and riots are everywhere. Immigrants ie those not born of English descent are put into captivity ala those during WW2. There are a lot of details and large pieces of the story omitted for what I can only assume are for artistic purposes because I have yet to read the book. Children of Men is a love or hate kind of affair. Its the little details that are captivating and believe me I have yet to see this film twice so I have not yet seen them all. For instance pot is still illegal however euthanasia isn't in fact it is sold in packs called Quietus. Get it?!?! I wont say whether im for or against either issue but this made me laugh very hard and has embedded itself in my brain ever since. There is also a huge Pink Floyd reference that literally had me leaping out my seat in astonishment. Everything current is reflected in Children of Mens future which is to say that this issue presented in the film is the proverbial last straw for mankind. I just have to say Micheal Caine was just flat out amazing. Typically at the end of any given year I can barely count the movies that I loved and will watch over & over on one hand. Although I am movie obsessed the Clockwork Oranges and Fight Clubs are few and far between. I have seen 3 movies thus far in 2007-Children of Men,Perfume & Pans Labyrinth that have soiled my movie going experience for the rest of the year. These three films are of that same blue blooded die hard CLASSICS that will live on FOREVER. Three in less than a month not years apart?!?!?!?!? I am honestly afraid to step into a cineplex right now. There's just no way anything else is going to be as good as Children of Men or the above two mentioned. Oh yeah there are flaws but in this case what does it matter to point them out this is a solid free thinker that will have your hairs raised for its entire duration. Form whatever opinion you will about Children of Men but if this movie doesn't motivate or move you at least once please please I urge you to check your pulse."

"paul_e_c","10","7","12","16 January 2007"," Can't stop thinking about this movie
","This is not a movie that fits into the recent formula films we are seeing out of Hollywood. Nor is it the garbage that critics and award voters like but that no one can stand watching. (e.g. Babal) The less you know about this film before you see it the better. It is hard to describe; it is not a 'feel good' movie but it is a fantastic film and story. I actually found the film creepy and scary for a simple reason, it could easily happen. The film is NOT in the distant future, it does not have space ships, dinosaurs, dragons, aliens, ridiculous science, or anything remotely hard to believe. Like most good stories, especially sci-fi, the story is based on 'what if'. What if something happens, how would that something change other things? Now I loved ""Reign of Fire"" (also based in England), that movie is 'what if dragons are real and woke up'. Great movie but really, how likely is it that dragons live under London? The 'what if' in this movie is not only easy to believe it is more plausible than people would think. If you are a science type person this film will freak you out because it could so easily happen. Can't wait to see it again."
"jaredmobarak","10","7","12","2 January 2007"," Very odd, what happens in a world without children's voicesChildren of Men
","Although I have been waiting months to see the film based on its trailer, I couldn't help but be disappointed by how much that tease gave away. I remember that no matter how engrossing the visuals and music were in that two-minute clip, I could not shake the feeling I had just seen the entire film condensed. Thankfully, after finally seeing it (hopefully it will make it to Buffalo soon so I can catch the amazing cinematography on the big screen), I can say that the trailer really just shows the tip of the iceberg for what will happen. Not only does it deceive in a good way, it hides the real emotional journey that the movie takes. <br/><br/>In twenty years our world will be on a steady road to manmade Armageddon. For the last eighteen years, women have been unable to conceive a child and this horror has allowed countries to go on a rampage to try and preserve their own ideals, as every day is a day closer to extinction. Wars are raging everywhere and it seems only Britain has been able to fortify itself to try and sustain what life is left for the small hope of survival. Refugees from all around the globe have tried to seek asylum in England, but are turned away or housed in detention camps until they can be disposed of. A group of insurgents, the Fishes, are trying to combat with the government's harsh policies of immigration, however, their war just begins a more rapid extermination of humanity as bombs and bullets fly throughout the streets. Maybe the bombs are acts of terrorism by the rebels, maybe they are set by the government to instill fear in the against the insurgents, either way the world has been shattered behind recognition.<br/><br/>Clive Owen plays a former activist named Theo who has lost faith in the causes he used to live to defend. He works a menial job and longs for the visits to the countryside with an old friend Jasper, (played wonderfully out-of-character by Michael Caine), to hold onto a small sliver of what life used to be. When kidnapped by the Fishes, led by his ex-wife (the stalwart Julianne Moore) whose own faith in the cause has multiplied since the same event which dissolved Owen's, he becomes a part of what could be the miracle that will save the world. His involvement in this mission doesn't as much reinvigorate his belief in doing what he thinks is right as instead shake him from the meaningless life he's lived these past years, awakening him from his debilitating self-loathing. He is able to see first-hand the atrocities being committed and decides to put his life at risk for this young woman who's miraculous pregnancy could save the world. Theo doesn't do it for mankind, he keeps his goals closer to home. In saving this woman's life, so her baby can live, he might be able to forgive himself for the life chance has created.<br/><br/>Owen is superb and he needs to be. Theo is in practically every scene as Cuarón has decided on using a cinema verite style staying close by in a fly-on-the-wall capacity. As an audience, we are thrust into the action as it happens all around our hero and ourselves. The singular vision Cuarón has successfully attempted here is unfathomable. There are multiple instances where we are treated to long takes lasting from five to ten minutes at a time. (I read an article that these shots are in fact digital composites bridged together to appear seamless; even so, the accomplishment is astonishing) One sequence towards the middle of the film has us inside a car with four characters. We spin 360 degrees around the interior in order to stay up on the conversation throughout and once the car comes under attack by savages, the view still doesn't break until after the car finally stops and the camera gets out to view the roadside. Whether you end up liking the movie or not, you must appreciate the technical achievement that went into it.<br/><br/>Along with the fantastic visual flair and top-notch performances is the simple yet profound story structure. Like Cuarón did with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, (having almost everything from the novel somewhere in the background), he gives the audience the benefit of the doubt. He understands that the medium of film is not the same as a book. With film we can see the descriptions and events occurring as though we are a part of the action; there is nothing more I hate then a character explaining something to someone that already knows for the sake of us, the viewers, being totally aware in case we missed extrapolating it for ourselves in the scene before. Does it matter where the troops are coming from? Does it matter what scientists are doing to find a cure? Why are babies no longer able to be born? None of these questions need to be systematically answered as the true story is of a man finding a reason to live again and his quest to save his young friend and her child. Less is definitely more and Cuarón truly understands how to mold cinema into giving us the answers we need without spoon-feeding. The brilliant performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Claire- Hope Ashitey are enhanced by the fact we know little of their past. We know just as much as Theo and therefore can relate to his actions rather than second-guessing everyone's motives because we know more than the protagonist. We experience it all along with the characters on screen. Cuarón is not telling a story that has happened, but instead allowing us to be a part of what's happening right now."

"piousbox","10","7","12","6 December 2006"," Visually stunning and thematically captivating
","This movie contains everything that a futuristic movie should have: a plot line centered around the extinction of human race, set in a politically charged situation; the struggle of a man against the greater collective forces, and ultimate redemption of human race through fate and individual heroism. The film is superbly produced, the dialogue is sharp and canny, the visuals--oh, i love the visuals, the journalistic style is so appealing. This film is much better than pop Hollywood movies where a concept is presented to you so meticulously, it's practically shoved down your throat. _Children of men_ does not do that. It gives you an image for a brief few seconds, and it's your decision whether or not to dwell on it. As a result the movie moves fast, fast, fast. Watch it twice and you'll still enjoy it. There is not a boring second of footage. I highly recommend this movie to all sci-fi fans, readers of cyberpunk novels, and just about anyone who enjoys action, fast & sharp. I'd give it a nine but oh, here's what makes this movie great: the jokes. There are moments in the film that are supercharged with tension, action, drama, and... humor. It's golden. Ten out of ten."

","I felt like I was living alongside the main characters. I even cried tears of joy for the first time in a very long time! The plot is very solid. The only reason I rated it 9 instead of 10 is because some details that I would have liked to have been explained were (purposefully) left up to the imagination. I strongly suggest that anyone who is even moderately interested in the plot sees this movie: I doubt that you will be disappointed. Julianne Moore's character is present for too brief of a time, but the time she does appear is one of her best, most realistic appearances to date. And even though many parts of the movie are shocking and sad, there is a great deal of humor in it."
"windymilla","8","7","12","19 November 2006"," A future classic
","I really enjoyed this film - it works well as a piece of entertainment and something with a bit more bight. Like a lot of dystopia-future type films, it says a lot about the present, particularly the tabloid hysteria over immigration (interestingly there's quite a few Polish people in this film, something of a bugbear for the gutter press at the moment)and the footage we see everyday of Iraq. I think this film would sit nicely alongside Brazil, Dark City, or even Three Kings. Technically it's superb - it looks brilliant, and was nicely sombre and gritty, which worked fantastically with the special effects. The battle scenes were truly breathtaking, as were the sudden, almost off-hand explosions. It ends nicely as well, avoiding the temptation to 'over-tell' the story beyond its natural ending as far too many films have done recently. The actors all give good performances here, especially Clive Owen who makes a natural hero without resorting to absurd posturing, and Michael Caine is brilliant as ever, at once familiar yet completely different, even making 'pull my finger' fit into this movie somehow! All in all, this is really a film worth seeing. I just hope we can look back in 20 years and laugh at how wrong this prediction was..."
"jak68","10","7","12","10 October 2006"," That rarest of things...a film better than the book
","I avoided this film initially because the religious overtones of the book really put me off what was otherwise a great idea. Thankfully these aspects are played down. Although the terrorists are called FISHES and they are expecting the second coming in the shape of a miracle birth. The film chooses to focus on telling a story of hope out of hopelessness. Everything is unrelentingly grim,grey and all the better for it. Rarely have I seen such a vivid dystopia of a possible future,and it works so well. The sci-fi elements are played down so that they become just a part of the story(in the same way as say,Gattaca,for example). Best of all,Clive Owen finally has a vehicle where he can show that he is a good actor. Sir Micheal Caine has never been funnier on screen in ages and almost steals the film as Owens' pot smoking friend.Julianna Moore makes the most of her part and limited screen time (and looks stunning)her hair, a rare glimpse of colour in an otherwise grey world. The ending may be a bit trite, but the film wins overall because it focuses on contemporary issues making this future even more plausible."

Yes thats right I am shallow. Should you get this out on DVD, make sure it is played on a surround sound system with DTS and a decent sized sub.

","I recently watched this film and I have to say it blew me away. I'm not usually a fan of Clive Owen, but I think his role in this film was spot on. Micheal Kane plays a successful futuristic type of hippie, again a spot on performance. The Director didn't stick to standard camera views and managed to keep the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the whole film.The story itself is intriguing, although could possibly do with a bit more explaining, and it shows quite a vivid future for the united Kingdom. Director uses some powerful images to emphasize the scene and the story, but still manages to keep it within a reasonable limit. The message is quite subtle throughout the film and I believe it shows a unique view of what the future holds for us.Absolutely worth a watch."
"jjeffrey","9","7","12","4 October 2006"," Close to now; not quite now
","The enthusiasm of many of the reviews of this picture is entirely justified. Though it is unlikely to make anyone feel 'good', it will offer a thought provoking and chillingly plausible vision of a world sliding into despair. The pseudo-documentary camera work is slightly jarring at times, but lends further weight to the film's sense of being grounded in a realist tradition.<br/><br/>Performances have been hailed, deservedly, as very good, but Pam Ferris deserves a special mention: we know what Caine and co. are capable of but it is refreshing to see her create a warm, believable character from what could otherwise be a flimsy 'tree-hugger' stereotype. That is one of the qualities that makes this a remarkable film. There is little of the 'throwaway' about the performances; the settings are entirely believable. Above all, the sense of the here-and-now extended 21 years hence is anchored in the presentation of a world very like 2006 but where the 'Grand Design' take on ecologically sound or penthouse living is taken to its ultimate conclusion and where a turbo-charged UKIP sets national policy.<br/><br/>All this and King Crimson in the soundtrack!"
"come2whereimfrom","8","7","12","28 September 2006"," what a film.
","Set in the not too distant future in Britain, Cuarón's 'Children of Men' is a bleak look at the planet after a virus has wiped out fertility. The film starts with the death of the worlds youngest person an 18 year old boy and quickly goes on to establish a picture of the world as a pretty messed up place. Terrorists, street violence, splinter groups, homeless, armed police, immigration at an uncontrollable level, towns turned into detention centres etc its not a nice place to be. Theo gets by being either drunk or hung-over or both. He hates his job and is haunted by memories of his past and spends his days skiving off and smoking weed with jasper (a nice little turn from Michael Caine). It is only when Theo, the former activist, is contacted by his ex, the head of a terror group called the 'fishes', that his life is turned upside down. They have in their possession the miracle the world has been waiting for, a pregnant woman called Kee, and everyone has different designs on how they should use her baby to help mankind. Julian the fishes ultra cool leader knows that the only person she can really trust is her old flame Theo and so entrusts him to deliver Kee to a group of scientists who may be able to find out how in the world she managed to get pregnant and thus potentially saving mankind. From the start of this amazing film with its washed out hues and run down streets your right in there, in amongst the muck and riots, graffiti and crime, it's a skin crawling feeling. It is acted superbly and has a script that contains bursts of black humour within its dark underbelly. It is littered with clever references to life today and is even satirical at points. But the real treat for any film fan is the direction, it is at all times interesting but particularly in two tracking shots it is breathtaking. The first involving a car chase that is a nine minute long take with such a complex set up you almost sense it an impossibility. The last being an even longer tracking/set piece (that apparently has two hidden cuts) but is still a visual treat that really makes the films ending something to behold. As I think a lot of people have said already this really is the thinking mans action movie. At last a big film with something to say and what a way to say it."

","Children of men is warning. It's an opinion from someone who is fed up with the state of the world and extrapolates his vision of today's world to a not too distant future.<br/><br/>The world today exists only out of sound bites and religious arrogance: The evil-doers, democracy, freedom, natural resources on and on and on.... Off course everyone knows God is on their side. They are right, everyone else is wrong. If THEY won't listen...lets bomb them.<br/><br/>But what if God decides to leave mankind altogether? That means everyone is wrong. What then? That's the main point of CoM. Mankind loses it's ability to procreate. This means ALL of mankind will be gone...within the next 70 to 80 years. Anarchy rules the world with the exception of Great Britain. The rest of the world is in chaos. Asylumseekers (white and black alike) try to get into Britain, only to be handled as third class citizens. Terrorists and activists say they are there to fight for the rights of illegals, but a closer look reveals they only care about themselves. CoM is not perfect, so is its script, but it tries to find a balance between art and entertainment. In a world filled with brain dead films like Click, My Super Ex Girlfriend or National Treasure, this film is a diamond. And the courage of its makers should be cherished.<br/><br/>Many people do not or will not like this film. That means they don't like today's world. They should be shocked when a coffeeshop is bombed - killing everyone inside, they should cringe when an activist is shot and dies. They should not like it when a supposed asylum seeker is yanked of a bus and blindfolded by armed men. But this is the world today. Why is it that we are shocked by a film (fiction) and are unaffected by news footage (real world)? To say that this filmmaker glorifies violence for entertainment, is to truly expose yourself as ignorant. Close your eyes, count to ten, change the channel and everything will be fine. Sorry, it won't. Open your eyes and take action. That's what Children of Men does."
"moviemanMA","10","10","19","14 January 2007"," The essence of hope
","Thinking about the near future is not the best way to cheer yourself up nowadays, with depictions of social and political unrest, rampant drug use, and all of the other ""downers"" that add up to paint a bleak and dreary picture. Suddenly out of the darkness comes hope.<br/><br/>Based on the science fiction novel by P.D. James, acclaimed director Alfonso Cuarón brings to the screen Children of Men. The story of how one man, one teenager, and one miracle can potentially bring hope to a world that is filled with fear, struggle, and war.<br/><br/>The year is 2027. The world has been struck with a terrible phenomenon. Women across the globe cannot procreate. To add to the chaos, the world's youngest living person has just died at the age of 18. Hope is a thing of the past and panic has replaced it.<br/><br/>A man who had hope once, Theodore Faron (Clive Owen), has just been reunited with her ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) but some rather drastic circumstances. He is made aware of a group of people called the Human Project whose main goal is to help better the quality of life and to somehow find a way to continue the world's population. All he is asked to do is to gain access across the isle with a girl so she can reach the Human Project.<br/><br/>Skeptical at first, he decides to go along with it after realizing what is afoot. The girl, Kee, is pregnant. The first child in over 18 years is about to be born and only a handful of people know about it. Theodore must travel past mounting obstacles, past all of the lies and deception, and try and help this girl and her soon to be born baby to reach her destination.<br/><br/>A very original plot for a much abused genre of film and literature. Of course, there are some aspects that are not too original like the government watching over everything and the military battling terrorists. Perhaps the most startling aspect of the story is the time in which it is taking place. There are no hover cars, no space cities, and no hologram projections. Much like Steven Spielberg's Minority Report, the world is very similar to today.<br/><br/>Cuarón's direction is powerful and oozing with emotion. At times, the camera is a character in the film. It moves amongst the characters as if a person were there along side, ready to jump in at any moment and contribute to the action going on. The shots are carefully constructed to show not just the main characters but also the devastation that is surrounding them.<br/><br/>Color in the film is practically missing. Clothes, buildings, environment, and people seem to blend in to this dreary and godforsaken world. A lot of earth tones and dull colors fill the screen, with the exception of those objects that are meant to be happy or important, like Jasper's home, and blood.<br/><br/>One aspect of today's world that is very important in the film is human emotion and the power of trust and friendship. The bonds that these people have to create to keep this girl alive show true human strength. Kee must trust Theo with her life and that of her unborn child. Theo has just met this girl but is willing to do what it takes to ensure that this baby is delivered into the world without harm, not just for Kee, or even himself. He must do this in the hope that the world will wake up and end this suffering.<br/><br/>What Cuarón has created is a perfect balance of emotions with an above average story. Children of Men is the kind of movie that sticks with you long after you leave the theatre or turn off the TV. Its power is felt not just during the film, but after, and therein lies its beauty."
"moviegeek310","10","10","19","14 January 2007"," Alfonso creates a stand out, brilliant film once again!
","Stunning, artsy, moving, well done, and disturbing are the words that come to mind when I think back on this film. Director Alfonso Cuaron - ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""- has created a dark, dreary, and bleak vision of the future, that brings to mind Ridley Scott's classic sci-fi, ""Blade Runner"". It is 2027, and women have become infertile, there are wars everywhere, and immigrants are rounded up and killed. The future looks bad until Theo (Clive Owen) agrees to help the last pregnant women get to a sanctuary named The Human Project. With the baby, the scientists might be able to save the future of mankind. <br/><br/>I'll start my praise with the actors: Clive Owen is absolutely phenomenal. He definitely deserves an Best Actor nomination, if not win it. He draws you into his character, Theo is the hero, but at the same time, a regular joe. Newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey as Kee, the last pregnant women, is amazing as well. I can already tell her future in film will be very bright indeed. Michael Caine as hippie/mentor Jasper is great as always. He is the kind of actor that the audience will never tire of, and will always welcome his warm, grandfatherly face. The cinematography is another huge factor. The tone, lighting, and coloring of the film is marvelously done. The grainy and dark look makes an already intense film all that more intense. You feel as if you are right there with Kee and Theo as they try and survive, because of that, I believe a Best Cinematography award is already in the bag.<br/><br/>As good as it it though, this movie is not for everyone. It is very violent, and depressing in its' portrayal of the future. The government goes through cities blowing everything, and anything away for no apparent reason at all. It is quite disturbing, because many of the themes portrayed in ""Children of Men"" are not far off from real life. One thing that bothered me was that many things were not explained, like why women where infertile, or why the government had turned on everyone. I'm assuming, in the case of an artsy film like this, that the director wants to leave it up to the viewer to decide some things for himself. One thing that really stood out in this film is that it shows what the world would be like without children, and it wouldn't be good. <br/><br/>""Children of Men"" is an amazing achievement in film-making, that is thought-provoking, and even has pro-life themes. If I had made my top ten movie list after seeing this, ""Children of Men"" would most defiantly be in the top five. Superb on every level. I give it 10 out of 10. Rated R for strong violence, language, some drug use, and brief nudity."
"Surecure","10","10","19","14 January 2007"," A speculative fiction masterpiece
","It appears that speculative fiction, the brainy offshoot of science-fiction, has come to vogue in recent years. Intelligent ""what-if"" movies have become more frequent than ever and Children of Men stands as being amongst the best of the best. Alfonso Cuarón leaves no stone unturned and has created as vivid a vision of a dreary, decayed future as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner painted a technologically advanced future.<br/><br/>The story of a world where all women have become infertile and civilization had decayed in the ensuing desperation is harsh enough, but Cuarón's and co-screenwriter Timothy Sexton's vision of this decayed world is so convincing that it becomes difficult to remember that it is simply a movie. Every single detail is filled in, from the stalling of technology in the face of a race coming to its extinction, to celebrity worship in a world where everyone is defined by the same dream, to the sights and sounds of a world where schools are empty and the religious feel that God has abandoned them. This film is crafted under a microscope that forgets nothing.<br/><br/>It is most interesting to watch the well-presented attitudes of the lower class who have nothing left to lose compared to the upper class who suddenly find their wealth to be meaningless and yet realize that their continued quest for material wealth is now merely an auto-response. What is most impressive is that the film does not fall into cliché or prejudice about any group. The rich are not painted as evil and the poor are not painted as saintly; the government is not painted as completely evil and rebels are not painted as being completely faultless. In this film, the good and bad of all groups is put front and center.<br/><br/>The view of the government is equal measures modern, Western civilization and Cold-War, Communist Germany. Showing the addiction to illusory security that many countries today are clamoring over and the attempts to quantify and control all aspects of living for the equally illusory socialist dream, this film really pulls no punches. As well, by showing how even civil rebellion can decay into corruption and that the government/army is made up of human beings who respond similarly to the same set of human circumstances, this film certainly succeeds in what all good science-fiction/speculative fiction should do: make us think of who we are and what are relationship is to the world around us.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuarón has crafted what is a crowning achievement in his career with this film. It stands out amongst all the films that I have seen this year and is a must-see for those who crave intelligent, honest and blunt storytelling with visuals that do not leave your mind long after the film has finished."

","I liked this movie very much, I hope it will act as an eye opener for people to see what kind of future we could be creating for ourselves if we aren't careful and do something about it before it's too late. <br/><br/>This vision of the future is very scary for the fact we can see a lot of this happening now. Much of the imagery is taken directly from what can already be seen in the news. <br/><br/>All we need is some kind of catalyst. In the movie it's a species survival crisis, in reality it's not inconceivable to think that the eventual lack of and high cost of oil could make enough of us think we are having a species crisis."

","This is the best filmed ""end of mankind"" movie I've ever seen. Usually these set-in-the-future, apocalyptic kind of films end up being clichéd and filled with overused crumbling Manhattan landmarks like they're the only buildings in the world that matter. And then invariably some nobody at the end has to (successfully) by ""fluke"" dodge 10,000 rounds of ammunition and rise to a challenge of running up the colors in true American heroism that ruins so many could-have-been good movies. I loved how this film had NONE of that. It was set in Britain in 2027 but it definitely took some political stabs at the whole ""Homeland Security"" stuff going on in the US right now. All that aside however, it was a film that took you right into the action. Many times it was all hand held, 1st person perspective filming like Saving Private Ryan meets The Bourne Identity kind of thing. I had seen the previews and I wasn't thrilled about seeing it but some friends dragged me along last night. I surprised even myself as I came out immediately raving about it."
"Soysoy","10","10","19","10 November 2006"," « 2027, an earthly odyssey » or the long-waited return of realism and true craftsmanship in mainstream cinema
","Visionary, honest and intelligent director at work. Celebrate.<br/><br/>This is the most meticulous cinematic work I've seen since Polanski's « The Pianist ». In terms of production complexity, richness and attention to detail, it's up there with « 2001 » (hence the title of this review). Everything, down to the smallest details, has benefited from an incredible commitment to sheer excellency, in-your-face realism, and at no point during the movie has my attention been drawn away by some awkward compromise that are so abundant in mainstream movies (with the exception of some dialog lines that seemed out of place, but they were scarce and were not that annoying).<br/><br/>At the purely cinematic level (dynamic staging + sets + placement of the eye + camera-work + lightning + colour + editing + effects integration), this is something that probably even De Palma couldn't have pulled off. The fluidity is so perfect and all the elements come together so seamlessly that this movie feels like first-class classical music. Actually it's technically so brilliant that it will be very difficult to outperform in the years to come. Yes, it's that good. Viewers who couldn't notice this extraordinary achievement in cinema while claiming they understand cinema, seriously need some education in what the medium really is, or should stop on the spot pretending they know what they're talking about.<br/><br/>Among the 933 movies that I've seen up to this day, I dare say that ""Children of men"" is the greatest cinematic achievement in the mainstream movie system, with the exception, maybe, of ""2001"" and ""The Abyss"". It's not an ""aesthetically"", ""artistic"" cinematic work though, it's very far from Kar Wai Wong, Greenaway, Zang Yimou, Jeunet's ""Amélie"" or Cuaron's own ""A little princess"". It's downright realistic, in a way no movie of a similar scope has ever been. It's not art-house, yet it should please even the most picky art-house lovers out there, from the mind-blowing film-making craftsmanship.<br/><br/>This stunning cinematic realism is strongly enhanced by several very long (up to 8 minutes!) real-time / single shot very, very complex action sequences, that are extremely powerful and must have been so tricky to pull off that the simple fact to imagine how they did pull it off gives me headaches. Even the overture sequence in ""Snake Eyes"" pales in comparison (which is a lot to say). In a modern movie world where almost everything we see is made from bits and pieces of heterogeneous scenes loosely glued together by frantic editing, this shines bright and puts to shame a couple of popular directors working with insanely high budgets with an increasingly complacent attitude (you know who I'm thinking of).<br/><br/>I would have very much liked to comment on the substance of the movie (which is almost as excellent as the execution) both at the story and subtext level, but found it impossible to do so without giving away too much plot elements. So I'll just say that if you've been enthralled by the meta-stories from some of these: ""Le Procès"", ""1984"", ""Brazil"", ""The Pianist"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Hair"", ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""The Devils"", ""Minority report"", ""V for Vendetta"", ""Merci la vie"", ""Full metal Jacket"", ""Andrey Rublyov"", ""Al-Massir"", you'll find in ""Children of men"" a lot to feed your thoughts and long talks with your friends.<br/><br/>And even if you dismiss all of the subtext, it's still one hell of a ride at the basic entertainment level. Enjoy!"
"Monotreme02","10","10","19","20 October 2006"," A new peak in the cinematic craft
","Children of Men is a new peak in the cinematic craft. I honestly don't know where to begin to describe just how staggeringly, remarkably mind-blowing this film is.<br/><br/>First, allow me to express my emotional response to the film. Depression. Elation. Shock. Levity. There are so many emotions I can't even begin to think of how to express in words that I experienced during the film. I was bawling throughout a majority of the length  which makes Children of Men the latest addition to the VERY limited list of films that made me cry. After the film, I sat in my car and just cried my eyes out for 20 minutes before I could even start the engine. It is one of the most emotionally incredible films I've ever seen. I cried from horror, hopelessness, disgust, depression hope, levity, exhilaration, beauty. All these emotions are experienced in their utmost extremes during the film.<br/><br/>While they seem so trivial considering just what an emotional impact the boarder picture has, it would still be a crime not to mention the technical wonders of the film. First, the conceptual ones. Nothing can even begin to compare to the level of detail, credibility, logic, and altogether brilliance of the dystopian future portrayed in Children of Men. While it is a popular theory that the human race will eventually be wiped out during an all-out nuclear war, Children of Men portrays an alternate, equally logic and brilliantly ironic end to the human race  we will die out simply from natural causes. The growth in human population has just become such a burden on nature, or God, or whatever forces you wish, and through a mysterious natural phenomenon, the entire human race becomes infertile. But the movie takes this concept and pushes it to such a depressingly horrible extreme, one can't help but admire and marvel the logic while realize the fearful truth  that we're already well on the way to this tragic future the film portrays. In an attempt to find a scapegoat, the gates of Western countries are closed and an ambitious but terrible, horrible governmental campaign sets out to rid these countries of any external influences  foreigners and immigrants are round up, put in refugee camps and eventually deported  if they're lucky. Naturally, subversive resistance groups form and use the only logical tool with which to fight governments  terrorism. It's a bleak vision but one that is far from implausible. The film's crew also meticulously creates all the little details, such as leisure activities, what the outside and the street would look like 20 years in the future, clothes, cars, trinkets, little items, newsreels, mundane routines, and just about anything else you can imagine would look like, be like and work like. It's truly nothing short of remarkable.<br/><br/>Another thing that is remarkable is the mind-blowing perfection of the cinematographic craft that materializes in the film. Cuaron creates a combination of down-to-earth hyper-realistic documentary-style film-making, utilizing completely hand-held cameras and long takes in order to simply allow all the details of the world and the setting exist without having to be emphasized; with an extremely self-aware use of colour tone (mainly pale blues and lots of greys) and absolutely gorgeous naturalistic lighting.<br/><br/>The actors and director Alfonso Cuaron did a flawless, amazing effort. Clive Owen is intense and absolutely incredible as the protagonist. As with pretty much all of his roles, it is not a showy performances and doesn't feature any of the theatrics many famous lead roles feature  it's a very minimalist ad extremely naturalistic performance, but that's not to say that it isn't intense or emotional  it is abundant in both. With this film, Owen really seals his authority as one of the most credible actors working today.<br/><br/>In all, Children of Men is a spectacle to behold. As an entity that exists within the cinematic craft, it's totally incomparable, with some of the best film-making I've seen in any movie, coupled with extremely remarkable direction and an even more remarkable depiction and portrayal of its setting. As a science fiction thriller, it delivers on an indescribable scale: Its concept and the mechanics of its futuristic setting are amazingly well thought-out, and their portrayal is bleak, depressing, shocking and one hundred percent credible and believable. When the film gets tense  and it is extremely tense throughout most of its runtime  it really keeps you right on the edge of your seat, clutching the handle tightly, and has you holding your breath. In the much broader sense, the film is a bleak mirror, or perhaps continuation of the already downward-spiraling current reality in the world today. Parallels between the dynamics of the world throughout its history and the setting of the film are dire and prominent. But all this is just the ribbon that ties the real package  an emotional core, a punch in the stomach so powerful; it is extremely difficult to remain oblivious."

","What a film! Saw it last night in Kingston Odeon - cinema quite busy for a Monday. I loved it, having not gone in with high expectations after reading a so-so review.<br/><br/>As a Londoner it was spooky watching so many familiar sights and scenarios with a (entirely feasible) twist, eg: buses and trains with bars on the windows. The future-predictivity of the film was so cutting and spot-on. Plus some nice little touches such as when just before he first got kidnapped he walks past 3 black guys dressed in (retro) bowler hats and city dress to accentuate their ""Britishness"", in an attempt to avoid being hassled by the police/military no doubt.<br/><br/>The film has multiple references to nazi Germany, ethnic-cleansing, Islamic fundamentalism, eco-warriors, class war, mad cow disease. I'm glad to see that Battersea power station has been put to good use - housing the rescued statue of David by Michaelangelo - while, from the windows of the penthouse, Rome burns below.<br/><br/>Laughed at Theo's boss's office: narrow, cramped and window-less, and the references to Diana-mania that preceded it. All very close to the bone.<br/><br/>And Clive Owen is superb, absolutely in his element as the cynical Dekard-with-a-sense-of-humour (hey he is British after all) character. Surely his best film yet.<br/><br/>Gritty, imaginative, original, Children of Men is our answer to Blade Runner, with bells on."

The story fails to unravel, it is poorly acted, especially by Owen who puts in an abysmal performance and Michael Caine who is just an add on to attract some viewers but clearly fails to impress. The Human Project is mentioned during the whole movie and comes up as a boat named Tomorrow? Please! Give us a break! Gratuitous shots of violence abound. Dialogues are below the level of an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie (and that is to say a lot). We were a group of 6 friends and none of us had anything good to say about this movie -instead all of us were intent on finding the culprit that recommended such rubbish. Comments from other viewers coming out of the theater were all unanimous: a waste of time and money. You have been warned!

","so; this is the future then? it begins with the death of the youngest person in the world, barely eighteen years old. All around is a Ludite nightmare. It is a bleak world, with bombs going off, littered streets, gun fire, the presence of armed soldiers and resistance fighters. yes, the future. Governments and the media cast labels on characters as terrorists. It is illegal to avoid fertility testing. Schools, although not needed in this future, are in terrible shape. There are propaganda signs everywhere...""illegal"" aliens are rounded up and detained. hmmm.... And yet in this dour world, the music of the Beatles, Stones, King Crimson,and Donovan lives on. There is graffiti every where, and yet there is also Guernica, colourful murals, and a beautiful country side full of plants and flowers. Animals are everywhere: cats, lots of dogs, sheep, deer, a zebra, horses, birds...some horribly exploited; others tenderly loved.... the most beautiful shot in the film for me was when Kee exposes her pregnant body, while modestly covering her breasts. She was beautiful, as all pregnant women are, with her swollen belly filled with so much promise. And life. It is described as ""a miracle"", since in this film, everyone is sterile. Since when has pregnancy and birth not been a miracle? it always was, is, and will be, regardless of the circumstance. Children of Men had some ugly things for sure, but it also had redeeming and wonderful things too, things like courage, self-sacrifice, nurturing, love. It had grief and sorrow, joy and happiness; desperation and commitment. It had a great ensemble cast, some of whom left all too soon. It also showed, that men who go to war don't sign up to kill children. I'd have to say that the biggest difference in this ""future"" world, is the lack of fresh paint and wall paper. they seem to be replaced by posters and newspaper article's with ominous words on them. i cant rate this film. It has brilliant moments, and yet it is left incomplete and has some plot issues. All i can say is, i am going to wait a while before i watch this again. It is an emotional exercise. In fact, it flexes quite a few emotions. I am a fan of Cuaron's films. He is flexible in his choices, and he takes chances. Children of Men is an important film about a terrible future (??). The sterile thing seems like a pretense for a film that is really about things which are happening to us now. I think we are better off watching this film, than not. It is a film which stays with you. ensemble cast: A; special kudos to Michael Caine cinematography: A+ art direction: A screen play A-"

","I wanted to like this flick so much - but there were too many flaws. I finished with 6/10 considering the fact I wouldn't even finish a movie below 5.<br/><br/>Acting is adequate, and indeed Owen is solid and Caine shines. No worries here.<br/><br/>Camera was really impressive. This is the movies strongest point indeed.<br/><br/>Story telling really laked in many cases in my opinion, well, I guess I have to ""go read the book"" to judge this after all.<br/><br/>The set was quite okay, but had some cheap (=""realistic"" ?) feeling to it. Don't know what didn't feel right for me in detail... Kinda B-movie-esquire.<br/><br/>Over emphasize of the guerrilla (rather war) picture was disturbing at best and annoying most of the time. Too long, too superficial.<br/><br/>As this is a ""we have a message"" film, I might just point out that I got ""the message"" and I still would have preferred to keep Holy Mary motives out of it. Not my piece of cake for sure.<br/><br/>Still I think that is one thing to remember: All apocalyptic dictatorship movies have this too obvious ""1984"", ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""Soylent Green"", ""Brazil"" and to a lesser extent ""Planet of the apes"", ""Bladerunner"", ""12 Monkeys"" references. So very limited originality.<br/><br/>I just hope that the age of ""mashups"" in which we are in doesn't limit creativity all of the time.<br/><br/>Currently it is rated at 8.0 at IMDb. This is going to change indeed, but I cannot see any ""true classic"" quality here."

","Those who have read and appreciated P. D. James' novel, on which this film is supposedly based, will be disappointed. The book and film coincide at a few junctures, but the film basically presents a new story -- sometimes illogical, and inferior to P. D. James' original. Retained is the future, childless world, a world in which humanity is doomed because of its mysterious loss of fertility (other animals can procreate), a world of ever-increasing chaos, and the names of the characters. Almost everything else is changed; the story is mostly new and the characters bear little resemblance to their namesakes in the book. As it stands, the film is fair, but go read the book."

","This movie has the most realistic portrayal of war and fighting in general that I have ever seen. Also the chemistry between the two main characters is great as both actors do an amazing job.<br/><br/>These two good things are not enough to carry the movie and it ends up becoming a confusing waste of time. If this were a war movie then I could understand the careful attention paid to the fighting but it is not a war movie. It is also not a discussion of modern terrorism so all the explosions and ferocity are seriously out of place.<br/><br/>The movie asks ""what if humanity were to suddenly become infertile?"" The problem is that this question is never answered and the situations surrounding the characters are never explained. Why is everyone infertile? What is going on? Why is everything taking place in England? Why is there so much upheaval? Who are all these groups of people and what do they want? This movie would be much better as a video game. Games can be stretched out and as the person is entertained by controlling their character information about the world of the game can be slowly hinted at in a peripheral sort of way. This method can create atmosphere and tension when done properly but is not suitable for a 90min movie that raises so many questions and answers none of them."
"Tmbo","6","6","10","21 August 2007"," Getting there
","This film doesn't merit a full whack of 10 stars, yet it obviously deserves more than average-skewing 'ones' and 'twos'. I wish people wouldn't do that...<br/><br/>I found C.O.M disappointing. Like many, I was keen to see it after reading positive reviews. Visually, I have no complains. Believable, gritty, oppressive. The story's premise, I have no complaints with. A lack of explanation for the infertility is inconsequential. In this film the intrigue lies not in the reasons behind the apocalypse, but how the characters react to the aftermath.<br/><br/>My main problems with the film were that I cared little for the characters, as others have said, there are few if any genuinely likable characters. Fair enough, they've all been brutilised by society's implosion, but the middle aged lady with the dreds is annoying, the girl is hardly endearing, and Clive has got a pole up him. if they had all met grisly ends on screen, I wouldn't have flinched.<br/><br/>Also, I was suspicious as to the films message. The characters we are supposed to view positively seem to lean towards the idealistic hippy school of thought and I fail to grasp how the issues raised by the film could have been mitigated by pot smoking, liberal attitudes to farting, or new age lifestyles.<br/><br/>Any film that gets you thinking has to be given credit however, add that to the visual element and the cinematography and I think we're talking about a reasonable piece of work."
"natalierosen","9","6","10","1 May 2007"," The more I thought about it the more I loved Children of Men
","The more I thought about ""Children of Men"" the more I loved it. The DVD discussion by the director and others certainly helped to get a clearer understanding of the director's intent. It is a supremely Orwellian film, bleak and violent, which had much to say about the nature of man and culture. It is a film that begs for discussion. The somewhat simple story of the film cannot be divorced from the complexity of its landscape. Each would be nothing without the other and special attention should be paid to the movie's setting.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the not-too-distant future making technological chaos a part of its surroundings. It centers on the world's inability to generate children, its lack of ability to understand why and the consequences this has for the disintegration of population, culture, history and life itself. The bleak surroundings of decay are omnipresent. It is testament, I think, to what happens when constant war and anarchy prevail. Society deconstructs. In society's vain attempt to perpetuate and sustain itself through repressive force it does neither. Stability is always elusive. One social and political philosophy is like another and the only thing left for the state to do is to perpetuate its media driven lies in some withering attempt to maintain order through tyranny. No one has the answer even though some think they do. The less powerful, of course, succumb to the Darwinian forces of nature. It is dinosaurian. If one force doesn't kill there is always another right around the corner which will. There is no rhyme or reason to it all. Humanity is prostrate before forces no one can control and man is at the mercy of other men and fate itself.<br/><br/>This movie poses many interrogatives. What happens to human society when biological and/or socially catastrophic events interfere with the natural orderly progression of life? How do humans adapt and survive or can they adapt at all? What happens when chaos reigns and people are in a constant state of war and anarchy? If social conflict is perpetual are human beings inclined toward constructing a totalitarian state? Who suffers and why? Is utopia a possibility ... ever? Is there hope? This film, I thought, was phenomenally relevant to the world in which we find ourselves. Perhaps, it is a film for all seasons as well. It could apply to Nazi Germany to Bosnia, to Lebanon, Darfur and most certainly to Iraq or, indeed, to any place which is prey to biological and other catastrophic events which give rise to chaos. The author perceptively places this film in Britain. I think this says it could apply to western culture as well IF we do not stop those forces which are brewing a perfect storm of biological catastrophe and social fracture. The very survival of life as we know it on our planet is at stake.<br/><br/>This film, although it is quite starkly bleak, does offer some hope through the only woman in the world who is pregnant. Amid this primordial social ooze and against all odds she attempts, with the help of one man, to save her infant's life. One must be patient and wait to see if there is an ultimate ray of light at the end of the tunnel. I recommend this film highly to those who want entertainment through serious thought provoking art.<br/><br/>Natalie Rosen, Framingham, MA"
"TwoThirdsMajority","9","6","10","29 January 2007"," An exciting pump of dystopia fiction.
","A 40-something man named Theo Faron(Clive Owen) is standing inside a coffee shop with a group of people, watching the news of the death of Baby Diego Ricardo, the youngest person in the world. He is 18 years, 6 Months, 28 days, 4 hours and 8 minutes old. Theo ignores the news, takes his coffee and exits the coffeshop. Here, we see London, a gloomy, dark & depressing London. Suddenly, ""BOOM!"" The coffee shop explodes by a terrorist act.<br/><br/>Welcome to London 2027 AD. Welcome to Children of Men. Here, humans are infertile. No one can give babies anymore. Thanks to global infertility, mankind has lost all hope for the future, because they are unable to inherit their wealth, ideals and goals to future generations since there aren't any. <br/><br/>It's been 18 years since no woman on Earth is able to give birth. Instead of having humans facing extinction like Fidel Castro dying peacefully because of a disease, mankind implodes and fast forward their extinction by causing nuclear wars in Africa, creating nuclear terrorism in New York, Tokyo & Shanghai, making our capital Kuala Lumpur looking like LA in 1992, and more devastation you could think of. The result? Waves of refugees from all over the world moved to the UK. However, since UK has become a totalitarian state, they've created isolationist and anti-refugee policies that has deported them from UK cities and sent them to concentration camps like what we've saw in Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and Auschwitz.<br/><br/>As the story progressed, we see Theo being taken hostage by a terrorist group named The Fishes. Led by Theo's ex wife Julian(Julianne Moore), The Fishes wanted Theo to escort an African 'Fugee' named Kee(Claire Hope-Ashitey) out of the UK and straight to a NGO named ""The Human Project"" which aims to end infertility and restore procreation in humans. But why Kee? Because Kee holds a secret that no one knew: She's pregnant. And what's so special about that? Well, here's the fact: She's the first woman to get pregnant after 18 years of infertility. Now you dig?<br/><br/>Some futuristic films like Blade Runner and The Matrix includes those cool-cyberpunk technology like flying cars, space travel and all that techno-babble, but this film? Not really. Not to say that this film doesn't have any futuristic design. It does. Some of it includes plasma-televisions, digital billboards, and cars where it has HUDs on the car's mirror. But, it still feels like London in our time, because the director Alfonso Cuaron(of Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban fame) says:<br/><br/>""The future n the film is still the same as our present London despite it's digi-billboards and plasma-TVs. That's because that since women became infertile, humans lose hope for the future and since 2016, technology stopped"".<br/><br/>What I loved, so very much, is how Cuarón gives lavish attention to the details of this post-apocalyptic world. Instead of trite character exposition or  God forbid  a huge opening text scroll spelling things out for us, details are what tells us of the larger story outside of Kee's flight. Newspaper clippings, headlines on billboards, TV commercials, animal carcasses on fire, little baby trinkets on people's desks these all tell their own story without those pesky spoken words. <br/><br/>It even feels more real than a typical movie, although it doesn't quite launch into reality/documentary style. I particularly loved a moment when Theo is in the woods and the camera pans up to the incredibly tall treetops while the evening gust of wind filled the speakers. It's hard to explain, but few movies bother to connect with us in how we see the world ourselves, and the somewhat-silent moment of majesty in the woods is something I've loved in my life (Cuarón also gave some attention to the trees in HPPOA, if I recall). The violence, when it comes, is shocking and full of immediate danger  this isn't the showy gunfire of most action flicks, but the scary kind that we see on the evening news. Yet even in a dark setting, there's still a bevy of humor and bright touches to make us laugh and smile, and the ultimate tale of hope is one to root for <br/><br/>Children of Men is good if not, a great movie, and I felt the same tingling of excitement that I felt when I saw Star Wars or V for Vendetta for the first time. By the end, I let my breath out and smiled. Terrific."

","'Children of Men' can be described as a speculative fiction thriller set in the UK 20 years in the future.<br/><br/>I was really blown away by this movie. I wasn't quite expecting it and went into it knowing extremely little about it which is probably how it actually should be viewed. I picked up right away on the technical reasons for its specialness which I won't go into in order not to spoil anything about it. But I will say that it is perhaps the most uncompromising, haunting and compelling vision of the future I may have ever seen and that it is very rich with a lot of heavy details, many of which could have been the whole subject of a whole lesser movie in itself. I read the synopsis of the plot on Wikipedia to better understand it and I literally had to stop for a few minutes after reading each sentence and let what they were saying sink in, in light of what I had seen. It is quite often extremely intense almost to the point of making you want to look away from the screen, but they do not achieve this intensity really in any of the traditional Hollywood ways. I'd have to see it again, but I don't even think they used any music during those sequences. It has a very raw feel to it and yet is very sophisticated at the same time, but it is not totally relentless either. The makers of the movie were very clever in how they marketed it. It has been a very successful movie at least in the U.S. without really any commercial hype behind it, relying almost totally on word of mouth and it very much deserves that success. It makes V for Vendetta look like a Saturday morning cartoon. The violence in it is very very realistic and grim and disturbing, as in fact violence should be! It's not glorified or gratuitous in any way. This is not a movie to see if you don't like movies that give you a lot to think about. Quite frequently while watching it, I had to remind myself again and again that I was just watching a movie that somebody had produced. That says a lot to me because I tend to be pretty jaded and cynical when it comes to movies, I've seen so many of the moves they can make. But I got the impression that effect was a pretty typical reaction to it. No doubt one of the best movies, if not the best movie, to come out in 2006, it will give me a lot to remember and ponder about for a long time to come."
"lngjon","10","6","10","7 January 2007"," Best I've seen in a long time
","Children of Men was not an uplifting story, although you do leave it with the return of a feeling of hope. Cuaron's brilliantly shot, thought provoking film is one of dull heartbreak, the way it really is, instead of the flash of agony so common in film these days.<br/><br/>His vision of a world without children, and, by proxy, a world without hope, is both terrifying and numbing, and his character-level shooting during much of the violence in the film really puts you there.<br/><br/>Clive Owen, who is quickly moving up my scale of favorite actors, is perfect as a man who, drowning in pain from his own lost child and a healthy dose of scotch whisky, finds his redemption by being able to care again when he comes back into contact with his ex-lover Julianne Moore, and then later by carrying the mantle of protecting Kee and her unborn child.<br/><br/>There was so much feeling in so many scenes, subtle feeling, not the usual over-acted kind that so many people expect and respond to. In real life, tenderness is exhibited by small actions, a look, a game with ping pong balls, the tenderness of a man saying goodbye to his disabled wife.<br/><br/>It is to Cuaron's credit also how he conveyed the sheer majesty of childbirth in a world where there are no babies, and the utter shock and reverence that would surround such an event.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the best films I've seen in the past two to three years, and as such I highly recommend it. Now I just need to catch Pan's Labyrinth."

","I like too much SciFi stories in apocalyptic future and this movie is a great example of it. The plot of this movie is very actual e not so difficult to happened, a mix of pandemic and xenophobes.<br/><br/>This movie has a quick rhythm that keeps the viewers turned on 220 volts since the start to the very end. The characters are very real and the actors play it very well.<br/><br/>It's a dark movie, with dark cloudy sky and dark places. It's very militarist and shows a totalitarist government that resembles very much to the famous Orwell's 1984.<br/><br/>I this this is one of the great movies of 2006 and it's from England, a proof that good movies can be made out of Hollywood.

","When i saw the ad for Children Of Men i said to myself that I have got to see that film. Little did i know that it would be one of the most exciting films i would ever see! The plot is so different than any other film i have seen before. Children Of Men is set in the near future; which in my opinion is the most believable future set film to date. No disrespect to any other writers but some films would have flying crafts landing on buildings as a daily sighting in the middle of a spotless London. Alfonso Cuáron makes us believe that we are seeing the future. He adds a few futuristic features such as moving ads on the sides of buildings and buses and to add to the realism, there is rubbish on the streets. Cuáron delivers us breathtaking sequences such as the five minute long sequence which follows Theo trying to find Kay in a war stricken area. The tension is persistent in this movie. The escape from the farmhouse left me on the edge of my seat. Not only is the plot strong but the performances are as real as the setting. I think this is one of Clive Owens' best features and deservedly so. This is a movie worth watching."

Really not just because i'm fan of the director, really Cuaron it's a genius. The film as breaking all the thinking's that one have of an story so easily and is surprising the screenplay are excellent written, Alfonso Cuaron as show that not just a brilliant director, also are excellent screenwriter as been demostring whit ''Y tu Mama Tambien'' that he and his brother won a nomination for Best Original Screeenplay for the Oscars, the performances are EXCELLENT Clive Owen, Julliane Moore, Michel Caine, the actress that perform it to Kee, all, also the supporting actors and actress as perfect, the direction... Oh f*ck i said all whit just said ALFONSO CUARON ARE THE BEST Mexican DIRECTOR, all the escenography, the ac tings, the photography are very good directed, the music also is an aspect that are wonderful, the photography, Emanuel Lubezki is an expert, how can you take a photography so good also when you're running, the screenplay are excellent (i've say the same but are more) the characters are wonderful written, for got a story that is not very attractive are excellent, also in any moment the picture are predictable, you can thinking ''Who's Next, What's as Happen the Next Scene'' totally unpredictable, the only it's that exposed the climax some fast but for good not like ''Babel''. But the movie as leave you whit the message that that's can be happen next, before i'm agree whit the abort in 100%, because i'm stupid on the school and don't interested on the studies, if i f*ck whit my girl i can't leave her pregnant...

"captainteveuk","10","6","10","1 October 2006"," Truly Phenomenal
","I saw this film two evenings ago, and was fully blown away. Not only was Children of Men the intelligent, ""thinky"" movie I was expecting, it was also a balls-to-the-wall action thriller of the highest.<br/><br/>It is quite easily Clive Owen's best performance to date, casting him as the truly believable Theo, playing opposite Clare Ashitey's Kee for a large portion of the film. The chemistry between the two is unexpected, but creates a truly brilliant sense of camaraderie in their race to ""save mankind"" (sort of...) Michael Caine deftly brings us Jasper, Theo's pot smoking ally, and Julianne Moore's Julian was, while surprisingly short-lived, a joy to watch. Chiwetel Ejiofor is equally good in his deeply sinister role as Luke.<br/><br/>Now, having dispensed with the usual gushy stuff about actors, I feel I should extol the pure genius of Alfonso Cuarón. This man is actually a genius. Properly. Alongside Mike Leigh's 1993 indie-classic ""Naked"", this is the most expertly put together movie I have ever seen. Every single shot screams ""this was really, really thought about!"", and the action scenes are fantastic. There's a sequence towards the end of the film, and i'm pretty certain there was around 10 minutes of the film taken in a single, hand held shot. It felt oddly like i was playing Call of Duty, and following Clive Owen around. I felt truly overjoyed that someone was doing hand-held filming properly: while it retains the pace and energy an audience is looking for, none of the film's clarity or meaning was lost, unlike so many other action films of late (need I mention the truly dire camera work in Miami Vice?) I can't express truly how brilliant this film is; all I can say is GO AND SEE IT! NOW!"

","This sci-fi thriller based on a book by P.D. James is absolutely magnificent. Its premise is high-concept yet totally believable and Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien) shot the film entirely using hand-held cameras adding to the realism and grittiness of the picture. Clive Owen gives the performance of his career in the lead role while there is a scene stealing supporting turn from Michael Caine. The film is a tonce poignant, tense, exciting , disturbing and even funny especially in Michael Caine's scenes.

"hugelypopularbeef_193","10","6","10","28 September 2006"," Bloody ace!
","I can't recommend this film more, it's probably the best film I've seen all year! It's one of the best sci-fi films ever made. There aren't any flaws at all. The acting is brilliant; Clive Owen gives what I think is his best performance, Michael Caine gives his funniest and most emotional, Chiwetel Ejiofor is amazing as always and Charlie Hunnam does that thing he did in Cold Mountain (but with a Geordie accent) and manages to scare the sh*t out of you. There are some genuine shocks in store. Thanks to Alfonso Cuaran's fantastic naturalistic camera-work, who should be nominated for an Oscar for this (but won't be), the violence becomes more brutal, the acting more powerful and the shocks are so realistic that you frequently feel as though you're watching real footage. Scenes such as the drive through the forest look so real that they are excruciatingly tense and absolutely terrifying to watch. <br/><br/>Really, the thing I wanted to address about the film is THAT tracking shot. Totalling something ridiculous like seven minutes long, it is the best scene I have ever seen. It would be really good anyway because of the genius action scene going on. But considering it is a seven minute long uninterrupted tracking shot, it is so much more. So much happens in it, it must have been almost impossible to choreograph. Yet somehow, it looks so natural and fluid, it's almost like it wasn't practised prior to shooting it. I would pay the ticket price just for that scene. Well not really. Five pounds off peak to see a film? Bit steep.<br/><br/>In conclusion, go see Children Of Men right now. It is one of the best films I've ever seen and I can't recommend it enough."

I defy you not to ask yourself the 'what ifs' raised in this movie and the parallels that can be drawn with present-day society make it all the more thought-provoking.

In general the acting isn't that convincing, only the scenes with Michael Caine are very enjoyable to watch. Yes it's some sort of Film Noir and yes, the future isn't bright.

Lets just add this to the list of movies that try to make a point about the war in Iraq. And to think I was going to the theater to see a movie with a plot that seems reasonable and entertaining and yet I was so very disappointed in the fact it took a well casted, well written and well thought out storyline and made it take a turn for the crapper when it was all about a government-spawned war to keep people under thumb. I was either terribly misinformed about the movie or it was drastically ill-advertised. Two thumbs down for lack of creativity in a time where everyone's political standpoint is plastered on the silver screen and this one deserves nothing less than to be lost in the static just like the rest of them.

"wisewebwoman","10","9","17","13 January 2007"," A glint of hope in the dark abyss of the future.
","This film has created much controversy and is in the camp of you either hate it with a passion or love it to bits.<br/><br/>Off the bat, I'm in the latter camp. This is a movie for grownups, no standard plot two by fours are issued at the door, no endless explications of the obvious.<br/><br/>I've also read the book and would agree with Alfonso Cuarón in his decision to remove a lot of the Christian hype of the book but would disagree with his decision to make this development the infertility of women and not the zero-sperm production of the men of the future. (PD James based the novel in part on this startling new development in the male population in some countries of Europe).<br/><br/>This is the bleak and hopeless world in England of 2027. The visuals are stunning and the mind is kept busy trying to process all the signs of a world gone mad with police and their guns and dogs on every corner. The tension is relentless down to the last bleak frame. Old signage and photographs point to the lead up to these forbidding times and omnipresent ads in buses and streets encourages one to to turn in neighbours to internment camps (""homeland security"" reverberates a lot throughout) and also offers pills readily accessible to terminate one's own life if one wishes.<br/><br/>The themes are many and as I'd pondered the book, I'll also be reflecting on this movie. For instance in a world where life is becoming extinct, life is not valued at all, cages of humans dominate every railroad station, identity cards are demanded at every turn. In one brief moment in the film (and it is the culmination of a long continuous shot which must go right up there as one of the best movie moments of all time)the warring stops for a fraction of time to honour the miracle of a child being born and then everyone continues the killing rampage, the baby forgotten.<br/><br/>I loved the insertion of humour into the darkest of circumstances, the alcohol and pot ingested to lighten the load, the caring and sacrifice in the most vicious of times.<br/><br/>Outstanding performances by a stellar cast, Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine,Pam Ferris and Claire-Hope Ashitey, who must have worked so hard to convey the realism of a world gone mad. Cinematography superb, down to the tiniest of details and the above mentioned 'long shot'.<br/><br/>10 out of 10. Not to everyone's taste obviously, there is no middle ground on this movie."
"brianjohnpinsker","2","9","17","7 January 2007"," over-hyped, overrated
","This plot is ridiculous. For some unexplained reason, all the women in Britain in 2027 are infertile. Or are all the men sterile? Is it a sperm-thing, an egg-thing, a uterus-thing, a vagina-thing? No one seems to know or care why, which doesn't inspire me to want to understand either.<br/><br/>And all the other countries of the world are annihilated? Is that it? Again, no one seems to know or care, and I didn't either. Clive Owen sure didn't care about the plight of the world; he was just sucked into a chaotic and baffling activist-driven rescue mission, because he happens to be the former husband of Julianne Moore, who's in the movie for 15 minutes and hands the mantle of leadership over to Mr. Owen, who very reluctantly agrees to help. Not very convincing for the ostensible hero of a thriller movie.<br/><br/>Really, he didn't seem to care about his character's plight, and this reflected poorly on the other actors, too. Even the female lead, newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey, seemed to be sleep-walking through much of the scenes.<br/><br/>This is the ultimate example of lazy writing. The screenwriter doesn't want to extend the energy to give a little context for his character's plight. The director plods them through all these ridiculous, long-winded conversations about their rescue mission, and the chases are unrealistic and boring. By the time they reached the end of their mission, everyone around me in the theater seemed to be appropriately confused and ready to ask for their money back."

"cinelyze","9","9","17","8 December 2006"," ""Children of Men"" is an allegory we can only hope and pray never manifests in our lifetime.
","""Children of Men"" is, in many ways, an allegory, one we can only hope and pray never manifests in our lifetime.<br/><br/>When the film begins, everyone in Britain is mourning. Not because another beloved princess has met a senseless end, but because baby Diego, the world's youngest person at slightly over eighteen-years-old, has just died. <br/><br/>The year is 2027 and age (or youth) is so important that it is measured down to the minute. This reverence for life, or certain people's lives, is significant because it underscores humanity's doom due to the infertility of women. <br/><br/>Ironically, in the dystopian society that Britain has become, not every life is of equal value. The country has closed its borders. Its military forces round up Fuji's (a cheeky name for illegal immigrants), who are ""hunted down like cockroaches"" and carted off to prisons (actually ghettoes) that would make Abu Graib look like a vacation destination. <br/><br/>But immigrants aren't the only ones who have to live in fear. The ubiquitous electronic media encourage all citizens to ""report any suspicious activity"" they might encounter, whatever that might mean. Under these circumstances, death by cop just may be a better alternative. <br/><br/>One man who apparently tries to avoid that end is Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a dissipated, whiskey guzzling former outspoken liberal who struggles to survive by leading an ordinary life. Or at least as ordinary as he can in such an oppressive society.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Faron, he is recruited by Julian (Julianne Moore), his former lover, now the leader of an all-purpose radical faction that will stop at nothing to unmask government corruption. Julian's quest is to obtain papers for Kee (newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey) so that the young woman may be safely delivered into the hands of The Human Project, an underground organization whose mission is to preserve humanity. Why this is necessary is no mystery, except perhaps to Faron, but it is such an important plot point that it would be unfair to reveal it.<br/><br/>Whether for love or money, or perhaps to feel that old rush of adrenaline he used to get when he and Julian were young and innocent, Faron agrees. He turns to the reclusive Nigel (Danny Huston), an old friend who is holed-up among some of history's great works of art, such as Michelangelo's ""David,"" and Picasso's ""Guernica."" You have to give Nigel credit. Despite his head-in-the-sand mentality, he is committed to ending his days surrounded by things of beauty.<br/><br/>This elaborate set up is the launching point for the rest of the plot, which carefully weaves back story into the narrative. Director Alfonso Cuarón (""Y Tú Mamá También,"" ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""), who co-wrote the screenplay with Timothy Sexton (HBO's ""Live from Baghdad"") based on the P.D. James novel, does not overlook any opportunity to present a visual connection between today's world and the one depicted in the film. Citizen's pay homage to baby Diego in public floral displays (not unlike those in honor of Princess Diana, as seen in Stephen Frears' ""The Queen""), Muslim fundamentalists march down streets bearing arms and banners, and sluices emit sludgy liquid into rivers. All of this is taken to extremes in the film. It is a world in which everything, if not everyone, has gone mad. <br/><br/>Missing from the script, however, is any sense of what is going on beyond this limited universe. ""The world has collapsed. Only Britain soldiers on,"" one newscaster reports, but we are never told how or why this calamity came about. Why humans cannot reproduce is never overtly stated, but it isn't unreasonable to believe that environmental pollutants and the ""flu pandemic of 2008"" are, at least in part, responsible for humanity's demise. Why, though, are other animals exempt (in one scene a kitten claws Faron's pants leg), and where are all the scientists when you need them? <br/><br/>This apocalyptic vision of a bleak and not-too-distant future is nothing new in film or literature (""1984,"" ""Brave New World,"" and ""Blade Runner"" come to mind). But Cuarón presents his vision in such a mirthless landscape that it makes us hope we won't be alive to see if it manifests twenty years from now.<br/><br/>Cinematography, by Emmanuel Lubezki (who provided a very different look to last year's ""The New World""), is astonishingly real, a verité style that exudes a raw, cold grittiness apropos the material. Editing (by Cuarón and Alex Rodríguez) invokes immediacy, particularly in the battle scenes of the film's climax.<br/><br/>Performances all around are strong, with Michael Caine doing a turn as a former liberal political cartoonist turned hippie counterculturist, replete with long hair and an ample drug stash, and Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Dirty Pretty Things"") playing against his usual good guy image. But the film is carried by Owen, who proves once again that he is this generation's Richard Burton, and by Ashitey, whose lines of comic relief are delivered with the proper earnest tenor. <br/><br/>""Children of Men"" is an effective cautionary tale, a reminder that what we do today has a direct impact on the future. As one person says, ""It's very odd what happens in the world without children's voices."" Let's hope we don't ever have to live in such joylessness."
"alexps","9","9","17","28 November 2006"," Intelligent beautiful film making
","The best film I've seen in years & certainly the best British film I think I've ever seen. Although at times it plays like a video game (Half-Life 2 anyone?) the sheer nerve of attempting those prolonged tracking shots (the car attack, the street fight) & pulling them off had my jaw dropping. This is something you could watch again & again & still pick up something new. Dystopia is writ large & seems to be something British film does well (V For Vendetta, Land Of The Blind, Brazil) but I've never seen London this bleak (even 28 Days Later had an undercurrent of hope). The attention to detail astounds - even a casual shot of a cat looking out of a window contains a full-pitched battle. The ambient noise seeps through from the buzzing of fluorescent lights to the remnants of tinnitus from that first calamitous explosion to the pervasive farmyard noises that bathe the refugee camp. The use of 'Homeland Security', Theo's 'Olympics 2012' shirt, Battersea power station complete with Pink Floyd flying pigs - every shot contained in-jokes & visual ideas that made me fear for blinking. Everything is washed out, polluted, black & bleak. The intermittent (occasionally extreme) violent acts seem out of place but keep you paying attention. I can't remember the last time I watched a film and really couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. If you like intelligent cynical science-fiction (and what else is good sci-fi about if not dystopia?) I cannot recommend this film highly enough. And all this from the pen of a Baroness, member of the House Of Lords - with an establishment figure like that, who needs the revolution!"
"bundleup","10","9","17","22 November 2006"," Notes from interview with Alfonso Cuaron
","I saw this movie last night and after the screening Cuaron was there for a question and answer session.<br/><br/>First of all, this is a science fiction movie, set in a fictional future. He did not want to make a science fiction movie, but he grudgingly admitted that this is one. He also said it was a chase film, one big long chase scene. The scene in the car with the motorcycle I believe is one of the most gripping, shocking and best made car chase scenes ever. It looks like one take, but he admitted that that was pretty much impossible given 5 people in a moving car and the camera turning 360 degrees.<br/><br/>What Cuaron kept stressing was that he was making a 'theme driven' movie, not a plot driven or character driven film. In the movie, he didn't even try to explain why women had become infertile, to him it didn't matter. To explain the 'why' would have made the focus of the movie the infertility. His theme was 'Hope'. He said, and I kind of agree, that the movie showed how he sees the world right now. There were some eerily real images on screen at the illegal detention center, scenes straight out of Abu Ghraib and Guatanamo, images of what America had become out of fear and lost hope. Even though this film is set in Britain, the Abu Ghraib images and the 'Homeland Security' references will hit thinking Americans hard.<br/><br/>The long shot, where Theo has been separated from Kee and is trying to find her in the middle of an all out battle, was one shot eight minutes long. They had roughly 16 days to block and rehearse, and it wasn't until the 15th day that he actually rolled off the first take. They got about 3 minutes in when the D.P. slipped. Since it would take about four hours to reset everything, they had to try again in the morning, on the last day. That went about 4 minutes, when somebody missed a major cue. Late in the afternoon of the last day, with the Sun beginning to set, they tried it again. Something went wrong in the bus, and blood ended up on the camera lens. Cuaron yelled 'cut' just as an explosion was set off, so nobody heard him. Owen just kept going, and so did the camera. He claims that was how they got the take. I felt the blood on the lens just made this whole grisly, shockingly violent scene seem that much more real.<br/><br/>Cuaron said that they had initially planned to digitally splash blood on the lens in post-production for the car chase scene when Jullianne Moore was shot, but left it in this other scene instead.<br/><br/>There are some people who aren't going to like this movie, but I was mesmerized by the work. It is a fantastic achievement, one that assaults both your senses and your soul.<br/><br/>This movie is still 5 weeks from being released (at least in the U.S., I'm going to assume it has already been released in Europe) and has already garnered nearly 6,000 votes on IMDb giving it a rating of 8 out of 10, not to mention hundreds of posts on here. That is simply amazing. This is sure to be one of the most talked about movies in years. I thought this was one of the most brilliantly made films I've ever seen."

Cuaron directed the hell out of this film! The script is pretty decent (interesting but reasonably standard sci-fi), but Cuaron elevates it so much higher. It brings you to such emotional highs and lows, all while looking completely believable. I don't want to give anything away, but this movie affected me deeply; I felt honestly shaken after leaving the theater. Technically, the film will floor you. It contains some of the most impressive set pieces in movie history, some of them shown as a continuous shot, with no cuts. You'll never forget the experience."

","Brilliant film, I absolutely loved it but I was slightly let down by the ending. I felt that it was left hanging too much and I wanted to know more. The use of camera shots throughout the film was excellent as there was a lot of moving about with the characters. It was extremely emotional, especially when certain characters died. Fairly scary to think about because the human race doesn't seem so far off what is portrayed in the film. This is what makes it seem so realistic. The acting was fantastic, Clive Owen played the part extremely well and Julianne Moore, although only in it for about 15 minutes, was phenomenal. The violent scenes reminded me of two things. 1. World War II with concentration camp-like settings 2. The war in Iraq with the constant fighting in the streets These aspects truly brought to life the realistic side of the film and showed quite accurately what would happen to the human race if an epidemic as serious as this were to happen. Overall i thought the production was fantastic and although the ending was a bit shaky, it definitely did not spoil it for me."
"TheFluffyKnight","8","9","17","19 October 2006"," A Political Hideaway
","2006 has been a good year for politically minded films: we've seen George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck.; the not-as-anarchist-as-the-comic-but-still-pretty-good V For Vendetta; and the emotionally charged United 93. This month, Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men joins these thought-provoking films, and quite rightly, too.<br/><br/>The year is 2027 and, one generation from now, the entire female population of the planet is infertile. The youngest person in the world has just died at 18, and most of the world has been ravaged by war, turning Britain into a Daily Mail reader's paradise; the government as made outlawed immigrants, and broadcasts its neo-fascist propaganda over digital billboards in streets and buses. In the middle of all this is Theo Faron (Clive Owen), an ex-activist, now an alcoholic working in an office. After narrowly escaping a terrorist attack in a café, Theo is kidnapped by a group of ""Fishes"" (freedom fighters), headed by his activist ex Julian (Julianne Moore), and thrust into the centre of a plot to get the first pregnant woman in 18 years to the mythical Human Project.<br/><br/>If Children of Men has one flaw, it is that it won't draw in the action crowd that made V for Vendetta a moderate success. If, however, you're looking for a politically and emotionally charged story, depicting a scarily realistic vision of what the future could be, Children of Men is highly recommended. Following in the footsteps of Fernando Meirelles and his fantastic The Constant Gardener, Alfonso Cuarón has blended a riveting story with a strong political message. Anyone who feels a knot of fear in their stomach whenever they see a Daily Mail headline will be moved by the images of immigrants locked in cages. And almost paradoxically, the climax expertly puts across the film's theme of humanity over any political agenda.<br/><br/>Technically, the film will not disappoint students of film. In an expository scene in an abandoned school, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), our pregnant protagonist, is almost too-perfectly framed in a shattered window. The technical highlights, though, are the film's two main action sequences. One in a car and the other in a building under attack, both are filmed in single takes, and have a documentary feel. We, the audience, are taken right into these scenes, which make their emotional climaxes (especially in the latter) even more real and moving.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a political hideaway from the past summer's lacklustre blockbusters, you definitely cannot go wrong with Children of Men. Cuarón has infused his work with a realism and emotional quality rare in films of this type, and fantastic performances from the main cast, as well as smaller characters such as Michael Caine's pot-smoking hippie Jasper make it a more than enjoyable experience. Hollywood needs more films like this."

","I'll keep this short and spoiler free. I cannot find a thing wrong with this film - it is an absolutely stunning piece of work. The attention to detail in realising a near future world - the richness of it rendered without a single line of obvious exposition. Brilliant performances from all concerned. The long takes and the stunning set pieces are just beautiful - echoes of Brazil crossed with Channel 4 news. It makes it's political and social points cleanly and succinctly. The best British film since 28 Days Later - and it took a Mexican director to do it - I liked his take on Harry Potter, but this portends so much more, I will be keeping a close eye on any future films directed by Cuaron. Simply brilliant."

"my_superstar73","1","11","22","22 May 2007"," God Awful movie
","I can not believe IMDb has a rating of 8.2 for this film. Believe me it is not even worth 5 points, let alone 8.2. And I can certainly not believe that some people would actually like it. The plot of the movie is nonsense. There is nothing connecting to another thing. The director tries to touch on issues like discrimination against illegal immigration, killing of innocents, end of future because of our own destruction portrayed through infertility, but all these important issues were not brought out in a manner to provide any thought provoking of any kind. The idea of infertility for 18 years and a sudden pregnancy had a great potential to be a very good film, but it is lost in incomprehensible fight scenes and sentimental crap, like the Messianic scene of the mother and child going through stunned soldiers and civilians. Oh, and it is also quite sexist. For some reason women are the infertiles. And Luke, who becomes the leader of Fishes after Julian Moore dies, thinks that the child just must be a boy. It's like the waiting of the second coming of Jesus (which, by the way, the name of Jesus is used constantly in the movie). But, guess what! The baby is a girl. The gender of the child shouldn't even have a place in the movie, because the whole theme of infertility and then pregnancy is a hope of continuation of life. Anyway, my disappointment was great especially after watching The Pan's Labyrinth and Babel (the films of the other two Mexican-American directors) and being in love with those movies, this one had a promise of being at least a decent film. BUT IT IS BAAAAADDDDD. If you want something good, watch either Pan's labyrinth or Babel. Don't be fooled by the rating. Don't waste your time."
"bob_marli","10","11","22","18 December 2006"," Watch it and learn something from it
","""Children of men"" is easily movie of the year. Of course, it won't get any Oscar, but did ""Blade Runner"" got anything?<br/><br/>First thing that you will notice about this movie is that violence really looks brutal. If you think that there is something romantic and nice about war, please watch this movie. Also, it is SF, but for me - this is probably most realistic SF that I ever see, and future described in it doesn't look that far.<br/><br/>Story itself is very symbolic. It is not important why humans can't have children any more; important is what kind of world we are leaving to them anyway. Main character in this movie never takes gun, even if sometimes that looks like best choice. Choices he made are choices of common sense - there is nothing on this world more important than life of human being, no matter if it is just another man or last baby on earth. If there is some idea that claims to be more important than human life, then there is something wrong with idea. How human life is valuable, can be understand in world without kids - then life of one kid seems more important than world itself.<br/><br/>Also, this movie put one big equation sign between people. In refugee town, first we see Arab demonstration, but after few seconds - we see French refugees. In cage, woman speaks on Serbian asking for water (Balkan wars), but couple meters after it, German is asking for food also. In bus, we have Italian crying. To average western viewer scene when he sees Arab demonstration or Bosnian refugee are not life changing - he saw that before, on evening news. How horrible this really is, he can find out when he sees that same thing can happen to anyone. There is nothing cool about dying; there are no long speeches, blue sky, and long shots. People die in a second, when not expected, and their deaths look absurd, because they are. Death is impersonal and fabricated, because when there is 100 death people of bomb in one second, you forget to realize how horrible death of one human being is. This movie will remind you on that fact.<br/><br/>Already famous long shot is one of the most impressive long shots ever. I find acting in this movie brilliant - it is never exaggerated, it is never 'I want to win Oscar tonight, look how hyperemotional I am"". We have great actors (Clive Owen, Michael Caine and Julianne Moore, among others), that are willingly part of movie, never becoming greater then story.<br/><br/>What to say at the end: watch this movie more then once. No matter if you will focus on story, acting, directing or music - you will enjoy every time. This is by far best movie released this year, with strong message that everyday world, soaked in meaningless blockbusters, keep to forget."

The acting is poor, the scenery/locations are poor and the story is woeful. It reminded me of the really bad low budget films, done my Channel 4 in the UK a couple of decades ago.<br/><br/>The story doesn't answer the questions the viewer has, like why people stopped having babies, why no immigrants, all the gangs and why people are having to hide. Also why nobody questions a girl in child labour screaming and grunting through security check points.

Yeah, she was in this film,I can't remember her character's name. I assumed from the sad music I was supposed to feel sad that she died but couldn't care less. <br/><br/>I've read other reviews and people who liked this movie often say that important information is shown here and there for example one piece of newspaper (out of a few dozen) next to Clive Owen in the interrogation room, that we see for a few second, mentions nuclear fallout in Africa. That's either lousy production design because why would I read THAT particular newspaper on the wall or a lousy attempt to explain the lack of information in the movie.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is that it thinks it's very clever with it's secrecy and aura of mystery but it's just stupid. A clever film gives us small pieces of a bigger picture which by the end I can put together in my head (an even better film surprises me by putting together the same pieces in a way I didn't think of), but here the pieces don't make a bigger picture, they don't make sense together. <br/><br/>There are a lot of information that isn't given (or ""cleverly"" hidden) but would be important, a lot that is useless and they're mostly told instead of shown. For example Julianne Moore's character get's way more screen time and build-up for a character that dies 15 minutes after appearing.<br/><br/>I didn't know enough about ANYTHING to connect emotionally. Not to mention Clive Owens robot acting.<br/><br/>This film was too long for so much nothing to happen.<br/><br/>(The cinematography was nice and Micheal Caine - compared to the rest - was good in his horribly written character.)"

","I found the whole story line from the film, Children of men, to be far fetched and well.... to be honest, it was stupid. So here we are in England in the future. The streets look like a war zone, complete with bombings, body parts flying everywhere, rubble, tons of graffiti, military police with their growling guard dogs, and cages full of prisoners right on the city streets. Yet our main character is off to work and stops on his way to purchase a cup of coffee to go... Starbucks I suppose has managed to stay in business. Apparently no babies have been born in the world for 20 years. There is not one explanation as to why this has occurred. We see birds, cats, cows and dogs. They obviously have no problems reproducing. This world wide event which caused only human sterility is left completely to our imaginations. I couldn't think of one single reasonable answer. Suddenly out of nowhere is a woman who is 8 months pregnant. She needs to be saved. I don't know what she fears. That is not explained either. Everyone seems to be trying to get into England, as though it is the last safest place to live, yet the pregnant girl is on a mission to escape from England. Why? Why? Another totally ridiculous part of this movie was when our pregnant girl tell our main character about how she noticed her stomach getting larger and larger, but didn't realize she was pregnant because she had never seen what a pregnant woman looked like. WHAT? In the future are old photos and information about pregnancy banned or something? Has she never seen a pregnant cat or dog? The whole film from start to finish was too much to swallow. Some films I've seen I don't completely grasp. When the movie interests me though, I'll watch it again then gain a better understanding. This movie however, Children of men, I will never watch again. There was not one thing about it which intrigued me enough to give it another chance."

A small group of people try to travel in Britain from A to B, and all kinds of crazy people with guns try to kill them, and largely succeed. There are more stunt men and extras than you can shake a stick at. I found it extremely boring. Why all this violence? It has something to do with mankind becoming completely infertile. Why this would turn everyone into homicidal maniacs is beyond me.<br/><br/>One of the particularly nasty villains has blond dreadlocks. I was waiting for him to have some imaginative demise, but he just unceremoniously and silently fell over backward, presumably shot by a bullet, unremarked in a corner of the screen.<br/><br/>There are no good looking people, and no morally courageous people, so I did not become particularly attached to the protagonists. I did not particularly care if the bad guys got them. This does not help the suspense much.<br/><br/>The film just ends as if the reel ran off the projector, as if chopped off by a timer at no particular place. There is no resolution. You don't even get to find out what happens to the heroes over the next few days.<br/><br/>What is the movie for? Perhaps it is just to show how unglamourous and pointless war is.

They were on the run and then they stopped being on the run and it was over. I kept waiting for a huge plot twist and it never came.

"bobgeorge1","5","5","8","4 June 2007"," a reluctant hero becomes a midwife
","I've seen there are are 11 pages of reviews of Children of Men already. So, is there anyone who hasn't seen this film yet? As most of the reviews say this is a film about a dark future set in 2027 with life apparently changing in 2008 when people are unable to have babies. The film has lots of chasing about and fighting and Clive Owen as the reluctant hero drawn in to help an illegal immigrant who has somehow become pregnant.<br/><br/>It makes some comparisons with todays issues around illegal immigrants. All the acting is fine as everyone else says in their reviews.<br/><br/>I just don't get the logic of the film. In the future, the near future, something happens that prevents pregnancy across the world. Inevitably this would mean the worlds population would decline rapidly. There is some issue about Britain being a place worth getting to; I missed what that was about but somehow Britain is overcrowded with a Police state trying to keep out the others.<br/><br/>Surely if mankind is disappearing resources INCREASE for anyone that is still alive; no need for fighting and squabbles, no need for concentration camps at Bexhill, no need for police state. A sort of heaven for the 50 or so years until the last person kicks the bucket. Admittedly with too many resources and no competition for survival it might be as dull as living in New Zealand. The more interesting tale would be how the very last person does whittle away their last few years.<br/><br/>I guess really this is just a film that is meant to illustrate the reluctant hero in the ordinary man and maybe the extra ordinary event that is childbirth?"
"grandenchilada","9","5","8","11 January 2007"," The future is here
","Alfonso Cuarón has many virtues as a director and they are all in evidence in this powerful, spectacular movie. My favorite virtue of his, which was much in evidence in the great Y tu mamá también, is his ability to weave many different moods and tones into a coherent emotional whole. Just as in Y tu mamá también he achieved a lovely melancholy undertone to the picaresque adventures of the two main characters, here he melds an urgent, moving emotional core to what is essentially an action movie. Or perhaps it's the other way around. His refreshing lack of sentimentality is what makes this possible: his movies are emotionally complex. Cuarón seems allergic to melodrama and to sentimentality, and I hope he is never cured. That is what I love about his films, the playfulness and sense of humor, the complexity, not of storytelling but of human emotion, the truthfulness of feeling. A couple of small details, like angelic choral music in a redemptive scene or the name of a ship at the end are as much as he is willing to concede to sentimentality; not much, considering that the fate of mankind is at stake. Children of Men is an apocalyptic movie about a future that is too close to home. It is apocalyptic, yet not futuristic. That is, the immediate future looks less like the Jetsons and more like a nightmare out of Hyeronimus Bosch. It takes place in 2027, which is just around the corner, and it's not a happy sight. In this world torn apart by conflict and self-destruction, the discourse that we hear today from the likes of Bush and Donald Rumsfeld has come to pass. Illegal immigrants are put in cages and deported, they are sent to detention camps closely reminiscent of Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib, the environment is almost all toxic waste. The premise that the entire world suffers from collective infertility doesn't seem at all far-fetched. What makes the movie harrowing is how close we are to being in such a state. It's almost as if the filmmakers are saying ""wipe the self-satisfied grin off your face and don't get too comfortable, for we are already there"". This is a movie where there is no detachment. The camera follows the hero like a shadow and it feels as if you are there with him, right next to the explosions, shockingly close to the violence, with the point of view of the naked eye, not of the language of the camera. Yet amidst the incredible chase scenes and the beautifully exploding mayhem, Cuarón and Lubezki are capable of achieving quiet, luminous moments of grace. I was frantically looking in the credits for whoever was responsible for the production design, which, with the entire art department, deserves a standing ovation and an Oscar (imdb says it's Jim Clay and the great Geoffrey Kirkland). I don't think I remember (except for High and Low by Kurosawa) a film that is more crammed with visual information. Because of the wide angles, the frame is full of details, and it takes a few moments to get used to so much coming from the screen. The context is as much in the foreground as the characters. I heard Cuarón say in an interview that this was his and the great cinematographer Emanuel Lubezki's approach in Y tu mamá también and they use it here as well, albeit on a much grander scale. There are not a lot, if any, traditional set ups of close up, medium shot, and reverse takes in Children of Men. The camera is fully engaged in the world around the characters. As you may have already heard, there are several extended shots in this film that are absolutely mindboggling. The piece de resistance is a climactic nine minute (or so) extended tracking shot without a single cut. However, to their credit, Lubezki and Cuarón so immerse you in the dramatic narrative that you barely notice there is a tour de force in progress. It is a thing of breathtaking power and beauty. In Clive Owen (long live his mother, as they say in Spain, praise the Lord for making him, a bona fide movie star with tons of talent), Cuarón has found a perfectly reluctant hero and one of the main reasons why the movie works at an emotional level. Owen plays Theo, a jaded ex-activist, embittered and hurt by the loss of his son and who has grown inured to the horrors around him. I will not give you the entire plot of the movie, as Anthony Lane did in his review, because you must see for yourself. But Owen gives a sharp, moving performance of a despondent human being who is slowly wakened from his apathy by having to perform a heroic deed almost against his will. As the world collapses around him, what Theo has that many others don't is basic human decency. It's as simple as that. It is not grandiloquent outrage or a self-righteous belief in freedom and democracy or none of that crap that gets bandied about by the bad guys nowadays as an excuse for their self-interested mayhem. Theo drinks, he smokes, he winces at the grief of others and he wears his task quite uncomfortably on his sleeve. Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis or any of those simplistic, grandiose fools, he ain't. In the end, what I most admire about Children of Men, besides it's undeniable artistry, and despite some of its commercial inclinations, is its commitment to protest. Cuarón does not shy away from shocking violence, but it is not much different from what you see on CNN any given day: people's limbs torn out by bombs, ethnic strife, a generalized disregard for human life. The movie has a strong, quietly indignant point of view about the state of affairs today, and that is what makes it so relevant, so powerful and so disturbing."

I was elated, depressed, scared and touched to the depths of my soul. The movie exudes with emotions, references to dystopias from other pieces of art, symbols, political and humanistic messages. There is too much to say about this film but it will take days to sink in. I urge everyone to go see it and think well before he extracts any conclusions.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to say that the scene where Theo and Kee come out with the bay in their hands is the most powerful moment I have ever seen put on film.

"garboventures","9","5","8","29 November 2006"," A grimly beautiful cinematic feast
","Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men, based on the dark and chilling PD James novel, focuses on a tragically apocalyptic world set in 2027. This is a world dogged by a fertility crisis which has meant there has not been a new baby born at all, in over eighteen years. Wars have ravaged the planet, the environment is in a funk from decades of prolonged pollution and mankind is in freefall, offered suicide packs by the government which promise a quiet and painless demise. A totalitarian British government herds all foreigners ('fugees) into concentration camps and multiple terrorist groups seemingly stage bombings for fun. <br/><br/>And yet, miraculously, amidst this angst and mayhem, a young woman, Kee, has fallen pregnant. The story charts Kee's desperate attempt to escape to a new life, accompanied by her protector Theo, one of fiction's unsuspecting heroes - a man who suddenly finds himself at the crossroads of history and rises to the occasion.<br/><br/>I should say for starters that I am a huge fan of Cuaron's work. He directed, in my opinion, the best Harry Potter film so far - by a country mile I might add. His work on Great Expectations and A Little Princess was eye-catching. And Y Tu Mama Tambien was one of my favourite films of 2001. He does not disappoint with Children of Men. Cuaron has an astonishing feel for the cinematic medium. Every single frame is crammed with visual delights. More than most directors he succinctly moves and moulds narrative with cinematographic brilliance and has a talent for deploying colour, or lack of it, when necessary. He genuinely paints a story for us with a magically illustrative visual vocabulary.<br/><br/>Here we are presented with a dank, rain-strewn world; a bleak, grey landscape, scarred by numerous power-stations belching thick smoke. The city streets are dirty, claustrophobic and crowded and buildings are graffiti-ed and fallen into disrepair. After all, what is the point of rebuilding a world which no-one soon will be able to enjoy? <br/><br/>Cuaron has elicited strong acting performances from his cast here. Amongst the minor characters, Michael Caine is simply fantastic as genial hippy Jasper - a real scene-stealer. As indeed is Peter Mullan, an unsung hero of British film-making, who takes on the minor rumbustious role of Sid, the corrupt border official. Claire Hope-Ashitey is fine as Kee, the first woman in eighteen years to give birth, (her name is a little too heavy handed symbolically), and Pam Ferris as her anxious guardian Miriam is passable, but this is not her best work by any means. Julianne Moore is one of Hollywood's greatest actresses but is really rather ordinary here - although her early death is shocking and raw. Chiwetel Ejiofor is always good value but a little under-used here as the idealistic Luke.<br/><br/>However, most eye-catching (and heart-tugging too, if truth be told) is Clive Owen's searing, brave performance as the film's 'hero' Theo - a sour-faced, cynical everyman, who takes it upon himself to escort poor Kee to the sanctity of a ship headed for the much-fabled 'Human Project', a quasi-mythical settlement on the Azores, far away from the grime and misery of mainland Britain. To do so requires a perilous journey, avoiding trigger-happy terrorists and murderous thug-like British police officers. Their journey takes them to 'Bexhill' - a town turned notorious refugee camp, enmired in filth and despair, where a minor civil uprising is being quashed most violently by the authorities.<br/><br/>There is an unmistakable, probably unavoidable messianic overtone to the piece at times, given the nature of the material. And of course there are blood-sacrifices. We know they're coming. But that doesn't make them any less powerful when they do. <br/><br/>There is a lot to love in this film, including random but touching acts of human heroism ... and a lot to worry over. Most affecting, perhaps, was the news that Theo and Julian had lost their young child in 2008 to a flu pandemic - a death that clearly haunted and destroyed their relationship - though probably not their love. <br/><br/>There is a very moving moment when Jasper recounts the sorry story of their loss to Kee and Miriam - not knowing that Theo is in earshot. The camera slowly closes in on Theo's face which is stricken at the memory. Saving Kee and her child thus gives him a second chance to save a child when he could not save his own.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films of 2006. It confirms, yet again, Cuaron as one of the supreme directing talents working today. I rather doubt Children of Men will garner much awards attention - it's a little too dystopic and bleak perhaps - but Cuaron deserves recognition."
"RottenMoreno","10","5","8","25 November 2006"," A brilliant apocalyptic masterpiece
","Yes, I watched Children of Men. To my surprise this movie premiered here in Mexico very early and I was one of the lucky ones to watch this fantastic apocalyptic film. With an amazing direction by Alfonso Cuarón, Children of Men is a science fiction film set in the future where the whole world is in chaos and humanity is at the board of extinction because every woman in the planet has become unfertil, and the youngest person on the planet has just died. Then when all hopes seem lost, a girl gets pregnant, holding the key to salvation.<br/><br/>Children of Men is one of those movies that make you sad, because yes, there are lots of scenes were your heart just breaks, but also (and this is what makes the movie fantastic), when you think everything is lost, a light of hope and joy emerges from the darkest time. Alfonso Cuarón achieves this in the most incredible way with marvellous visuals and special effects and with an amazing script, that never fails to shock and succeed.<br/><br/>To Cuarón's amazing direction, joins Clive Owen's perfect performance. Owen is more than excellent in the male leading role, demonstrating that he indeed deserved that Oscar nomination in 2004 for Closer. This is definitely his best work, and he is also my personal pick for Best Actor of 2006. Joining the cast is also Juliane Moore and Michael Caine (who brings a very charming and funny character to the film), also one of the best actors of the year. And last, but not least, we have newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey, who gives a very powerful performance.<br/><br/>Children of Men is not only the best drama picture we've seen this year, but also one of the best movies of our time. It leaves us a message that we'll never forget, and teaches us that there's always hope, no matter how bad things can look. This is a film that won't be ignored, and that deserves a look from each and everyone of you."

","Wow what can i say about this amazing film, just when i was starting to get bored of all the clichéd movies of the average todays cinema, and then it comes this movie with such an interesting story, and the best of all, the way it was done, technically perfect, amazing cinematography, brilliant performances, especially from Clive Owen and Michael Caine, great effects, and also the long shots were impressive.<br/><br/>This is a slow paced kind of chasing movie, with very stressful moments and tense music, and its developed in a way that can be sometimes a little confusing, because the story starts an no one explains nothing at first, you have to put a lot of attention on some parts that doesn't look to be so important but they are, anyway at the end its still one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>Definitely we have to keep an eye on Alfonso Cuaron next movies because he has demonstrated to be one of the best directors of this times."

","I'm proud to be a Mexican and watch the work to a fellow Mexican, like Alfonso Cuaron, who is making interesting choices to work. ""Children of Men"" with the lead role by Clive Owen, show us a very possible scenario in 2027, when no procreation is possible. But... can this be a cliché? I haven't found any movie with a positive vision of our future, maybe that's because our present events.<br/><br/>The biggest achievement about this movie is the cinematography, the Juliane Moore cameo and the always great Michael Caine, in a very good supporting role.<br/><br/>Good movie."
"emmakatetuck","10","5","8","11 November 2006"," my opinion on a few things in the movie!
","This is my first post, so please be gentle! i've mentioned a few things from the movie, so don't read this if you haven't seen it (though you probably won't know what i'm talking about anyway!) I saw this film last night on a whim - to be honest, there's not really any movies out at the moment i want to see! I'm so glad i saw this! I've read a few reviews of this movie in magazines, and they all said it was a sci-fi flick, but in my opinion, it's more of a 'futuristic' film - i think sci-fi, i think movies like star-trek. but this film showed a future that is quite possible. it really made me feel uneasy! everything about this 'future' was familiar, and there wasn't anything so out of place that it was jarring like in some other movies where it all seems possible and then someone gets in their flying car! the most disturbing was 'quietus', the at home suicide kit - even the advertising for it was sickening - and the fact that the kits were free and handed out by the government? creepy! i've read a few posts by others and there was one that commented about the fact that the infertility plot line didn't seem to make sense. i have to say that my initial reaction was the same, and i couldn't understand why Britain wasn't letting in any 'fugees'i the population was declining, and then i remember a comment by one of the characters - 'the whole world was going to s**t before the infertility issue - it just made it worse' (or something like that!) the infertility was like the straw that broke the camels back. i loved at the end when they were coming through the building and the sight of a baby brought everyone back to one level - it was like it united everyone, they forgot about what was happening, this little ray of hope was in their presence. but like most things, people quickly forget and the fighting starts again.<br/><br/>i also loved the fact that there wasn't a 'good guy' in this movie. Theo was originally in it for the money, the 'terrorists' planted a bomb that killed innocent people, the government (supposedly) did the same and was keeping fugees in cages on the street, even the people who were trying to save Ke and her baby had ulterior motives. it was realistic and kept you on edge - i never knew who they should trust (i swore that Miriam was in on it too, especially when he came into the room to tell them they had to leave because they were in danger - i was yelling in my head, no! don't trust her!) in fact, the whole audience was tense, the funniest moment in the theater was when they were running away from Sid and Theo smashed him in the face with the box, the whole audience screamed! at the end i just sat in my chair and was just blown away - you didn't realise how on the edge of your seat you were! i can't say i 'loved' this movie as it's not the kind of movie that you buy on DVD and watch over and over again on a Sunday afternoon - it's too depressing! but it definitely made an impact on me. the best movie i've seen this year! (actually, equal first - i loved Confetti!)"
"fantasyescapist","Null","5","8","11 October 2006"," Brilliant, though-provoking film ...
","I went to see this with my A2 class today, as it has some similarities with 'The Handmaid's Tale' by Margaret Atwood, so our teacher took us to see it and I was blown away.<br/><br/>This year so far I haven't seen a film that's as good as this - realistic, very good acting, cinematography, directing etc.<br/><br/>Basically, women are infertile in this near-future, and Clive Owen's character helps the only pregnant woman to safety.<br/><br/>It is quite a bleak, serious film, but that's the point! Everything is shot in a way that makes it seem so real, it's actually freaky. Gritty, violent and though-provoking, with a solid story and characters we care about. It touches on a lot of political issues going on at the moment.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron is such a good director, and I take back all the bad stuff I said about Prisoner of Azkaban, cause this film more than makes up for it. I gained so much from this, and learnt a lot. Easily the best film of the year so far."

","To think we only went to watch this as it started earlier than another one. <br/><br/>So its the future, the world has turned bad as people cant have children and really don't have much to live for. So someone gets pregnant and the struggle begins.<br/><br/>The action starts pretty much at the beginning and never stops for more than 1 minute stops. I was barely awake before watching it and came out as if id had a pint of red bull. There are certain scenes that make saving private Ryan look amateur and there are enough small moments of humour which makes some of the characters great to watch. Unmissable, go now."
"nunobio","3","8","15","12 January 2011"," One of the worst movies I have ever watched.
","I am astonished with the overall rating for this movie. I am still at half of it and with the expectation that something will eventually improve. I do not know where to start. The acting in general is poor and the actor's performance is very unrealistic. I do feel some sympathy for Clive Owen but I do not think he is a good actor. In every movie with him I have the same feeling, that he has a strong presence until he speaks, then everything falls apart. Another very annoying aspect about this movie is the technique used to shoot it, the cameraman is running after the characters and in fact participating in the action. Result: you become dizzy and in my opinion it simply does not fit! I also have the impression that the soundtrack is inexistent, therefore taking away any emotional atmosphere a movie with such a plot would need. Don't know where the English movie industry lost it but this work of poor quality falls very much into the same category of many other English movies, series and comedies of the last decade. Unfortunately..."
"badajoz-1","3","8","15","23 April 2009"," Another dystopian future - another disappointment
","Just like 'Franklyn,' 'I am Legend' and 'Waterworld' we are presented with a dystopian future, where all hell has broken loose with the lack of fertility amongst the world population. Only UK has survived in any normal sense - although the film begins with a CNN-like coverage of Princess Diana's death, sorry, Diego's(the youngest man on the planet)How has this been broadcast? - and yet it is filthy, run down, fascist, with violence and bombing an everyday experience. What would make a real picture would an in-depth investigation of how a society like this can still supply transport(trains), energy, computers etc without normal trading links - something I am sure Gordon Brown would like to know about! But no, this turns into a shoot em up chase movie with various nods to Arab/Israeli, Iraq conflicts and immigration. So, yes, an hour to set up this dystopian vision, in order to get Clive Owen heroically battling soldiers and terrorists to save the first child born in eighteen years without taking up a gun! Lots of realistic war zone footage, with even a miraculous pause in action as the miraculous child passes through the carnage!!! Sorry how this film can be praised, I don't know. If you have a futuristic society - make it work for us. Don't just show a few coal-fired power stations in the background on the south coast - all the coal is in the north of the UK- and put all the problems down to a mysterious flu epidemic in 2008. Take a chance, not fall for the predictable Hollywood, video game violence and sentimentality!"

All I felt at the end of the film is a sense of relief that it's over - as for the main character he's nodded off as well! There were some good moments - the war scenes particularly - but the cinematography was just soooooooo uninspiring, the characters shallow and as usual in crap sci-fi the 'history-why-did-this-happen?' pieces stuck in at predictable junctures throughout the film.<br/><br/>If you want to make good Sci-fi, leave it in the hands of a true fantasy director like Terry Gilliam. Compare Twelve Monkeys with Children of Men - there's just no comparison! <br/><br/>Now, if only they'd cast Bruce Willis, turned the aperture on the camera down a few notches, added some Ridley Scott skyline filters, a decent script and made it look a bit more like it wasn't filmed this year down Docklands somewhere - then it might not have been quite such a crap movie.<br/><br/>There have been some truly God-awful Sci-fi movies out over the last few years - take 'The Island' as one example - it's no wonder the genre takes such a beating.<br/><br/>Also, I can't believe the rating on this movie is so high - what are people thinking of?"
"somethinginteresting","10","8","15","15 February 2007"," The most overlooked movie of the year
","What can I say about ""Children of Men"" to make more people go see it? How about that it's one of the best films I have ever seen in the theater.<br/><br/>It's one of the greatest films I've ever SEEN.<br/><br/>This is one of the few films I would give a perfect 10 for. Alfonso Cuaron, from the first scene of the movie, crafts a beautiful and all too possible future world.<br/><br/>There are almost too many things to list that make up why this movie is so good, but I will try: The story is excellently told. The characters have unique and individual voices. From the very beginning of the film, I was completely absorbed in finding out about what was going in society of the world. The movie is cold, dark, and depressing and scarily realistic. The conflict between the native British and the so-called ""fugees,"" or refugees mirrors the immigration rumbles in the US right now perfectly.<br/><br/>Maybe that is why I love ""Children of Men"" so much. It was in the future, and yet it was a film that, for me, challenged a lot of modern day politics.<br/><br/>It is also one the film that made me realize something my dad had always told me. My dad always told me that the greatest films were told by pictures or images, and this is a film that certainly does it.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" is a film that I know I will look back on 10, 20, 30, even 40 years from now as a truly great film.<br/><br/>To close, I think it's a crime that this movie was not nominated for either Best Picture or Best Director--and I don't think I'm alone. See this movie."

","I do not know what the fuss about this movie was all about. I just returned from the cinema and I feel as I have just seen a mid-seventies Irish social drama; made entirely more like a social documentary than movie ""with a message"". I do however think it is truly realistic in the whole idea of ""what-would-be-if-it-would-be"", but nothing beyond that. Casting is excellent, Owen is *the* man for the role, the others are good as well, but there's nothing that leaves that stunning impression like in ""Babel""- Since it is the AA-nominee, it is obvious why it is like that - I merely think that something is missing somewhere. The same as seeing ""V for Vendetta"" - the general idea is great it's just that I expected more. More story, more reasons, more who'n'why.. But there it is as it is.. Unfortunately. I don't think I'd have a wish seeing it on DVD in the near future. But that's just me."
"phd-asskickology","10","8","15","17 January 2007"," Fantastic visuals, excellent story, it has a sense of realism.
","This story had some striking visual scenes that remained in my mind for hours after the movie was over. I thought the plot was excellent, and that is realistically showed how people behave in very unnatural setting. This movie had some very deep and emotional moments. It seems to me that a lot of reviewers are focusing on some parts of the movie to really nit- pick, this isn't an action film, this movies point it to convey an overall feeling of being in a time and place and that is what it does very well. You can see tiny little details all over the set and references placed throughout the film that instead of being vague and confusing are enlightening or at the very least add an intensity I haven't seen in a long time. One of the few movies that made me want to cry at one point. Definitely one of the better movies so far in the 21st century. If I had a child I would want to take them to this movie. One thing I loved about this movie was that it didn't try to explain what happened like often happens in sci-fi movies, this is very plot driven, they just show you the landscape and tell you the situation and move on. I also liked that on the extremes of either side of the political landscape in this movie they where more or less the same, just on side had power and the other none. I thought that was very true about most of life, with the people in the middle just kinda caught up in it all. I highly recommend this as a beautiful piece of film, go see it with a friend or spouse or family member, even alone if you have to."
"ElderGamingGod","9","8","15","13 January 2007"," Almost Perfect
","A lot of people thought that getting the job of directing the third Harry Potter movie would be Alfonso Cuarón's big break. Yet oddly enough, this Mexican director's big break would not only come years later, it would also be one he made for himself. Children of Men is that big break.<br/><br/>This movie is, without a doubt, n of the most ""in your ace films"" you will see all year. Cuarón made a decision about how he was going to present this film and did not look back. The environments are dirty and decaying, the people are all overshadowed by the hopelessness of their situation, and the only remaining signs of government we see are of the ""mighty"" English.<br/><br/>Clive Owen plays a man who has given into this life and world and has ceased to care. He lives his life as though the events that unfold around him don't matter unless they directly affect them. Owen gives a great performance as the man who has given up to avoid pain, but is cast right back into life with the revelation that a young woman is pregnant.<br/><br/>From there, Children takes off with the care and percussion of a director far more experienced then one would expect Cuarón to be. The action sequences in this film are amazing on their own, but become even better with the realization that a lot of them are done in long shots that go an ungodly amount of time without cutting. This film also contains (near its end) what may be the greatest urban combat sequence ever caught on film.<br/><br/>However, for everything that is great about this film, there are also a lot of things wrong with it. For one, Cuarón takes a great deal of care to make things very real to the viewers. While not a bad thing in and of it self, it makes it annoying when he cuts out of a situation that is a major problem (a major medical operation that is handled in only a very few minutes and left unresolved by a cut to when it's all over) or has some implausible action scenes (the car rolling down the hill that the men on foot would have caught). Also, one too many sequences in this film are played for laughs. Cain's performance does not fall into the category, but chasing the car down the hill does. And finally, and this is really the big one, the movie is so sad and so depressing that by the end, you have either left or have made yourself indifferent to the death and violence as a way of coping. This films last few scenes display the problem as Cuarón tries for an emotional ending that I could not latch onto because of how damaged I already was.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, this really is one of the best films of the year."

","It's a difficult thing, defining a masterpiece, especially when the term is thrown about all too casually. And I wouldn't want to call this film 'important' either, because I don't believe it is a word that should ever be used when defining ANY work of art. A film (or anything at all for that matter) is only as important as you're willing to make it. I sometimes wish people wouldn't be so shallow as to pour so much of their time and energy considering such superficial things as a series of moving images projected onto a large white screen, no matter its contents. Yet here I am, like many of you, spending both my time and energy typing away about this film (even if I do so implicitly). And so, I find that I am left with two possibilities; either that I am another shallow rambler wasting away in contemplation of foolish things, or Children Of Men is truly important to me. In reality, both of these are true...and in a nutshell, this is what Children Of Men is all about. It's about most us, those of us who are 'aware' yet not bothered enough to transcend their mere 'awareness' of the problem. That is, until something comes along and lights a fire under their asses. For me, it may be this mere film, Children Of Men."

Here is the plot summarized: move pregnant woman for unknown reason through ""terorists"" ""facists""""leftist hippies"" and across a battlefield into a boat. If you think i am joking, watch the movie. It is my opinion that this movie will only appeal to those who can ideologically agree with its leftist babble, and to those that blatantly and without reason have a distaste for authority. Also, the killing of the two police officers for no reason was distasteful and offensive."

The cinematography is absolutely BRILLIANT which might not carry the same effect if it were watched on a small TV. Same goes for the sound which is spot on and deafening at times; it really captures the imagery well. The plot line is pretty great, good dialog, outstanding visuals, and overall very well-paced.

","OMG This is an amazing film, an absolute masterpiece. I am absolutely mind-blown. I really like intellectual science fiction and nihilistic visions of the future collapse of western society, and this one is so plausible and palpable.<br/><br/>Intelligent, funny, powerful, political, and quite a logical warning and rational progression from where we are today. This could happen. I don't know about the major plot point - that humans stopped reproducing, but the rest... it could happen.<br/><br/>The cinematography is blindingly excellent. I lost all sense of sitting in a theatre watching a movie and found myself feeling thoroughly captivated - which meant that my heart was racing and I felt like I, also, was in harm's way. It is violent, but not the usual garden variety of ""There are men with guns on the screen, they are fighting."" No, this is Technicolor 3-D ""cinerama really makes it real"" violence that is presented with such clarity that you will walk away and feel a sense of relief that the street scene you will encounter as you walk outside the theatre is once again comfortably normal.<br/><br/>The sound editing is also brilliant, I really like the way they would take a sound and transform it as the scenes changed. I can't be more specific without writing spoilers, but please trust me, this is a film to see in the best theatre you can afford because the sound design is a critical component to the experience of being in this story.<br/><br/>Excellent soundtrack too. I want it, gotta have it. Amazing gems, from King Crimson to Radiohead and all over the world and back - with an extra cool cover of the Stones' Ruby Tuesday used to great satisfaction.<br/><br/>Rated 10 out of 10 on the super cool movie experience scale."
"kidboi","10","8","15","28 October 2006"," One of 2006' best films.
","2006 has really surprised me with it's movies. I was honestly expecting the big budget action blockbusters to be the years best films, but most of them just flat out sucked. Little did i know, that it was the end of this year, that would bring on the good movies. 'Children Of Men' is one of those films.<br/><br/>The film is set in London, 2027. Everything is completely messed up. Women are infertile, people have lost all hope of further future and in the beginning of the film, the youngest person on earth dies, leaving the world in complete desperation. But could all this be changed with a single breath of child? That is the question this movie is making. When all hope seems to be lost, can one single person make a difference? In terms of cinematography, Cuaron goes into a direction similar to that in 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'. Grim tones, hand held camera. And in this case, it completely works. It blends perfectly with the chaotic look and feel of this film. The 2027 London is wonderfully done, and makes you think that actually the present day, but has these little hints that it is the future, such as holographic screens and stuff like that. The acting in the film is brilliant. Since Clive Oven is one of my favorite actors, i was very delighted to finally see him in a lead role. Julianne Moore gives a solid performance as well, but i was surprised to see Michael Cane in such an extraordinary role. Instead of playing himself, as usual, he plays this crazy hippie like old wacko, who seems to like the joke 'Pull my finger' quite a lot. The movie isn't all non-stop action, but when there is action, it's realistic and very originally made.<br/><br/>One of the best films 2006 has to offer. Definitely a must see.<br/><br/>10/10"
"ExpendableMan","9","8","15","2 October 2006"," A strong contender for film of the year
","Let's not beat around the bush here, children are a pain in the backside. Sure, to the parents they might be angelic little beauties wrapped in swaddling clothes with the most adorable sparkling eyes, but to the rest of us they are the tantrum throwing hell spawn that make grocery shopping and bus journeys a thing of misery. But what if they suddenly ceased to be? If women up and down the country started having miscarriages and the pregnancy rate plummeted until it dwindled away to nothing? How long would we last before giving way to utter chaos? This is the premise of Children of Men, a film that manages to encapsulate a whirlwind of emotions in the course of its running time and emerges as one of the most thought-provoking cinema releases in a long time.<br/><br/>Set in Britain in 2027, the opening scene is one of sledgehammer like subtlety. Our protagonist Theo (Clive Owen) wanders into a coffee shop to catch a news report on the death of the world's youngest human being. He buys a drink and ignoring the crowd milling around the television, wanders back outside when the relative tranquillity of the scene is abruptly ended when the coffee house and everyone within it is decimated by the blast of a terrorist bomb, followed by screams and the disturbing sight of a woman stumbling out holding her severed arm in one hand. And from here onwards, your attention is fixed.<br/><br/>This is a Britain not unlike that seen in V For Vendetta. In the face of social anarchy where activist groups promote their ideologies by blowing up civilians, the Government has responded in true Orwellian style. The pretence of Democracy having long been abandoned, we instead have a world of black suited riot police with machine guns marching in unison beneath the billboards encouraging the civilian mass to report on their neighbours the instant they show any sign of unusual behaviour. One especially jarring moment comes when Theo steps off a train and casually walks past several cages containing East Europeans who have all been rounded up, a moment that is alarming simply for the sense of how normal it is. With violent mobs attacking vehicles for no specific reason accompanied by the surrealism of an early view of a big inflatable pig hovering above an industrial estate, one of the film's many strong points is in crafting a wholly believable world during these initial scenes. It is a chaotic world where dystopic oppression meets indiscriminate violence and it sucks you in completely, frightening in how close it seems.<br/><br/>But things really step up a gear when the main crux of the plot arrives. Abducted by his ex-wife's activist group, Theo finds himself meeting with the world's only pregnant woman and soon becomes embroiled in a mission to escort her to the coast to meet up with the Human Project, a shadowy secret organisation who will be able to shelter her and possibly save the whole human race in the process. Hounded at all turns by those who want to use Kee (the magnificent Claire-Hope Ashitey) and her baby for their own ends, Theo's initial reluctance to get involved transforms into a stubborn determination to protect her at all costs and their quest makes for gripping viewing.<br/><br/>Holding all this together is a combination of documentary-style film making and some brilliant performances from all involved. Unlike most major releases, the camera is more of a passive bystander and the focus is on a realistic portrayal. There is no dramatic panning or ham-fisted slow motion at all and this calmer, less intrusive approach allows everything to seem more real.<br/><br/>And speaking of real, Clive Owen deserves a wealth of praise for his central performance as Theo. He has foregone all pretence of Hollywood glamour and seeing his unshaven, haggard form when it first shuffles on screen it's hard to believe that this is the same man who played Dwight in Sin City. Throughout the course of the film, he provides the audience with a highly sympathetic figure to cling onto. He cries, he bleeds, he even breaks down at one point and his attempts to guide Kee are bereft of any action hero melodrama. As a result, he is so indescribably human that you'd have to possess a heart of stone not to root for him. The aforementioned Claire-Hope Ashitley meanwhile puts in a performance that should hopefully elevate her profile and grant her more roles. For want of a better word, she is fantastic. Kee is at times strong and cynical with a bitter sense of humour about her but altogether very vulnerable and couldn't be more convincing if she tried.<br/><br/>This is accompanied by a divertingly cheerful performance by Michael Caine as an ageing hippie who is intent on seeing out the end of the world with a smile, a mountain of cannabis and Ruby Tuesday on the record player. He adds a light touch that provides a welcome break from all the nightmarish scenarios we get elsewhere. What's more, there's another brief but powerful turn from the criminally under appreciated Chiwetel Ejiofor who must surely be one of the acting world's best kept secrets.<br/><br/>As a whole then, Children of Men is a commanding piece of art. It creates an enthralling world of humanity under incredible pressure, but does so without over-indulging or playing to the camera. And if there is to be one moment that sums up the entire film, it comes near the finale as Theo and Kee stumble out of a shattered apartment block with the baby wrapped up next to her mother's chest. Corpses line the streets and rubble is strewn everywhere and for a moment, the war-zone grows calm as soldiers and activists alike lower their weapons as the realisation of what has become of mankind sinks in before someone pulls a trigger again and the carnage continues. Highly recommended."

","The trailer proclaiming Children Of Men was ""from the director of 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' and 'Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkhaban'"" made me chuckle - two very different films. Yet of course, Alfonso Cuaron's astonishing cinematic style and the colours he wrings from the screen are present in both, and are very much present in Children of Men - which in the sense that it's about a car journey from the city to the sea, has the same basic premise as Y Tu Mama Tambien. Beyond that, the contrast couldn't be starker, though, with the gorgeous Mexican countryside and sunshine of the earlier film replaced by a dank, drizzly Britain whose landscape is filled with fields of burning cattle, smoke-belching factories and derelict schools. In Y Tu Mama Tambien, the travellers are shown kindness and hospitality by all they meet - in Children Of Men, they are ambushed by a burning car and chased by motorcycle gunmen. And the journey ends not in an unspoilt Pacific beach paradise, but the foggy English Channel, with toxic waste spewing into the water.<br/><br/>But despite the depressing nature of this vision of Britain in 2027, it's no less sumptuous a cinematic experience - Cuaron makes greyness and decay throb with colour. The London of the future seem depressing and exhilarating simultaneously - much of the enjoyment of this first part of the film is watching out for all the subtle and not so subtle differences between life now and in the future. There is also a bit of humour early on - the inflatable pig outside Battersea Power Station, and Theo's boss's office festooned with cricketing memorabilia which seems to suggest that England hadn't won the Ashes since 2005! Somehow even the state-provided suicide pills with the slogan 'You Decide When' are quite amusing. The second part of the film is the most conventional 'action movie' section, as Theo and Kee make the hazardous journey from London to Bexhill, and finally there is the refugee camp and battle scene, which is not just stupendous in execution, but is a powerful reminder that people are living like this right now, whether in Guantanamo Bay or Lebanon - the scene where the block of flats is shelled was an incredibly vivid depiction what must be the sheer terror of being bombed in your own home - and the wailing of the baby amid the destruction a heartbreaking reminder of how the most innocent suffer in war.<br/><br/>This is a great film on every level - beautiful to look at, great acting (with Clive Owen perfect in the role of Theo), fantastic music and a gripping narrative, which you can view as sci-fi, action movie or political allegory, depending on which mood you're in. And just as Cuaron's even earlier Great Expectations had a great Pulp song, so as the credits roll, we have Jarvis Cocker's wondrous ""C***s Are Still Running The World"" - the title of which can either be interpreted as being about political leaders - or perhaps in the context of the film and the miraculous birth of a baby, is about womankind being restored to their rightful place in the natural order of things as the givers of life."
"Melon2000","10","8","15","22 September 2006"," Hands Down Best Film of the Year So Far
","""Children of Men"" opened here in Britain today, and I've just got back from seeing it this afternoon. It's easily best film I've seen at the cinema so far this year, and probably one of the best sf movies for a hell of a long time (maybe one of the best ever). Obviously I loved it - here's why: the depiction of Britain in the future is absolutely spot on - there are so many little references (Bexhill as a refugee camp is a terrific injoke for anyone who's ever been there - I live down the road) and locations shown to the point of decay that look and feel just right (it's now, just more so). The detail in the film is meticulous to the extreme, locations that I've walked around have been revamped and everything is completely realistic. There is no fake looking CGI in this film - it's like walking around the real world, and sucks you in completely. The camera-work is truly extraordinary - incredibly long hand held shots that follow Clive Owen through increasingly large and scarily real battle scenes (particularly a scene in a car getting ambushed and another run through a full scale battle zone are jawdroppingly good - outdoing anything in Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" - the only two films where I' ve seen anything that comes close to this). Alfonso Cuaron's best film so far. It's got the heavyweight message and performances of a great drama with the tension, excitement and spectacle of a big time action movie. Clive Owen is perfectly cast - it really is his film - everyone else (as good as they are) are just there for support. I've often found him a little wooden before - but his cynical, grizzled character here is one he was born to play. It's really knocked me for six, and I honestly can't recommend this enough - it's got the truth and integrity of an indie film with the sheer verve and emotion of great Hollywood cinema. A future classic."

","Children of Men makes you feel the setting of the movie as well as any I've seen. It is filled to the brim with details that show the level of dystopia present in London, where things are supposedly ""best"". Rather than focusing on the premise, Cuaron drops you right into the world and emphasizes how people live in this world and the consequences. The visuals of the world and how Cuaron gives the viewer information via details in the shots rather than exposition is excellent. The cinematography is among the best I've ever seen, with several edge of your seat action sequences shot without cuts. The ambiguity and the focus on people rather than the scientific solutions and reasoning makes it a more powerful film showcasing the extreme dystopia. Bleak and intense, but its technical aspects elevate Children of Men to be a great movie."

","Children of Men is set in the year 2027 where women have become infertile so no baby's are being born and the human race is going to die out. There were parts of Children of Men that are incredible. The premise, most of the acting and some action scenes that have you on edge make this film great. This film uses lots of long takes that were at times very impressive and at time you didn't even notice it. What I really liked was that the main character, who was played by Clive Owen, could have been a hero who would save the world from this dystopian future, but instead he was written as an every man who was very relatable which made the movie much better. The fight scenes were also done extremely well, there's one in a car that looks like its all in one take and is absolutely breathtaking. Children of Men takes lots of inspiration from dystopian fiction like 1984 and Blade Runner and has parts that feel like they could fit into either of those story's as well as the tone being very similar.<br/><br/>Children of Men does almost everything right. There are just some slip ups in the story. There's one part in the middle of the film that didn't feel as realistic as the other parts and some characters made decisions that were a bit stupid. That only really happened for a bit and then i started to get completely sucked into the story again <br/><br/>If your a fan of dystopian future then you'll love Children of Men and also if you just like really good movies, just keep in mind that it's not perfect."

","I remember watching this cult-classic YEARS ago on DVD with my best- friend; we were having a sleepover at his place and we watched this movie on his MacBook Pro. And this was remarkable; in every sense of the word! Children of Men looks at what would happen if humanity ceased to reproduce: but suddenly there's ONE woman in the whole of the UK who's pregnant with the first child conceived in years. It's a fantastic premise for a dystopian sci-fi movie and it delivers with the grittiness, the somber tone, and Clive Owen's remarkable lead performance. Children of Men is not your typical alien-invasion sci- fi; it's a grounded affair into what happens when society is on the brink of total collapse, and then there's the smallest yet biggest glimmer of hope: a soon-to-be-born child.<br/><br/>Why was this a flop at the box office? I have no f###ing idea why, but it deserved a WHOLE LOT MORE than it initially grossed.<br/><br/>Anyway: Children of Men is one of my favourite sci-fi movies!"
"vostf","7","3","4","4 September 2012"," Good, not great for lack of a more elaborate storyline
","Children of Men is a directorial achievement, no question about it. Alfonso Cuaron made the choice of a documentary-like approach, and this is extremely well done. Sequence shots with the camera moving with the characters, and with lots of action and extras all around: kudos.<br/><br/>Now if you set aside how it's done, and how good the cast is, you have a pretty flimsy storyline. The main character (Clive Owen) is only reacting to events, he is only a reluctant hired activist. Too much depth for this character is sprinkled here and there without leaving us time to empathise and eventually root for him.<br/><br/>OK the dystopian reality is nicely done, but it's only a very grim background and action is reduced to characters running in front of this very background over and over again. Science fiction, social commentary are not just about finding a nice historical and sociological backdrop. Here is the big flaw in the script: the action, and the hope it is supposed to foster, feels very episodic. Just think of it: the best scenes are those with 2 characters given a real dimension by talented actors. Julianne Moore has something to display in front of the passive Clive Owen character, then it's Michael Caine and it is a real pleasure (and relief) to get to enjoy him again later.<br/><br/>All the ""apocalyptic"" end is very well done but the movie is stalled from the start in the same way the car is in a very funny scene (was it really intentional? Could not be actual relief for the characters in the middle of action + depressing times). Actually the movie goes nowhere and never picks up speed. Director Cuaron succeeded in his technical endeavour but the rest feels empty because he confused visually gripping context and compelling story-line."

This made no sense.<br/><br/>And it remains so until you see the commentary by people who made the film. Then it becomes all to obvious: a film against globalization. Then it becomes quite obvious that the producers have a major political bias (read: ""Farenheit 9/11"") that is bad on facts and lousy on production.<br/><br/>Overall, the film did not much to further their cause for anti-globalization.

It began really great, but it wasn't good enough to engage me for so long. However, there are a few good performances: Julianne Moore does a great job, so does legend Michael Caine, and they are really helping to raise the level of the film. I know it must be very hard to make a film that takes place in the future, but hey, War of the Worlds did it! Well, anyway, if you don't have anything better to do, you could see it.

"natalia-martian","4","4","6","28 September 2014"," If you read the book and liked it, don't watch the movie!
","I made the grave mistake of watching the movie after having read the book. I liked the book very much, because it explored the undertones of a world without children, the subtle ways in which it changes people. The book showed how different persons had different coping mechanisms and what that did to society as a whole. It also showed so many different facets of the same person, not just a tired nobody, like the movie made Faron out to be.<br/><br/>So I went into the movie having certain expectations which were never met. Characters were changed or added or subtracted. The relationships between characters were greatly modified. The main character had nothing but the name in common with the character in the book. The mother is not the same in the book. The Fishes are not anarchists, they're just a group of people who haven't stopped caring, like the rest of the world. The group leader is someone else. Jasper was not an old hippie who grew weed and lived in a hyperbolic world. Everything was messed up and backwards. The action was totally different from what happens in the book. So I would repeat my warning: if you read the book and liked it, don't watch the movie, you will be utterly disappointed!<br/><br/>I don't know if it was the bitter taste that made me watch this with very critical eyes, but I also found the acting pretty bad. Faron had no depth, his cousin had no credibility, Julian only seemed to be in it for the kicks, and don't get me started on Miriam, worst of all. I appreciated they hired a Romanian speaking actor to do the Romanian bit, it does taste authentic, though I did not like it that they felt the need for the gypsy in there in the first place. I did not like the shaky camera either, made me feel like I was watching a poorly budgeted documentary. The crying baby scene... dragged out and milked for everything it didn't have.<br/><br/>This might be the last time I watch a movie after having read the book, especially if I liked it."

I just didn't care, making for a depressing movie even though there were a number of really good edge-of-the seat scenes. And because of the inglorious plot holes and the things that were just too far fetched to believe, spoiling the credibility of what seemed like a seriously good film at first. There was some quite poor acting in places too that spoiled the continuity at key moments and made me care very little about it and the plot that unfolded.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the concept and many of the scenes, but couldn't care less about the outcome and what happened to the characters. A major flaw for me.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the investment in props and effects was pretty good, especially the final 'battle' between the uprising and the military police. Michael Caine was warmly excellent and infused the film with humanity, as opposed to the headless chickens running around all the time.<br/><br/>A plot needs to come full circle and give us the 'hah-hah' surprise element, but not here, it just rushed through things as fast as possible in attempt to brush past the implausibility of it all.<br/><br/>An improbable movie that failed to fully entertain."

If we keep allowing brutalism and mischief to multiply abroad, what will it look like when it festers and seeps in under our doors? <br/><br/>What would life be like if you had a certain amount of wealth or privilege and you built a bubble of normality around you? What would happen as the ""cost"" for maintaining this bubble became more and more prohibitive and more of your friends couldn't keep up? In this film, there are lots of different coping mechanisms on display. Some characters turn to a resistance movement, which ultimately is as ruthless as the forces it opposes. Another character tries to get by on his wits (and his ganja) and is steamrolled by the urgent business at hand. Another relies on a religion that seems to be an off-shoot of New Age idealism that looks at danger as something of an inconvenient attitude problem. Another character, one that has assembled considerable power and treasure is asked how he copes with the chaos just outside the door and he replies, ""I don't pay attention to it.""<br/><br/>But worse, what would life be like if you didn't have sufficient wealth to maintain your freedom? In this exercise (in this movie), civil liberties are shattered. ""Illegal immigrants"" are collected like Pol Pot-era Cambodian outlaws, put in cages and taken to camps. Some are displayed in poses from Abu Graeb, others... who knows? We the viewers of the film, move on to other vital business.<br/><br/>So, bravo to P.D.

Cuaron's world of the near future may be dystopian but certain aspects of it ring true with where we, in our own real world, may be headed towards. So I guess this is a very political film too. People will either agree with it or completely disagree with it. There is no middle path.<br/><br/>As a filmmaker and a student of film, this is a film which stands out for me in 2006.

I knew he could make anything interesting and captivating.<br/><br/>This movie isn't it.<br/><br/>It does have its moments of brilliance: the opening scene is amazing. You feel you are seeing a documentary rather than a movie and you are seeing it right as it happens. The scene in the countryside where Julian (Julianne Moore) is shot and killed captures the intensity and is very realistic as well. I especially dug the scene where Thom (Clive Owen) is being driven to his cousin's mansion in time to King Crimson's ""In The Court of Crimson King."" It becomes almost Kubrick like and like something Stanley Kubrick would do.<br/><br/>Yet, I found myself not really caring about the characters or the story at all. Thom has to help a pregnant girl escape. Why? We don't really know. The pregnant girl is very hostile to Thom and inexplicably warms up to him and becomes his friend by the end of the movie. The ""Human Project"" is not seen nor explained further beyond what other people say about it. Julian's vigilante group changes their stance very quickly and seems to double-cross Thom more than once (although if I were kidnapped, I doubt very seriously I would trust my one-time kidnappers) without explanation. They want to use the baby for 'political reasons'? Why? Why is almost the entire movie not explained or understood like this? Not only that, but the protagonist in Thom is VERY one-dimensional. We get that he is cynical about life and thinks his life is sh*t and I went into the movie expecting him to progress as a character. Instead, I felt he just wandered with the girl and escaped but that was it.<br/><br/>I hope sincerely that the creators of the movie did set out to craft a story instead of the uninteresting mess I saw. I really wanted to like this movie; what kept me going was to see how well Cuaron would depict the scenes and the hand-held/documentary style of the film. I sorta wish the ending was a big reveal and the ""Human Project"" knew of the girl's existence all along. Instead, we got the awful ending we got. I guess Thom's life was sh*t after all.<br/><br/>And so was this movie."

","I found CHILDREN OF MEN at a cheap price and I was warned reading the critics before I bought the DVD. I have to admit that the story hits a serious problem of nowadays but I am disappointed for several reasons. First, the camera-work was too shaky and bad. Second, the cinematography was very cheap and I cannot understand how it could won some prizes at the film festivals or why so many nominations. Third, the script was not developed enough to create a tension packed action thriller. There were enough other candidates to earn some attention. I was impressed therefore by another good performance from Clive Owen. I found him also very good in DERAILED. CHILDREN OF MEN is not a must see. Final verdict: 4/10."

","I loved this movie and the director for 2 main reasons.<br/><br/>1) Anyone who can incorporate the King Crimson song ""In the Court of the Crimson King"" into the soundtrack of a movie is amazing.<br/><br/>2) Shortly after the King Crimson song, Theo is having a conversation with his cousin in front of some large windows. Outside the windows, the background looks exactly the same as the cover of Pink Floyd's ""Animals"" album. With the floating pig, smoke stacks and everything. I think I am one of the few who caught that.<br/><br/>The movie also contains a very good chase scene.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see what Alfonso Cuaron does next."

","Once again, I'm subjected to a film that is style over content. I'm seriously disappointed by this film, especial since it is directed by Alfonso Cuarón, who gave us ""Y tu Mama Tambien"" a film with soul and so much richness and depth. This film lacks that entirely and by the end I felt nothing for any of the characters, I couldn't have cared less if they lived or died, I just wanted to escape them. To be honest I'm not usually a Clive Owen fan, but I have to say his performance in this film was very good. Now I don't want to be negative,but I can't help it here, this film should have had at least half an hour shaved off it and a lot of the dialogue changed as left me feeling patronised, I'm not stupid and neither are most movie goers, for instance - an alarm goes off and what does Micael Caine's character say ""It's the alarm"" WE KNOW unless we are deaf.<br/><br/>Sorry, but, well there it is. Don't take my word for it watch it for yourself, make up your own, at the end of the day it's only my opinion and opinions are like arseholes, everyone's got one."
"inkblot11","5","7","13","23 February 2007"," A noble attempt is the kindest description one can give to this film
","It is the year 2037. Civilization has broken down everywhere, except in England. Naturally, human beings across the globe are entering the country, only to be apprehended and sent to concentration camps. Britian, it seems, is for Britain only. There is another problem, also, in that there have been no pregnancies in 18 years. No one knows exactly why women are infertile but pollution, global warming, food additives and the like are being blamed. Theo (Clive Owen) still has a high ranking government job but that does not mean he is living high off the hog, only that he is in a better state than most. He stays in touch with an old hippie friend (Michael Caine) who resides in a secret forested enclave near London. One day, Theo is kidnapped by a so-called terrorist group whose agenda is to ensure the fair treatment of immigrants and the end of the camps. Theo's ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) has ordered Theo's capture, in hopes that he will be able to garner the legal papers to escort a young lady to a safer community off the coast. It so happens she is miraculously pregnant and a hope for the future. Will Theo get involved? This film, although noble in its attempt, is not a very good movie. The culprit is the story, which, despite being by P.D. James, is disjointed, inconsistent, and incoherent, at times. This leads to incredulity and disappointment. Owen, a very fine actor, of course, tries his best and the rest of the cast is well chosen, too. The costumes are good but, the production values are a bit wanting, considering a futuristic setting. If you want to see a collapsed future world, try the Mad Max movies or Blade Runner. Although it tries hard, Children of Men ultimately goes belly up, unfortunately."
"BigRayH3","9","7","13","22 February 2007"," A Bleak View Of TheFuture, But A Stunning View None-The-Less
","The first thing a lot of fans of this film (or the novel it was based on) will be to draw comparisons between the two. However, the film is extremely different from the novel. If you are picking up the book after seeing the film or heading to the theater expecting a revival of the book, DON'T. Look at them as separate stories from the same world of the author. They aren't comparable.<br/><br/>That being said, after taking in both the movie and the book, I enjoyed the film much more. I watched the film with amazement and awe throughout. (The incredible cinematography and direction were stunning and should be at the top of the list for this year's, if not this decade's best) Clive Owen seemed born to play the part of Theo and Micheal Caine delivers an uncanny performance of.... well, Caine. (But it works amazingly well) The only actor that I questioned was Julianne Moore, not for her acting, but for the roll. Julian seems better played by a lesser-known. But she does a great job.<br/><br/>The most outstanding thing in this film is the utter realism it achieves through extended shots that seem to run forever, but never lose excitement. I don't have to tell anyone the two most spectacular shots in the film that use this. If you've seen it, you know. If you haven't, you will. Simply amazing! (They've sparked some interesting discussions for the fans, just take a look in the IMDb Forums) The tale of post-apocalyptic London and the dismal future of the world is nothing new. But the depiction of the ""near-future"" in C.o.M. is so subtle and organic, it comes across surrealistically.... real. It allows the viewer to look past the time and focus on the story. (We've all seen enough films that show us the bright and shiny, flashy as Epcot Center, FUTURE) It's nice to see this done so well while still being interesting and fresh.<br/><br/>Bottom-line, this film has heart. In a gritty war-torn scene of violence, to see the hearts of men and women so touched by the sight of a child made me tear up in the theater. (Just don't tell anyone) In the end, for all it's action and excitement, this film is about the heart of humanity. If not the survival of it."
"nicniewart","1","7","13","24 January 2007"," A Dank Dismal View of Post Blairite England
","Britain's best film making was the golden age of Ealing Studios, where such gems as KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS,THE LADYKILLERS,THE LAVENDER HILL MOB,PASSPORT TO PIMLICO were at one end and by the time of the lavish blockbusters of David Lean the era was already in decline. The films showed honest labourers with a charm and humanity, and also the rich at play with style and elegance. Consider then the subject matter of CHILDREN OF MEN: a dismal world that England has become under Blair, rank, decaying, everything broken, covered with mildew, graffiti, nothing working, abandoned old cars, dodgy looking immigrants everywhere, shoddy clothes, smoke and pollution everywhere, everyone looking and being unpleasant, 1984-style guards in a shadow of SS or NKVD lookalikes. What is there in this film so the eye can rest on? There is no comfort anywhere. Everything is dirty, the colours bleached, the greens made khaki, sour orange. There are no nice cars, no nice houses, kitchens, gardens, anything. At least Tarkovsky had a driving narrative, critically composed frames, and a superior moral stance as he was battling the Soviet regime from within. This has no such claims. The hero is played by Clive Owen who resembles a block of wood, inheriting the role once made famous by Liam Neeson. Julianne Moore is in it for about 15 minutes then gets shot dead (a merciful release) and then so does Michael Caine, who is the sole positive thing about this movie. The subject matter concerns that the authorities in this future world are preventing/have prevented/ or maybe considering to prevent/ any more babies being born. I couldn't care less which of those it was. On fast forward, it doesn't really matter. The film shows an England in a world devoid of any reference to God, or the joys and compassion it brings to life, so the whole tenet and tone of this film to me is utterly pointless. It has all the air of a made for TV BBC film, did I say film? more like the filmed bits in a dismal 1970's BBC video tape series like Doctor Who. In the 40's someone faced with the subject matter of this film would just run away to Florida, or Utah. In a French film of the 50's everyone would have a car crash; in the 60's people would sing; in the 70's they would turn to drugs; in the 80's they would turn to technology. In the 90's they would send a rocket to some distant planet to summon help; now we have no solution, only the off switch. The whole thing is so joyless and unsympathetic that I had given up caring what the plot was, or what the outcome was, and the only thing that baffles me is why such obvious talents as Cuaron, Lubetzki, and Caine should waste on such subject matter. The last time I watched something so awful was in student days when the film club had booked a documentary with the irresistible title of LABOUR UNREST IN SAO TOME. (Well it was the late 60's) And this has been nominated for some Oscars? Please, Gentlemen, try harder."
"Boba_Fett1138","9","9","18","7 April 2007"," What an incredible realistic looking movie.
","At the beginning of the movie I was quite worried. I thought; Oh no, not another movie about a depressive, cold and ugly looking future, in which a common man grows out to be a hero. For the first 30 minutes it really felt like the movie was heading in that direction. Later the movie starts to take a positive turn when the movie becomes less plot orientated and instead turns into an almost documentary like observation of the events happening in the movie. It helps to give the movie its really realistic feeling.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie is in how how incredible authentic it all looks and feels. It helps to make the movie make a big impact on you. The movie will probably glue you to the screen for at least its last, really impressive looking, final 30 minutes or so. Even despite its weaker more formulaic opening this movie as a whole knows to totally grab you and leave a really lasting and powerful impression. The camera always stays with the main character, which allows us to see the things as he sees them. I really liked this approach, since it made the movie feel really realistic and puts you right in the middle of everything. You really feel that you're a part of this movie while watching it. This works especially great toward the ending of the movie when the action begins and it really starts to feel like you're watching a war-documentary.<br/><br/>The movie features many long shots that at times go on for minutes. This also works great for the movie its realism and it makes sure to grab you and put you right in the middle of things. It provides the movie with some great made and looking moments that are memorable, for sure.<br/><br/>Also of course the visual style of the movie adds to the authentic feel of the movie. The Emmanuel Lubezki cinematography (Oscar nominated, in a great year for cinematography) is most excellent.<br/><br/>The movie subtlety shows 'the future', so no flying cars or ray-guns in this movie. There are only small changes in the future and more subtle things such as the way we talk and society lives with its-, almost as if it has accepted, violence. I also like the way animals play a subtle role in this movie, which use can be interpreted in many different ways and some other small elements and references in the movie that have a deeper meaning in it. <br/><br/>Yes, the future in this movie is dark, depressive and about a hopeless situation but the movie doesn't do anything to exaggerate it. Also again a reason why this movie feels so incredible realistic. I don't necessarily see ""Children of Men"" as a warning for the future but more as a persons vision of the future, if the world, environment and society goes on living and changing the way it does now. The movie thank goodness does not have a preachy undertone and it doesn't prominently tries to send out a message to its viewers.<br/><br/>And is it me or is Clive Owen getting better with every movie? What I also love about this movie is that it has a couple of other A-list actors in in it (Julianne Moore, Michael Caine) but the movie isn't afraid to treat them like B-list actors.<br/><br/>The movie perfectly incorporate its action into the movie. It shows that director Alfonso Cuarón is top of the game when it comes down to action. The movie has action in it many modern action movies would be jealous of but Cuarón knows to feature its action in an humble way, despite its large scale and complexity, to let the action serve in the service of the movie and its story.<br/><br/>An absolute essential 2006 viewing and one of the year's best.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"El_Farmerino_Esq","9","9","18","22 February 2007"," Exhilarating, visceral cinema.
","It seems many critics are either getting hung up on searching for some kind of political meaning in Children of Men or endlessly theorising about the possible cause of the global sterility that is central to the plot; missing the point on both counts, in this reviewer's opinion, as both the political and science-fiction aspects of the movie are merely means' to an end - the end of crafting a breathtaking, human and incredibly visceral cinematic experience. If you'd like a sketched-out political message (let's face it - when it comes to politics, there's little room in any movie for more than a mere sketch) then, hey, the internet is your big, fat, rusty-coloured pearl vomiting oyster. Likewise, if you would like a dry and quasi-scientific or laughably mystical explanation of a highly improbable scenario that adds absolutely nothing to the story then, well, I believe The Outer Limits is available to purchase on DVD. If, however, you'd prefer a magnificently filmed, brilliantly acted and absurdly thrilling depiction of a society tearing itself to shreds in the face of the ultimate despair, and the fragile glimmer of hope struggling through the darkness at the centre, well, welcome to Children of Men.<br/><br/>The movie plunges us into a society without children - a society, therefore, with no future, no hope. In the effort to keep some kind of order, the British government has resorted to ruthlessly hunting down and detaining all illegal immigrants/refugees. The country is riddled with terrorist factions, the most prominent of which being The Fishes, a radical group ostensibly fighting for immigrant rights. It is a country teetering on the brink of an abyss into which the rest of the world has already fallen. Amongst all of this, we follow Theo (Clive Owen); a man who, along with everyone else, has little left to look forward to. That is, until he gets involved in the increasingly desperate struggle to protect a miraculously pregnant young girl who just might hold the key to mankind's survival...<br/><br/>It's a plot of very grandiose proportions, to be sure, but Cuaron does the sensible thing and keeps it tight on Theo; throughout the movie we never really leave his side. It's a part Owen pulls off with aplomb, a performance of wearied charm with glimpsed moments of emotional turmoil seeping through the cracks. The support cast is uniformly excellent, too, particularly Claire-Hope Ashitey as the rather-too-symbolically-named Kee.<br/><br/>What really makes Children Of Men, though, is the dazzling technical brilliance of the film-making. The two central action pieces, filmed in extended, continuous hand-held takes, mark a triumph of carefully planned, visceral cinema over effects-laden bombast. The near-final sequence, in particular, set inside the explosive battleground of a disintegrating refugee camp, really has to be seen to believed. Reportedly a nightmare to shoot, it's worth any and all effort expended and ranks among the finest achievements in cinematic history.<br/><br/>This is not to say that this is a movie without any flaws - in the first half, certainly, there are a few moments of rather clumsy plot exposition and, as mentioned above, some of the symbolism is a little too on-the-nose. However, these are largely minimal complaints when faced with a film as arresting and exhilarating as this. Children of Men is a brilliant study of humanity on the brink, of a society gripped by fear and despair, turning on itself, and of a man at the centre struggling to salvage some kind of hope. It is an action movie, sure, but one with a deep understanding of human weakness at its centre. Despite what some might say, it doesn't attempt to preach any kind of message, contenting itself with an investigation of our deepest fears. Some might argue that it is undeserving of an Oscar as it presents no significant political or moral message; this reviewer would argue that that is precisely why it should get one."

","I saw ""Children of men"" yesterday and it was a big disappointment for me. I heard several of my friends say, that it is a great movie and i should definitely see it.<br/><br/>I always liked Clive Owen, and i still think he is a great actor, but in "" Children of men"" he s really bad like all the other actors. They are fake, and you don t believe them.<br/><br/>Then I liked the idea of a ""post-apocaliptic"" future although thats nothing new nowadays, it seems to be quite modern. The story in the movie is very boring i think.( Woman' s really special, so man has to protect woman.) A little easy i think.<br/><br/>Technicly i have to admit that i have never seen some thing like that, there are several sequence shots, they are very good. I also like hand-camera, but in this film it is too much, much too shaky and used to often in my opinion.<br/><br/>All in all i think that it is a bad movie with a big budget, so u see nice sequences, nice pictures, but the actors are not as good as they could have been and the story is a too easy for me.<br/><br/>In case u see the movie anyway, don t get blended by the image or the sequence shots...."

","""Children of Men"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Alfonso Cuarón <br/><br/>Starring: Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Claire-Hope Ashitey, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Pam Ferris, & Peter Mullan <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for strong violence, language, some drug use and brief nudity) <br/><br/>When ""Children of Men"" ended, I left the theater, feeling drained, depressed, and yet oddly content. Because, after nearly two hours of watching death, destruction, and war, we are left with an uplifting finale--an ending that, despite all of the atrocities we have witnessed, has a glimmer of hope. ""Children of Men"" is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen all year, being both completely enthralling and visually arresting. Sporting superb performances from Clive Owen and Claire-Hope Ashitey and the rest of the cast and one of the most intriguing premises presented this year, ""Children of Men"" is a massive achievement in movie-making. It is one of the strongest, most poignant films imaginable. It is an effective film, but, with that said, I must admit that its effect is very disturbing. In my theater, two people walked out and I suspect that it was because they could not handle the shocking material presented here. I, however, could not have left for I could never have pulled my eyes off of the screen. Moving and ultimately chilling, ""Children of Men"" is a must-see film.<br/><br/>In 2027, the world is in a very chaotic state. No more children are being born and the world's youngest person has just died at the age of eighteen. Theo (Owen) just wants to live out his life without much troubleuntil his ex-wife, Julian (Moore), comes and asks for his help. She introduces him to Kee (Ashitey), a young woman who is miraculously pregnant. Julian, a known rebel and target for the police, tells Theo that he must take Kee to a sanctuary at the sea where a group of scientists can hopefully use Kee's birth as a way to save the future of mankind. But, as Theo makes his way across the war-torn country into the very bowels of a hellish world, he will discover that, even in the darkest days of what could be the end of the world, there are still people who careand that what we once all took for granted is now our only hope.<br/><br/>Academy Award nominee, Clive Owen seems to be making movie after movieafter movieafter movie. I'm a big fan of most of his movies, from ""Closer"" to ""Inside Man"", and I feel that ""Children of Men"" is his best film to date. He gives a raw, unfiltered performance. I think that many actors seem to calculate their actions and how they say dialog prior to making the movie, but that does not appear to be Owen's technique here. His performance is steeped in realism. Julianne Moore got second billing despite having very limited screen time. I thought that her casting was purely brilliant. Moore is a big-name actress and it's great to see an actress of her caliber taking a limited role in a film. It gives the film an element of surprise that is reminiscent of what Alfred Hitchcock did in ""Psycho"" (1960). I love Michael Caine and he gives a great performance here. The real gem for me, however, is Claire-Hope Ashitey. The marketing executives of ""Children of Men"" practically ignored her when cutting trailers, making posters, and creating TV spots and yet she proves to be an amazing, beautiful actress who gives a perfectly credible and sympathetic performance. It worked so well. She completely blew me away.<br/><br/>As I have said, people left my theater before finishing the movie. ""Children of Men"" is not for everyone. Sensitive viewers will probably want to stay away and, even if all of the language and the brief glimpse of nudity were removed, it certainly isn't for young audiences. It is a shocking and depressing movie that rockets through violence, terror, and war to finally deliver a slightly hopeful ending. I am not often left completely speechless by a movie, but, when ""Children of Men"" ended, I really didn't feel like talking. I needed time to digest what I had seen and to truly comprehend everything. ""Children of Men"" is a must-see for mature viewers who can handle it. It is truly an amazing, brilliant movie that affects you emotionally. It's unlike anything I have ever seen beforeand, in a world where most movies are clichéd rip-offs or remakes, that comment speaks volumes about a movie.<br/><br/>Final Thought: A thought-provoking and emotionally-resonant film, ""Children of Men"" delivers a haunting, yet amazing story.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)"
"alafolle","10","6","11","23 February 2007"," Love it or hate it, just don't miss it.
","Children of Men is the sort of film that elicits strong opinions, both positive and negative. Cuaron hurls his audience into an alternate world with minimal exposition and expects us to figure out what's happening on our own. The science-fictional plot device is absurd and no effort is made to provide a scientific explanation. The narrative is propelled by unlikely developments and the occasional deus ex machina. The dystopian future of 2027 bears an unfortunate resemblance to the worst neighborhoods of our own era, and those hoping for stylish futuristic sets (a la Blade Runner) will be disappointed.<br/><br/>But those who are drawn into Cuaron's world will be mesmerized. There is a vitality and immediacy to the cinematography and directing that has been all too rare in recent years. In the final 30 minutes of the film, viewers are dragged into the hell of a third world refugee camp and forced to experience the chaos and confusion of being innocent bystanders on a battlefield, with no guide book or interpreter. The emotional reaction is powerful and genuine, not coaxed out of us with fluttering flags and orchestral accompaniment. Despite being marketed as science fiction, the power of the movie comes from its extreme realism.<br/><br/>This is a film that takes itself seriously, but to me it was not the least bit stuffy or ""pretentious."" The action is intense and often fast-paced, and the characters do not deliver grandiose monologues. The depth of this film lies in its truths that are unspoken, and in its attention to detail. It can be seen in the way the characters grieve for a celebrity death rather than the routine tragedy of a street bombing. It can be glimpsed through a bus window in a refugee camp. It is ultimately driven home in an allusion to the World War 1 Christmas cease-fire, one of the most bizarre, yet illuminating moments in human history. This is not a ""message movie,"" but there is more than one message here if you choose to look for it.<br/><br/>There are many valid criticisms that can be made of Children of Men, but I strongly reject the claim that this is a work of political propaganda. The political message is powerful precisely because it is NOT propaganda. This film offers us no ideological heroes or easy answers. It simply takes the extremes of poverty, war, and hopelessness in our own world, and eliminates the distance between us and them. Cuaron isn't giving us a solution, but he's forcing us to confront the issues.<br/><br/>If you ask me, this is the most powerful and gripping movie I have seen in years. Your mileage may vary."

"luke-346","10","6","11","16 January 2007"," A classic dystopian text!
","I would have to argue that Children of Men is great, if you like good old fashioned dystopian narratives. Children of Men is a typical dystopian film in that it is an exercise in a politically charged form of hybrid textuality. The vast majority of dystopian texts, including Children of Men, often offer detailed and pessimistic presentations of the very worst of social alternatives. The social alternative in Children of Men is the future  a future in which it is no longer possible to have children, reproduce or start a family. In enabling us to experience this alternative, Children of Men examines how certain contemporary issues and planetary governments could facilitate a social order that is relentlessly harsh, destructive, and miserable. A crucial factor of this vision is the films ability to register the impact of an unexamined social system on the everyday lives of everyday people which is, of course, set against the English backdrop of 2027. However, although this film creates a dystopian society of unseen quantities it interestingly depicts speculative forms of history that purport to describe a set of future developments traceable to present conditions. Examples of this lie in the treatment of the prisoners (Abu Ghraib), crooked authority figures and the manner in which illegal immigrants are treated as a whole is also a current issue in today's society. Yet here it is taken further, as so often the future can, to a nightmare world in which all traces of human rights are disregarded. Children of Men manages to execute this vision superbly as it allows us to feel that pain, the woe and dismay of the characters as they embark upon a journey of hope.<br/><br/>Children of Men is ultimately about a journey, a journey of hope a hope of trying to escape a dystopian nightmare with the reward at the end of this journey being a utopian dream. To aid the telling of this story Cuaron utilises some fantastic camera techniques - the pick of the bunch being the scene inside the car. I must admit I am an extreme fan of long takes and Children of Men is by far the best I've witnessed in recent times. The use of such long takes in Children of Men help to facilitate a sense of real time (almost documentary in comparison) which in turn gives an implication of reality. It also aids in increasing the characters appeal whether it be negative or positive as we continuously become witness to many uninterrupted sequences of events. In employing such long takes Children of Men also manages to bring about notions of rolling news coverage that is reminiscent of footage that could only ever be acquired in the Reuters library. It is not just the camera-work that portrays this; the explosions are also brilliant and hark back to the stunts and pyrotechnics used in Saving Private Ryan. The sound is also fantastic, a great example of this being the early morning farmyard scene - a scene in the film in which the characters must try to remain silent. I would thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good film-making, pictures from this genre and fine story-telling as they will not be disappointed."
"sister_vigilante","10","6","11","12 January 2007"," Without out a doubt the best movie of 2006!
","When I went to see this film I had an idea of what it would be like, a typical action film, and I have to confess that I was totally wrong about ""Children of Men"". My expectations were destroyed as it broke all the archetypal stereotypes that are present in an action film. The action in the film (which there are many scenes) has some point to it and it does literally have you on the edge of your seat. However what I found far more mesmerising was the emotional journey that the characters go on, none more so that Clive Owen. He was the reluctant hero that I found most appealing. I saw this film with every intent of taking my younger brother with me even though he is not 15 (which is the certificate the film was given in the UK) as we are pretty lax at what he sees. However having seen this film, I am glad we didn't because it had a brutality of it that I had never quite seen before. I suppose that it affected me so much, because I had been to many of the places shown in the film; it looked more like the Middle East than England. For two hours this film hypnotises you. It is one of the rare films that afterwards you kind of wish you never saw it, just because you can watch it again for the first time with no idea of what will happen. I recommend everyone to see this film as you will not be disappointed."
"mostvaluableplayer23","10","6","11","11 January 2007"," Goodbye Ruby Tuesday, Hello Hope of Tomorrow
","This cinematic version of P.D. James' bleak yet beautiful tale of an infertile future stands alone in its greatness. From the beginning scene in the coffee shop where it is announced the youngest child on earth had died at the age of 18, you are set in a world of no hope. The first part of the movies concept being, what is there to live for when there is no one living tomorrow? The second concept being, die trying so those tomorrow have at least a chance to try. Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) is the central character who has chosen to risk life and limb to bring Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to The Human Project. The Human Project headquarters if you will is a boat adrift at sea, that is a symbol of a new start for civilization. This movie has so much symbolism going on its mind-blowing. From Jasper (Michael Caine) to Clive Owens,'s shoes it makes you watch and examine what the meaning of the film is truly about. The meaning of the film mostly being the concept of winning the fight's over your trial and tribulations. Human survival, government oppression, racism, infertility; the idea that humans can and will outlast any problem that comes there way. I think the strongest point of this though is used through a song, ""Ruby Tuesday."" So many lines referencing the current state of things in London and throughout the world. The clearest being ""Yesterday doesn't matter if it's gone."" In other words goodbye Ruby Tuesday, hello hope of tomorrow and save the children of men."

","I wouldn't say this is the best movie I've ever seen, but it's close--I'd rate it 10 except for a few nit-picky plot points--and it is without a doubt the most intense. (Schindler's List is the only one I can recall that's even in the same league for intensity.) The director did a brilliant job of fusing action and meaning, so that the film was mesmerizingly exciting but also very rich and moving. Apocalyptic scenarios are a dime a dozen in films, but this one really worked for me, I think, because of the way it very graphically showed the toxic effects of hopelessness... something that is extremely relevant these days. It was incredibly poignant and utterly convincing at the end of the film to see the awesome power of returning hope, at the sight of something as simple as a baby. Brilliant."

The movie is very well directed, because the graphics and the imagery is very disturbing yet so real like, that it even made most of the audience that I was in cry. The acting is also excellent by most of the actors, especially the performance by Micheal Caine. As for the story itself, it is an interesting concept and very good. The story sets place in England, in the year of 2027. A man named Theodore lives in a world that is in total chaos because women can no longer get pregnant. He soon discovers that a woman is pregnant, but the organization that is keeping her safe is actually wanting the baby for different purposes. Theodore goes on nightmarish adventure in a desperate attempt to get her to an organization called""The human project"". The reason why I gave it eight stars though is because there was some parts of the story that was not explained, such as the part where you see soldiers treating the illegal immigrants like they are in the holocaust. Other than that, it is a movie that is worth seeing."
"LadyLiberty","5","6","11","7 January 2007"," Children of Men a disappointing movie about a disappointing future
","Children of Men takes place in London, England in the near future. Civilization is falling thanks primarily to the fact that female infertility rates stand at 100%. The knowledge that humanity is doomed to extinction has resulted in extreme violence up to and including acts of war. Although Britain has avoided the worst, it's still a bleak place where Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) makes his home.<br/><br/>Theo works for the government's Ministry of Energy, and he drinks. He drinks a lot. But one morning as he makes his way to work on an armored train through slums and unrest, he narrowly misses being killed in the terrorist bombing of a coffee shop.<br/><br/>He's so shaken up that even booze offers no respite. He takes the day off work to visit his good friend, Jasper Palmer (Michael Caine). Not long after Theo's return to the city, he's roughly grabbed off the street by kidnappers who toss him into a van, put a hood over his head, and take him to parts unknown.<br/><br/>When the hood is finally removed, Theo finds himself face to face with alleged terror leader, Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore) who also happens to be Theo's former paramour. Julian, recalling Theo's connections with a government official, asks him to help secure transport papers for a girl who must reach the seashore at all costs. Theo is disinclined to help, but the offer to pay him and pay him well seals the deal.<br/><br/>Theo has no idea how important the girl and her delivery to people waiting at the shore is until she discovers that she's pregnant. The young Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) represents hope for humanity for Theo; but she also represents almost unfettered political power to others.<br/><br/>Clive Owen fills the rumpled trench coat of Theodore Faron almost perfectly. In one dramatic scene, the pained way in which he held his body alone spoke volumes. Julianne Moore strikes me as too mild-mannered and frankly pretty to be the ruthless activist that she portrays, but she does an adequate job. Better is Pam Ferris (as Kee's mid-wife companion), Chiwetel Ejiofor (as Luke, a member of Julian's cell), and Claire-Hope Ashitey herself.<br/><br/>The special effects are very good, but even better are the sets. So much is presented as matter-of-fact that it seems perfectly believable to see bits and pieces of futuristic technology lying amidst the dinner dishes or outside a coffee shop. And the mixture of low tech with high tech conveys the setting brilliantly. The dark and dangerous vision of the future is flawlessly filmed, and brilliantly edited. Director Alfonso Cuarón has a reputation for dark stories, and Children of Men is his masterpiece.<br/><br/>Children of Men is based on the book of the same name by P.D. James. I've not read the book so I can't say how good or faithful the film adaptation may be. But there are some apparent remnants of the novel in the movie that appear jarring or confusing to those of us not in the know.<br/><br/>There are those critics who have called Children of Men an unrelenting chase scene. I found myself disagreeing with that assessment rather wholeheartedly when, for long stretches of time, little would be happening. I thought perhaps I was expecting too much, but one of my two companions said immediately upon the movie's end, ""Well, that was slow wasn't it?"" (For the record, their considered assessment in the end was, ""It was okay..."") <br/><br/>Children of Men is an extraordinarily well-crafted film in a visual sense. But what should have been a compelling story is rendered lackluster by some confusing elements, too many breaks in the suspense for the suspense ever to build, and characters who seem utterly despondent (granted, with good reason) rather than determined to do something  anything!  while they still lived to do anything at all. My movie experience wasn't a waste of time, but neither was it an afternoon I'd consider well spent. Too bad.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: One of the more striking topics touched on by Children of Men was Britain's handling of illegal immigrants. Signs are everywhere noting that hiding or aiding illegal immigrants is a crime. Sturdy wire cages abound at train stations and outside internment camps where pathetic immigrants of all ages are locked prior to dispersion. What order remained in that part of the world was apparently to be found in Britain, and the British government determined to hold onto that order whatever the cost rather than to descend into the primitive violence and utter collapse of so many other places.<br/><br/>It was obvious in the film that the point was that we were supposed to have sympathy for these illegals who were being rounded up and pushed away by government goons. One look inside an internment camp is enough to convince anybody that no one should be treated in such an uncivilized fashion! And yet I personally saw the other side of the point made just as strongly: If there's no border control, or insufficient border control, any hope of sovereignty or security will be overrun by those who will destroy those things merely by seeking it en masse.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Children of Men is rated R for ""strong violence, language, some drug use, and brief nudity."" Additionally, the storyline itself is too dark and complex for youngsters to grasp or enjoy. I'd say that Children of Men is fine for those relatively mature kids of about 14 or 15 and up. I can't recommend the film wholesale, though. Instead, if you're interested in seeing some truly wonderful film making, or if you've read the book and want to see some startling scenes on screen, Children of Men won't disappoint. The rest of you, though, may find yourself wondering just what it is that some critics are seeing that the rest of us so patently obviously are not."
"EUyeshima","9","6","11","5 January 2007"," Precarious Balance Between Nihilism and Hope Captured with Bravado by Cuarón
","Director Alfonso Cuarón lends both scarifying grit and unexpected heart to this propulsive, rewarding 2006 screen adaptation of P.D. James' 1992 dystopian sci-fi novel about a hopeless future with no children. There have been many apocalyptic films that deal with Armageddon in many different forms, yet this one reverberates from a most plangent storyline of global collapse as Cuarón thoughtfully brings it down to a human-size scale. Set in England only twenty years hence, the film shows a relentlessly bleak landscape not too far imagined from the present. Cuarón manages to tether us to the fantastical story by making 2027 London look realistically desultory and shell-shocked with its faded double-deckers and Bangkok-style tuk-tuks. In turn, the Bexhill refugee camp later in the film has a startling resemblance to the Abu Ghraib prison and the surrounding streets a dead ringer for the shots of violent warfare we are used to seeing in Iraq on CNN.<br/><br/>The plot centers on Theo Faron, a former political activist who has been numbed into apathy by the increasingly nihilistic state of the planet. Because its isolated island geography has ensured the success of an emerging fascist government, Great Britain has become the only nation to survive the worldwide nuclear terrorism. Foreigners are automatically labeled illegal immigrants and placed in brutalizing internment camps, and at 18, the youngest person on the planet has just been stabbed to death. The news is devastating to the masses because infertility has plagued the planet for nearly two decades with no hope for the human race to survive. Kidnapped by the Fishes, a revolutionary group supporting the foreigners' human rights, Theo finds out the dastardly act was masterminded by his ex-wife Julian, who heads the group. Her motivation becomes clear as they are holding a West African girl named Kee, who happens to be eight months pregnant. The rest of the film focuses on the clandestine effort to transport Kee to the Human Project, an offshore organization dedicated to reversing the global infertility.<br/><br/>There are so many strong visual cues and unexpected plot turns that it is impossible to be bored by the story penned by no less than five screenwriters including Cuarón. A powerful example is the meticulous portrayal of Theo's cousin Nigel, the one official who can secure travel documents for Kee's passage, as the curator of the world's surviving masterworks (including Michelangelo's damaged David and Picasso's Guernica) in the reconverted Tate Modern. Another is the superb cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, richly textured in establishing the bombed-out, authoritarian universe and documentary-like once the more violent aspects take over the movie. Particularly impressive is the extended scene where the Fishes attempt to escape an aggressive ambush in a speeding car, as well as the concluding battle scenes which culminate into an unexpected religious allegory.<br/><br/>After his scene-stealing turns in ""Closer"" and ""Inside Man"", Clive Owen really owns this movie from start to finish with a richly complex portrait of a man who discovers his sense of purpose against seemingly insurmountable odds. In fact, his committed performance holds together some of the more far-fetched plot developments like Theo's too-easy escape from the safe house. Claire-Hope Ashitey provides a striking presence as the vulnerable but amazingly resilient Kee. Also making vivid impressions are the reliable Julianne Moore as Julian, Chiwetel Ejiofor as fellow revolutionary Luke, Danny Huston as Nigel, Pam Ferris as Kee's self-appointed guardian Miriam (who provides an essential back story behind the infertility), Peter Mullan as the corrupt policeman Syd, and an especially colorful Michael Caine as Theo's perpetually quixotic friend Jasper. This is nicely audacious film-making, a creative masterstroke that marks Cuarón as an important creative force in cinema."

In fact the acting was very good, however I don't think the actors were given much to work with. I feel that most of the movie was about creating a mood and not relaying story line or information about why we should care about what is going on with the characters.

This film was nowhere near as good as the dramas shown on television and less exciting and thought out than a typical Spooks episode. The storyline of the film lacked credibility and was disjointed often leaving me with a sense of frustration. The lead up to the essence of the film - the extinction of mankind through infertility - was not dealt with at all. There were scenes in the film which were ridiculous ... 30 seconds shot of a pair of sandals being put on etc etc. A number of scenes weren't credible at all and we generally felt little connection with the characters.

","I read Children of Men and was so excited to see that they were making a movie out of it. But by the time I walked out of the theater, I was disappointed and angry. They had mangled the entire story until it was a pointless mishmash with zero character development.<br/><br/>Whoever (a bunch of studio jerks sitting around a conference table perhaps?) did the screenplay, paid so little attention to the subtlety and details of the book, that the finished product is a pale imitation of the great movie this could have been.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is the totally random changing of major elements of the book, which accomplished nothing and watered down the story. Example: Let's change the main character's professor friend (played by Michael Caine in the movie), from a crusty, old-fashioned old dude living in an austere English townhouse, to an out-there ex-hippie guy living in a cabin in the middle of the woods. Why?? Adds nothing, no meaning to it.<br/><br/>Example: Let's kill off a main character (Julian, played by Julianne Moore in the movie) early on and eliminate an entire main thread of the story as laid out in the book (which is the slowly growing bond between Theo and Julian,and thus his increasing need to protect both her and the baby). Instead, let's create a entirely new character, change her race from the original character, and make her the pregnant one instead of Julian. Why?? Adds nothing, no meaning to it, and removes meaning from the very heart of the story.<br/><br/>Example: Let's remove what could have been a haunting and shocking scene, the Quietus (in the book, a forced suicide march of the elderly, orchestrated and monitored by evil government forces-it is seeing one of these in action which initially prompts Theo to join the band of rebels), and replace it with an ill-explained box that says ""Quietus"" and the idea that the elderly take the drugs inside and kill themselves. Why?? Adds nothing, no meaning to it, removes what could have been a very dramatic scene in the movie, and removes the impetus for Theo to join this ragtag group of rebels in the first place.<br/><br/>Example: Let's not provide any details that illustrate the terrible effect that infertility has had on the people of this future world, and just run through the movie like it's a video game. In the book, we learn how families had been so desperate to conceive, they were having christenings for kittens and pushing around baby carriages with teddy bears in them. It's the small, odd details that bring a story to life. This movie eliminated nearly all of them, and sucked the life out of the story.<br/><br/>Example: Let's get rid of the whole storyline that the evil ruler of England, is a childhood friend of Theo, and thus remove the whole reason why the band of rebels come to Theo in the first place (so he can go to his childhood friend, the ""Warden of England"", and try to convince him to make reforms). In the movie, it Julian is some old flame who randomly asks Theo for help. Why this change?? Adds nothing, no meaning to it, and removes a major plot element which helps make the story make SENSE.<br/><br/>I'm all for changing some things from the book, to make a movie, if it results in a better movie. But this is a case where the movie turned out to be garbage precisely because they changed everything. For no reason. No meaning to it."

Number one I guess its a British movie thing, yes I know we ignorant Americans, but gee all of the Brit speak without explanation kind of got on my nerves. Along with the endless ethnic chatter amounting to nothing. And then there is Clive mumbling just like he did in Closer. He was cool in Sin City because he spoke clearly for the first time in his career.

","I usually enjoy post-war science fiction films of this genre. I also loved the concept of no human babies being born and the resulting strain on society. Finally, I think Clive Owen is great and he delivers a solid performance in this film. But in the end I think the film was only slightly above average. The biggest problem for me was the terrorists. I did not understand their cause or their tactics. It simply made no sense to me. Immigration & state powers are contemporary issues of which the viewer has an understanding, but I don't see the jump from our contemporary immigration protests to acts of murder & terrorism. I just couldn't get behind that notion. I also didn't see the benefit of the terrorists killing their own leader over a disagreement. Usually in such cases the terrorist group will simply splinter - just look at our contemporary terrorists groups for such examples. It also wasn't clear to me what Clive Owen's character supported as an activist in his past nor were his ex-wife's goals clear to me. Basically I think the film would have been great if it were a bit longer and the story more fleshed out. Perhaps there was simply too much editing here. This film had a makings of a great story, a great cast, it was well shot but it simply missed the mark."

Just like you'd expect in a film like this everyone's got their own hidden agenda, people aren't who they appear to be and no one's to be trusted. Lots of darkness and evil. Too bad they didn't make this into a Mad Max film, it would have been more entertaining. Instead it was mediocre and tedious. I was glad when it ended.<br/><br/>Anyone else agree?"

","For the generation that grew up on video games - this is perfect. get the protagonist ( that means the hero) from one threatening situation to another until you reach the end zone. Beside the fun of the chase, there is nothing else to this film. It's little more than chase, run, blast, boom, escape, arrive. But most of you love it, I'm sure. In its favor there is the nimble camera work. Note how he tells you he has not changed cameras by keeping blood splotches on the lens. Of course, there is no reason that we should be aware of a camera - it hasn't been part of the film up to then. But - in this world, it's considered ""innovation"" . Does anyone out there remember ""Rope"" - probably not. We could also consider the Jungian/Biblical imagery - announcing the baby in a stable, going ""down"" to the canal, the cave imagery on the walls in the final scenes, the notion of the ""ark"" floating on water at the end - etc., etc. But who knows or cares about that? You want bif, bam, boom? You got it. You want writing and plot - stay home and read.<br/><br/>By the way - where did all those isolated immigrants get the automatic weapons for the revolt?"

","What a waste of a terrific opportunity. Infertility provides grounds for a brilliant apocalyptic vision but the logic of this film is so wrong it destroys any credibility the concept gave it. Here are my problems...<br/><br/>1. Why is the Human Project a mysterious entity? Given the resources spent on infectious diseases today, every government, every biotech and pharmaceutical company would be doing NOTHING ELSE but trying to solve this problem. What is wrong with these people?<br/><br/>2. Why do they believe that because KEY is an immigrant, the fact that she may hold the answer to saving humanity would be ignored? Why doesn't Theodore (Clive Owen) just take KEY to his rich and powerful cousin that gave him the transit papers? It's retarded.<br/><br/>3. If they need to get to this buoy to find The Human Project why don't they just get a boat and go there? Why do they need to go through the detention centre? Sure it's a little closer but it's also a war zone. Why not get a decent boat, row a little further and avoid being shot? People this stupid deserve to die out.<br/><br/>4. Films need to be thematically tight. The themes of immigration/humanity just don't fit with the theme of infertility. It's trying to be two films in one and this never works.<br/><br/>So really, with so many writers credited with the screenplay you'd think someone would have picked up on some basic elements of logic - but then maybe that's the problem."

"gradyharp","10","8","17","29 March 2007"," One of the Most Important Films in Recent Years
","CHILDREN OF MEN is a masterpiece of cinematic artistry. Director Alfonso Cuarón, using a screenplay he co-wrote with Timothy J. Sexton, has done what few artists have been able to achieve before - create an apocalyptic experience that is almost devoid of extraneous material meant to terrify the audience and focused the worst of unthinkable events into a personal story about a few people. Oh, the global destruction and masses of dead humanity are not kept from our eyes, but instead Cuarón uses these horrid images as a background for a story about the changes than can occur in each of us when our souls and lives are challenged by extinction.<br/><br/>The story is set in 2027 and the only country that has survived some unnamed disaster is England (importantly, the only country without a constitution, maintaining its governance on history). The landscape is bleak, twisted, filthy and holds scattered cages of fugitives (immigrants from the countries no longer in existence): it is difficult to decide which is better, being dead or living in this heinous mess of a wasted world. Society is on the brink of extinction as the people are infertile and the youngest living person has just died. We meet Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a drunken bored disillusioned detritus of a man whose early years were alive with political activism. He loathes his meaningless job and he is bitter and utterly disillusioned and emotionally numb. A group called 'Angels' is lead by Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore), Theo's former significant other with whom he had a child that died of influenza, and Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and their work is the protection of immigrants as well as transporting a young black girl Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who happens to be pregnant(!) to a sea spot where Human Project will aid her in propagating a new society. Julian has Theo captured (he is the only man she can truly trust) to handle the safe transportation of Kee to the Human Project.<br/><br/>Theo at first refuses to absorb this new direction but incidents occur which change his mind: he receives sound advice and encouragement from an old hippie friend Jasper (Michael Caine) and the trek begins. The bond between Kee and Theo is an increasingly strong one and as they follow directions that are in code they gradually discover the incentives of various people to follow the eventual birth of the first child to be born in eighteen years. The trip is harrowing, suspenseful, filled with psychological and philosophical implications, and the ending of this tale occurs in the foggy mists of the sea aboard a tiny boat - a place that has no roots.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is mesmerizing in this tough role and his support from Moore, Caine, Ejiofor, Ashitey, as well as smaller roles played by such fine actors as Charlie Hunnam, Pam Ferris, Danny Huston, Peter Mullan, Oana Pellea and Jacek Koman to mention only a few is on the highest level. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is miraculous, capturing a strange world that seems very real yet not absurdly over the edge. Classical composer John Tavener (with help from Mahler, Penderecki, and others) finds just the right balance between old folk songs, contemporary requiem moments and excerpts from popular music of the past to mold a fascinating musical score: it works! Some may avoid this film because of the apparent disturbing content, but for this viewer this film speaks so cogently to the matters we should all heed to help reverse some of the destruction we have done to our world that it would be hard to imagine this film not changing people's views on immigration as an example of how confused is our sense of humanity, and that is only one issue before us. CHILDREN OF MEN is an instant classic, whether we like it or not. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp"

Some of the pseudo-intellectuals posting seem to think that plot gets in the way of good movie making and that if you are left to supply what various elements of a virtually plot less exercise out of your own imagination, why this is the ultimate in movie making.I strongly disagree. A far better acted movie of a dystopian future exists. It is called BLADERUNNER. Bladerunner discusses the nature of existence, consciousness,the very idea of what it means to be human, and much more. Furthermore, it is also very violent, but not gratuitously so. Ample time is given the viewer to exercise his/her imagination. Perhaps this is why there are at least 8 different versions available.Feel free to contrast Rutger Hauer's performance on the roof of the Tyrrel building to any scene in this worthless piece of trash.I rest my case.

For me, it was one of those films leaving me feeling I wasted my time (and money). My wife and I sat through it purely because we'd paid to go and see it. Otherwise, had I been watching it for free on TV, I'd have probably switched channels long before the end.

"AlanJ2","3","12","29","7 October 2006"," Tiresomely derivative (if expensive) this post-apocalypse movie has few likable characters and is filled with holes
","Although its fighting scenes are elegantly visual in places, and there is some pacey action, the content of this film is so tiresomely familiar and cliché-ridden it is remarkable some people have been writing so favourably. Once again we are in a post-apocalyptic western country (England) in which a right wing semi-fascist government is rounding up immigrants and subversives. Once again we meet the Resistance and yes the plot harks back nostalgically to the idyllic freedom of the 60s, even its patron saint being an old hippie (played with usual gusto by Michael Caine). Once again the hero and heroine fight to escape to a Better Place, here some nebulous scientific project across the ocean. At least 'V For Vendetta had flashes of originality and did not, as this does, come over (unintentionally) as a right wing rant, especially in the way foreigners are portrayed as half-crazed. There is something smug and self-congratulatory in the way such ancient themes are recycled as if the makers have been the first to discover them. In fact the merest zombie movie boasts more engaging characters and also seems more accurate-- and less derivative-- about what a breakdown in society might actually look like. Worse yet, even on an action level the plot is riddled with terrible holes. A car chase where the hero's car cannot be bump-started on a steep hill but magically comes to life on a mud flat just in time to save the occupants! The hero and heroine's semi-magical release from a building surrounded by ferocious troops by holding the world's only surviving baby aloft yet while the baby is valued enough to paralyze all action, the troops subsequently ignore it and get back to fighting, leaving the hero and heroine to go free. It's this kind of sloppyness in follow-though that makes the whole film risible specially since such sequences are mounted with gushing sentimentality."

"warren-1976","6","6","12","25 January 2007"," A Message In Search Of A Meaning
","Children of Men is a strange film to judge. The story is not original (Simply think The Handmaid's Tale from 1990, taken to an extreme), then again, few stories are. What it gives us is an interesting and updated spin on an old idea. Perhaps 'interesting' is the key word, though.<br/><br/>So what works in Children of Men? Its vision of the future is extremely realistic, and really does feel round the corner. Carrying on current trends, certain items are plausibly advanced, while others haven't changed at all. The society it portrays is again, simply an extreme extrapolation of where things are headed now.<br/><br/>The 'action' scenes are excellently portrayed, keeping you on the edge of your seat at every window smash, ricocheting bullet, and explosion.<br/><br/>The cinematography carries on the recent trend of 'documentary' style film-making all the way. This is perhaps its greatest advantage, and its downfall. Instead of watching a story, we feel as though we are watching a documentary. It often gets bogged down in these scenes, that while harrowing and intense in a way we've become used to with films such as Saving Private Ryan, or Black Hawk Down, do not progress the plot, or characters. Children of Men is most interesting when it takes a pause. The moments with Michael Caine's character. The conversation between Moore and Owen as they meet up again, and we gain a few glimpses of their underlying character. The discussion at the farm, with the dilemma of how to proceed.<br/><br/>Saying that, these scenes are few and far between, and afterward, you realise that the extremely effective 'action' set pieces are almost a mask to the somewhat limited script and story.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a message in search of a meaning. On the surface, it seems to be saying a lot. Scratch beneath, and you realise that it doesn't really know what it wants to say. The conclusion is disappointingly stereotypical. We expect the blunt and unresolved end that comes with this type of film, as if to say in capital letters 'Look, it's all very serious, depressing and meaningful stuff, and we're leaving you to interpret it the way you want'. The shame is, with Children of Men, that 'message' just leaves the film drifting like the characters in their row-boat.<br/><br/>To a certain extent we are still treated to that oh-so-popular message of today: ""Authority figures=Evil, Weed smoking anarchist hippies=Good"", but to its credit, Children of Men at least doesn't glamorise the 'resistance'. They turn out to be as villainous, if not more so, than the government they oppose. It doesn't take sides the way you expect, even though it does beat us over the head occasionally with a few politically correct messages. At least the two leads Theo and Kee are essentially average people caught in the middle.<br/><br/>I wanted to like Children of Men, but it doesn't quite work. Far more could have been made about the repercussions of Kee and her child in this dystopian, barren world. Children of Men is a good example that sometimes when you try not to say anything specific, you end up saying nothing at all. It is a brave attempt, and well worth seeing. It makes a change to see some thought-provoking and intelligent science fiction, but we've seen it all before and explored in far more depth."

","As a sci-fi film it's seminal to the genre, as a reflection on post 9/11 and political propaganda it couldn't be anymore relevant. Alfonso Cuaron's vision of the future is a bleak and intimidating one. Rarely have I seen a film represent an issue in the same context as children of men has, it's a bold and intelligent narrative that depicts it's dystopia with hatred, betrayal and hope. Clive Owen's Theo is at first sight a rather unlikeable character whose main priority seems to be bureaucratic conformity, however as his journey unfolds he abolishes his pragmatic facade and inevitably renders a moxie of vulnerability and compassion. The rest of the cast are wonderful from Michael Caine's eccentric and idealist hippie to Claire Hope Ashitey's fear induced Kee. Children of men erects it's subject matter in a graphic tone, one that may be difficult for the mainstream viewer to accept let alone comprehend. The viewers political and social preference notwithstanding you would either have to be naive or sheerly ignorant to be confused by the moral argument and message that lies within this contemporary masterpiece."
"paulmartin-2","7","6","12","29 October 2006"," Innovative, but falls short of excellence
","The social, economic and political upheaval depicted in The Children of Men is quite conceivable. We are not given any explanation why the world has been transformed, though we get hints of nuclear devastation and turmoil in other parts of the world from newspaper headlines posted on walls and in the street. Also not divulged is why no children have been born for over 18 years.<br/><br/>The sparse elucidation in the film is not a weakness; it is in fact a potent tool that is used in tandem with other devices to create a powerful effect  that of mayhem, confusion and dislocation. These are all normal side-effects of war, civil or otherwise. People are bundled along, herded like cattle, running in fear of things heard but not necessarily seen. Explanations are not handed out on a platter and this adds to a freshness that is a welcome departure from the mindlessness of most Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>Politically, it's not too hard to foresee such a bleak future, because aspects of it exist right now: Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, refugee camps and detention centres are words that immediately spring to mind. The dehumanising of refugees and the association of them as being on a par with terrorists is something regrettably we have already seen in our lifetime.<br/><br/>The camera work is excellent, with ample use of wide angles and long, sweeping takes that follow the protagonists as if the camera operator  and we  are an embedded journalist in a real-life war situation. At one stage, we even see specks of 'blood' on the camera, adding to the sense of immediacy. The film is quite relentless from start to finish, creating a solid feeling of tension and anxiety. The cinematography is also used to great effect, creating a sense of real bleakness. There is great attention to detail in various scenes depicting urban and industrial wastelands, adding to a tangible sense of chaos and anarchy.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuarón has developed an impressive body of work to his credit with films as diverse as this, Y tu Mama Tambien and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Y tu Mama Tambien remains my favourite of his works, though Children of Men shows a great deal of risk and innovation that deserves recognition. In spite of this, the film had some reasonably significant faults that cannot be overlooked.<br/><br/>In a landscape that is so miserable, where people's lives are so grim, the use of pop music was sometimes inappropriate, mostly in the first half of the film. I really liked the music, but its use detracted from the consistency of the film. It seemed to reveal a slight unwillingness by the director to completely commit to the risks he took in portraying such a bleak futuristic view.<br/><br/>There were a number of inconsistencies. The most noticeable was that it was night time when the car was being pushed downhill to escape the farmhouse. By the time the car reached the bottom of the hill (maybe a minute later), it was light. And why push-start the car at the bottom of the hill? It made no sense, when it could have been started while coasting down the hill.<br/><br/>Another distraction was the contrived use of hand-held camera with what I call 'designer shake' which I first noticed some years ago in TV's NYPD Blue. Hand-held cameras can be used to good effect by creating a sense of immediacy, that you're there amongst the action. Generally it was used effectively in this film, but there was no need for its accentuation. This was particularly so in the first half of the film during the relatively quiet scenes, and for me it made it an effort to connect with the film.<br/><br/>For some time I have been observing a fad for UK films to cast one American actor or vice versa. This appears to be a device used primarily for marketing purposes. Sometimes its use is so contrived that it detracts from a film, such as Gwyneth Paltrow in Sliding Doors. In other films it has worked well, such as Helena Bonham Carter in Fight Club. While I am a fan of American actor Julianne Moore, her appearance in this film seems to be neither a positive nor a negative in this respect.<br/><br/>Michael Caine's character looked good on the screen, but seemed somewhat cartoonish, as if he had come from V For Vendetta. His part was overplayed, like Geoffrey Rush's role in Candy. Other characters had a similar but lesser effect, but I can't think of them at this point. Another contrivance is the popular use in British cinema of the term 'wanker'. For god's sake, they got this term from Australians, and now it's used much more than we ever have. It gets a bit tedious.<br/><br/>The near-religious symbolism of the child with Joseph- and Mary-like characters was used to powerful emotional effect, but was then wasted with the implausibility that an entire troop of soldiers will let them pass unchecked and get away. The ambiguity of the ending was, however, effective. The arrival of 'Tomorrow' gives hope without a clear outcome, reminiscent of Charlton Heston in The Omega Man (1971). Interestingly, the plot of The Children of Men has a lot in common with this earlier film.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is powerful, engaging, innovative, intelligent, visually stunning and exciting. It conveys an interesting story that includes important political commentary. Its failings are not fatal, but detract from what could otherwise have been a really important work. Aside from anything else, it is definitely worth seeing for its clever and innovative techniques."

The issues of illegal immigration, oppressive government, greedy corporations, pollution and morally bankrupt populations are not gonna go away any time soon, and the self constructed plight of humanity is more than likely to get worse before it ever gets remarkably better. This film does a beyond superb job of predicting and realistically showing a very probable future. The biggest unknown is the possibility of human fertility being so drastically affected by any or all of the above.

"rooprect","7","4","7","26 January 2013"," Careful choreography & camera-work bring this 2-dimensional story to life
","The strength of this film is not in its plot but in its presentation. The story is pretty basic: in a dismal future where humans are infertile and hopeless, an unlikely hero fights to survive & protect one small hope of humanity. The plot is set in the beginning and remains pretty linear, but pay attention to the excellent camera work which sets this film apart from your regular dismal future action flick.<br/><br/>In particular, the director uses long fluid takes. Like up to 5 minutes without a cut (in actuality there are some cuts but they're digitally blended together seamlessly so the effect remains continuous. In the commentary, the director says he did this to give the audience a sense of real time. And yes, it's very effective, as if you're there in the middle of the action watching things unfold second-by-second.<br/><br/>To achieve this, the director had to go through extraordinary efforts. For example, in order to film a car chase with simultaneous dialogue from 5 people inside the car, he had to build a special car with a hole in the roof & camera crew on top so the camera could pan, twist & move through every angle necessary. Meanwhile the action of dozens of extras outside (not to mention fire & explosives) had to be carefully timed & choreographed to fit with the dialogue.<br/><br/>In another memorable scene, again seemingly consisting of one continuous take with no cuts, the action begins in the street under intense gunfire, the camera follows our hero running down several side streets, into a bus, into a building, up a flight of stairs, down the hall, up another flight of stairs and through a bunch of rooms, all the while with scores of extras running around and shooting hundreds of bullets--all in one fluid camera take.<br/><br/>Folks this is no ordinary action flick. It's a complex work of movie-making excellence. If you enjoy the sort of technical stuff I've been babbling about, you'll really enjoy the presentation. I haven't seen such meticulous camera work in an action flick since ""The International"" and ""Run Lola Run"" directed by German genius Tom Tykwer."
"rjmungall-1","3","4","7","14 February 2009"," Gimmicks of men
","This movie is difficult for me because I can't quite figure out how to articulate exactly how this film falls short, but I'm going to give it a try and see what happens. First, I'll say that overall the movie, for what it was, was done OK. I was in the moment the majority of the time, sort of. But distraction doesn't equal real reward. Actually, this is usually my biggest gripe about anything purporting itself to be ""artistic"" or real cinema, that it is simply a distraction: ""I'd like to forget I'm alive for the next two hours so I can get lost in something.. but nothing more please!"" Or maybe it isn't trying to be anything but a distraction, who am I to say? But either way, the foundation of this movie is gimmick. Gimmick gimmick gimmick. You'll see what I mean. I'll start with the more minor points, to make some points, and also to second the opinions of many others..<br/><br/>Blood on the camera: gimmick. What does that add to the movie? Or is it more ""real"", bringing me back to the fact that I'm looking at a film frame made on a Hollywood set? The hand-held thing, especially in the woods, if anything made me feel like I was a wolf waiting to attack our characters. Either way, I don't know what kind of message I am supposed to be getting about a pulsating camera holder, especially in scenes with no one even in the frame.. Gimmick. Then there is the military seeing the first baby born in years, then like a tank of goldfish completely forgetting, going on to fight some more. Not only was that absurd, but it was also almost unclear WHY they happened to be attacking that building with tanks and everything, just at that moment, when the Only Baby On Earth was inside.. And this film also features the most noisy ""smooth"" exodus from a compound of guys standing around with guns 5 feet away. And the car door taking the same guy out, twice? First, Really?? Second, Gimmick.<br/><br/>In addition. There was hardly any character development. Now, granted, everyone is shooting half the time so it isn't like they are going to be sitting around debating Nietzsche or something. But, these characters are stoic, monk-like. They hardly seem invested at all, except when they are about to die or think they are about to die. Otherwise the carnage around them apparently doesn't bother them too much, unless it's way too close. In the building at the end of the movie, Clive continues to nonchalantly walk in front of open windows while the whole British army is knocking people off all around him from outside. And let's not forget how at the very end the air force decides to start air bombing the hell out of a city with their troops scattered throughout. Or how old Clive managed to paddle what appears to be miles with a bullet in his stomach. And, I hardly cared that he died. He was THAT developed. Wait, I forgot that the miracle baby was delivered in perhaps the quickest and most pain free birth in the history of man. Just a few minutes of screaming and POP.<br/><br/>But let me get to the real problem. All that other stuff would just be good humor in the face of an OK movie. At least worth 6 stars, right? No. No! No! Because the whole GD movie was a big gimmick. This movie is the definition of gimmick. Gimmicky characters walking around a gimmicky world with gimmicky TV's and gimmicky military and gimmicky everything. I'll do my best to articulate what I'm complaining about. This whole movie runs on one thing, the last woman on earth that has a baby. But that's it. This is our justification, our only justification, for everything else that happens. It's cheap, plain and simple. A gimmick. This is the only ""thought-provoking"" part of the whole movie. I'd rather they would have just left it out and left the whole thing ambiguous. That would have been a lot more fun for me, just the experience of society falling apart for some reason. But no. The apocalypse will come because of.. infertility? Governments collapse from not having babies? Really? So THAT is what will cause the breakdown in government. Not foreign relations, scarcity of oil, food, water, etc etc. But infertility. The word ""orwellian"" will soon be replaced when we see how insightful this film is in time.. and every other justification is just as gimmicky. <br/><br/>OK OK, I'll stop talking S and get to the point: Just because the film REFERENCES something doesn't mean it CONSIDERS it. This film just name-drops subject matter, a small series of really bad excuses for a long chase scene. This film is like if I came over to your house, spattered a few post-it notes with words like ""homeland security"", or ""just imagine being on a bus and feeling like you are going to a concentration camp"", and you go, twitter, facebook, and myspace the hell out of the internet, about how GD thought-provoking I am and how great I am to have as a friend.<br/><br/>A good movie, in my opinion, is more than distraction. It's about giving me an Experience. Reflecting back towards me. Maybe even giving me an insight or two about life. This didn't have these things. It was a 90 minute chase scene thriller. I don't need everything explained to me to enjoy it, but don't treat me like an idiot by ""explaining"" the movie in a cheap way.. I'd rather they just skipped the pretensions. Enjoy it for a not-so-hot chase scene, but don't go talking about thought-provoking. Clear out the spider webs of your mind, there is a lot more thought-provoking out there, in any medium, than this film."

"amazinggrayling","9","4","7","3 April 2007"," This was a great film: very moving
","This film was so wonderful. Every moment of the film was filled with intricate details and that made it that much better. As to the criticisms of this film being too ""political""...don't knock its good intentions. Besides, I am not sure whether that point is justified because Clive Owen's character was so apolitical, so cynical about politics and the film really pivots around his performance and the strength of the character's ""goodness"" and lack of political affiliation. Furthermore, I thought the film was very anti political-fanaticism.<br/><br/>It had so many nuances. There are films which are just about putting across an idea, but it's not often that we get a film with the right emotional tone. There were moments where this viewer felt so moved because there was, sorry to sound corny, a lot of emotionally-charged truth in the film pertinent to today's world - how we continue to destroy each other so recklessly, even while we recognise how precious life is: the scene where Faron and Kee and baby walk out into the tanks and soldiers and everyone is flabbagastered by the sight of a baby and stops fighting - but only for a matter of minutes; the fact that humanity is coming to an end because no one can conceive but we still put ""fugees"" in cages and treat them just about as badly as we do animals; the fact that we hold certain political convictions that we think will change the world and make the world better but we are willing to compromise basic morality by taking lives in the name of this political idealism.<br/><br/>Michael Caine was so wonderful too. He rarely gets a chance to play these eccentrics and he made most of it. The continuous action shots that lasted over 5 or 10 minutes were so good too. Great cast, great story, genius direction and writing = great, great film. Go out and rent it/buy it now!"
"chriss-31","6","4","7","2 April 2007"," Beware! Overrated!
","Besides some amazing cinematography, and other technical merits, this movie has little to offer. Poor character development, painful exposition. This movie consists of a beginning and a middle, no proper ending anywhere to be found. As it is an adaptation of a novel, it is hard to fault them for staying true to the source material, but this movie has the same problems translating to the screen as The Da Vinci Code. The audience is expected to care about characters who are given less than 5 minutes of screen time before they are thrown into peril. Supporting characters are given annoying catch phrases or quirks in lieu of proper personalities. Look elsewhere for the next big thing in sci-fi. This is clearly out of the Stephen Spielberg school of film-making. If this film wasn't so hyped up I wouldn't feel the need to comment, but there has to be a voice of reason midst all the hysteria."
"speteman","10","4","7","31 March 2007"," Mesmerizing -- an absolute must see, a truly original masterpiece!
","Note: I have intentionally left out any commentary on specifics of the plot or message of the movie, as I would strongly recommend you see this with as little preconceived impressions as possible.<br/><br/>It's hard to put this movie into any one category: an epic drama, an action-packed, fast-paced thriller, a character-driven 'emoticoaster', a documentary on the human and societal condition. It really is all of these wrapped neatly into a crisp, tight story that leaves no inch of film to waste. It is by far one of the most intriguing movies I have watched in some time and kept me thinking for some time after it ended.<br/><br/>The film brings all critical elements together to lose the audience in its reality, making you believe you are almost watching a documentary of a place and society that exists in our world today. The sets served as a believable canvas on which the story was told. In numerous scenes the background of the film was as important as the immediate action, often revealing subtle, reinforcing details that provide more context to the story.<br/><br/>I was equally aware of how unobtrusive the camera work was to the film, always putting the audience right where they needed to be to get the full scope of any scene. I often felt like I was in the movie as a passive participant because it was so engrossingly filmed. Some parts of the film were admittedly graphic, but done so in a way that added materially to the condition of the characters and their plight. I truly appreciated how in touch I felt with everything going on, and credit the camera direction with that.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was great: lifting your spirits and dropping them low; amplifying the emotions of a moment and also cunningly removing itself at times of suspense. This was very well done.<br/><br/>The acting by all involved was superior. Clive Owen gave mightily to Theo, revealing a character who adapted as more information was learned by him throughout the movie. Owen transformed Theo from complete apathy and despair to a hero of sorts fighting for the future of the world. Julianne Moore played a minor role, but was excellent as always. Michael Caine was truly enjoyable to watch as a post-modern hippie. He added much needed levity and humor to give the audience some rest. Claire-Hope Ashity was very convincing as the unexpected vessel of worldwide hope, balancing well her personal motherly tendencies with her obligation to the human race. There were several of other very interesting and fun characters as well, all necessary threads in the overall fabric of the film.<br/><br/>I was not initially aware the film was based on a novel, but I was blown away by the originality of the story. It was entirely believably and thoroughly examined the implications of the twist that the human race has found itself in. Even in the most gloomy of circumstances with the fate of the human race hanging in the balance, the script did well to show that in the end, we are all just humans; with the same faults that we have in the real world -- competing interests, greed, power, a deteriorating moral value system, and so on.<br/><br/>Add to all of that excellent direction and you have a film that is epic in scale and scope; tackles deep moral and ethical issues in society; provides some of the most suspenseful and realistic action/war fighting sequences I have ever seen; gracefully analyzes the emotional spectrum that people in a hopeless world could exhibit; and masterfully follows the story of a small group of people making their way through that world to restore hope. The movie was edited with straight-forward story telling but packed with tremendous amounts of information at every turn. In 1 hour 50 minutes, I felt the movie still could have been much longer, but was amazed how effectively it tackled all of its subject matter so succinctly. The result is a movie that is very raw, gritty, and powerful, opening your mind up to what our world could come to in any number of varying paths. A must see, and definitely near the top of my all time favorite list."

And let me say, this is one of the few films that actually makes you feel as if you are in the movie. The use of the freehand cam added a more realistic touch as well as a unique filming style. No wonder this film won an award for its cinematography. The storyline itself was executed quite well. The battle sequences are very real and at times graphic. The acting was great and the casting likewise. I found myself wanting more by the end of the movie which is usually a sign of a great film. This is definitely worth the price of a ticket.

","Really a surprisingly deep movie. A relatively normal guy gets sucked into the troubling events that surround him. Can he rise to the challenge, or sink back into the rut he wants his life to be? This film has a lot of message, but it isn't terribly preachy. From what I saw, most of the Social Significance was background filler. This film is about some people doing some stuff, living life, and about some other folks that intrude on that. The really great thing is how the ordinary people survive the Great Events. Or fail to do so.<br/><br/>I'm just impressed as hell with Michael Caine and Clive Owen. Both turn in some great performances. Caine's may be his best in years. Moore, Ejiofor, Ashitey, and the others are good too. The acting was wonderful. Real people with flaws, not cardboard cutout action heroes. I think I'd have to attribute any faults at all to writing or direction. The flow just wasn't quite there. But each individual scene was stunning.<br/><br/>By the way, watch for the symbolism. Both classical and pop culture. Again, the background tells a story, if you know what to look for. They even worked in Revelations 13, and made it make sense."

","If you like futuristic apocalyptical themes, you'll like this. If you're like me, and don't find them appealing, then you might like watching the vision of the Director spread out on screen.<br/><br/>We've been here before. It is a genre that always seems to be played out in dark, violent, frightening, hues of man reduced to a barely civilized mass of humanity. Something has gone awry and we are left to wonder what. Immigrants seem to be the main problem. Thousands of them rounded up in cages and shipped to holding camps on the coast.<br/><br/>Clive Owen, our anti hero lower echelon bureaucrat, walks in a London reduced to something from ""1984"" or ""Blade Runner."" The government has turned fascist (1984), and the big new of the day is that the youngest man on Earth has died at 18. The planet is not reproducing! Then his ex- wife shows up with a request for papers to allow a woman immigrant she knows passage out this hell of a U.K. He reluctantly agrees and soon enough finds himself as the sole protector of the only pregnant woman on Earth. Due to her value to any and all factions the only safe place for her is something called the ""project."" The plot line has a million ways to develop but the Director and writers choose to go the old route of a tour through a Breugelian circles of hell. It's all well done but the theme is regurgitated and old. It seemed like Clive was walking through set pieces in a human zoo, a flotsam and jetsam of humanity waiting it's demise. The message is clear: Shape up Earth or this awaits you.<br/><br/>My problem with anything futuristic lies in my need for people to behave realistically within that future, and that just doesn't come across here. Within the plot the people come across as actors cued to act and react. In the end the biggest probability of all lies unanswered.<br/><br/>In reality the real gold mine is the woman, not the child. The child is the future, the woman is the producer of it. As the only fecund female on Earth she'd be doomed to become a fertility cow, a Queen Bee of the future, popping out little future-lings for an incestuous rebirth!"

","Just back from seeing the film 24/sept I can hardly recall a jot of the dialogue, but cannot get the themes, the cinematography, the action or the mood out of my head. This is a gritty film, and even the inclusion of the twee balloon (pigs might fly) outside the window in the Battersea scene and the mawkish Hollywood-esquire sentimentality of the soldiers' pause in fighting later in the film serve the purpose of enabling the director to roughly drag the viewer back to his 'reality'.<br/><br/>Michael Caine's ageing hippie, cheerfully devoted to his invalid partner and ruthlessly executed by the self-styled liberators is in stark contrast to the pragmatically loveless society portrayed. Images recalling Guantanamo, Abu Graib, contemporary conflict between western power and Islamic determination, detention and abuse of migrants, 20th century images of the Warsaw ghetto, the Hungarian Uprising and the fragility of redemption are interwoven as Clive Owen struggles to make sense of what is going on. He becomes an unlikely hero whilst Bexhill becomes Beirut. There are no 'bad guys' or 'good guys', just a bleak expression of how ordinary people respond to extraordinary circumstances according to their own perspectives, but the innocent suffer more than the guilty,- chillingly real.<br/><br/>A thought-provoking cinematographic experience with excellent soundtrack, brilliantly understated acting and stunning, visuals.<br/><br/>I will certainly buy this one when the DVD is released. I also hope no-one will ever attempt a sequel, which would destroy the enigmatic impact of the film. Hollywood, keep your hands off!"

","This takes place in Britain in 2027. The world has been hit by a plague or something (we never find out) that makes women unable to give birth. Society begins to crumble. Theo (Clive Owen) is a bureaucrat who distances himself from it all--but he was once an activist. He's drawn back into it all by a former lover (the always great Julianne Moore). There is one pregnant woman (Clare-Hope Ashitey) who they have to smuggle out of Britain and Theo gets involved.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat vague and I'm still not sure what all these characters were about (I'm STILL at a loss to figure out what Michael Caine was doing here) but I was fascinated from start to finish. It is bleak and depressing with no humor or lightness to help you along. There are bloody gunfights and a nonstop air of depression surrounding everything. Still it's not THAT grim. I was able to distance myself from it--I was always aware I was watching a movie. Some people may not be able to do that (a few people were crying when I went).<br/><br/>The acting is superb--Moore is never bad and Owen has never been better. His acting anchors the whole movie. You see his character go from unfeeling and uncaring to the other extreme. Even Caine was fun (sort of).<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into the politics of the movie--but this seems to be the kind of future President Bush would love. Big Brother is always watching you here--illegal immigrants are routinely caged and brought to camps, people have to carry identity cards and the government has total control over everything.

Nothing any character does follows from anything. Nothing about the society holds together. The only thing that lets me get to sleep at night is the comforting thought that the screenwriters didn't care whether any element of the story made any sense, they were only looking for visual appeal.

And after very effectively promoting for that ninety or so minutes the idea that the human race is just a brutal mob, why am I supposed to care that women have stopped having babies? Unfortunately, this movie is ultimately just a macho fantasy, even to the title: ""Children of MEN(?)"". Babies are beautiful, no doubt about that, but in our actual real world where every single problem the planet faces today - social, political, environmental - can be traced directly to overpopulation, do we really need a movie whose subliminal message is ""a baby will fix everything""?"

Pretty odd for story set twenty years in the future. By the time we're fifteen minutes into the movie the jabs are direct with no pretense of subtlety. It's the story of a man who lives in a society that is controlled by people whose characters could have been created by the Democratic National Committee. No Democratic talking point was missed. I have never seen such shameless propaganda. Even without the political preaching I'm not sure this would be a good movie. The clichés are non-stop.

Even David Lynch with his abstract, dreamy stream of consciousness filmaking leaves the viewer satisfied on some level. That is not the case here.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" thrusts the viewer into a future where men and women are sterile and faced with certain death. Our hero, Clive Owen drags himself through this world, jaded and sluggish - averting the eyes and pleas of non-British citizens, foreigners and immigrants violently imprisoned behind barbed wire in public places. The ""resistance"" discovers the only pregnant woman in Britain and recruits Clive to transport her to safety - to the mysterious group known as the ""human project"". How any of this pandemic and social collapse came to be is never explained.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds we meet the ""resistance"" - kind of a Mad Max Population meets Hip Hop meets Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition meets Greenpeace Boat Sailors. The wise man who counsels Owen in his desperate, meaningless and doomed existence is his own dad! But this a special dad - it's Michael Caine dressed up to look exactly like John Lennon married to a woman in a Yoko Ono costume. In this flick, Mr. Lennon's seventy and tenderly caring for a mute staring Yoko, I mean Mrs. Caine who'd been tortured into an autistic existence by the British government for some unexplained reason (just like everything else that goes on here). Mr. Lennon aka Caine, is still the merry mop top prankster, smoking dope and daring Clive to pull his finger after which he lets rip a disgusting fart! Ha!Ha! The stirring background music to this loving family is a Rolling Stones soundtrack featuring an achingly sung version of Ruby Tuesday.<br/><br/>At this point I should have said ""Hello Goodbye"". But I continued to plow on, like my reluctant, but consciousness awakened hero Clive. Even after the liberal, brave hearted, resistance leader - the determined and beautiful Julianne Moore is gunned down by what we and Clive discover are her own followers. It gets even more ridiculous. Every time the pregnant black woman is revealed to the world, the stunned observer cries out ""Jesus Christ""! There's a Monty Pyhonesque fellow who rescues and later shoots our hero! Lots and lots of random shooting by who knows who! Trying to glean some explanation I even watched this DVD's making of featurettes. I knew I was on the road to enlightenment, when they interviewed several talking heads who made bold comments about global warming as water rushed between icebergs. Maybe I need Barak Obama and Al Gore to explain this flick to me!"

The movie is about a grim future (again, yawn) and features some impressive gun battles with civilians and combatants running fighting and hiding, in scenes similar to Beruit in 1982 yet it's England 2027. The camera work appears to be hand-held, the footage suitably gritty and washed out.<br/><br/>It's a depressing film but not because it predicts a grim future - the grimness is about infertility that started in a couple of years from now, yet this issue is barely discussed, never explored.<br/><br/>The performances range from very good to adequate, but the film and ending was oh so predictable.

The story line had potential but the writer/producer/director did not do much with it.

Fine acting from all concerned and a gripping, well written storyline were of course major factors, but by far the biggest contributor in my opinion was the directing style, which traded the usual theatrics of violence and death for the same sort of matter-of-fact, gritty realism that I have only encountered previously in Saving Private Ryan - itself deeply powerful and heart-rending. The climactic battle scene, with its one continuous shot following Theo's desperate search for Kee and the baby, is one of the most emotive, harrowing pieces of cinema I have ever encountered.

It is shot so well, with its ever longing track shots that gives the film a eerily realistic dimension to it. It is a very graphic yet powerful film, and doesn't show the future in a nerdy cleaned up future. It shows London in 2027, and only a few not-too-overdone futuristic modifications are made.

Also, the most powerful weapon in the movie is actually Kee's Baby, in the scene where she carries her through a war-zone and everyone stops shooting.

"dnlcmch","9","6","13","12 January 2007"," A dystopian masterwork
","""Children of Men"" opens with a bang that echoes throughout the film's entirety. It's a loud, progressive sound that unleashes the darkness of humanity and the chaotic depths of a hellish dystopia. The year is 2027 and humanity is one the verge of extinction. Women are infertile and all hope, innocence, and civilization as we know it has plunged into despair. Only hell itself can rival the idea of this sort of future, where humans are divided, compassion and innocence is nonexistent, and the warmth of a child's heart is nothing more than a long lost dream.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cauron has already established himself as an admirable visualist, and a versatile one at that. From the voluptuous and angelic frames of ""Great Expectations"", ""A Little Princess"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", to the grim and melancholy vision of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", Cauron always manages to elevate the material, good or bad, into a much deeper, profound, and personal work by utilizing in his style and through his own eyes, even to the point of adapting a Charles Dickens novel into a film whose visuals are as lyrical as the source material itself. With Children of Men, Cauron not only succeeds in providing a profoundly haunting vision of an intriguing future, but, he also succeeds in launching his capabilities as both a visionary and as a director to a whole new level, perfectly establishing the film's style and atmosphere with the use of hand-held cameras, elaborate and chaotic set pieces, and an emporium of symbolism and subtle meaning.<br/><br/>The story has a concept that's strikingly unique, yet, told in a traditional and engrossingly symbolic fashion, perhaps almost to the point of being biblical. Theo (Clive Owen) lives his days like any other civilian to Britain's dystopian society. He knows there's no hope, no faith, and no future. He's just counting the days before humanity reaches its end. Yet, all of Theo's thoughts and regards are immediately uplifted once he is reunited with his ex lover, Julian (Julianne Moore), who is now the leader of a terrorist organization whose goal is to stress the meaning of humanity and what is left of it. First, take into consideration the fact that the presence of Julian in Theo's life is more than a breeze of fresh air. She's the last thing on Earth that he love and to have her back in her life is like having sunlight on a day that's bound to bring thunderous storms. We know that the two have a passionate past, yet, one that was destroyed by the loss of their baby child. Theo's remaining feelings for Julian are then delved deeper as he discovers a vital secret...a young woman's pregnancy.<br/><br/>The character of Theo is depicted in a sort of biblical manner, making him the shepherd that God trusts upon in order to expand the affections of his miracles. The film itself can be considered as a deep meditation on the science of theology and the philosophy of nurture and its effect on human nature. Is the resulting chaotic society a reflection upon human nature, or is it simply the dying need for the warmth and nurture we witness every day, yet, never fully appreciate? The performances given by the cast are all astounding in their own way. Clive Owen is an actor whose always benefited from his deep voice and suave persona, like the ideal James Bond. Yet, as Theo, Owen gets a chance to explore a character with profoundly deep emotions, from the troubling grief of loosing a son to the inexplicable capacity of saving humanity's last hope. Owen delivers an all out sublime performance and carries the film beautifully. Julianne Moore, although with limited screen time, delivers a fairly fleshed out performance that enables the audience to have an overall good understanding of her character, her goals, and her feelings and intentions towards the fate of humanity and Theo. Claire-Hope Ashitey, the newcomer of the ensemble, delivers well as Owen's opposite and as playing the pinnacle role of the film, giving a performance that utilizes on her amount of realism and believability.<br/><br/>From its opening scenes, Children of Men is a panorama of not only a brilliantly crafted, nihilist dystopia of a future, but, also of the capabilities of human compassion in the face of hellish darkness. Cauron has created his own personal masterpiece with his own personal and unique style. From his use of excessive tracking shots to the emphasis of hyperrealism, he fuels the film with both technical and emotional nuances that will stray in your mind for days. The ever-lasting message of hope is one we hear every now and then, yet, Cauron presents the moral of the story in a way audiences, and mainstream ones especially, aren't use to seeing. It's a moral that isn't afraid of being too bleak or too sober  just as honest and poignant as a newborn baby's cry."

"matt-stabile","10","6","13","11 January 2007"," Take Note Filmmakers, Cuaron's ""Children of Men"" is the Best Film Made in Recent History
","Read This and Other Reviews at TheExpeditioner.com There are certain films whose story will be pored over, ruminated, discussed and wildly interpreted to the point of frustration. ""Children of Men,"" Alfonso Cuaron's fourth English-language film, is not and should not be one. Instead, it is a pre-apocalyptic work of art whose genius derives not from the somewhat illogical plot line but from its masterful use of vivid imagery and cinematography of the highest caliber, leaving the audience enthralled and in a state of disbelief throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>""Children of Men,"" (a quotation from the bible: ""Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!"") is essentially a nativity story based in a decaying not-too-distant future where women have become infertile and England has become an inhospitable haven for outlawed immigrants whose influx has led the British government to outlaw them entirely. Amidst this chaos the archetypal hero (aimless, emotionally defunct, melancholic) Theodore (Clive Owen) is recruited to accompany a pregnant refugee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to safety out of warring Britain and into the hands of a group named The Human Project, located offshore in the Azores. Why exactly she can't stay and have the baby (fear that the government won't allow it because she's an immigrant or fear that rebel groups will use her as propaganda are two somewhat implausible reasons suggested) or what The Human Project actually does (a Mediterranean Manhattan Project plotting to begin civilization over again) are two of the more glaring questions that need to be quickly discarded to truly enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Cuaron explained in a recent interview that he was not so much interested in addressing these questions as he was in exploring the metaphors presented by a civilization unable to procreate and the hopes that one child could bring to a hopeless people. But what he fails to mention is that he is very intent on creating a cinematic experience that has never been felt before; one that is created not by the story but by the monumental work behind the camera.<br/><br/>Never before have I seen special effects so effectively used than in Children of Men; exemplified by their almost invisibility (take note George Lucas - on second thought, please stop making movies). Whereas the standard vision of the future in film has been unfamiliar (Blade Runner, Mad Max, maybe even Waterworld), here the future is a mere twenty years off and the world is eerily similar, save for the minor technological advances such as digital billboards displayed on building facades and slightly more ergonomic cars. Filmed throughout with a bluish/grey hue, the world appears significantly more rundown but quite recognizable, as would be the case in this fictional social state, and the familiar London sites are seamlessly transformed digitally into pseudo-military checkpoints and public holding cells. Other poignant images inserted surreptitiously include scenes of caged foreigners ready for transport, an Abu-Ghraib inspired prison -- complete with attack dogs, disrobed and masked prisoners -- and a not-so-subtle visual allusion to Pink Floyd's classic album cover, ""Animals,"" with an accompanying flying pig.<br/><br/>Even more impressive is the way that Cuaron utilizes digital effects to give the allusion that the film has been shot in a series of long tracking shots, some of which run as long as nine minutes. Most impressive of these is during the film's climax where the hand-held camera seemingly follows the action of Theo from outside a war torn building, up several flights of stairs, through a gun battle and back down outside amidst scores of extras fighting, yelling and cowering from gunshots - a shot so complex and physically impossible it is a wonder that at the time I didn't realize it was not truly a single take. What Cuaron achieves through this digital trick-of-hand (the scenes are actually several different shots digitally connected to appear as a single take) is to transport the audience directly into the midst of the action, sometimes in the first-person view, creating an exhilaratingly involving experience that has been lost with the contemporary trend of quick inserts and rapid-fire editing.<br/><br/>The real accomplishment is that through the use of these techniques and despite the otherwise distracting plot holes, ""Children of Men"" transports the audience so entirely and convincingly into this rugged, bleak future that the simple act of childbirth creates an immense emotional impact. The result is that by the end the audience is left completely exhausted and mentally drained by the travails that Theo has gone through to deliver this small glimmer of hope into an otherwise hopeless world.<br/><br/>As a I rode home after the film I heard a post 9/11 recorded announcement on the subway alerting passengers to be aware of suspicious packages or people; an alert not unlike the ones played throughout the film warning Londoners of the danger of foreigners. A striking similarity between a world so different from the recent past and a world portrayed so close in the future -- a similarity not lost at all on the makers of ""Children of Men."""

","I just returned from watching this movie. The acting is great but the film doesn't show why people do not procreate anymore, why the world is in a bad state, and what will happen after the end of the film. This in contrast with the amount of filming time used for some people moving from one place to another. I read a lot of books of WWII and this film had some shocking parts in it to me as what the civilized (British) world is doing to other people in 2027. Like the film Waterworld, in some part you get to know why the world is all water and what will happen when they found the last peace of land. But in this film you miss out that part. The plot is great to make a good story but things don't add up. And it's beautiful when women are pregnant, but it throws the film to ranks at the bottom when it is predictable that the women has to bare child at the least convenient moment. That has worn out so many times, it doesn't work anymore."

"ironhorse_iv","8","3","5","30 March 2017"," Oh Man, yes! Children of Men deserve the rights to be call all-time masterpiece. It's one of my favorite movies
","Loosely based on a novel of the same name by author P.D James, 2006's apocalyptic thriller 'Children of Men' tells the story of Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a disillusioned bureaucrat who spends most of his days wallowing in drunken self-pity as the world around him, dies a little each day, due to the fact that the human race has been rendered infertile. But that all changes when he's abducted, and force by his ex-wife turn refugee freedom fighter, Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore) to agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman, Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitney) around a war-torn England to a sanctuary at sea. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, certain audience members might hate this movie for the lack of exposition. I have to say, does do enough, as the movie opens with a new casting. Even without that, 'Children of Men' still explores the themes of hope and faith in the face of overwhelming futility and despair, so well, with visual effects and well-crafted music that it didn't need to tell it through words. You see how the world deals with issues like immigration through the background and sounds that it plays. You know that something isn't right. The War on Terror looks more like the Holocaust. It tells you in an interesting subtle way by lingering on it, even if the foreground has pass the camera frame. It's brilliant filmmaking. It also rich in symbolism, both historic, political, religious, and cultural. You can't help, seeing images that remind you of arts, ranging both modern and classic. Works like Sandro Botticelli's 'Birth of Venus' to Michelangelo's 'Pietà hit you very strong with feelings. The film's visuals is also full of references to famous literature works such as George Orwell's novel 'Animal Farm' to T.S Eliot's poem 'The Wasteland'. Plus, you can't get away from all the Christ imagery. While, some of these imageries can be a bit heavy-handed. Most of it wasn't annoying like other films. Plus, I like how the visuals for this movie, help influence other works like 2013's video game 'Last of Us' & 2016's film ""Logan"". The cinematography from both Emmanuel Lubeski & director Alfonso Cuarón was amazing. The use of dark color palette really shows the bleak dystopian future, the film was going for. However, the most obvious achievement for this film, was the consistent use of long takes. Scenes like the 'Car Ambush' & 'the Tank' moments are some of the best well-shot sequence, I have ever saw, in a movie. The film is full of top-notch action scenes like that, that comes off as chaotic, despite being meticulously planned out. Cuarón shoots most of these scenes like a combat documentary, using hand-held cameras. Thank goodness, for no shaky cam. I also like how the film used natural light wherever possible. You see, a lot of it, in early dawn in the urban centers, and the forest sequences. While, the camera shots are impressive; the acting in this movie is just as good. The people in this fictional world is reflection of our current society. It shows a range of human emotions: ranging from anger to violence, hopeful to religious, disengage to hedonism, and downright depressing to defeat. Everybody in this film has a role to play, and all the actors pull it off, even Michael Caine as Jasper; whom I think, is the weakest of the characters. I think, they pull it off, even if in order to bring the book to the big screen, several key character roles were switched and streamlined. Theo as a government worker rather than an Oxford Historian, makes more sense. Other great things, the film change or delete, was the way, Theo's kids die, and his unneeded love triangle with Julian and another man, and Theo's over the top brotherhood with cartoony evil villain of warden Xan. I also like, how the film stick to a one place settling, rather than going with the novel's idea of Theo going on vacation to a different continent. It makes it, seem that travelling is dangerous and not easy to do. However, some of the changes felt a bit not wised. Julian's new role as the rebel freedom fighter, rather than the carrier was somewhat a downgraded; seeing her original role, not only affect with the people around her, but also the whole country. Also, the new ending with the ship of 'Tomorrow' felt a bit, out of place. I get the Human Project, part, but why would a reproductive medicine team would need be in the ocean to do their studies. Did I miss, something, political here? As much, as I hate the Xan being comically evil in the novel; I would still rather have the 'coronation ring' ending, instead. Despite that, I did think the film did the right decision, with switching the infertility from male to female. It makes the film's ending, a lot more ambiguous, & bittersweet. Overall: As far as dystopia sci-films go, it doesn't go much higher than this movie. 'Children of Men' is quite simply one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Thought-provoking and spry. It will aged well, overtime. You will get a lot with repeat viewings. Highly recommended."
"Screen_Blitz","9","3","5","9 September 2016"," Wildly compelling and thought-provoking tale of a bleak, dystopian future
","Adapting from P.D. James's phenomenal literary work, Alfonso Cuaran embraces a dark, powerful vision in this examination of both a paranoid and terrifying fight for humanity's survival. From the prestigious script by Cuaron and the stellar cinematography to capture the most astonishing moments, the scariest aspect Cuaron incorporates here is not just the concept of humanity threatened by infertility or the violent nature associated with it but how incredibly believable it is. Though such a deeply bleak concept like is highly unlikely to happen, the film makes it quite difficult not to imagine the possibility of the future hitting such turmoil envisioned this story. It is eagerly thought-provoking from beginning to end, but nonetheless compelling in nearly every sense. Set in 2027 in dystopian London, one of the last stable nations alive after the world is devastated by war. All the women in the world have been left infertile, and the youngest individual alive has just died; leading humanity alarmingly close to extinction. But when London native Theo Faron (played by Clive Owen) learns from his former lover Julian (played by Julianne Moore) of an illegal immigrant Kee (played by Clara-Hope Ashitey) who happens to the first pregnant women in nearly two decades, Theo sets out to escort the women across the violent, war-ridden country to board a ship that will take her safety. <br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaran drives this film in a direction that cites more interest in telling a powerful story of a society facing a grim downfall than explaining the reason behind the disaster that threatens the very existence of mankind, and it's not long before the plot moves in ways that render the explanation behind the mysterious phenomenon less and less important. The plot sets in the following the news of an 18-year old boy, the youngest human being alive dies, and atmosphere settles with every last living adult alive facing a seemingly inevitable doom. From that point, we are left with endure a bleak and paranoid atmosphere, with a very few moments of levity. One of which involves Michael Caine as a old pot-smoking hippie who becomes a brief aid for the lead character on his journey, and only with little screen time. Along the way, we are set on an extraordinary journey of hope and desperation, with themes of war and genocide of illegal immigrants playing out. Alfonso Cuaran portrays these elements with such gravity and authenticity, and with a deep emotional core punctuating nearly every scene; there is never a moment that feels wasted. Few of these scenes involves Clive Owen's character and the supporting characters in the midst of the mass genocide that tears their surroundings to shreds, and these scenes sparkle with breathtaking cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezski, with some long uninterrupted shots progressing as long as several minutes. <br/><br/>The cast consisting of Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Chiwetel Eijiofor, Michael Caine, and Clara-Hope Ashitey, falls nothing short of ambition here. Clive Owen, taking the lead role, is fantastic with his performance with great sincerity. Along his side is Chiwetel Eijifor as the leader of an immigrants' rights group who is the initial protector of the poor pregnant women Kee. He delivers a decent performance for the rather small amount of screen time he has, but definitely not one of his most memorable roles. Julianne Moore, multi- Academy Award nominee, is also given her time to shine here but like Chiwetel Eijiofor, carries a slick shortage of time on screen. Michael Caine plays an old hippie isn't really given much to do other than provide a little light-hearted relief from the grim atmosphere that pervades the film. Clara-Hope Ashitey on the other hand, is arguably the most riveting actress in the picture. Blooming with heart and humanity, Ashitey nails her role and provides a pleasant on screen presence throughout. Whether her performance soars in the Oscar caliber or not is difficult to speak of. Needless to say, she delivers all what she needs to do. <br/><br/>Children of Men is a powerful dystopian science-fiction adventure with a thought-provoking treat from beginning to end. It is a deeply inspiring take on P.D. James's acclaimed novel, and sits a well example of an cinematic translation of literary done right, even if it spits a few liberties form the novel. The performances are powerful, the cinematography is profoundly stunning, and the script by Alfonso Cuaran succeeds on capturing a realistic feel of a futuristic society in gone to turmoil."

","This movie had so much potential for a great story, but didn't come through at all. Mankind can't have children, but it's never really explained too well. Some girl has a kid, don't know why. We've got to get the mother to some place, not sure why. People get killed, not sure why. There's no tension, no obstacles to overcome - basically the Italian Job of ""sci-fi.""<br/><br/>Technical problems: the action one-take follow shot is great for war scenes, but not for a conversational scene. Shooting an entire movie in this look is disorienting and annoying. Sound design was atrocious as well, with every character having a crystal clear voice, despite being outdoors or in an echo-y corridor.<br/><br/>Acting by Clive Owen was very mechanical and emotionless. He was a reluctant hero, but had a permanent look of ""What, where am I?"" on his face. The rest of the cast was poorly developed, which really made me care very little when they were taken out of the storyline.<br/><br/>With my griping out of the way, let me touch on the good. The locations were beautifully gritty. All of the abandoned buildings and the refugee camp footage was very well put together. There was some good humor that broke up the film a bit and made it not so tedious to watch. Some good action sequences in there as well, and a bit of brutal violence that surprised me a little.<br/><br/>All in all, a film with a lot of potential that fell far short. It's hardly a sci-fi film, and its attempts to be artistic made it frustrating to watch."

","I do not usually like this kind of 'Science Fiction'; I MUCH prefer the more 'entertaining' and stylized visions of the future that are not so DAMN gritty and realistic (such as 'Dune' and 'Bladerunner' for example ~or even Star Trek and B-5 to be honest~) BUT, and it'a a BIG ONE like Mariah Carrey's (YUM! : ) I do absolutely HAVE to admit that this film is not only made extremely well, but I feel it does indeed accomplish EXACTLY what the director wants it to do: To give us a VERY realistic and believable warning as to what COULD very well happen in the near future based upon a number of his political observations.<br/><br/>That is why although I personally would not CHOOSE this kind of film for my usual type of preferred Science Fiction, I MUST admit that I was powerfully moved many times during the film.

ANYONE that does that earns MY respect, I'll tell you : ) Seriously though, EXTREMELY well made film *** IF *** you like and appreciate your Science Fiction to be VERY realistic and cautionary.

"commandercool88","10","3","5","30 March 2007"," Sweeping Perfection
","'Children of Men' will break your heart just so it can put the pieces back together. Alfonso Cuaron deftly crafts this masterpiece of a film, and it's one of the most powerful of the year, or of any year. He so remarkably reaches into the future to deliver a startling warning to society today, while giving us a truly effective film that works on so many levels. It's an action film, a thriller, a drama, a crime mystery. It transcends the typical movie-going experience, resulting in a spirited film that'll pull at your heartstrings, but give us hope for a new day. It's one of the very best films of 2006.<br/><br/>Imagine a world where nearly all governments have collapsed. Crimes are at an all-time high. And women are infertile. Where hope for a future no longer exists. In Alfonso Cuaron's world, this is the world that will exist in 20 short years. But for Theo, a former peace activist turned bureaucrat, life will be turned upside down in an instant when he's encountered by his ex-girlfriend, Julien, and recruited by her rebel group. Labeled as a terrorist organization by the British government, the group plans on rising up against the oppressing national government. How high the stakes truly are will be revealed to Theo when he discovers one of the group's members, Kee, is 8 months pregnant. It's now a race against time to safely transport Kee to the Human Project, who will be able to provide the needed medical support. It's a task that will take them across England and into the heart of life-risking danger. It's the last ray of hope this world needs, but will it live to see the day?<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron ('Y Tu Mama Tambien', 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban') has a style all of his own. It's gritty and raw, no glossy cover, and the cinematography is sweeping. Simply put, 'Children of Men' is an amazingly well-made film. But it's so much more than that. What struck a chord with me was how startling realistic this film is. Cuaron has created a fully realized world that lives and breathes. And while I wouldn't classify 'Children' as a political movie, it certainly makes some poignant social commentary about war, pollution, immigration. Issues that appear to mirror our own society. It's as if Cuaron is telling us, the time is now. Now is the time to wake up, realize what's going on in the world today, and take a stand in doing something about it. Do something, or suffer the consequences. It may ruffle some feathers, but if it didn't, then this movie isn't doing its job.<br/><br/>'Children' is at times both an immensely intense and emotionally compelling picture. The action scenes are some of the best ever captured on film, the violence brutal and graphic. It's not always an easy film to watch, but even through its realistic portrayal of violence, 'Children of Men' has a compassionate heart. Cuaron has a way of capturing the human spirit like I've never seen before. The emotional depth he brings to film shines in all he does, making what I believe is one of the best working directors today. I cannot imagine a director who could have handled 'Children' any better, it could have easily come across as either too saccharine or too violence-based, either of which would have weakened the effectiveness of the film. Yet with Cuaron, a perfect medium is found. The result, 'Children of Men' consists of some of the most heart-wrenching scenes of the year, but also some of the most uplifting.<br/><br/>The film's cast is spot-on. And while Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine all deliver excellent performances, it's the enduring supporting cast that ultimately steals the show. Claire-Hope Ashitey, who portrays the first pregnant woman the world has seen in 18 years, gives audiences a moving and fantastic performance. But Pam Ferris, a nurse who accompanies Kee along her journey, takes the cake. Truly and utterly amazing, Ferris has that emotional punch that connects extremely well with the audience. Clive Owen's best performance to date remains his tour de force in 'Closer', but the strength and power he exudes on film makes him one of Hollywood's most talented and underrated actors. Michael Caine has gone from being a master magician in 'The Prestige' to a weed-growing hippy in 'Children', but his ability to command the screen is never questioned.<br/><br/>'Children of Men' may be overshadowed by some of the other more mainstream award-caliber films this year, but let it be known that the latest film from Alfonso Cuaron is a true, unparalleled masterpiece. It's such a breathtaking and dazzling effort in every sense of the word, and a film that everyone should have the opportunity to see. It's a cautionary tale that'll make you believe in the endurance of the human spirit, once and for all. And in the end, its exhilarating power will leave you breathless and transformed. It uses the loss of fertility to represent a much broader issue, what happens in a world without hope and in the face of destruction. It begs the question, what will you do to help? The time to act is now, and the time has never been better to see 'Children of Men'."
"ameh1","8","3","5","18 January 2007"," Through a Lens Darkly
","Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men has captured man in his element, a self-destructive force, more comfortable in the role of destroyer than creator or enforcer of justice. Using a constantly moving camera, combined with powerful sound effects and brilliant editing, he invites us into the very abode of the devil himself, a visually fascinating journey.<br/><br/>It is as if the audience is drawn into the film, against their will, becoming a key element of the story. We are given a camera and are forced to join Theo in his many adventures and observe his every move, as he confronts his enemies and adapts to an unexpected and rapidly changing environment. We find our selves in Jasper's house (the character played with such ease by Michael Cane), and as we often do when we are visitors to a house, we seek in images and objects and various bits and pieces of paper, the life story of our host, and so the camera slowly pans its way across the many paper clippings and mementos so lovingly put together, curious to know but afraid to ask, why his wife sits silently, looking into know where. When the leaves rustle gently in the wind, you look up, or the camera does, fascinated by the giant and ancient trees, as they sway gently sway back and forth whispering to each other, earnestly. As Theo dodges the bullets and weaves his way through the violent streets, and people who seem to have lost their way, we are given a first hand view, up close and personal, of humanity slowly disintegrating and dying a slow and tragic death.<br/><br/>In the end, we have to stop and leave Theo to his fate. As the camera slows down and widens its scope, the image is startling; a boat rocks back and forth in turbulent waters, hidden amongst the thick mist and stormy skies, its fate, and the fate of humanity itself unknown. Suddenly like phantoms, fighter jets scream overhead, to be followed, in the distance, by muffled sounds and flashes of human destruction. Adding a disturbing color to a disturbing landscape, like a painting from one of the Dutch or French Masters, framed forever on a museum wall.<br/><br/>The actors are used as mere tools and instruments in the telling of a story, they play their part and vanish, as they are meant to, that is why one cannot help but admire the performance of Clive Owen as Theo. His gaunt haggard face, unshaven, with deep sunken eyes, fits perfectly into the mood of the story. A man who has lost all hope or belief in anything, thrust into a world filled with characters that have sunk deeper into a nihilistic nightmare.<br/><br/>In fact, (and it could be just my imagination working overtime) some of the characters seem to have walked right out of a Gogol or Dostoyevsky novel. I would go so far as to say that this movie brings to mind what I have always imagined Russia or Germany to have felt and looked like during the later half of the 19th Century through the first few decades of the 20th century.<br/><br/>I was also reminded, as I watched this movie, of the brilliance of a Schindler's List or the camera movements of Saving Private Ryan. There is something very similar in the nature of the personalities of Oskar Schindler and Theo. Both seek redemption; both are alone, isolated from the rest of the world, fighting it, and the demons within. Speaking of Theo, the name is not much different than Neo, from the Matrix; one could say that this movie is a more realistic approach towards similar subject matter.<br/><br/>Through the eyes of the director and his camera, we are forced to bare witness to the state of human existence in the present; a world where everything and anything is possible, a world without hope or faith in the greatness of humanity and its leaders. Thrust or born into such a world, the individual will believe any one who provides them with a sense of hope and belonging, and therefore will justify using any means possible to make sure that they are never separated from what they believe to be a sanctuary, a cause that gives them a sense of identity and worth. From this, fundamental principles are born, and spread like a virus through every aspect of human life; religious, secular and economic. As the movie develops, the eternal hope is that with the birth of every new born child, we will somehow regain our humanity. We pause for a moment in the midst of whatever we are doing, our expressions soften and we bow in reverence, but familiar sounds bring us back to reality, into a world in which we are most comfortable.<br/><br/>While Freedom Writers uses the power of a brilliant performance to steer things up; Children of Men, has a stronger foundation on which to build on, with excellent direction. Both movies are bold and dare to take risks. While Freedom Writers is far more hopeful and positive, Children of Men does not use sentiment, it is brutal and honest, focusing on Man in his most natural environment. The director exploits to the fullest, the creative freedom and license that has been bestowed upon him, by the powers that be. On the other hand, by limiting the number of people who are going to see this movie, or can see this movie, they have taken back what they gave so liberally. It would be a shame, if this movie as well as Freedom Writers, is denied the opportunity to participate in many of the award ceremonies that flourish during this time of the year."

Excellent ! I was totally immersed in the environment and nothing looked fake. Truly amazing SCI FI ! Also, I was hoping for a bit more SCI FI elements that'd explain why women were no longer having babies. Something relevant. Hint hint ! Come on you Screenwriters, even I could think up something better. Well, actually I think I will do that !! Ha ha. Anyway, this movie is a must-see for any SCI FI enthusiast or casual movie goer. It definitely makes you ponder the question whether Genetic tampering could actually lead to such a predicament."
"Guinevere723","7","3","5","16 January 2007"," What's left to hope for? Movies like this!
","'Children of Men' paints a disturbing picture of a not-to-distant future (the year 2027), concentrating on a world's civilization that has been dealt a very harsh reality: the human race is on the brink of extinction. Women have come to acquire an inexplicable fertility defect and can no longer procreate as they could 20 years ago. As the rest of the world has fallen to ruins, hapless souls from all over the globe attempt to immigrate to the one and only place that has managed to survive: London, England. The once prosperous and renowned city has turned into an oppressive and highly controlled environment, yet by the same token it has become the only safe haven left on Earth that's still alive and kicking.<br/><br/>Soon we are introduced to Theo, a former activist turned bureaucrat, and his ex-wife Julian, a big name peace advocate. The two are compelled to reconcile by forces bigger than them because, as it turns out, there's a young woman by the name of Kee who is miraculously with child. A difficult but worthwhile mission thus ensues in order to safely transport and protect Kee and take her to a safe place off the coast where scientists can learn from this remarkable miracle.<br/><br/>I must begin by saying that, even if it's only January, this is the most absorbing movie that I have seen this year. The overall concept proposed in the storyline is not entirely implausible, which makes it all the more frightening. And although we as viewers are never really given a concrete explanation as to why women have become infertile, the notion is no less worrisome. But one of the things that especially impressed me about this film was its visuals. Artistically speaking, it is masterfully shot and constructed and does nothing short of take your breath away. I was absolutely blown away by the incredibly long and action-packed single takes that were interspersed throughout. That sort of approach successfully aids in giving the film a gritty and guerilla-like tinge to it. It puts you on the edge of your seat and makes you feel like you're down in the trenches right along with the characters; extremely effective and transfixing.<br/><br/>And with a cast like this, it comes as no surprise that the film was chock-full of excellent performances across the board. Clive Owen is certainly continuing to prove himself as a hot commodity, even if success didn't greet him with open arms until he was well into his 40's. His classically handsome look paired with his undeniable talent make him nothing short of luminous when projected on screen. As usual, Julianne Moore is excellent, though a bit understated here. Her role is not a very large one, despite what the trailers and previews on TV lead you to believe. And Michael Caine, who never disappoints, turns in a cheeky and chuckle-inducing performance as a former political-cartoonist turned reformed hippie.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is definitely worth checking out and hopefully you can appreciate it for not only being a thrilling science fiction piece, but also a deeply moving drama with hints of light comedy to break the tension every so often. I hear a lot of people label it as being the 'Blade Runner' of the new millenniumI'm not entirely sure I agree with that because they are two entirely different movies, advocating completely different ideas. Nor do I believe this film will have as much of a culturally significant impact as 'Blade Runner' did, but that's just my opinion. I do urge you, however, to check out 'Children of Men' so you can judge for yourself!"
"Cinema_Fan","9","3","5","16 January 2007"," A Fable: England's green and unpleasant land's.
","Caution: This review's second chapter contains minor book Spoilers, concerning the P.D. James novel The Children of Men.<br/><br/>Director of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) and Producer to Pan's Labyrinth (2006), Mexican born Alfonso Cuarón has now delivered us Children of Men. Phyllis Dorothy James White, the British born (1920) writer penned her 1992 novel The Children of Men and having worked for the British Civil Service, spent time as a magistrate and governed the BBC her full and illustrious career is never endless. Alongside the movies screen writing team she took the 19th annual USC Libraries Scripter Award, too, the 2007 Online Film Critics Society Awards for Adapted Best Screenplay.<br/><br/>As a book on its own it works well, as an adaptation it works extremely well, while only taking minor snippets from the novel and adding and subtracting their own brand of themes and concepts Children of Men is now one of the better movies to emerge from 2006, and notwithstanding the modern adaptation of Ian Fleming's Casino Royale.<br/><br/>With this dystopian world ravished by war, paranoia and the frustrations, and failures, of Man the Orwellian vision of Nineteen Eighty-Four, the totalitarian future is now complete and amongst us. Female fertility has become obsolete, the Human race cannot reproduce, and no child has been born on the face of the planet for eighteen years. Man, and his future, is dying. Soon he shall be extinct. Theo, the beaten, downtrodden and middle-aged ex-political activist has unwittingly become involved in a war of an underground revolt. Here he is active once more, in the perilous journey across England's Home Counties, with a young girl, Kee, who, to Theo's bewilderment is pregnant. The first pregnant woman for more than eighteen years. This secret must be protected, at all cost, and mother and child must flee to the mysterious and enigmatic Human Project, across the seas. Their flight is a constant fight for survival. Who can be trusted? Who can keep a secret? This is the hopelessness and disdain that Alfonso Cuarón has projected, as Man is slowly becoming extinct, he, as a race, must come to terms with its own passing, that Man is not infallible, not immortal and that with His own future He must also prepare and cope with his own inevitable demise.<br/><br/>With this premise Alfonso Cuarón, his scriptwriters and crewmembers have turned Children of Men into a vision of cinematic mastery; this is a dark world, that is, over the last eighteen years, torn itself apart, albeit in the physical, emotional and spiritual form. The mistrust of anything foreign is quickly dispersed and rejected; ethnic cleansing has never had it so good, with England's policy of returning non-nationals to their respective homelands. Reminders of past European xenophobic atrocities' such as 1930's Germany and 1990's Yugoslavia comes into mind. Here, in London 2027, with the Governing bodies and their prison camps that are brutal, callous and unforgiving, we now have a Police State, that one Theodore Faron, and working for a Governmental body the Ministry of Energy, has to endeavour.<br/><br/>There is no government ruler here, this has been replaced by a Warden, The Warden of England, Ministers are represented by democracy, here anarchy is governed by a self-appointed Warden, and here too is the pecking order of the British class system, this is emphasised more by the use of the concept of animals. The rebel underground activists who call themselves The Fishes. While Julian has the tiny tattoo of a swallow on her neck, the symbol for independent freedoms perhaps? The tiny fragile songbird whose wings, sadly, are clipped. Theo, on the other hand, has been given the qualities of what appears to be of Saint Francis, Patron Saint for animals, it is the animals in this movie that seem to have a connection with Theo, a six sense that they, and only they, can recognise the quality of a higher being, a Saviour. In the final battle, we have a heard of sheep, controlled sheep and their dogs running, fleetingly, through the streets, the symbol of chaos of the masses that are guided and pushed by the dogs. Which in turn are also controlled by the pigs, and toward the end, we repeat the scene that is hanging on the wall of the Warden's dinning room Picasso's black and white painting Guernica and the effects of war and disorder. The ruling classes that populate the schism between the oppressed and their high-ranking counterparts. The all seeing pigs, their affluence, power and greed that crush these doomed sheep, and guide them to their slaughter.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki's work here as cinematographer is astounding. His talents have rewarded him with numerous recognitions for Children of Men, be it B.A.F.T.A., the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, National Society of Film Critics Awards, USA, Online Film Critics Society Awards and the Venice Film Festival, and not forgetting his 2007 Academy Award nomination for ""Best Achievement in Cinematography"". His vision is a powerful thoroughfare of Mans destructive capabilities, and with an insight to seeing the real world via dark, bleak and graphic detailing that war can bring. However, where the Children of Men transcends into great cinematic craftwork is the style of camera-work that Alfonso Cuarón has developed, with his extendedly long camera shots, and with minimal edits, we literally are alongside Theo and his contemporaries. These long uncut hand-held shots are what makes Children of Men work at ground level, and with this believability, photography and sensitivities we have a movie that has delivered."
"bobbobwhite","7","3","5","16 January 2007"," Grey, grim, gritty and depressing, as it should be
","I won't tell the story of the film as others do over and over, but I will offer a commentary.<br/><br/>In this gritty and harsh end-of-the-world-coming film there were too many unexplained reasons for everything bad that had happened/was happening to the world for me to say this was a great movie, but it did have its very effective moments if you could look past its story holes, inconsistencies and oversights. It is true that harsh, apocalyptic films like this one are tough to watch, but are absolutely necessary for all of us to see many times from this point on, as people worldwide do not respond to subtle messages about our environment, pollution, war, and global warming so they must be hit in the face by a story like this one regularly to show what can/could happen to us if we don't wake up and stop the world-killing atrocities that we are committing against other humans and to the earth. The film story left out the causes of the horrible state of the earth and concentrated on the effects of these atrocities, which were truly horrible to witness. All of it was very shocking, as something like it really could and may happen.<br/><br/>The story of getting a mother and child, the only one in the world, out of England to someplace secret to perhaps provide a chance for humans to start anew, was your typical chase story with all the typical suspense, pitfalls, threats, violence and mayhem along the way. Nothing too unusual or different there. The ending was the hope the filmmaker gave us. But, what would that baby girl do later to save our species even if she escaped? Any possibility for the future hinged on finding a fertile male somewhere, but no babies had been born for many years so what were the chances of that? Would they try to use frozen sperm from an earlier and fertile time? No questions like this one were ever posed or answered.<br/><br/>The impact of the obvious ""baby Jesus"" scene near the end was very forceful, as it represented the filmmaker's idea of perhaps the only chance at a new beginning for our human-screwed-up-world in 2027, just as Jesus' birth was hoped to be 2000 years earlier. That powerful scene showed the immense reverence and amazement of even the military, which briefly ceased its vicious attack on insurgents as the mother and baby passed by. It was like a 2x4 slamming into your head as it made its point of, ""this baby is perhaps the only chance for human survival!"".<br/><br/>I had a problem with story inaccuracies, as in its technical representations everything.....the tanks, guns, cars, clothing and even TV's showed no improvements over those around today and in many cases they were worse. No progress there, so the problems shown were obviously around for many years, perhaps since 2007? No clue, no answers. Also, if the country was in such chaos, why were the roads everywhere passable without roadblocks? Where did they get fuel? And, how did everyone eat, sleep, work, make money to live on, etc.? No good explanations were given for any of that. The film just wanted us to accept what it showed and concentrate on the devastation and human depravity. But I needed a more full and complete story of the social mess and its causes, and this wasn't one so I was left with too many unanswered questions that should have been answered.<br/><br/>This movie has been out a week and hardly anyone was in the theater, so it probably won't make a profit.... depressing and/or apocalyptic films, even though foretelling an impossible or even somewhat hopeful future for us, usually don't make money. We just don't want to face what we have done and what may result from it so we stay away."
"riskplayer2","8","3","5","14 January 2007"," Just got back
","This was a very good movie. The theater was packed and I haven't seen a lot of advertising on it. It must be word of mouth. It's fast paced and kept me engrossed every minute. I really liked the fact they had scenes where the camera is obviously being carried by a camera man. It gave certain scenes a gritty realism that was kewl. Michael Cain is amusing right to the end. It will probably be good on DVD . I'd say waiting for this to hit commercial TV would ruin it for you. This film has good momentum and advertising would probably render it unwatchable. What is up with minimum lines? Can't someone just come on with a brief take on a film?"
"baskin_robin689","Null","3","5","11 January 2007"," Hope and beauty beneath the chaos
","Alright so pretty much I loved this movie purely because of the societal messages and ideas about human nature that it creates.<br/><br/>I would have to say I felt that the strongest part, the part that really made me think, was when 'theo' and 'kee' were walking through the crowd of soldiers, carrying the baby as everyone looked on. To me this sent the message that, despite societal restrains and conditions, everyone is still human. The soldiers, their guns cocked and ready, pointed at the next random person that they had planned to kill, still showed hope for the future. The baby, which stood for that hope, made them all stop and stare in awe. But just as the message had been beautiful, it ended with the soldiers turning away from their hope and resuming fire: Society imposes so many chains but, despite that, the chains can only bind. they cannot remove the human underneath the layers of bone, flesh and skin. But despite this glimmer of hope, the chains of society still hold fast."
"sushee-monster","Null","3","5","8 January 2007"," A technically proficient post-apocalyptic dystopia
","NOTE: Rather than pointing out things already described in triplicate by other movie reviews, I opted to mention elements of the film that were not exhaustively discussed, yet made the movie better. Also, my review would not make much sense without giving context to the back story. As such, I will try my best not to reveal any actual plot or spoilers. This section will be enclosed within -----'s<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men ties elements of sci-fi, war, and human drama very cohesively. To that end, the film evokes the same moods as films like 1984, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan while still feeling totally refreshing.<br/><br/>----- Based (very) loosely upon a 1992 novel by P.D. James, Children of Men takes place in 2027 in a world torn apart by global terrorism and pollution. Most of the major cities around the world have been ravaged for some reason or another (mostly nuclear), causing ""foogies"" to flee to Great Britain. Britain is one of the only countries that hasn't collapsed under the strain of the world and maintains its position by maintaining a very hostile disposition towards outsiders. Worsening the matters is an unexplainable infertility pandemic that has crippled the human race for 18 years. -----<br/><br/>One of the first things I noticed about the movie is, despite being 20 years later, the movie had a very present feel to it. Unlike other films that take place in the near future, this movie feels that time has progressed in a very deliberate pace. The streets of London feel like they would now, save for a few subtle technological advances. Technology advancement has always been a prominent element in conveying the theme and I thank Cuarón for not beating a dead horse. Several of today's topics in the world today are also integrated into the film. Terrorism (there's more than one type), the Iraq War, environmental degradation are all prevalent and their effects on the world in the future. In the end, the film has a certain plausibility to it versus the more abstract and detached settings in most Science Fiction film.<br/><br/>Another element that stuck out in my mind is the use of non-verbal exposition incorporated into the film. Much of the back story and overall mood is filled in by showing news clippings, TV news reports, capture and internment of refugees along the London streets, etc. While most films of this scope require direct explanation, Children of Men does an excellent job at wiring these things directly into the movie.<br/><br/>Cuarón also filmed extended takes for the movie. There are two very prominent scenes in the movie, one taking place inside a car and another on foot amidst a large battle, that were executed beautifully. The car scene employed a camera system inside the car that could swivel around and even traverse through the front windshield. This scene was also filmed in one uncut shot. The other employed a hand cam system that followed Clive Owen's character through city streets, through an apartment building, and back out using only 5-6 cuts. Did I neglect to mention that both of them were choreographically rich and employed approximately 20 and 50 actors respectively? Scenes of this magnitude are never technically sound without the use of major cutting, so I again congratulate Cuarón for his virtuosity.<br/><br/>While most of my praises were for the technical aspects of the film, the movie, as a whole, was excellent. The plot was very conventional, but enriched by the diverse cast of characters. Michael Caine as a strawberry pot smoking neo-hippie will always stand out in my mind. Peter Mullan as Syd brings a cheeky sense of humor as a corrupt internment camp officer. Clive Owen did a good job mixing dramatic and thriller/action acting, which he can probably chalk up to his roles in Closer, Sin City and even possibly BMW Films' The Hire (although I'm probably reaching out here).<br/><br/>In the end, I was very satisfied with the movie. It felt similar while still being completely new. To that end, I'm really interested in what Cuarón has to offer next."

"Dinner_Jacket","8","3","5","6 January 2007"," Great movie! A must see!
","Excellent movie. There are very few bad things I can say about this movie.<br/><br/>Brief Summary on the movie.<br/><br/>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD (minor if any)* Children of Men is set in a bleak post-apocalyptic world where women can no longer procreate. This movie takes place in London, which has become a sort of fascist ruled state, having a strict no immigration policy. All immigrants are treated quite harshly and given little or not rights. A terrorist group known as the Fishes (which fight for equal human rights for immigrants) are attempting to transport the pregnant woman, Kii, to the Human Project.<br/><br/>*END (potential) SPOILERS* The casting is excellent. Clive Owen gives an outstanding performance as a former activist soon to become deeply involved in aiding the first pregnant woman in 18 years. With other supporting actresses/actors such as Julian Moore and Michael Caine, you already know that whatever you end up thinking of the movie, the acting is still top notch. Music is well done and/or well chosen, with several songs that help suit the mood. The atmosphere of this movie was extremely well done (as in my opinion, it seems quite the task to create such a bleak world, and have actors convey a convincing disillusioned state at the fact that humans can no longer procreate).<br/><br/>Children of Men offers a high tension, high suspense thrill ride coupled with immensely engrossing and well done action scenes that could be described for lack of better words as ""meaningful"". This movie steps above the bar set by typical action movies (involving often pointless action scenes with underdeveloped characters) and keeps you wanting more. Characters are easy to attach to (or easy to hate, depending), allowing you to almost feel what they feel in a sense. A highly recommendable film, as long as you don't mind movies of a bleak nature.<br/><br/>Also! This movie could easily be compared to the popular computer game Half-Life 2, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Enjoy the movie! Well worth the admission fee. :) 8/10"

","Children of men is an epic tale based in a world where humans cannot reproduce. Over all the movie was great. Great plot. Some humor, a lot of violence.

Now when Faron and his cousin are talking over dinner, in the background behind Faron's cousin, is a floating pig. It took me a few seconds to realize what I was looking at. The smokestacks gave it away. It's the inside view of the factory on the cover of the ""Pink Floyd"" album ""Animals""! On the cover there is a factory with several smokestacks, between two is a floating pig. Very clever.

","I must say, I had high expectations going in for Children of Men. Finally, yesterday,it was released and I could go see it (today). It certainly exceeded any expectations I had. The movie flowed very well, and I did not see a single dull moment. The pace and cinematography combined to make this a truly amazing cinematic effort. Everything from the blood on the lens to the long shot made the end sequence excellent and one of the best action sequences I've ever seen. There isn't much that I can say for the acting except that it was superb. Clive Owen was remarkable in capturing the role of Theo, but I must say Michael Caine stole the show every time he was on screen, even down to his final words. The film was very meaningful to me because it was about one man, thrust into an impossible situation, who did everything within his power to fight for this cause. Cuaron's direction leads this film to a place few have gone before. It is captivating, enthralling, and intense all at the same time. It took me through a wide range of emotions. The journey was part of the experience, and I felt like I was with Theo and Kee at many times. I thought the whole experience was one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in a long time (this coming from a die hard Departed fan). I can say that Children of Men tops The Departed for me. Children of Men is my top for 2006 if it still counts as a 2006 film. If not, it certainly will hold strong against 2007 competition I strongly believe.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to all people who are looking for a film about believing in something. It is a great achievement and is definitely going in my Top 10 or 20 films (not quite sure yet).<br/><br/>If you have any hesitation about this film, put it aside and prepare for a unique and amazing movie.<br/><br/>10/10"
"dflatin","8","3","5","5 January 2007"," A grim future
","Children of Men portrays a grim future in a classic science fiction tale where the veneer of civilization is peeled back and raw humanity is exposed. The film is unsentimental and true to its premise. Clive Owen was especially effective in his role as an ""everyman"" caught up in events. Michael Cain played a great supporting role. And the music was a blast from the past. This being a near future context, the dates seemed a little off, appearing to place the targeted release date of the movie more at about 2003 than 2007. This is, of course, a problem for all sci-fi stories set in the near future. There were times where I thought the editing could have been tighter, but overall I think this is the next great classic sci-fi offering in movies."

Barron waste land of black (or red Mars-like) dirt & half burnt buildings ***or*** flying cars, cyborgs, robot servants, etc.<br/><br/>This film was surprisingly believable. The story was told as if evolution COULD prevent fertility of humans in the very near future due to our experiments, corruptions and short-cuts to solution. Some may see the movie as political - any war/end-of-the-world movie would be. It was almost like a movie outlining the consequences of our actions due to those who trying to prolong life, create life that isn't intended to be, and alter life from its natural state. Like God's punishment to our evil. That's the basic point of many movies made but it's been a long time since I've seen one delivered quite as well as this one. It ended up being more of a war movie than a sci-fi flick. Very dramatic and even spiritual in more than one scene.<br/><br/>I wasn't fully satisfied with the ending but it still was better than I anticipated. As my husband said, it almost made it seem as if there was going to be a sequel (I hope not though because it would probably ruin the philosophical flow of it all. Almost like what the Matrix 2nd & 3rd movies did for the first). We were left to wonder whether or not mom & baby were really going to be protected as they tried so hard to get to a safe place. BUT if it ended up happy & ""la-dee-da"" then that could have made the ending corny, which then would have ruined it all."

","Not quite science-fiction as much as a hypothetical view of what the world might turn into under extreme circumstances, Alfonso Cuarón's grim, stark vision of the future is one of the most amazing and original films of its kind.<br/><br/>The origins of ""Children of Men"" lie in P.D. James' novel of the same name, but it's clearly Alfonso Cuarón's vision of the future, a hyper-exaggerated view of today's world, transposed onto a grim world where humanity's last generation is on the verge of extinction due to their inability to procreate. . It's not the shiny future with flying cars we've seen so many times, instead being a grimier version of England today that falls somewhere between Stanley Kubrick and Terry Gilliam's ""12 Monkeys,"" humanity having given up hope on evolution or technological advances at this point.<br/><br/>This movie gives off a eerie effect of that this is the future in store for mankind. I recommend this to anyone."

The acting in this was second to none, and could have been portrayed differently, and still managing to get the message across.

How can one take a wonderful cast like this and make such a crappy movie? There is no story set-up and no explanation of anything that happens. It would be nice to know who some of the people are and how they are connected. The hippie mentality that enjoys this (ahem) 'film' might be the thing that drives the publicity. There is liberal propaganda galore and, naturally, anything that remotely seems right is horrible. I often wonder why the libs only see the future as grey, smoke-filled, and horrible.

"cmurphy8689","1","8","20","21 May 2007"," Left-wing propaganda
","This movie was mostly modern-day left wing propaganda. The previews gave me the impression that this was going to be fun and creative. However, it was neither. There are several layers of religious bigotry (that's bigotry against religion), along with views that if women stop having the ability to have babies, somehow most white Britons would become extremely racist and hateful. There were several themes from today, like illegal immigration and homeland security, which were taken to Hitler like extremes. Illegal aliens were carted away in buses similar to what happened during the holocaust. The idea that people that support tough borders and the deportation of ILLEGAL aliens are racist and would have it announced every five minutes over loudspeakers that illegal aliens must be deported is really an ignorant view of the true motives of people to the political right. This was really a hateful film. The idea that there will be a people in 20 years who want to target innocent Muslims, send illegal aliens to death camps and nuke anyone who is not like them seems very close to how extreme left-wingers view the right today. The movie even suggest that this all started back in 2008, and with the use of images in the background makes a connection to the current President of the U.S., George Bush.<br/><br/>Occasionally we watch politically charged movies, but can at least find some bit of creativity that allows us to look beyond a certain bias. This movie had no redeeming qualities, certainly no creativity. Go to the streets of Portland Oregon during an anti-war demonstration and you'll hear all the themes and conspiracies of this movie and then some. Take notes, make a movie of the conspiracies and you too can have a movie just like Children of Men."

"paul-2644","4","10","27","4 October 2006"," Not that good
","First the positives. Clive Owen has established himself as a class act and continues to deliver. Michael Caine is superb as Jasper and Claire Hope is excellent as Kee. Chiwetel Ejiofor continues to give varied and excellent performances and shines as the zealot Luke. Unfortunately, Pam Ferris, as Miriam, gave an atrocious performance as though the dreadlocks were a stapled on attitude. She reminded me of Neil from the Young Ones in her comical pronouncements.<br/><br/>Some of the imagery and cinematography was good but was also one of the downfalls of the picture for me. The Pink Pig over Battersea may bring a smile but really was too much.<br/><br/>The car driving down the country road past the unrecognisable creature next to the effluent drain with a horizon of smoke belching chimneys really summed up this film in that it rammed home a right on message. It often tried too hard.<br/><br/>Many have commented on the realistic and believable nature of this near future. It just made me shake my head.<br/><br/>This was a premise film (what would a world that was sterile be like?) and it had no convincing story to carry this premise. In fact, quite ironically, the world we discover is not sterile. There are no explanations as to why the world went sterile in the first place, beyond a curse from God, and we find that it is in fact not sterile as Kee is having a baby. What sets her apart? Nothing it seems. So we must conclude that all over the world there are other Kees.<br/><br/>There are a host of other issues force fed to us: environmentalism, nationalism, treatment of illegal immigrants - but it is all in your face and tabloid. This film tries too hard to be right on without have a narrative to speak of, beyond the single journey of woman with a baby and a reluctant hero to end up is a dinghy being picked up by some enigmatic last hope organisation.<br/><br/>So to conclude. Some great acting, some good set pieces and camera work but a dire script and poorly conceived shovel fed moralistic stance."

","I was having a glance through the top rated sci-fi (turns out this isn't sci-fi in any way actually) movies here on IMDb to find something good to spend a couple of hours on. This had a very high score, and the premise of global infertility intrigued me. I read a few reviews and it sounded solid.<br/><br/>After considering some of them again after actually seeing this abortion of a movie, I've concluded that the ONLY answer to such a high number of beaming reviews with 9 and 10 stars is vote fraud by the studio. I'm not the only one who thought the same after watching this one. Check some of the other ""hated it"" reviews. Many of them believe the same.<br/><br/>There have been times when I have suspected this in the past, but thought I was just being paranoid. Well, this one leaves me with no doubt that it happens. IMDb, please do something to fix this. This is the fourth movie in a row I've watched after seeing it in the top 250 that has turned out to be COMPLETE crap. What's going on?? This is easily the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune of viewing.<br/><br/>There is NO discernible plot, and I mean that. It's nothing but contrived dialog to take us from one dreary scene to the next. Literally nothing that is happening has any reason or explanation. The acting is high-school drama class level from nearly everyone. There is not one likable character. Hell, the first line spoken by the supposed savior of humanity (how is she that again?? never explained.) was ""what the f*ck are you staring at?"" Garbage from beginning to end.<br/><br/>What annoyed me the most is that the interesting premise of this global infertility is COMPLETELY unexplained. The ONLY way it is addressed in the film is establishing that it exists. Nobody has the slightly clue why, and figuring it out is never pursued by anybody. This is the result of nothing but lazy writing. They didn't even care about this supposed premise.<br/><br/>Avoid, avoid, AVOID!!! The IMDb score is mind-bendingly unbelievable."

The story is flat, not convincing and leaves me wondering in how far humankind might be saved just because one woman manages to get pregnant. Also I did not like the obvious comparison to the Jesus story (one guy is the Savior, couple on the run etc.). Also kind of a shame to make a movie that plays at around 2030 and then go ahead and take cars like the Renault Avantime (or Fiat Multipla?) and put some cardboard around it to fake a ""futuristic"" car.

The movie is too stretchy and too boring in parts. There's nothing much happening for much of a time and it crawls at moments. Some moments are good but they only make it an average flick not the one to make you stand in appreciation. Most of the part I was skipping frames. Clive Owen did a nice job.

"zwirnm","6","4","8","14 July 2007"," High expectations dwindle over the course of the film
","Children of Men got a great deal of attention last year for its bleak portrait of a future Britain after a catastrophic epidemic has caused the sterility of every woman on the planet  but the attention was mostly for the political allegories embodied in the plot: roundups of illegal immigrants, refugee camps, a country ruled by the national security state, looming ecological crisis. The fact that the director was Alfonso Cuarón (Y Tu Mamá Tambien, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) brought the film even more attention. But seeing the film left me ultimately frustrated; my expectations were high at the beginning but dwindled over the course of the playing time.<br/><br/>The opening is positively enthralling  horrific, but enthralling. Simply becoming immersed in a society contemplating the future extinction of its species, and the political response to increasing hysteria, pretty much guarantees that you'll be compelled to watch. The story itself fades in comparison, despite strong roles by Clive Owen and Michael Caine. Julianne Moore has a surprising role as a leader in an underground organization that may be a terror group, but may also represent humanity's best hope for survival. The political allegory turns into a run-and-chase film, and then a bloody massacre in a squalid apartment block that looks like a cross between Gaza City and the Brixton of the 1970s. The ultimate scene takes the film in a mystical direction that I found unpersuasive.<br/><br/>Without giving away the plot points, I'll just say that I found the set design, cinematography, and sound direction enthralling (check out the Spanish-language version of ""Ruby Tuesday""), but the story left me wanting more."

","In a world with no future for mankind, what's the point? Of working, of peace, of living out your days? Even the audience cannot help but be gripped by this fundamental dilemma, so skillful is the manner in which movie-goers are drawn into the world of 2027.<br/><br/>In fact, the extraordinarily three-dimensional and relevant setting is the film's greatest strength. Down to the details, each piece of the environment displays a moribund hopelessness which immediately draws the audience into its bleak atmosphere. The audience members know they are, of course, the very people living in this miserable London of the near future. This is our world, when we are just a few years older. The crushing closeness of the setting to our own reality makes this film a breathlessly intense ride.<br/><br/>Brilliant cinematography (there are more than a few shots that resemble perfectly-composed photographs) and fantastic casting choices (Michael Caine makes the ideal fatherly hippie) makes this a wonderfully well-crafted film. And while there are clearly metaphorical overtones throughout, the director is careful not to overdo it, or to impart too much information that is not truly relevant to the story.<br/><br/>This film would have been able to hold its own against literary classics like 1984 or Brave New World if only the second half of the movie had been as strong in plot as the first half. Unfortunately, the end of the movie degenerates into an irritatingly generic battle-zone escape sequence, as if a shortage of plot development was filled in with a gluttony of guns. The only moderately satisfying ending does nothing to save the latter half of the movie.<br/><br/>As a whole, this is a movie to see and perhaps to continue musing on for several days afterwards. It would certainly not be appropriate for anyone too young for 'Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's list. But for an adult looking for a film that will expertly seize your breath as well as giving you something to talk about on the way home, Children of Men is highly recommended."

Within one hundred years there will not be a human left alive on the face of the Earth. The world has responded by falling into chaos, for without children what is there to look to? There is no future. On the verge of collapse, itself, Britain regresses into an almost fascist state, where immigrants (called fuge's (fugitive) are persecuted and removed from the cities to fenced in immigration (read concentration?) zones. <br/><br/>The director gives us a believable and beautifully (as in starkly) realised representation for this story to occur. I think the main plus of this film is how well the reality in which this occurs has been defined, obviously this is vitally important to accept this films central premise. Another plus I found were the lead actors, who all performed brilliantly. Some insane escape/fight scenes which truly leave you on the edge of your seat up the ante and ""make"" the film for me.<br/><br/>There are however some negatives; Some of the acting from the supporting cast is pretty abysmal, at times I felt like I was watching a play put on by amateurs at my local pub. While the story makes sense throughout I did find the end wanting a little. I felt that we are left with too many questions unresolved. I understand that this is adapted from a book, which I have not yet read, but I must assume that the ending is left intact. So my main problem may not be with the film, but rather the story, which I felt would have appeased me more with more exposition about the organisation that the lead characters are primarily concerned with.<br/><br/>So a good film, amazing action sequences but the story letting me down a little in the end.<br/><br/>Overall I'd give it a 7/10"

Thought provoking? Neither.</li></ul><br/><br/>Second, nothing happens in this movie. From opening to close, you see the same thing over and over again. They go from one angry mob to another angry mob; from one house to another house. Even then, the pacing is so ridiculously slow I was ready to fast forward because all that was happening was Napoleon Dynamite-like staring. Or pointless conversations. Or just downright NOTHING, where the camera will literally sit and stare at a wall. Children of Men took boredom to a whole new level I didn't even know existed.<br/><br/><ul><li>Thrilling? If shots of the wall and lame conversations thrill you, you'll have gone in your pants 15 minutes in.</li></ul><br/><br/>As far as technical details go: there was not even half of enough violence to earn this movie an R-rating. The cinematography is hand-held and it adds a layer of realism. This realism, however, just makes the movie even more dull and boring because it's exactly like what you could walk outside your house and see. It gives you even less of an excuse to pay attention. What Hollywood and indie filmmakers both don't understand is that what America wants isn't just another so-real-it's-scary thriller, we want something we can't walk outside our own houses and see. A mature fantasy, if you will. Why do you think 300 did so well, while this movie failed? Because 300 was a mature fantasy, while this is just another tired ""thriller"" that doesn't even have enough wind to thrill or enough intelligence to be original.<br/><br/>I just can't get over the fact that nothing happened in the entire runtime of this movie. That's why I gave it such a low score. The screenplay couldn't have been longer than 20 pages, because the scenes were long but there was nothing happening in them. Sure, it had a cute and different way to end humanity, but the story is so thin the average person could have thought of every detail of this movie in a coma.<br/><br/>I think it's movies like this that make me think originality is dead, not your big-name blockbusters. Blockbusters have expectations they have to match, but it's a sad day when indie films like this can't even think of something more original than this. What's even sadder is people like you try to build it up as intellectual and amazing instead of lowering your standards so something truly original and mind-blowing can have a chance to be released. The public opinion sells, and I guess this is what everyone wants: a hideously unoriginal film that claims to be intellectual but in reality is nothing more than a paper-thin plot with paper-thin characters and less thrills than a stroll down your street.<br/><br/>It's your call.<br/><br/>0/10"

","I'm nearly at a loss for words.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" took my breath away with the sheer visual audacity of its storytelling and the deep strength of feeling contained in it. Alfonso Cuaron, adding his voice to the many other directors who have made post-9/11 films about the grim state of a world governed by terror and hopelessness, has given us one of the most memorable and dramatically satisfying films I've seen in a long, long time.<br/><br/>Much ballyhoo has greeted the trio of Mexican directors who released films this year, and people have been wetting themselves over Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's ""Babel"" and especially Guillermo Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth."" ""Children of Men"" blows both of these films off the map. Cuaron's world view seems to be as grim as his compatriots, but unlike Innaritu and Del Toro, Cuaron seems to think that the world in which we live is worth saving and uses his movie to deliver a practical message of hope that resonates in the here and now. ""Children of Men"" is the most uplifting downer I think I've ever seen, and the long scene in which a small, crying baby temporarily halts the warfare and carnage taking place around it, for one instant uniting enemies in the wonder and glory of new life, reduced this viewer to tears (and I don't cry easily at movies).<br/><br/>Cuaron's visual style is absolutely stunning. He creates a meticulously detailed vision of a nightmare future that is all the more horrifying for its plausibility. And there are a couple of extended set pieces (I'm thinking most notably of the one in which a car containing our hero, Clive Owen, and a group of activists/terrorists is attacked by an angry mob, the entire scene filmed in one long take by a camera that never leaves the car) that astounded me with their showmanship. And yet, for all of its directorial panache, I never felt that style overwhelmed substance -- Cuaron ably and completely welds style to subject in such a way that his approach always perfectly serves the story he's telling without drawing attention to itself.<br/><br/>I think it's very interesting that the end of this film is inspiring so much debate, and that different people have completely opposite readings of it. Some think it's dismally depressing, lacking in any sign of hope. Others think it's optimistic, the happiest ending possible in such a dystopian work of fiction. I believe the ambiguity is intentional on Cuaron's part, and I personally came away exhilarated by the powerful message of hope, and a reinforcement of the belief that there will always be good people willing to do good things for others in the belief that the world can change for the better. Maybe I read into the ending what I wanted to read into it, but maybe that's the point. Perhaps those who think this movie has nothing to say have given up already on the state of the world, while those of us who find in it a happy ending are those who will continue to refuse to accept that a world governed by panic and fear is acceptable.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" makes a nice companion piece to this year's ""Little Children,"" another downer that ended up being one of the biggest feel-good movies of the year for me. It's so refreshing to find that there are directors who want to do more than simply wallow in gloominess, and actually offer solutions even as they highlight problems.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","By 2009, the world has become infertile. Is it pollution? Nuclear fallout? The hand of God? No one knows, but as of 2027 no child has been born and the world is falling into disarray. This movie follows one man (Theo) on his journey with Kee, a woman who may be the hope for the world's future. Will humans be born again or is this the slow end? This film is so full of social commentary, but it's done in an artistic and powerful way. Maybe not a subtle way, as they prominently feature Homeland Security, immigration crackdowns and even a man with a hood over his head forced to stand with electrodes on his hands (a now iconic image of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq). How does the government handle crises and crack down on dissidence? Maybe not to this extreme in real life, but then again some would say this is where we're headed.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is amazing as the everyman (albeit more a hero than most would be). Michael Caine is also good, though I think he tried too hard to be John Lennon. The character of Kee is most fascinating, and people have pointed out how her name sounds like ""key"" (the key to the future of humanity) and ""chi"" (an Asian word meaning, basically, ""life force""). I have to assume this was intentional, just as Theo's name must be (meaning ""god""). What's surprising to me is how well they kept the religious aspects minimized. While they are important to the plot, they're always in the background. Compare this to ""The Mist"" where religious fanaticism takes center stage and become obnoxious (and it's not long before an obnoxious character makes a film itself obnoxious).<br/><br/>Dystopian films tend to be well-made, and this is no exception. The director took great pains to get long shots filmed (some going over six minutes straight) and the use of the hand-held really added to the feeling of being embedded in a world of war and violence. Do not pass up on this one. If you only have time to see it once, make sure you see it once. But you may end up wanting to own it for repeated viewings."

I was disappointed by what I felt were two or three crucial points that were never made clear in the end. I know that if you have seen the movie, you know what I mean.

","Impressive as all Hell, at least from the standpoint of direction. There are a couple of long takes that are just about the greatest sequences I've ever seen. Cuarón is a master of putting the audience in the middle of the action. I've never felt more like I was in a war zone before. The collapse of society has never been more vividly depicted. However (and I hate to say ""however"" when there's so much to be amazed at), I didn't absolutely love the movie. It creates a frightening world, but the story that goes along with it is not equal to the creation. It's decent, but nothing fantastic. And the characters weren't especially great, either. Only Clive Owen gives a notable performance, and he was even better in Inside Man. I also thought that exposition in the film was handled clumsily. How many left to right tracking shots do we need of photographs and newspaper headlines? Every time Cuarón wants to tell us something about a new character, or explicate something that has happened in the past, that's how he does it. Okay, despite some complaints, which I guess are major but I was too impressed to care too much, this is still one of the best of the year."

","Children of Men grabs you by the neck and keeps you watching through a harrowing hour and 40 minutes. It's evocative of Orwell's 1984, with a bit of Terry Gilliam's Brazil (sans the humor).<br/><br/>Based on the 1992 book by P.D. James, the story takes place in a dystopian 2027 Great Britain in which fertility has vanished from the human race. There are no babies or children, and the youngest person on the planet, age 18, has just been killed. All the major cities in the world except London have been decimated. The streets of London are battle-torn--terrorists, warring factions, the military--and it's barely safe to walk down the street.
At the same time, illegal immigrants are being rounded up and put in pens like animals (sound familiar in 2019?).<br/><br/>Miraculously, a young woman turns up pregnant, and various political factions want her and her baby. Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a London white collar worker, is contacted by his ex-wife (Julian (Julianne Moore) to help the young woman escape the war-torn country and find safe haven on a ship called Tomorrow.<br/><br/>Very little is explained in this film; it's all about the escape. Along the way, we meet Theo's friend Jasper (Michael Caine in a phenomenal performance) and several other characters who assist him (or turn out to be betrayers).<br/><br/>The cinematography is astounding, with many long, uninterrupted shots, ala Hitchcock. I'm having a hard time thinking of a movie that has better camera work. You can't avert your eyes.<br/><br/>The plot is somewhat elusive, with very little backstory, but director Alfonso Cuaron has wisely chosen to make this a visceral rather than a 'logical' film. He succeeds in captivating us.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films of 2006, with a high budget ($76 million), but it lost money because it was not well-promoted. Too far over the average Hollywood-brainwashed moviegoers' heads, I suppose.<br/><br/>Quit watching mainstream Hollywood garbage and seek out gems like this one. You will be rewarded."

The other players including Ms Moore are with the programme and the scenery is dark South London plus West Sussex doubling for Surrey (guess). I won't put spoilers here as I had seen none before I saw this. It comes under Sci Fi as set in the future but it tries effectively to project a world only 20 years ahead and is believable, no lasers, no space ships, no time travel, it portrays a violent world but one not unbelievable which adds to the effect which may be good or bad.

At times the camera movements feel almost found footage but it is done in a way that makes you feel like part of what is going on without the nausea some people feel from the form of film-making. The cinematography also perfectly encapsulates the ruined dystopian future these characters are a part of. The plot and story telling is the only area that I fault this movie. The premise is very interesting but many things are not explained as well as they could such as where they are going, how the infertility came to be, and the uprising.

"FilmMuscle","9","2","3","7 October 2013"," A Rare Accomplishment in Film
","Though I have already seen Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men prior to Thursday's viewing, I came to the realization that to truly appreciate the film's level of depth requires one to witness the picture multiple times and more. Before digging deep into the bowels of its impeccable technical aspect, I can't help but applaud the movie's fresh concept and setting where it presents a bleak and depressing future in which fertility is basically nonexistent assumingly due to humanity's irresponsible behavior towards the earth and our pursuit of self- interests. Clearly, the air lacks any pureness or freshness, and thus, it leaves us in a dystopian environment. There is absolutely nothing joyful in the film's content as you're forced to view sheer misery, hopelessness, and suffering. The world will never be the same, but the script occasionally allows for little humorous bits as if to indicate that happiness is still possible, and that some form of hope, whether miniscule or large, still remains where a smile can yet be sighted on a poor man's face. <br/><br/>Now, let's delve into the cinematography and mis-en-scene, specifically. One of the film's well-known and incredibly impressive traits is its use of unusually lengthy shots, and in a way, such a feat definitely revolutionized the way filmmakers shoot. Normally, film stock wouldn't allow for such duration, but even then, to film that long of a shot is unbelievably difficult, especially the way Cuaron engages it. For instance, there's a scene where we see the car (holding Theo, Luke, Julian, Joy, and Mirriam) proceeding through the woods and awaiting potential conflict as a burning car blockades their escape. Remarkably, that entire scene acts as one single shot, and a tamer film could use such extended shots in a much easier manner, but the greatest factor which makes this long-lasting shot/scene so amazing is the amount of events that transpire during its span: you see hundreds of people running towards their position, a burning car sliding down the hill, a motorcycle's spinning out of control, two cops being eliminated, and an important character unfortunately meeting a brutal death. In another scene, I marveled, scratched my head, and wondered how they could possibly pull off a whole graphic pregnancy scene in one single shot, descriptively capturing the baby's birth with the umbilical cord still connected and the baby covered in vernix and fluid. Were substantial CGI effects used- was the baby digitally recreated? <br/><br/>In regards to the mis-en-scene, the amount of effort extinguished into creating this disconsolate world is simply astonishing to an observant moviegoer; the filmmakers made sure to dirty up every corner and subtly mask every detail with a gloomy appearance. As a whole in its look and thematic material, the project is unquestionably ambitious and determined. On another significant note, Cuaron and his colleagues showcase extraordinary attention to detail in the film's subtlety when pertaining to the plot, themes, and overall progression. Green seems to be a recurring color throughout in a world otherwise infested with complete darkness or grayness (depends on the way you look at it), and in the world of literature, the color green represents hope, life, fertility, etc, and with that, every glance at a fresh tree or flowers reconstitutes hope and that potentiality of new life in a distant future. <br/><br/>Also, the film is seemingly riddled with biblical references. Theo starts his perilous journey as just a normal citizen being cast into a predicament, and there's a scene midway where Theo decides to supply his feet with sandals. The filmmakers could've written the scene so that Theo luckily discovers some standard sneakers or other footwear, but they go along with sandals. Immediately, this brings upon some religious imagery when recalling Jesus Christ's famous footwear. Before Theo comfortably fits the sandals for his feet, he noticeably sighs as if to give the impression that he's not prepared- in the slightest- for the journey he's about to embark on, but at that moment, he has no choice but to undertake a Christ-like path. And then at the very end, his death acts as a sacrifice for the hope of new life and happiness, again reestablishing Christian symbolism. With all that being said, Children of Men is doubtlessly a rare accomplishment in film- one that will continuously be studied down the line and hopefully become a classic that we revisit over and over again, uncovering something additional every time."

This is why I go to movies! ""Children of Men"" is why you should go to movies! It is intense, it is surreal and I felt like I was in the movie the entire time. It felt like I was on a roller coaster. I know a lot of critics and reviewers say cliché things like ""It's a roller coaster ride!"" Yes, it really is!!! I felt kinda out of it afterwards- like I did when I got off the ""Superman"" ride at Great America this past summer. I had a minor headache after the movie was over- I'm not sure if this helps endorse ""Children of Men"", but I felt like I was Clive Owen running through a bombed out town. This is a movie that is more than enhanced by the theater experience! I'm not going to get into what this movie is about, because anyone reading this should just go see it and trust me. Watching it on DVD will not do it justice. I was not a film major in college (I chose radio, maybe I should have went with film) but I know this movie looks like few before it. ""Children of Men"" has an unbelievable quality about its filming. The cinematography in it is second to none.<br/><br/>Before I get to hung up on the visual greatness of this film, the cast is equally great. Clive Owen is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. Owen reminds me of Harrison Ford in ""Blade Runner"" in this futuristic masterpiece about an era where women become infertile and Owen has to protect a refugee who has done the unthinkable- become pregnant! Julianne Moore and Michael Caine give outstanding supporting performances as well. Caine plays a weed-smoking hippie who assists Owen in hiding the pregnant refugee. Can not go on with out giving mad props to director Alfonso Cuaron. I don't know much about him, but I will watch anything he is involved with after seeing his outstanding epic. Bottom line- Go see this movie!!! I'm tempted to re-do my best of 2006 list and put it number one or two. ""Children of Men"" is the best movie I've seen since ""The Departed"" and I hope everyone who enjoys a good story and loves great cinematography, will come away feeling like they just walked out of a bomb shelter and feel glad they did.

It propels the viewer right into the story (leaving clueless critics lamenting the ""glossing over of many of the specifics"" as they remain grotesquely obtuse to the clarity of the film's situation and the value of mystery and pace in a good story), but dwells on quiet and poignant angles and moments to reach into the deepest reservoirs of storytelling about our times. <br/><br/>Just take one scene: the protagonist Theo (Clive Owen), fleeing the revolutionaries who had been his accomplices, works at finding a pair of shoes in the home of his friend Jasper (Michael Caine) and then happens upon a conversation between his fellow travelers and Jasper. He stays hidden on the other side of the room, and Alfonso Cuaron uses the entire space of the screen to tell Theo's story and his solitude; the lighting and mise en scène of the camera are nothing short of brilliant. The ensuing reels of film are among the most compelling and wrenching that I've ever witnessed; both my wife and I were brought to tears by the intensity of this film, and this almost never happens these days. <br/><br/>So we flip in the DVD: oh, yeah, another movie.

Its premise is that there haven't been any human births for 18 years and suddenly a pregnant woman appears. If you ignore that, it is all a chase film in a world dreamed by Bush. Corrupt government on one side, terrorists on the other and all the smart and compassionate people in the middle.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it was very well done, dark but not overly dramatic, desperate but not hysterical, heroic but not explosive. I mean, I can hardly believe Clive Owen went by all those discarded weapons and didn't pick one, didn't kill anyone, didn't even properly punch a guy. The only real fight scene he was in, he was saved by the Romanian woman :) The atmosphere was great and for that I mark it high. You want to watch this."
"za-andres","9","2","3","14 March 2007"," A rare futuristic thriller: grim in its scenario, yet exhilarating in its technique.
","There are many things that happen in our future: for those technological buffs out there, there will be large hi-def T.V screens and sophisticated wireless devices. But on the not so shinny side, and for those present day future predictors, women will become infertile, and eventually we will all vanish from Earth. It's difficult to establish such a premise in 114 minutes, and Cuarón happens to know this. So what he creates is more of a preview of it. Despite its astute sympathy for what-if film lovers, ""Children of Men"" does work, and rather effectively.<br/><br/>It's 2027, women are infertile, death comes everyday, migrants are a complex deal, rebellions arise all over the world, and there is a suicide drug named ""Quietus."" Motto: ""You decide when."" Shelled by the excellent Clive Owen as Theo, a lazy and mundane man who has lost his son to, yes, a flu pandemic in 2008. His first portrayal is a scene in which he is walking into a coffee shop, -the youngest person in the world, age 18, has just died- buying a usual cup of coffee, and putting a sip of rum in it. An instant later, an explosion. It nearly kills him. Cuarón lays clues and evidence all over the film, especially through vivid examples of people, mostly illegal immigrants, being locked up on the street, and random, but important advertisements. Theo really doesn't care much about the world, that is, until his ex-wife (Moore with no English accent), the leader of pro-immigrant rebels, presses him into retrieving a pair of illegal travel passes in the hopes of reaching a group of much-rumored, never-confirmed off-shore scientists called The Human Project. Their motives, tied to the well-being of a young immigrant (Claire-Hope Ashitey), will soon become clear, but only after the cost of failure has been made equally clear. Kee, played by Ashitey, is visibly pregnant, and after a serious of insolent truths about the rebels themselves, Theo is now bound to help Kee. They set off, and eventually reach their destination, which marks the end of the film.<br/><br/>Cuarón's graceful camera, the movement of characters across the frame, and the magnificent acting collectively evoke a genial sense of place. But while the film's exo-skeleton is a memorable and vivid one, the film does have its minor narrative flaws. But what ultimately saves the film from darkness (just imagine if it were Ridley Scott) is Cuarón himself. Without overemphasis, Cuarón beautifully bends gritty realistic scenes and predictable ones to his own canon; he changes the rules of the game, and he is very well aware that only he can do such a thing in a film with a what-if standpoint. He includes mettlesome action scenes (all which are masterfully detailed) with exuberant dialogue, and we truly realize what an brilliant director he is. While ""Children of Men"" is not his best film, his diversified directing is fluently proved in this piece work. His previous works, including the terrific ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", have all spanned from drama to fantasy, and all over again with this rare and futuristic film.<br/><br/>There is a striking scene late in the film, after a serious of some major 'bam bams' and deaths, where Theo tries to find the newly-born infant that Kee had unwillingly exerted out of her young abdomen the night before. Everything but the young baby's cries fill the screen. He soon finds her, and he brings Kee along with the baby out of the decrepit building which they were using as shelter. Soldiers cease fire. People hold out there arms and cry. They all forget why they are fighting, and if there is any cause for it in the first place. It is evident that Cuarón has a gift only the greatest filmmakers share: he makes you believe."
"Monkeyman_Jon","8","2","3","13 March 2007"," Shook me up bad
","Women are no longer able to bare children. Thus, the age of man is ending, and the world is in chaos. But then, as the world is grieving over the loss of the youngest person alive, a miracle! A woman is pregnant for the first time in decades, and it is for our protagonist, Clive Owen, to take her away from the city to a sanctuary island in the Azors.<br/><br/>'Children Of Men' really is one of those movies that I try to avoid. You know, the kind of movie that, even as you are watching it, makes you feel bad and somewhat uneasy, and after leaving the theater, and those anxious feelings starts sinking in, you feel even worse.<br/><br/>The story, based on a P.D. James Novell, is quite simple, viewed from a thriller-movie-perspective. Owen and the girl are pretty much being chased through out the entire movie, but then, it is not that part of it that makes me feel the way I feel. It's the mood! It's too real! In this era, of threat of terror, global warming, draining of the oceans and so on, we are (I mean, I am) very perceptive to this sort of a nightmare. We can of course imagine it, the end of the world, as something very far away, but here we are presented to a vision, so near to reality, it is spooky, and the mental image of the future world is no longer that abstract. It is given a face, a setting and an ending.<br/><br/>We are shown a, not very likely, but too real vision of the apocalypse.<br/><br/>But this is such a fantastic movie. So well executed. Apart from the story and the great performances by the cast, the cinematography is just mind blowing. The shots are long, tight and sweaty - not very far from the work of Janusz Kaminski's in 'Saving Private Ryan' - and combined with the editing, the environments (where was this shot?), the sound track and the directing it is so striking, it shook me to the very bone.<br/><br/>So see it if you're up for some hard thinking and bad sleep. It will be worth it, but any way."
"Cineanalyst","10","1","1","21 May 2020"," Death and Rebirth on Film
","No other film, perhaps, better captures the seemingly miraculous than ""Children of Men."" The power of it is in taking the most everyday occurrence in living history of childbirth. The depiction of a future dystopia is subtly reflexive, of film as itself a process of death (still images of the once moving and living) and rebirth (as projected moving images) and accentuated by the rise of digital cinema, as motion pictures went through its own process of the death of film, reborn as something different and new digitally. The filming of ""Children of Men"" reflects this, too; shot on film, as a few, if continually fewer, pictures even to this day continue to be, it, nonetheless, goes through many of the same digital intermediaries as other films do and before, ultimately, largely being viewed as a digital product, whether by projection in a theatre or at home through disc or streaming. The standout, seemingly long tracking shots here are part of this--combining the power of continual filming, but also largely broken up by sly edits and computer generated imagery. Everything in ""Children of Men,"" including the sci-fi dystopia set in the near future, is both familiar and novel--futuristic computer screens next to gray looks at long-standing landmarks of London; war and pestilence, religious and political zealotry beside others going about their daily routines; death and life.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""Children of Men,"" then, is a great technical achievement at the least. In a history of the greatest shots and scenes ever in film, the seeming one-shot of the attack on the car here would certainly be worth including, as would the later tracking shot of the blood-splattered camera, which in following, but keeping some distance from, Theo (Clive Owen) becomes something of a character itself--visibly included within the action as marked by blood, sometimes dazed in joining Theo in avoiding the battle surrounding them, but also displaying curiosity by looking around and elsewhere besides him. For pure emotional power, the more conventionally edited-together sequence of the cease fire is remarkable, as well. The shaky, hand-or-body-held camerawork, grit and experimental nature of the cinematography, editing and effects here remain more impressive in a way, too, than similar set-ups, including long framings and trackings, but which are more antiseptic in director Alfonso Cuarón's acclaimed and admittedly-still-spectacular subsequent pictures, ""Gravity"" (2013) and ""Roma"" (2018).<br/><br/>Beyond technical and stylistic bravado, I also love what Cuarón and company did here in underscoring the loss of procreation and by inverting some familiar tropes--all of which goes a long way, too, towards accepting the usual white-male savior plot. In this artfully-created world, the loss of children is highlighted well from the beginning with the news footage of the youngest person in the world's murder. Later, in one of the best such twists since ""Psycho"" (1960), there's the murder of the then-lead female character, who also happens to be played by one of the biggest stars and brightest talents in the business, Julianne Moore. This loss of children is doubled by mentions of the loss of a child to a flu pandemic by Julian (Moore) and Theo. The loss of mothers, and by extension fertility, furthered by another mother figure being comatose. Fathers die, too. Besides that, this is the best use of Michael Caine and his iconic status as the ultimate father figure I've seen outside of a Christopher Nolan feature.<br/><br/>It's all the better that ""Children of Men"" also keeps its distance from religion, especially because of its miraculous content. The funniest line in the otherwise dramatic picture is when Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) jokes of being a virgin, with the obvious allusion being to Mother Mary and the birth of Jesus. Although ironically played by a real-life English actress, Kee's status as a refugee also well exploits the white-savior plot and the anti-immigrant dystopia in the film. That the camera keeps its distance, with few close-ups, and retains some independence from tracking Owen, and that characters aren't overly fleshed out and relied upon offers a greater view of society as a whole. Theo is provided habits of drinking and smoking since losing a child, but, otherwise, specific character details matter less here, as do the ethnic, political and religious battles, as all seems to stem from the shared existential crisis. A smaller inversion that works well, too, is that of the gypsy woman and her rebuking the old trope of them stealing babies.<br/><br/>Tropes inverted, as with all else in ""Children of Men,"" things are familiar but reborn. It's what makes the future dystopia, gray and unflashy, more striking, as a believable extension of the real world (then, in 2006, and perhaps even more so today, as I reviewed it during the real-life pandemic of 2020). It's why the filmic metaphor of life-death-and-rebirth, especially in the age of transitioning from film to digital cinema and effects, is effective. The story of the film is the same as the making of it: ending life to start (again, still images in filmmaking), but through innovation, work, or sexual reproduction, creating life anew. It's why ""Children of Men"" is a miraculous and hopeful picture, as well. People and films ultimately die only when there is no future. The many lost silent films, for instance, vanished because of careless lack of foresight of a future market for them (plus nitrate is inflammable, but that's beside the point). The inclusion of the art collector in the film is a brilliant touch in this respect--of a character collecting famous artworks--Michelangelo's sculpture of ""David"" and Picasso's ""Guernica""--despite the common belief that nobody in the film's world will be alive to appreciate them in 100 years. As long as their are children, there's a future, and great art, including films such as ""Children of Men"" may continue to be appreciated."

The plot is a simple one, life where there is no fertility and the oldest person is 18 and people just seem to have given up, descended into chaos and lost all humanity. The lead Owens is great as Theo, the reluctant hero. Before I started watching I thought he was going to be the action hero type but he is simply just a normal guy, depressed, grieving and just not really sure what's the point. The cinematography is outstanding. It really is just gripping without being a ten out of ten movie.

"TheDonaldofDoom","9","1","1","1 January 2019"," An appeal for humanity
","The message that stayed with me most from ""Children of Men"" is that in this apocalyptic world, seemingly everyone involved, at first, saw baby as a political tool, be it the government or the rebels. That's partly why humanity is in the state that it is in this film, because of the lack of humanity. Just like the British government showed no mercy to the refugees, it seemed no one would see the baby for what it really was: just a baby. But in this deeply depressing world there are glimmers of hope. Men stop fighting to let the mother and her baby pass through. The child brings peace. In the last scene, they are found by the Human Project. It's an oasis of hope, that there really are people in the world that are dedicated to making it a better place.<br/><br/>Along the way, we see the distressing human cost of Britain's survival. We see the demonization of outsiders through newspaper headlines, the inhuman way they are treated and the terrorism that happens as a result. Although the introduction to this film's world is a bit clumsy and slow, we do see a fair bit. The film is rich in symbolism, most obviously in the iconic pig and power station background but also in the war zone the sense that the baby, like Christ, stopped men from being evil, if only for a short while. Many moments ground us in the reality of a world without children, such as the sight of a derelict school with a playground that has been unused for years. While it's not visible straight away, ""Children of Men"" has heart.<br/><br/>It's the war zone sequence that this film is most known for, and rightly so. It's the most powerful part of the film, intense in its impact. With Cuaron's signature long shot we experience the violence in a more realistic way than we are used to in film. I found myself wishing the fighters would just show some kindness, and finally they did. Elsewhere in the film, the long shot is really effectively used in the car chase scene, when the camera simply rotates within the car throughout. In both cases, it makes for an uncomfortably realistic experience watching."

Sequences of the film, including the famous drive-by death scene, horrify and amaze us.. and unfortunately dwindle off back into the forgettable plot. Then, something amazing happens. The final 30 minutes of this film is a cinematic explosion. It's some of the best filmmaking of the past 20 years. Emmanuel Lubezki, quite arguably the finest living cinematographer today, provides a visual experience that conveys a certain kind horror and hopelessness that many films have never achieved. Children of Men is a stunning feat."
"blumdeluxe","9","1","1","2 April 2017"," As depressing as close to reality
","""Children of men"" is one of the few movies that manage to create an image of the future that has proved to be not too far away from how reality could look like. In fact one of the greatest strengths of the film for me is, that it establishes a rough and dirty image of a future world that still has enough in common with reality to make it believable. There are no hover-boards or air-crafts flying around, no stylish future-items or anything, just a degree of progress that you would easily accept. Of course it missed some of the things that actually have established by now but I guess the technical development of the past few years was a very rapid one. Also I find it one of the more believable options of apocalypse that infertility somehow gets common.<br/><br/>Sadly, in some parts the movie is already not too far away from reality nowadays. We do see the strong desire to re-establish nationalism in many countries, including methods like building walls and gathering people to bring them out of country. The general mood towards refugees gets rougher as their numbers increase. I instantly had to think of phenomena like the jungle in Calais and felt strongly reminded.<br/><br/>As for the story it is a solid one, nothing spectacular but it kept me entertained. The characters weren't the deepest ones I've ever seen but neither were they unbearably flat, so I was pretty satisfied. The only thing that I really don't believe is that all of a sudden everybody forgets about the baby and they can escape. I mean it is literally not far away from seeing ghosts in such a situation. You wouldn't just turn around and keep fighting, at least I had wished for a more plausible reason.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, ""children of men"" is an excellent film. If you haven yet to give it a try, do so. It is maybe more current than ever."
"fishza","10","1","1","8 January 2017"," Smart, engaging, brilliant, yet subtle.
","Children of Men is quite possibly one of the best films ever made. There is so much to admire about the film, and way too much to notice in just one watch. One of my absolute favorite things in any given movie is its ability to craft an entire world before your eyes, and no movie quite does this as well as Children of Men. <br/><br/>From the very start we're hearing news stories about the death of important figures, and seeing the state of things in the world around us. There's just so much to see. Alfonso Cuaron takes the audience on an amusement park ride by moving the camera into locations we wouldn't normally go just to get an extra glimpse at the state of the world. We never learn the story of a mother grieving over her dead son, nor do we dive deep into the British propaganda we see scattered in the streets, but that's the beauty of it, all of these things help to create a believable world that's never been done so effectively.<br/><br/>The story we actually follow about Theo Faron trying to transport the first pregnant girl in 18 years to the safety of the fabled Human Project is just as fantastic as the world it takes place in. Theo leaves his boring lifestyle to do something good for the world and as a consequence we see various figures in his life get ripped out of existence. The things we see people do for the hope of seeing just a single newborn person again is beautiful and heartbreaking. Best of all, the story is told through the actions the characters take, the movie includes almost no expositional dialogue and rather we learn about the situation through the character's actions, and through the details in the world around us.<br/><br/>I haven't even mentioned the massively impressive long shots. <br/><br/>In the end, Children of Men is challenged by very view in its world building abilities and uses its universe to deliver a story about the good of the entire human race's future. It's compelling, and it look and feels beautiful. 10/10."
"ashleybessbrown","6","1","1","13 November 2016"," A good movie that could have been great.
","My biggest beef with ""Children of Men"" is that it strays so wildly from P.D. James' book - not even necessarily in plot line or character qualities (though it does do that) but thematically and morally. The book is quite explicitly (and implicitly) Christian in its narrative arc and in the protagonist's crisis of conscience and evolution. The creators of the film appear to have deliberately omitted this crucial underpinning of the novel, only making a shallow nod to it in the midwife's loopy pastiche of new-age spirituality. I found the midwife incredibly irritating in the movie, incidentally, whereas I didn't in the book. Luke is a completely different character in the movie than he is in the book - and I mean COMPLETELY different. Unrecognizable. I know, it's an adaption of the book, and a facsimile shouldn't be expected... but I resent the almost complete excoriation of what I believe to be the author's intent in telling a redemptive story based in Christianity. To me, this is not really an adaptation of the book but an entirely different story with a similar premise. Stylistically, it is incredibly well done, the acting is fabulous, Clive Owen is brilliant, and there are some beautiful scenes (Theo escorting Kee out of the crumbling building comes to mind). But, having read the book, the film rang shallow overall to me. <br/><br/>Also, a mild peeve: I get that bad guys use rough language. That's realistic. But the f-word as noun, verb and adjective in the same sentence, over and over and over? Incredibly annoying."
"melihayar","6","1","1","16 December 2015"," Would have been a better story
","Well, Cliwe Owen got another well-played role. But the point that I didn't like the movie that much was about the evolution and the conclusion of the story. I appreciate the way that they describe the occasion valuable and dramatic. The situation that the world can involve in this case was shown realistic and satisfied. The middle east influence in the refugees life was highly expected and you can clearly see these guys are the typical poor unwanted people to use in your movie. I wouldn't tell I like it. On the other hand, cinematography of the movie was incredible and needs respect to be shown. <br/><br/>To sum up, in my opinion, the movie deserves a perfect six. Not more not less."

","In short; great screenplay, impressive sets and amazing cinematography, but some utterly atrocious characters aside from the main two (most of them you will want to die as quickly as possible). Also, everyone hates the sound of babies crying, so why would you let that be the only thing you hear during the final 10 minutes. I would advise just turning off the sound altogether and fast forward through the parts when they're talking (the visuals speak for themselves).<br/><br/>I've heard some people call this the best movie of the 2000s, which I find very hard to believe. I have no idea how anyone could watch this movie without at least wanting 3 people (in particular the spiritual fat lady, the screaming gypsy lady and the crying baby) to die. This is usually not a good sign. Only the pregnant lady, the main character and Michael Caine are decent and more importantly not as incredibly annoying as the others.<br/><br/>It's still worth a watch, but only for the unique story (you could also just read the book instead) and for the visuals."
"neillaoshi","1","1","1","20 October 2015"," The emperor has no clothes
","I'm a Britophile: I like British movies and British actors. I'm also a lover of Sci-fi, so I loved the idea of a British sci-fi that people were saying was actually good. I first saw Children of Men and I wasn't blown away, in fact I was vaguely bothered, but if you'd asked me about it last week I'd have said it was a pretty good movie. Having watched it again I would not say the same.<br/><br/>The good: the atmosphere is good, Michael Caine is pretty good and Clive Owen is OK.<br/><br/>The bad: the plot is wafer thin and there's no exposition: don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you can't leave unanswered questions or leave the audience to figure out how some things happened, but there's just too much in this movie. Perhaps the book explained a lot more, but for us who haven't read it the movie is just an extended chase scene in a possible future, but without a good reason given for why the future is the way it is or why the chase is even necessary or what it will achieve.<br/><br/>The other problem is that technology doesn't seem to have moved on in over fifteen years. Of course this is always gonna be a problem for low budget movies, but it does remove one of the main reasons I like sci-fi: the chance to see what new cars, weapons, fashions etc. can be dreamt up by the film makers.<br/><br/>I think the first critics who saw this movie had low expectations and were pleasantly surprised, but I do notice that as more and more people have seen it its rating has dropped as people begin to realize the emperor has no clothes."
"Realiser","4","1","1","10 October 2015"," Look for a magic ship
","The widespread critical and popular acclaim of this movie is surprising. This movie is wrong and stupid on many levels. To begin with I will say few good things about the spectacle. The movie does a good job portraying the desperation of human race. The loss of fertility and how people are losing hope was portrayed quite nicely. You feel for them and get desperate along with characters. Before I start talking about what actually is going in the plot, I will have to mention few basic facts about what must have been going on in such world. First of it is obvious that there must exist a gigantic scientific effort to understand why and solve the problem. This will most likely take a form of a large network of multinational government funded research centers. By this time everyone understands that if problem isn't solved humanity ""goes bananas"". Over the years such centers must have come up with some understanding. All their tiny, even nonexistent progress should be widely publicized to a population hungry for any straw of hope. In the movie, however, the only mentioned research center is a ship, which somehow exists without supplies and without any government supporting it. Even assuming such state of affairs, a militaristic nation such as UK is portrayed in the movie would quickly apprehend it to give people hope. What happens when a baby comes into such desperate and hopeless world? The mother herself or anyone close or anyone who knows her during pregnancy should submit to authorities. This is way ensures that the information goes public and people get hopeful again. This also assures that infertility research center gets hold of her. Not only they will be able to help and provide for her, but also they will make tremendous progress in combating affliction. The news of this will immediately infuse the whole world with hope and outlook for the future, after years of desperation. A pregnant woman submitting to the authorities will be the single greatest good thing that can happen in such world. And we know that the government is tyrannical, it has resources since it exerts tight control over the public, we can therefore conclude it has resources to conduct research and protect the young woman. It is hinted in the movie that such outcome might be undesirable because anti-immigration stance and overt racism. Those arguments are nonsense. Due to desperation and absence of hope the government faces complete chaos, anarchy, and degradation. The only chance to avoid impending apocalypse is to solve the infertility issue. Even appearance of a progress would give tremendous benefits to easing the unrest and restoring the order. So what happens in the movie is some weird small gang of revolutionaries/terrorists gets hold of the pregnant woman. This people are either completely evil or tremendously stupid since they deliberately prevent this woman to submit to authorities. The head of the organization, seemingly reasonable person, portrayed by Julianne Moore, doesn't think of giving people at large any hope either. Then there appears a genuinely good person, a protagonist of the story portrayed by Clive Oven. Instead of doing the right thing – immediate submission to authorities, he decides to steal the girl for the most retarded purpose anyone could think of. Here is his thinking process: ""There exist a magic ship, with best research facilities on board. This ship will be somewhere close to the shore on that day near that harbor. So I'm gonna risk her (and my) life, put her into a flimsy boat and paddle out into the open sea. Never-mind my wounds, never-mind the fog, never-mind the waves, which could easily turn the boat over and drown us, never mind I will never find the ship even if it came, since I can't see anything 10m away. I will still go look magic ship because someone told someone who told someone that it is going to be there"". Risking life and last hope of humanity for a fantasy is preposterous. I admit that meaning of ship might be symbolic, I but no matter how you cut it, going for the ship is evil because it is taking hope away from people."

","It's an interesting premise and the future society, where Britain is practically the last nation still standing, is well realised. This should be a really good movie. But the leaden script, laden with exposition, and some truly bad acting in most of the supporting roles, combine to ruin this film. Claire-Hope Ashitey does well as a terrified young woman carrying the future of the world (literally), but Chiwetel Ejiofor and Peter Mullan, the best of the rest, have such dreadful roles, and everyone else delivers their lumpen lines with such lack of conviction that the whole thing sinks beneath their weight.<br/><br/>As an example, a scene in which Theo, played by Clive Owen, realises that the young woman (Ashitey) he has promised to protect is being double-crossed by the people she trusts could have been achieved in about 30 seconds of screen time but instead it goes on for what feels like an eternity, clubbing the viewer over the head with exposition. ""We killed ****!"" ""We're going to kill ******!"" ""Then we'll take over the world!"" All that's missing is a ""bwah hah hahhhhh!"" and an evil twirl of the moustache from the villain of the piece.<br/><br/>Very disappointing and not a little frustrating.

To make it even worse, Clive Owen, in my opinion, is the most unlikeable actor since Michael Caine. I can't believe that I wasted my time on this. And I can't believe that this is what people like in movies these days. This really shows you how far our cultural tastes have deteriorated during the past decade or so, which is why garbage such as this is continually forced on us rather than good, intelligent, meaningful, real-to-life drama, or movies that touch upon human emotion, moral values and lessons to be learned."

Chiwetel Ejiofor stands out as the sinister rebel leader - this film established him as one of my favorites. And check out Michael Caine playing a hippie with such aplomb, it's one of his best performances ever!<br/><br/>You could say Blade Runner was the Children Of Men of the '80s or Apocalypse Now was the Children Of Men of the '70s. It's that deep, it's that solid, it's that freaky, it's that bleak. All the while, it's one of the more compelling tales of personal redemption I've ever seen. And the events that unfold (in the world as portrayed) are beyond biblical in their gravity. What a yarn...<br/><br/>If anything else this decade tops this, I can't wait to see it!"
"jdkraus","3","5","12","18 January 2007"," Dark, depressing, and disconnecting...there's no soul!
","I was really, really looking forward to this film. It looked like the next, modern-day Blade runner, loaded with a combination of action and story, at least that's what the trailers looked like. But unfortunately, it was major disappointment. To put the film in simpler terms, instead of focusing on the story, in which the trailers showed was about an ordinary man named Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) who accompanies Juliane Taylor (Julianne Moore) to relocate a pregnant woman that can save humanity from self-destruction.<br/><br/>No, this is not the case with this film, instead, Leftims propaganda is rubbed in your face. It's no surprise that the Leftist sympathizing critics loved it; it had all the things they fantasize about or dread: - Fascist Totalitarian State - Lynch mob in the form of the all male, all white state police - CoOp Farms are safe, Capitalistic cities are dangerous -white rich people who have mindless and spoiled children - Discrediting of the Christian religion/bloodthirsty Muslims- Celebrity worship - Concentration camps - Deportations - Beirut/Baghdad style street fighting - Crooked cops smuggling drugs and people into Prisons - State torture of political activists - massacres of innocent civilians See what I mean? Even more so, the depiction of the world that Alfonso Cuaron created gave me memories of what eastern Europe became after the Berlin Wall fell. This includes: pollution, trash every way, and everything/everyone is filthy.<br/><br/>So, the story was left to rot, leaving plenty of plot holes and unclear explanations. The film did not get involved in any of characters nor grew in deep with the story, as to how the world ended up in the way it is. Instead of developing characters, they were killed off almost as badly as Scorsese's ""The Departed"", but much, much quicker. So, there is no real feelings for these characters as they face either their demise or success in this ""screwed up"" world, nor are their motivations and inner struggles revealed.<br/><br/>The three good cast members: Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michale Caine were great, but were only in the film for a limited time. No chemistry was built up in the characters they played. Even Michael Caine, who was strangely dressed up as a ""crazy hippie"" was deeply limited, as was the lovely Julianne Moore (who was only in the film for ten minutes). The rest of the cast was incompetent for the film (if you call it a film). They're acting was weak and at most wooden. Particularly the actress who played Kee. All she did was whine, complain, and hide behind people's back as they were blown to pieces by lead (which happened frequently).<br/><br/>Bottom line, this film had no soul; there was no flow to it (just propaganda); the trailers were very misleading. Instead of a combo of action and story, the film delivers depression, darkness, and disconnections in a leftist dystopia. What was worse was, that the camera was ""hand held"". There's no big deal with that, but when the camera shakes violently as if it was near the tremors of an earthquake, it gives a very out of control and unclear view as to what was happening. I felt like I was watching a B movie, like Mad Max. And not to mention the action sequences (which were few), were like this, and I was forced to look away, because I had such a headache! So my point of view, do not see this film, unless you're a Leftist or believed in Leftism.<br/><br/>A generous 1/4 if you do see this movie, take some anti-nausea pills, for there are guarantees, you may get motion sickness."

","My title sums the movie up. Children of Men is a cheap-shot, bleeding-heart, tear-jerker that offers no logic, lots of emotion (just like good propaganda should) and horrible spectacles of a mean old conservative government anti-utopia. Oooh scary! The directing is amazingly effective during scenes of violence. It lulls you in and at unexpected moments puts you, the viewer, in harm's way. Not exactly a pleasant experience, but hey, this ain't supposed to be. The acting is great as well, although I didn't think Clive Owen was all that special. For a future where a child hasn't been born for awhile, why is it so overpopulated? Beats me. The answer must be Children of Men. This contradiction is also interesting from the liberal perspective, because of the conservative pro-life message of the movie. Wacky huh? I couldn't be bothered to figure out this lazy storytelling. Creative confusion is always a good way to misdirect you from the fact that there's a lame plot. Michael Caine expertly plays a cliché character of the old pot-smoking, cuddly, has-been, hippie layabout. When he got shot, I wanted to cheer. Will liberals ever let go of this kindly old hippie grandpop image? Will we forever be haunted by the moronic ghosts of hippiedom? And also conversely, the evil ghosts of Nazidom (images of which permeate this movie)? What exactly were the motives of the political gang who killed off Caine's hippie character and wanted to kill off Owen's character and use the baby for an uprising? Beats me. The answer must be Children of Men. An uprising of who for what? Children of Men. The ending is totally lame. I was like, that's it??? Children of Men. What the eff does that title mean? It's stupid."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","12","11 January 2007"," Connoisseurs' favourite
","(Watched in Toronto) <br/><br/>""Children of men"" has all the markings of a connoisseur's favourite, without having an overly indie or art house feel. If you have seen ""28 days later"", you can't help noticing the similarity in many ways  global pandemonium (unlike many others, neither is post-nuclear-war), British setting, protagonists constantly on the run, menacing barbaric hordes, an ultimate, utopia-like destination to escape from the dying world, with hopes of rebuilding a new world. The unique thing about ""Children of men"" is the desperate situation of global sterilisation (cause never explained), as a result of which a pregnancy and subsequent childbirth becomes the centre of a vortex of power struggle.<br/><br/>Much have been said in the Comments and Messages Boards about the filming techniques  the long take, the hand-held camera, special colouring and texture of the visual, deliberate minimum editing, compelling sound  and there's little that I can add. The fact that Alfonso Cuaron is among the 5 directors winning in the some 20 critics awards says much (with two wins, he actually ranks third in this series of awards that is dominated by Martin Scorsese with 12, followed by Paul Greengrass with 4).<br/><br/>Acting is splendid. Versatile Clive Owen is effective as the stumbling, reluctant hero in an unsolicited quest to escort the pregnant girl, and later mother (composed, confident performance by new comer Claire-Hope Ashitey), to safety. Two big names, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine, as ex-girlfriend/resistance leader and ex-flower-power friend, have rather brief appearances but make disproportionately significant contributions to the movie. Romantic (thing ""Love actually"" and ""Melinda and Melinda"") Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a militant activist who can be both deadly cool and explosively hot.<br/><br/>Mostly grim, at times almost religiously prophetic, this movie is not without it's fun moments, particularly with its dry and sometimes dark humour, as in one of the escape scenes when it takes an eternity to jump-start the escape vehicle."

"jluebe","10","5","12","8 January 2007"," Children of Men best film of 2006
","This is a film -- thanks to its perfect cinematography and good score -- that's more about mood and emotion than selling ideas. It is a ""smart"" movie that lets you know it's considered all the moral and contemporary angles, but it doesn't try to corner you into any of them. What you take away from this film depends very much on what ideas and beliefs you bring into it. Director Cuaron's approach seemed to be, to swipe a slogan from FOX, ""We film, you decide."" I find that refreshing.<br/><br/>For sure you can watch this film with just about anyone, and afterward have a lively, interesting debate. But the film itself doesn't lower itself to petty didactic arguments: it has a story to tell. Again, how refreshing! Moroever, this film is not ""just"" genre entertainment, although it is part action and sci-fi escapism. (Despite plenty of shooting and violence, Owens' character never once picks up a gun, even when one would seem to come in handy.) Refusing to beat you over the head with messages, Children of Men nevertheless does stand for some important things which, upon further examination, humbly approach the universal. Without being hackneyed or trite, Children quietly and movingly stands up for the sacredness and dignity of each human life. Owen's character is the only one who ""gets"" this. Both the liberal-lefty terrorist ""Fish"" fighting for immigrants' rights, and the fascist security forces using violent, repressive means to stave off anarchy, lose sight of dignity and preciousness of life in pursuit of their zero-sum goals.<br/><br/>Even I was tempted to think Owen just didn't get it when the motley Fish leaders, the erstwhile protectors of a young pregnant African refugee, asked him what he thought should be done with her, i.e. how best to use her for the Cause. ""I think she needs a doctor,"" he answers immediately, ""I think she needs proper care."" The Fish can only scoff at such short-sighted naiveté. With humanity on the brink, I thought to myself then, surely Owen's character was missing the big picture, the pressing political fate of millions? But as events prove, Owen is right and the Fish are wrong. I ended up reproaching my initial reaction as the film reached its climax. Owen is the only one, absent a few non-English speaking refugees, who recognizes the moral imperative to protect innocent life.<br/><br/>The awesome, unifying moment of this film, when time slows down several dozen heartbeats, takes place in a tenement building in a refugee city. Suddenly, both jackbooted soldiers and dread-locked terrorists lose the will to fight each other when they're abruptly face-to-face with a miracle: a real live crying infant, the first in 18 years. The truth's liberating effect on them is fleeting, however, as characters revert to form. The moment passes and the fighting resumes in earnest, continuing a masterpiece of real-time, first-person-view urban warfare, but it gives Owen just enough time to stumble away to safety with the future of humanity in his arms.<br/><br/>Owen's character also embodies another significant but understated theme, related to the above: politics without a hope & vision for the future is a footrace to the grave. Owen is a ""retired"" liberal activist who retains strong sympathies for the old Left, including his politically active ex-wife (Juliette Moore), and forest-dwelling hippie mentor (Michael Caine). Director Cuaron contrasts Owen's liberal simpatico with his apparent resignation to ""sell out"" and work in a dull, gray government bureaucracy for The Man. As the action unfolds, Cuaron makes us think that Owen will surely have to choose: either the unstable leftist Fish, or the fascist forces holding anarchy at bay. Yet Owen's actual choice -- the correct choice -- is neither.<br/><br/>Owen, unlike the radical and increasingly violent Fish, has realized that once hope for life is out of the picture, his liberal politics stops meaning anything. For that matter, when life consists of waiting to die, everything stops meaning anything. More broadly, this film shows us that when politics become divorced from mankind's real circumstances -- which have a knack of ignoring our left-right paradigms and pre-conceived notions -- society becomes grotesquely pointless, even dangerous to itself.<br/><br/>Giving us spare but effective snippets of Owens' bland, rote, hopeless existence at the start of the film, Cuaron invites us to believe that Owen is a washed up drunk beyond renewal. But Owen's character shows his true mettle as soon as he realizes that, quite literally, hope has been reborn. Without fake bravado, or ""dramatic"" bouts of doubt a lesser film might give us to increase the suspense, Owen simply and unhesitatingly does the right thing: protecting against all comers the mother-to-be of humanity's first baby in 18 years.<br/><br/>I never read the novel upon which this movie was based. Maybe it's great; and I'm sure it's different than the film. But all that is irrelevant. Children of Men stands alone as a great film, and the building inertia of its simple but irresistible narrative and momentous power of its visuals carry all the meaning a viewer can hope for in a film.<br/><br/>Finally, not to ruin the ending, but it's just not true that ""everyone dies in vain"" in this film as Suderman claims. Maybe the ending is not suitably Hollywood enough for Suderman, but that's his problem. Even if everyone did die in this film, and all of Owen's selfless bravery and humanity sans sappy sentiment failed to carry the day, it wouldn't mean that hope was in vain. If there's one thing this movie shows us, it's that hope is the sin qua non for humanity. And like Owen's character, we can only do our humble, stumbling best, as Jesse implored, to keep it alive."

The story - very interesting.<br/><br/>What can be pinpointed is that nothing is directly thrown at the viewer. Instead of having voice over narration or fictional news snippets cut in between scenes the film, through effective direction implies all that it wants to say. The dark gloomy world on the edge of dystopia is felt just as strongly, if not stronger, this way. The strife all around the landscape feels as if it is all around you and that is exactly how anyone would feel if they were actually there. The many contiguous shots, even during hectic action scenes really drive this point home. The story is in the same fashion - packed with many subtleties that the viewer takes in and a whole world unfolds. This world asks questions in favor of providing answers, but that is what makes it fascinating.

","What bothered me most about this movie was the conceit that being deprived of progeny, humankind would descend into chaos and in turn undertake mass migrations from one's homeland into the hostile bosom of another nation. It just does not make sense.<br/><br/>I think it is fair to say that the more likely human response would be disbelief, bewilderment, sadness and depressive passivity. People would turn inward, questioning their fate and their place in the world. After the initial reaction abated into resignation or denial, people would entreat their government and their scientific communities for explanations and solutions. I think people would live out their lives as quietly and constructively as possible.<br/><br/>The level of violence, anarchy and animus in this movie seemed far more appropriate for a society that had something for which to fight: a future for their children, racial or religious hegemony, economic redress and/or freedom from repression. This is why we usually fight.<br/><br/>Granted there are few mad individuals who are angry at the worlda sociopath or disgruntled employee. But they see the world as having more than they have. In the instance of this movie, everyone is in the same boat. You might rail against the heavens, but not your neighbor.<br/><br/>The movie's premise, I make no reference to the book, is an interesting one and worth examining. It certainly teases the mind. One woman's becoming pregnant after years of societal barrenness, would provoke delicious scenarios. Who was the father? Was there a father at all? What are the implications of the woman's being black--not white or brown etc? Could a new a new Eden be established and the world start afresh?<br/><br/>Done well, dodging bullets in the streets and pitched battle scenes make for good cinema. We only have to look at Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket or Black Hawk Down. These riveting movies kept your jaws clenched and your knuckles white.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind was a passionate love story perfectly set with the US Civil War as its backdrop. Children of Men was an intriguing story of societal demise and tenuous rebirth set against a populace who was too busy fighting to take much note of it."

The end of Faron at the seas is almost an insult to the viewer.<br/><br/>I am quite sure that the novel must have been better and that this is an unlucky Hollywood version only, otherwise I can not imagine why after the so great 1984 has been written and made into a movie, and we have had Matrix and The Island and a bunch of others dealing with the end of the world as it may seem likely, anyone would have seen anything in this non-existing plot."

"karma9","3","4","9","17 April 2007"," Children of Men, Subtitile: Why Bother
","I am a major ""Blade Runner"" fan and I heard this movie advertised as ""Blade Runner for the 21st Century."" Unfortunately it wasn't even close and it wasn't sci-fi. This movie takes place only 20 years in the future and is clearly tied to our present. For some unknown reason, society has fallen apart throughout the entire world. Apparently wars are going on and there was an epidemic (bird flu?) in 2007 and people are generally vicious and uncaring about what goes on around them. The only plot you can glean from the movie is that for some reason (maybe the epidemic) women can't get pregnant so everyone goes crazy and attacks each other, and people from all over the world want to sneak into England (illegal aliens). The illegals are treated harshly in England, by being rounded up and put into tiny cages before being transported to a walled up (part of) old city (i.e., the Nazis in Poland, or Escape from New York).<br/><br/>Then ""hero"" of the story, Theo (played by Clive Owen - big fan) surprisingly appears to be living a fairly normal life (going to work, coming home every day, trying to pay his bills) in the midst of this chaos. Suddenly, he finds himself asked to do a favor for a radical political group called the Fishes, lead by is ex-wife. He and his ex were members of the Fishes in their youth. He left, she stayed and the Fishes committed some terrorist acts (after Theo left), but his ex assures him that, that isn't what they do anymore. She asks him to get travel papers for a young woman without giving him much info, he says no initially but decides he needs the money she offered. Do you think he'll get the papers when pigs fly? Look what's floating in the background when he arrives to ask for the papers, a flying (well actually floating) pig. It was so distracting in the scene that I could only look at that giant ping and wonder, ""does the director think the audience so dumb they won't get the symbolism unless he slaps them in the face with it."" Anyway the savior of mankind is a baby being carried by the young women that, unfortunately for Theo, he only finds about the baby after he is under the control of the Fishes. Shortly afterward he finds out the Fishes staged a coup by killing his ex, and they will kill him in the morning and keep the baby (did I say savior of mankind) for themselves. For some reason the radicals believe the baby will incite an uprising against the current government, and I assume they will need to rule until the Savior, uh I mean baby is old enough. Unfortunately for Theo (and Clive) his heroism never comes out, by the time he finds out what is going on, he is already stuck, with escape his only way out. He seems to hang on to the girl and baby more as a security blanket then any attempt to rescue them. Near the end of the movie when there is everything from handguns to tanks firing all around him and the baby, he never once attempts to pick up a weapon to protect the baby. What I found most offensive was a scene that clearly was intended to depict a group of Middle Eastern radicals (terrorists) parading down the streets of the walled-in and secure (?) ghetto, carrying banners and AK-47s. Why Middle Easterners and where did they get all the AK-47s in the middle of a walled-in ghetto (prison camp) in England? The good: Alfonso Cuarón produced some great cinematography. If you are interested in becoming a camera operator and or directory of photography, this is a great movie to watch. The visuals seem to be right out of the war in Iraq but with even greater intensity. Surreal gritty realism at its best. It is clear that Alfonso Cuarón wanted to create a movie with such stunning visuals that you would forced to consider mankind's future. His movie does this, but unfortunately all you see is hate, pain, and cruelty, from the point of view of a few, who seem only to want to be left alone. If Alfonso Cuarón believes this is where mankind is headed, then why care at all.<br/><br/>Final: Blade Runner was about the hope that men and women have (even if artificially created) and that life no matter how it turns out, is worth fighting for, even if it isn't perfect. In Children of Men most everyone wants something at the expense of others, except Theo who just wants to survive. The only hope we are left with at the end of the film, is that maybe this baby will enable the continuation of the savagery and pain we saw throughout the film. Why?"

It's supposed to be this vision of England in the future- but it looks suspiciously like the England I saw three years ago, plus some explosions.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good, the writing decent. It's the plot itself, and the logic, that is lacking. It's not in any way enjoyable to watch; there are only a few moments where any form of humor or happiness exists.

","I can't believe that this film is rated so highly -- I was shocked to see that it had been nominated for 3 academy awards.<br/><br/>It's not the worst film I've seen this year, but the acting isn't great and the plot is very contrived. Though I tend to agree with the (not too subtle) political messages contained in the film (that we are moving towards a police state, that our crusade against illegal immigration is a bad thing, that the government shouldn't be trusted), I think that these messages are inappropriately conveyed.<br/><br/>Successful films, even romances, are successful because they allow the viewer to suspend disbelief, and Children of Men didn't do it for me. It's not realistic, yet still highly predictable. The actors do a poor job of creating a sense of ""character"". The camera work and editing are good, but without a believable story line that I can identify with, what's the point? Why bother?"

I particularly didn't like the part where the ex-girlfriend (ex/wife, whatever) gets shot in the middle of nowhere, and they are able to organize a new car out of the blue.<br/><br/>What can one expect from a movie based upon a book by P.D.

","A very disappointing show. With several very favorable reviews as a base guideline, I went to this show with high hopes and left feeling very disappointed. It may be an artsy favorite but it missed the mark with me. I love sci-fi but this was weak in many areas--initial story, suspense, and ending. At the conclusion of the show, several people in the theater exclaimed at the same time--""You have got to be kidding!"" That is exactly how I felt. There were many holes in the story which went unexplained and left the viewer perplexed. There were allusions and inferences of religion which strayed from any real impact. A nice concept but poorly delivered. Others may have liked the show but this could have easily been better if done in a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits mode."

First off, the cinematography reminds me of 28 Days Later not to mention the whole British thing to begin with. In the end, the story line stank, the acting was mediocre, and the ending straight up sucked. One of the biggest wastes of $17 (2 people) I've ever seen. If you really think you need to see it, wait for the DVD and rent it or Netflix it. This was supposed to be a serious, sad movie that made you think and get you involved but my date spent half the time laughing and was starting to wish we had gone to see Happy Feet..... Now Pursuit of Happiness, that looks like a good movie, that has been seen by a few of my friends and they said it was good. If you're looking for a good movie, I'd guess you should go see that one.

","Alfonso Cuaron's latest film is an action/drama about a dystopian and bleak futuristic society where women can no longer propagate, and the youngest person alive has just died.<br/><br/>A former activist, named Theo (played brilliantly by Clive Owen) is kidnapped by a terrorist/freedom fighter group called ""The Fishes"". The leader, he is surprised to find, is his ex-wife (whom they had co-parented a child who has died, with another great performance by Julianne Moore). She charges him to transport a miraculously pregnant woman named Kee to ""The Human Project""--mankind's last hope for survival.<br/><br/>Through the rest of the film, we are bombarded with some of the most amazingly spectacular action set pieces ever put onto film. Two of which are achieved in a single, unbroken take.<br/><br/>Which brings me over to the technical side of the movie. Emmanuel Lubezki's eye-popping cinematography deserves an Oscar. John Tanver's score is quiet and unobtrusive--perfect for the movie. Cuaron and Alex Rodriguez edit the movie with a swiftness and perfection that deserves an Oscar nod as well.<br/><br/>But the person who really makes this film is Cuaron himself. Even if you don't like the film, you cannot say that it did not have its technical merits. What I'm referring to, of course, are the amazing action scenes (people who have seen the film know what I'm talking about). I know I've said it up above, but I can't describe what was going through my head when viewing the long takes. (e.g. ""How the hell did they DO that?!) Anyway, CoM deserves Best Picture (although it's a tie between the Departed and this), Best Director (tie again), cinematography, editing--hell, even the actors deserve some Oscars.<br/><br/>Overall, an amazing film, a great technical accomplishment. This has been a great year for the three Mexican directors. They're on a roll."

","To say the film paints a dark portrait of the future is an understatement. Suicide kits and anti-depressants are handed out like candy in a world where people can't even take care of themselves, but crave children and pregnancy.<br/><br/>Life is disposable, but the potential for life is revered.<br/><br/>Children of Men is more like a war or chase flick than a sci-fi story. The only similarity I see to Blade Runner is that it takes place in the future. Comparing Blade Runner to Children of Men is like comparing filet mignon to chicken mcnuggets.<br/><br/>If you like action movies, you'll probably love this. It's not a character driven film. There's a lot of bombing, explosions and violence, with a few comedic scenes with Michael Caine to break up the tension. There's also some over-the-top angelic music whenever there's a sign of hope.<br/><br/>So if you like seeing very sad films about a future being overtaken by disease, despair, death and destruction, go see Children of Men. It's perfect for the pessimist.<br/><br/>I have to agree with the other reviewers who said that it's more like sci-fi fast food with editing like The Prisoner. It felt like I was watching war footage from Iraq spliced into a rescue story."

The jumpy camera shots started to make my head hurt about half way through the film. Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine give solid performances though. The film in nothing more than propaganda. Very poorly presented propaganda at that. I felt no compassion for any of the main characters and therefore couldn't bring myself to feel anything for them.

""What am I watching?, Guys, next time you work on a film it may be helpful to read what the person ahead of you has written. Also some unanswered questions: You know you are going to just going to have to let go of logic when they state 4 times at the beginning of the film that the youngest child 18 years, 10 months, etc has died; then cut right to a scene of Clive Owens nephew playing with a holographic Rubeck's cube; who is like 15 going on 16.

Just keep telling yourself they will explain it soon, uh-no, they don't.<br/><br/>(a) ""Remember that ringing you hear in your ears"", Julian Moore says to Clive Owen. (well what specifically, why say it if there was no point in using it at the end of the movie with some tie in?) I would have ended the movie with him actually hearing the ringing instead of moaning and maybe have him remember his own son, instead of moaning like he was about to fart his pants.<br/><br/>(b) Why was Kee housed in the barn with the cows?, More important, why were animals able to continue reproducing; young kittens, calves, but humans  uh, no?

"shishaldin","6","4","9","6 January 2007"," Less than meets the eye
","I haven't read the other comments, so I apologize if others brought this up.<br/><br/>The visual repleteness of Children of Men exceeds the viewer's capacity to take it in. I understand that most good films require more than one viewing. Still, any good film must entertain, and it's hard to be entertained by something visually so rapid and complex that you're constantly distracted from the characters and dialog. A movie is not a painting.<br/><br/>I also had a lot of trouble understanding dialog, because of rapid speech, accents, occasionally slang, background noises, and occasional mumbles. Again, to some extent this is just current film idiom that we're all used to--movies are supposed to confuse us likereal life. But it does not add to my enjoyment to be constantly worrying whether I'm following the story correctly because I know I'm missing maybe 20% of what is said, <br/><br/>Fortunately, however, Children of Men has an extremely simple plot, characters that don't develop, and a handful of very basic ideas, so in spite of the visual and auditory challenges, you do get the gist. My problem is that a movie has to have more than a gist, and this one doesn't."
"Polaris_DiB","9","4","9","5 January 2007"," Amazing takes and gripping story
","This film is pretty superb. I still haven't seen Y Tu Mama Tambien (I'm ashamed...) but I was really impressed with Alfonso Cuaron's work in, of all things, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Cuaron put the long takes and multiple depths and fantastic background in that movie to provide magic to a series seriously lacking in what it's all about (and I don't think any of the subsequent movies are going to ever be as good). Thus, knowing he had made a Science Fiction dystopian flick, I was intrigued.<br/><br/>Going back to the idea of long takes.... talk about long takes. Cuaron has somehow taking the complicated shots through multiple stories and buildings and sets that everyone is so impressed that PT Anderson can do and has stuffed it with more complications with a world falling apart from violence and despair. It adds to the tension of a dramatic lack of hope so much that I think if it wasn't for the comedic relief of Jasper (Michael Caine!), I don't think I could have made it through it.<br/><br/>It's about the world twenty years in the future where humanity has suddenly ceased to procreate. Clive Owen plays a depressed and inanimate man who suddenly finds himself trying to accompany a pregnant woman (and the world's only hope) through a world filled to the brim with rioting, anxiety, and destruction.<br/><br/>The dirty mise-en-scene and a lot of the dystopic imagery has already brought comparisons to Blade Runner, but to me this is a whole new image. Actually, it seems to me closer to 28 Days Later, but is vastly more infinite in scale.<br/><br/>I think this movie would be perfect if it wasn't for the fact that a lot of the dialog is filled with contemporary meaning in a little too obvious way. V for Vendetta made the same mistake of making a science fiction that was just a little TOO obviously a comment on the political realm of today. Luckily the story and the action make this into an adventure all of its own.<br/><br/>By the way, it also has a great soundtrack. Pointedly hippy, but great nonetheless.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","I will confirm that the acting is quite good and the cinematography is interesting and well done. However, a real good science fiction movie explains a bit of the underlying plot and at least some of the science, if even as cool and interesting pseudo-science that has no basis in reality, but is at least fun and intriguing to think about. This movie has none of that, but instead only the loosest futuristic concepts that serve merely as an excuse for yet another immensely violent suspense film. The initial rave reviews must be coming from the masses of young sci-fi fans that have read nothing but cheesy comic books, and studied little to no science at all. It's not an absolutely terrible movie, but given the superior acting and cinematography, it could have been fantastic had the storyline been developed at all. If you are a discriminating sci-fi fan that actually expects the writers to think, just a little, then don't bother, or wait for it on Netflix and see it on someone's large flat screen TV with decent surround sound -- if you must. It's not worth the $20 at the theater for a date, especially since you will both have to watch some comedy before sleeping to shake off the CNS shock effects of the gratuitous violence. If you are someone who likes watching hackneyed, silly time travel sci-fi over and over again, or loves idiotic violent movies, then I am sure you will give it at least 8 stars, so go ahead and continue the financing of such drivel."

Terrorism is running rampant, much of it between the fascist government and the supposedly non-violent guerilla organization called the Fishes...etc. It's amid this situation that we meet the film's extremely reluctant hero, Theo (Clive Owen, delivering a perfectly formed one-note performance), a former activist-turned-bureaucrat who drinks too much and never has enough money. Barely escaping one of those explosions, he's kidnapped by the Fishes and offered by their leader (Julianne Moore) a tidy sum of cash if he'll pull some government strings to get some transit papers for ""a friend.""<br/><br/>It all becomes a mission to get Kee to ""a safe place"" to have her baby.

"Ata-2","10","4","9","21 October 2006"," Finally a movie this year worth every penny
","In brief, a ground-breaking work worth watching more than once. One of the best movies I've ever seen and definitely the best Brit movie I've seen for decades.<br/><br/>Based on P.D. James' book and set in southern England, Children of Men depicts a bleak future in which no children have been born for 18years and humanity is on the brink of extinction. Through a series of encounters Clive Owen's character is subtly drawn into the midst of a group who harbor probably the world's only pregnant woman. The two protagonists then set off to find a legendary sanctuary at sea where they hope to change the fate of humanity.<br/><br/>Yes its bleak, and yes its depressing, but it gets under your skin and its one of those movies that later, out of the blue, you'll crave to see again. This movie is actually special in so many ways its hard to list them all. Alfonso Cuarón direction is reminiscent of Kubrik at his best (Oscar 1). More than just having watched this movie you feel you lived through it. The camera work and cinematography in general are simply brilliant (Oscar 2). You see the action from the viewpoint of an observer who is right in the thick of it without missing out on the peripheral action. It really makes you feel you were there and are actually remembering what happened. The whole movie is shot in a kind of twilight that feels like natural light and reinforces how real everything feels. A 21st century Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Whoever designed the sets loved their work (Oscar 3) because of the attention to every little detail. The Pink Floyd reference is a kind of icing on the cake. London is transformed into a vision of this bleak future so incredibly well it is hard to believe its all fiction. The trains and the various vehicles just fit in perfectly so you have no trouble believing that is what they are going to look like in this future.<br/><br/>The special effects are simply fantastic (Oscar 4). I just loved the subtle touches like the advertising on the side of the buses. In any other movie they'd force these things down your throat to show how clever they were, but here the special effects are done so well you don't even realize they are special effects unless you are looking for it.<br/><br/>Whoever did the explosions and coordinated the stunt work is a genius (Oscar 4). When you see so many explosions on TV it's easy to spot a fake Hollywood flame blaster. The ones in this movie are bang on.<br/><br/>There is this welcome trend in today's TV programs to have the dialog and action approach closely what people would actually do and say in real life (e.g. Entourage). This is the first full-length movie I've seen where the screenplay (Oscar 5) does the business.<br/><br/>After all the so so roles this is one in which Clive Owen really shines in the lead (Oscar 6). Michael Caine (Oscar 7) raises the bar as far as great acting goes.<br/><br/>The movie this reminds me of most is No Blade of Grass. Both get under your skin and both have a kind of inevitable quality about them in the sense that from one scene to the next things happen in a natural progression that makes the story truly harrowing. I can only hope that this movie wins an Oscar but somehow I think it will get short-changed primarily because it has mainly a British cast, but more likely because the material is not Oscar-compatible in the same way as Apocalypse Now. Ask any hundred movie buffs which they remember, Kramer vs Kramer or Apocalypse Now. Enough said. If it does win, I'll be 3 for 3."
"jamessagi62","8","4","9","19 October 2006"," Great movie
","What frightened me the most in this movie, is that the way the year 2027 is pictured, seems so realistic close to how we live today. Except of the infertility theme, and some smaller high-tech improvements to objects we use today, the way people dress, the bars, the TV journal ... its is all so similar... very well done, and it's a fantastic trick to make you think it could all really happen in a few years from now. The plot is well build, good suspense, although towards the end the film looses somewhat of its tension, especially after the scene with the cease-fire of the soldiers in the last 10 minutes or so. That scene is extremely strong, but the continuation is somewhat of a strange curve I thought. How the ""fugees"" are set in scene and the link to the the refugees we see today, is particular interesting. What stays somewhat unclear is why the human race is infertile, and why the particular girl isn't, but OK: I guess you can make up something yourself... Great movie!!!"

","I have just returned from seeing Children of Men sometime after its release in the UK. It is by far one of the greatest films I have ever seen, I have already mentioned to a few friends that it may be the best film that I have in fact ever seen! You may think this statement is a little over-stated. Let me briefly explain why I left feeling so strongly. The beginning of the film is possibly run-of-the mill, but as the story develops, so does the action. Children of Men is at times slightly depressing, but so relevant to current affairs, that at other times the boundaries between reality are blurred. London looks much like it does today and despite being set almost 20 years in the future, many of the political and social problems are quite believable.<br/><br/>Michael Caine and a bungling police man add a sense of humour and light-heartedness at moments when you may feel like there is nothing else to do but to jump under a passing lorry. This film is bleak, but I find plenty of under-lying messages. It is also excellently directed and has several great moments of filming.<br/><br/>Without saying much about the actual plot, the end of the film fills one with a relieving sense of hope and faith. Sometimes things do take place beyond our control, however much we would like to believe otherwise. Yet Children of Men seems to remind us of the value of life and the seriousness of many of today's issues. It is the sort of film that has the potential to change you for a very long time."

He is supported by Hollywood actress Julianne Moore, veteran actor Michael Caine and British TV favourite Pam Ferris. He becomes embroiled in an underground organisation who wish to protect a young woman who might be our only hope for the continuation of humanity. This film also touches on other issues such as immigration and euthanasia as part of its central storyline. Trying to survive in a world of violence and chaos Faron must struggle to protect the one scrap of hope we have left. The director's choice of a documentary style approach to the shooting of this film makes it appear even more realistic as it encourages the viewer to feel they are genuinely watching the future unfold. Any violent action appearing in this movie is intended to add to it's gritty realism rather than to have the hero show his fighting prowess. This film does not have the glossy manufactured feel of effects blockbusters such as Ultraviolet which makes it stand out from other dystopian movies. You can't imagine a typical Hollywood car chase where the hero has to push his clapped out car down the road to get it started. However this portrays perfectly the degenerating state of the future world. There are also nice futuristic touches such as Faron's London 2012 sweatshirt looking a little old after years of wear. Our hero is an average man with alcoholic problems who possesses no super powers or strengths other than a concern for the common good of humanity, which is shown by very few of the other characters. This film avoids the pitfalls of other dystopian futures by portraying the appearance of the not so distant future as not being remarkably different from the way we live today, therefore avoiding the overly futuristic feel of some films which can start to look dated incredibly quickly. Children of Men has some important messages to impart about humanity and it is especially interesting for the cynical approach it takes towards politics. All the different factions in this film appear to want to use the innocent young woman for their own political ends without regard for the wider consequences. From this we can interpret the didactic message that humanity is such a divided race that even if we were faced with what might be seen as the unifying problem of the global extinction of humanity we would still find it difficult to give up our appetite for conflict and aggression. This is demonstrated by the fact that fighting and killing is still rife in this future even though there are no new people being born to replace those who die. Overall a darkly compelling vision of the future."
"just_hamish","9","4","9","1 October 2006"," Without doubt, Cuaron's masterpiece.
","Children Of Men represents a wonderful triumph in Cuaron's career, a milestone movie that secures his already well established place as one of the most talented directors currently in work. Based on PD James' novel, Children Of Men depicts a none too distant future (2021 is the given year) falling apart at the seams after a mystery infertility pandemic has eliminated any hope of mankind's future. It is a concept that is both simple and surprisingly effective, a vision that would startle the majority of people, the idea that such a simple unknown event would bring our arrogant, self important species endless development to a grinding halt within 80 or so years. It is this inevitable sense of hopelessness that leads to a horrifying interpretation of a species on the brink of extinction.<br/><br/>The time of release could not be any more potent, Cuaron takes every opportunity to draw parallels with the current political and social climate, the grounding in a none too distant future ensures a frightening sense of familiarity making the events depicted all the more shocking and effective. Pretty much everything we see before our eyes is taken from somewhere from recent history or current events (segregation, refugees, concentration camps, terrorism), put all this into our familiar, peaceful England and it drives home a potent point. The global situation is pretty dire around the world and yet in a way we live in a bubble, insulated from the majority of horrors. Here is a story taking place in an England with that bubble burst, and it is certainly, worryingly very plausible.<br/><br/>Opening with what is perhaps the greatest depiction of a downtown suicide bomb yet put onto film Children Of Men pulls no punches from the very first frame. It is the first of many flawless scenes of violence, comparable to those of Saving Private Ryan in their sheer intensity and the incredible impact of the sound design. The majority of the picture is filmed in an up close and personal manner, spinning around Clive Owen's Theo, giving the viewer an unprecedented feeling of being there, in the moment. This extends from the huge action set pieces right down to the smaller set pieces (such as the incredible, inventive car get away scene. filmed in on a farm in a beautiful early morning glow) Events happen just off camera as the bold tracking shots offer glances of a fully realised environment, a level of detail that achieves the difficult task of convincing the viewer that as soon as the camera is turned away the world depicted continues.<br/><br/>Emotionally the film at first appears a little dry, as Theo bounces from one event to the next, but a subtle, gripping change occurs somewhere in the first third of the film drawing you in to it's vice like grip through a mixture of great writing and technical wizardry (particularly the striking shock value), as Theo crouches down in the woods, sobbing uncontrollably you realise that Cuaron has crossed the line, delivering a film that is absolutely blinding in it's impact and portrayal of a world crunching down around them. Oddly enough there is a reoccurring predictability to some of the events, yet the shock remains undiluted. This is an incredible achievement that is extremely hard to explain but can be accredited to the sheer skill put to use in portraying the events. Knowing something is coming does nothing to lessen the impact. At the same time many scenes satisfyingly avoid convention providing a truly varied experience that is both surprising and familiar. Clive Owen is wonderful in the lead role, dealing with the splattering of black comedy (another aspect that creates an entirely unique atmosphere) with ease. Michael Caine is equally brilliant as a weed smoking, Zen loving hippy, his sub plot as heartbreaking as anything in the film.<br/><br/>The violence is absolutely shocking, it seems to be unexpected in a film of this nature, a fact that certainly plays in the Cuaron's favour. It is raw, disturbing, even choking at times delivered in moderation (certainly not excess) so as to maximise impact. Characters slip out of the narrative with little more than a backward glance, adding to the realistic feel, tying up loose plot ends is certainly not on Cuaron's agenda here. CGI is employed with utmost brilliance; you will most likely not even notice it is there, pointing to a future where CGI can have its uses. We may be put off by overuse of average CGI in current films, but when you are unaware of its use the problem diminishes. Saying a film had good CGI is all very well, but having it pass by unnoticed is a far greater credit.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only fault is a lack of truly stretching the potential of the material in terms of political or social comment. Ultimately the messages conveyed through the material are simple and well worn, yes it fits in all the references but never really serves up anything new to say about them. However as a dystopian vision of the very near future Cuaron's film is a stunning, wholly immersive piece of work with an ending that is bleak, achingly sad and ambiguous. Children Of Men is sure to stand the test of time and become a modern classic."

","This is one of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen, as the movie is stacked in layer upon layer of Political, Religious, social and ethical messages.<br/><br/>Set in the not too distant future the world has a fertility crisis,the story centers on England where a Fascist regime has its population under government control.<br/><br/>The government achieve this (albeit with resistance) by a policy which is strict on asylum seekers and non British citizens is brutal slightly hinting of the way the Jews where treated. Citzens of this future are also encouraged not only to reproduce as society is infertile but also encouraged to euthanase themselves by obtaining an advertised suicide kit. <br/><br/>Clive Owen (Theo)is a regular 9 to 5 guy, once was a freedom fighter has since given up and joined the rest of the conforming society, mainly prompted by the Death of his own child. However his past resurfaces when he is abducted by the mother of his dead Son Julian (Julianne Moore).<br/><br/>Why ? <br/><br/>Juilian is protecting a young Woman called Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) who is special as she is first Woman to be pregnant in 18 years. As forces within Julian's movement want the child for their own Political ends, Julian has made plans to get both Kee and the unborn child to safety from here own organisation, and the government who will not allow the first child to be born in 18 years to come from an Asylum Seeker.Theo is the only person Julian can trust and with the task of getting Kee and the unborn child to an organisation called the Human project and he has the connections to help to do this.<br/><br/>On the Journey to safety, Kee escorted to her destination with Theo who is not the unborn's father gives birth to a Son.<br/><br/>So the tone of the movie could be that this child may be the second coming of Christ but doesn't explore that in too much detail but it is referenced several times,through remarks an characters names (Theo=God in Greek)what the child represents though is Hope to the desperate situation the world has come to.<br/><br/>Cimematically this movie is breathtaking, the camera work and the general atmosphere and breaking down of society is awesome. The sense when kee gives birth and the resulting shots of they baby are brilliantly scripted and shot.<br/><br/>The ending too bucks the traditional happy white picket fence ending too, leaving you to decide what happens next.<br/><br/>Its no doubt about it, this will be a classic movie, just like Bladerunner and the Shawshank redemption."

","This is a great movie, truly, a very powerful and emotive movie. the acting was top class (including an underused Julianne Moore), it could have been over acted but wasn't, could have been tacky and sensationalist but the cast and director maintain a very level headed, dramatic, yet believably. Thats the charm....and power of this movie....its incredibly realistic. This doomsday scenario is made believably....and thats pretty hard hitting. Unfortunately, there is a draw back, they went too far to make it look gritty, the shaky camera technique, apparently ""documentary style"". the sets, locations and effects are all superb, therefore in my opinion the gritty look is completely unnecessary. its realistic enough and doesn't add at all to the action.

","It's not a ""bad"" movie, it's just not actually a good movie. Script, directing, acting, production design, all are just sort of lacking. It bugs me that many seem to think the movie is either original or meaningful. My guess is that many of the very positive reviews come from people who sort of politically align with the movie's negativity about the future, and thus aren't reviewing the movie as much as the Vision And supposed message. More specifically... The antagonists don't have a real face or story. Our heroes keep running from things, but it's all kind of silly. There are about ten sensible ways out for them but they keep running away from silly seeming over the top mobs of hooligans, or police."
"MovieGuy109","9","3","6","1 December 2011"," A superb action film.
","Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men is not only one of the better action thrillers of 2006, but one of the best films of the year. The futuristic atmosphere is so intelligently created by Cuaron and without heavy use of special effects. The action scenes are especially realistic and well-made without campy choreography. It's a thought provoking film about a future gone wrong. This is very memorable because it analyzes the plot more than the violence and has little action cliché. It will leave you breathless by the time it finishes. Compelling performances only add to the overall experience, which is far better than average action films. This look at a bleak future is one of the better of its time and genre."
"Lucabrasisleeps","7","3","6","9 January 2009"," Engaging thriller with a weak ending
","So another movie which bothers me because of its ending. I guess the thrust was on emphasising the marginalization of minorities in Britain. I am surprised though when this movie is called the best movie of 2006. It is a good attempt but in no way is this a groundbreaking movie or anything.<br/><br/>The story is quite intriguing. The story is set in the future in a Britain bereft of hope. In the Britain being portrayed, immigrants are treated as dangerous criminals and pushed into camps, like refugee camps. The human race is plagued by infertility for 18 years. In the midst of all this is a woman who becomes pregnant all of a sudden. The main character is a man named Theo(Clive Owen). He meets his old girlfriend Julian(Julianne Moore) who is involved with some extremist activities. From then on, his life starts taking a turn to the worse.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is the portrayal of the main character. He isn't portrayed as a superhero or a guy who has multiple talents. He is a regular guy who is caught in the wrong place. The movie is from his perspective. So we see his despair and his confusion throughout the movie. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron is topnotch and is one of the things I loved about this movie. The dark feel to the whole movie is appropriate and the whole ""filming from the main character's perspective"" is effective as we get an insight into the mindset of the character at various points of the movie. The use of music is another positive aspect. There is no overdose of music and in many scenes, there is no music at all. This adds to the dark feel of the movie. The scene in the Bexhill refugee camp is especially well done. In this scene we see his confusion and terror as he wants to do his best to protect but he is caught in the crossfire. Clive Owen's performance is quite good and his character would strike a chord with the audience. Julianne Moore, unfortunately, is under utilised in this movie and we don't see much of her. Michael Caine does well in his limited role but he could have been given a larger role.<br/><br/>The ending is a problem for me. I am generally annoyed at these open endings utilised in movies and this was no exception. The lack of a clear ending was not the only problem. The problem is that the ending was so underwhelming and lacked the kind of passion or energy that the rest of the movie had. The political angle was, IMO, a little too much for me. Sure, it is an issue relevant for me too(as I am an Indian). But the political themes in this movie are rammed into your head without any subtlety. The heavyhanded way of presenting these political themes was definitely a negative aspect. There are not many twists in this movie as I expected(but then I am a Christopher Nolan fan). The movie is straightforward from the second half onwards and it becomes a sort of adventure thriller in the vein of Bourne identity.<br/><br/>My rating for this movie would be 7/10. This is because it is quite entertaining from an action thriller viewpoint. I did like Alfonso Cuaron's direction so I would most probably check his other movies."
"sme_no_densetsu","7","3","6","21 March 2008"," Not bad but I don't see what all the fuss is about
","The year is 2027 and there hasn't been a child born in 18 years. Society is crumbling and Clive Owen's character Theo is content to let it crumble around him. That is, until the discovery of a pregnant woman thrusts him into the role of reluctant hero as he strives to deliver her safely into the sanctuary of the Human Project.<br/><br/>One of the strengths of the film is the direction by Alfonso Cuarón. The camera-work and cinematography combine to produce a gritty, realistic world not far from our own. While this is admirable I would have been more impressed if the film's futuristic world was more distinct, as in a film like ""Blade Runner"". Also, while I can respect the craft behind the film's visuals, the bleak look doesn't really appeal to my tastes.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly fine but unremarkable. The area that I think could use improvement is the script. I can only imagine why it took five screenwriters to bring this story to the screen. The fact that they were nominated for an Academy Award (Best Adapted Screenplay) baffles me. The action-oriented parts of the film are satisfying but the background is merely hinted at. The dystopian elements aren't as clearly defined as in ""V for Vendetta"", let alone great literary works like ""1984"" & ""Brave New World"". Perhaps the novel has more depth but this adaptation is little more than a shallow action flick.<br/><br/>I recommend the film; just don't expect something that's in the same league as other dystopian films like ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""V for Vendetta"" and ""Blade Runner""."
"stu9003","7","3","6","15 September 2007"," A film of extreme highs and lows
","Children of Men is a film of extreme highs and lows. In places, the film is mediocre, but in other places it's excellent. In general, I'd say the first hour is mediocre, but the last 30 minutes are outstanding.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me is that the movie does a poor job of creating the overall setting. We're told that it's the future and that no child has been born in over 18 years, but are provided with no reasons as to why this has happened or why it's about to change. We're also told that the rest of the world has somehow gone to hell and that England is the only country left that's still functioning properly. Unfortunately, the film provides no rationale as to how or why any of this happened and provides only the briefest description of the chaos that's going on in the world at large. As a result, I had a hard time getting into this futuristic world. I couldn't really understand why our heroes were running, what the Fishes wanted, or why the Human Project equaled salvation. Consequently, I also didn't really care too much about the characters. At least, not at first.<br/><br/>However, in the last 30 minutes, the film turned into more of a desperate chase style film and this section of the movie was simply outstanding. There were some very powerful and gripping sequences and the director perfectly captured the desperation and chaos of the situation. In particular, there is one notable shot that many others have cited: an 8 minute-long single-take sequence with our hero, Theo, navigating his way through a battlefield. This scene is one of the most brilliant and gripping sequences that I've ever seen. To me, it was right up there with the best shots in Saving Private Ryan and the movie is worth watching just for this one scene alone. 7/10"

I was just unfortunate enough to believe the movie reviewers that unanimously agreed that the movie was a masterpiece. This couldn't be farther from the truth.<br/><br/>The movie begins and ends with no explanation as to why children are not being conceived. In fact, I'm still a little puzzled as to what the movie was ""about"". The very little dialogue that was in the film didn't help explain. I guess the viewer was just supposed to know the general facts and not ask questions.<br/><br/>The character development was poor. I felt absolutely no connection to any of the characters in the movie. As they began to encounter dangerous situations, I found myself thinking ""Who cares?"". There was little, if any, back story on any of them, so it was hard to feel any emotion for them.<br/><br/>The movie itself was gray and dark. I'm supposing that was to create a somber, ominous mood. All that achieved was creating a depressing atmosphere reminiscent of a movie about World War II.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money."
"Rathko","10","3","6","3 May 2007"," A Breathtaking Dystopian Vision
","'Children of Men' is an outstanding movie that rewards multiple viewing thorough the incredibly detailed and multilayered world that Cuaron et al seem to so effortlessly conjure. Their world is the most authentic creation of a dystopian future ever put to film, living and breathing with a terrifying realism and believability. The cool hued, monochromatic and grainy cinematography combined with the hand held camera-work and dizzying, one-shot scenes only enhance the documentary feel of the film. The story is simple, and the performances solid, but ultimately all exist to service the powerful emotional punch of seeing images of torture and repression  familiar to us from archival photographs of Nazi concentration caps, Soviet gulags, Turkish prisons, Japanese POW camps, and Abu Ghraib  transposed on to the streets of London and Bexhill. Of course, we should appreciate such horrors without theatrics and CGI parlor tricks, but the visceral empathy that such images conjure is as fascinating as it is horrifying, and drives home the horrors of dictatorship, guerrilla warfare, insurgency and terrorism.<br/><br/>Though all the performances are excellent, Michael Caine really stands out in a revelatory performance that steals the movie. His character stands as a moral rock at the center of the film and a lesser actor could easily have missed the character's potential. Caine deserved at least award nomination. Oana Pellier is brilliant as the gypsy Marichka.<br/><br/>The conservative criticism of the movie is baffling and reveals more about the oddly paranoid and defense whining of the right than about the movie itself.<br/><br/>Though set within the context of a Western dictatorship, 'Children of Men' clearly marks out the Fishes as the real enemy  treacherous and violent. They are not suit-wearing yuppies of the capitalist system, or church-going suburban paragons of Red State heroism. Instead, the Fishes, the bad guys, are dreadlock wearing, Buddhist chanting, commune living hippies. They're not only liberals, they're caricatures of liberals. The whole movie plays as a critique of terrorism and brutal dictatorships. By showing in graphic detail the effects of political tyranny and terrorism, the movie asks, wouldn't YOU want to be saved from this life? And in doing so, asks us to understand the moral validation for war in Iraq. But of course, the conservative right has never really been that interested in multiple readings and subtle shifts of perspectives. They'd rather just cry foul every time their increasingly fragile and delicate sensibilities are offended.<br/><br/>'Children of Men' is an incredible movie  genuinely thought provoking and powerful  that deserves as large an audience as possible and a far superior DVD!"

","Theo (Clive Owen) was once an activist when he and his ex, Julian (Julianne Moore) were 20- somethings, but now he's a burned out, alcoholic bureaucrat four months behind on the rent and nothing phases him including the death of the youngest person on the planet, Baby Diego, age 18. Women are infertile. Car designs are bad. All immigrants to Britain are illegal and hunted down. And society has lost its cultural knowledge and diverse community except in London where the Royal Horse Guard still roam the streets in perfect formation. <br/><br/>When Theo is kidnapped by urban terrorists called the Fish led by Julian, he begins a life-changing journey to save Kee, who is pregnant, an event that has not happened for 18 years. The bleak situation of humankind is contrasted by the humorous character of Jasper (Michael Caine), an aged political cartoonist turned hippie pot farmer who lives outside the city where he cares for his catatonic invalid wife, a photo journalist who was tortured by MI-5. Jasper provides one of the last ties to the swinging London life of his youth and enables Theo a form of escapism as well as contrast to his own sense of failed politics and ideology. As Theo and Kee try to escape to a Utopian group called the Human Project, they become the foil of both the conflicts between the government and the Fish whose awareness of Kee's pregnancy will provide them with political leverage. As warfare and violence surrounds Theo, his purpose becomes a deliverance that at times verges on the biblical flight of the Xrist child.<br/><br/>The DVD includes extras that provides critical discussions by social critics and noted historians which verge on significant university lectures (take notes), as well as the typical kinds of additional information which add to the visual appreciation of the film. The stellar cast is a pleasure to observe ensemble, however the bleak futuristic appearance of London and the countryside is both depressing and a wake up call. This is not a lighthearted road trip storyline but a complicated critique of the many failures of ideologies, Utopian fanaticism, and nihilist projects gone wrong in every sense. It is thought provoking fare that leaves little to the imagination, but asks audiences to ponder the serious actions of modern society, intolerance, and extremism."

","If I had to sum up Children of Men in one word, it would be... flat. I liked an awful lot of things in this movie. Post-apocalyptic is probably my favourite genre. Michael Caine is a revelation, the quintessential British hero, a podgy guy in an armchair wearing a cardigan. I shed tears when Theo escorts Kee and her baby down the stairs in a war zone, the baby's cries causing a lull in the fighting. Julianne Moore and Clive Owen excel in their roles. The production design is spot on, based on the theme ""Only Britain could be this crap."" The Greenpeace, Guantanomo, Tate Modern satirical moments were slightly annoying but not intrusive. So why did I not get more from this film? I can only guess that it failed to live up to my expectations. I had heard so much about this film, the trailer looked fantastic, but Theo's journey was less than compelling. Perhaps it was too much exposition. Michael Caine's rendering of the story of Theo's son's demise felt a bit clumsy. The turning point for Theo is when Kee tells him she believes he is the only one she should trust, but this key moment is pitched low-key. It is a good film, but it could have been great. In sum, a bit of a missed opportunity."

","There are two things that Harry Potter 3 and Children of Men have in common: odd nature scenes and director Alfonso Cuaron. As you can tell if you've seen both of those movies, they are very different. That goes to show how Cuaron can differ his style to suit the movies best. He goes from fun, fast-paced storytelling action in Harry Potter 3, then delves into serious, unentertaining drama for Children of Men. That's not to say that Children of Men wasn't entertaining; it was, but it wasn't necessarily fun. ""Interesting"" is the word that should be used if you had to sum up Children of Men in one word.<br/><br/>What has made Children of Men so ""universally acclaimed,"" according to metacritic.com, is its all-to-realistic look at the not-so-distant future, where one problem (along with many other small ones) can make everything go wrong. In the case of Children of Men, all women have become infertile. The youngest person on the earth, who was born in 2009, dies at age 19 as the film begins. As it progresses, Children develops some very intriguing characters, mainly Theo (Clive Owen) and Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey). Ashitey delivers a very good performance as Kee, a woman who is discovered to be the only fertile woman left on the planet. It is up to Theo and a few of his acquaintances to save her and have her deliver the baby.<br/><br/>I can't even begin to talk about the mastery of the second half of Children of Men. It is truly like nothing I have ever seen before. A war has broken out in London (the main setting in the movie), and for nearly 20 minutes, the only camera being used is a hand-held one which follows Theo and Kee around the war zone as they attempt to find a save ground for the newly born baby. At one point, blood gets on the camera, and things keep rolling. It's little touches like that that can make a movie so great.<br/><br/>When I left the theatre a week ago after witnessing Children of Men, I didn't feel too high on it, but after looking back, it's very evident as to how much smart planning went into it from the mind of Alfonso Cuaron. The film is so realistic in terms of presentation that you actually feel like you're sitting right next to Cuaron himself as he directs (as cliché as that may sound, it's true). I didn't like the movie as much as some, but thought it definitely was an experience that I recommend to most people who enjoy intriguing plot lines and smart film-making. -Nick Harvey<br/><br/>Good) The whole idea, presentation & production, great vast number of entertaining characters Bad) not really much fun, can drag a bit 137) The number of movies I was on track to see in 2007 after finished watching Children of Men"
"bastard_wisher","10","3","6","10 April 2007"," So, so much more than a Hollywood action movie
","Whoa, talk about a mis-marketed movie! Never have I seen a film's trailer do so little justice to what the film actually is. I went and saw this for $1 at my incredibly sleazy neighborhood second-run theater expecting some neat cinematography ('cause I'd already seen some clips on Youtube) and that's about it. Oh how much more this turned out to be. To call this a ""Hollywood"" film seems grossly inaccurate (save for a few small moments here and there, which I'll get to in a moment), as I can't really think of any Hollywood movie to compare it to stylistically or thematically. It reminds me more of Michael Haneke's ""Time of the Wolf"" than anything else, but with a camera style which actually recalls Gaspar Noe's ""Irreversible"" (an almost absurd thought for a big-budget, studio-backed film). It is this insane cinematography which really earns the film such an outstanding score, since I guess I can see how the same screenplay could have resulted in a pretty stupid movie in anyone else's hands. While certainly not cringe-worthy and pandering, the script does struggle with some very clunky exposition (like every time Clive Owen's dead child is brought up, or when the midwife suddenly begins explaining her back story randomly for seemingly no reason), and strains credibility for the sake of plot-momentum at at least one point (namely where Clive Owen conveniently overhears how The Fish killed his ex-wife. The script's reliance on surprise moments also wore a little thin after a while (the scene where we think Jasper is dead but he isn't works, but by the time we get to where we think the prison guard is going to whack Clive Owen but he doesn't it's gotten contrived). I also found the very ending rather disappointing. Having succeeded so thoroughly at creating an uncompromisingly bleak tone, it feels like a slap in the face to the rest of the film when the ""Tomorrow"" boat appears. If it had ended just a few moments earlier, with Clive Owen and the girl floating alone in their dinky little boat, it would have been amazing. That said, none of these vague flaws do anything in the long run to diminish the sheer impact the rest of the film creates. Through the masterful long takes and unbelievably complexly choreographed mis-en-scene a sense of pure sensory overload and tension is attained unlike anything else I have ever seen. To compare it to the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan"" feels cheap and does no justice to the film as a whole, yet it is the only comparison within mainstream cinema that I can think of. But unlike Spielberg's drivel, Children of Men refuses to soften up, or to take sides. The bleakness is overwhelming and deadening, the violence is jarring and frightening, as much the polar opposite of Quentin Tarantino's violence as I can imagine. The few moments of tenderness feel hard-earned and real, and pack just as much emotional punch to me as the film's violence. I find it remarkable now the film refuses to portray either the rebels or the government as admirable. In the context of the violent frenzy, ""sides"" don't even come into play, it's just pure terror. I loved how the camera would often wander indiscriminately, catching little visual asides and focusing on them for little moments, giving a greater sense of just how much is going on during all these scenes of intense combat, or even just the glimpse of Jaspar and his catatonic wife we get after Clive Owen and the girl leave, something a ""normal"" Hollywood movie would never do. The entire refugee camp sequence is as masterful a piece of virtuosic visual film-making as I have ever seen. Granted, all of this probably loses quite a bit of impact on a small screen, so I'm glad I saw it in a theater, albeit as shoddy a theater as one can imagine, especially since it's really as much of a last chance to do so as I could possibly get (hell, the movie's already out on DVD).<br/><br/>As a side note, anyone who dismisses the film's cinematography because Emmanuel Lubezki occasionally ""cheated"" with the long takes by digitally enhancing them is, in my opinion, not only entirely missing the point but also snobbishly denying the possibilities that digital post-production offer, in my eyes not at all different from refusing to listen to music made on a synthesizer or even to refuse to listen to music on compact disc or MP3!"

","Scene: 20 years from now. Britain is under the yoke of a fascist regime, a virtual police state in which ID cards are required at all times and illegal immigrants are herded into holding pens for deportation. Crazed feral savages roam the land, ambushing cars and throwing rocks at trains for no apparent reason, and the state TV channel pumps out propaganda 24/7.<br/><br/>It doesn't sound all that much different from 2007, but I digress.<br/><br/>The macguffin here is that the world is in the grip of a fertility crisis, no humans having been born for over 18 years. As the film begins, the world's youngest human - the last person ever born - has just been killed by a crazed fan, and a wave of Diana-style emotional incontinence ensues. Enter Clive Owen, a mild-mannered civil servant with a troubled past. One day, he is snatched off the street by his ex girlfriend who, it turns out, now runs some sort of pro-immigrant paramilitary organisation. She has an immigrant in her care whom she wants to smuggle out of the country for some reason, and she needs our Clive to provide the necessary documents.<br/><br/>Of course, when Clive meets the young immigrant she is up the stick in a major way, and his task is to transport her to some sort of offshore fertility research centre so she can be prodded and experimented on in the name of saving the human race. But he doesn't just have the Government to worry about - some rogue individuals hatch a plan to off his girlfriend and keep the pregnant girl to fuel their own ambitions...<br/><br/>The acting here is superb, with excellent performances from Owen, and from Michael Caine as ""Jasper"" (who may or may not be Clive's dad, there's a nice bit of ambiguity there). Charlie Hunnam steals the show as the Geordie traitor, Patric - ""Blaydon Races"" has never sounded so sinister! The cinematography is brilliant and creates just the right atmosphere; the car ambush scene has to be seen to be believed. The story is gripping, with just the right number of twists and turns to keep you interested.<br/><br/>There are a few niggles, however. The ending of the movie is a little annoying and leaves us with several unanswered questions (like, what happens next? Is humanity saved?) The movie doesn't explain how the world came to be in such a state of anarchy (was it entirely because of the fertility crisis, or would it have happened anyway?) or how women came to be infertile. A bit of fleshing out here would have helped the story enormously.<br/><br/>I also have a problem with the political stance of the movie, which I found to be too one-sided and simplistic. There are a number of pro-Muslim set pieces, perhaps alluding to the Israeli/Palestinian situation. The film-makers seem to be saying that Islam (or religion in general?) offers a path to peace, without articulating how or why.<br/><br/>The pro-immigration guys are mostly heroic freedom fighters, acting for the good of humanity, whereas the Government agents are a bunch of callous and sadistic fascists (there are a lot of non-too-subtle allusions to the Third Reich and the Holocaust here, particularly in the detention camp scenes). The Government may in fact have had perfectly legitimate reasons for wanting to restrict immigration, but this side of the argument is not shown here.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is an extremely enjoyable movie, and I look forward to the inevitable sequel."

","I am astounded at the sheer stupidity of some of the whiners here that go on about continuity, story continuity, plot holes, plausibility of the actions of the characters and the events which transpire.<br/><br/>CHILDREN OF MEN is one of the most important and astounding masterpieces of the cinema to come in a long time.<br/><br/>If you want to see a plethora of GOOFS, go to your most popular movie on this IMDb.COM: The Godfather. There are so many mistakes, it's surprising that it could have ever have been considered a ""good"" movie at all. Go see for yourself.<br/><br/>For me, ""The Children of Men"" is a masterpiece because it achieves a vision of future that we cannot imagine but possibly happen with such virtuosity of narrative, acting, production values such as art direction, cinematography, sound and music that we are drawn in and we cannot look away because the events that we witness compel us to continue on, curious, involved, and searching for the next scene to evolve, the next conflict to resolve and because there isn't a moment filmed in this movie that we have ever seen before in exactly this utterly polished manner.<br/><br/>Frankly, if you didn't like this movie, then you do not have a complete vision of just how plausible all of this is. Ugliness, dirt, death, bloodshed, wars, suffering, aggression and terrorism not only from terrorist groups but also from governments are a part of the fate of this world that very few are ready to accept. But there is little that points in the other direction. There is little that points in the direction of peace, understanding and cooperation between all of the peoples of this world.<br/><br/>More than any other movie since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE has been as successful at depicting what a dark, ugly world we will hand down to our children (with some reservation given to BLADE RUNNER & BRAZIL - yet even this was an exercise in ""suspension of belief"", as Hitchcock was so famous for.) Children of Men has shaken me so since I saw it recently that its apocalyptic vision has altered my views regarding our current world and its many possible outcomes.<br/><br/>I know hundreds will disagree with me - but I dare say if you weren't shaken by this film, you may just require a finer examination of the world in your future curriculum.<br/><br/>Enrique Sanchez"

"RogerBorg","10","3","6","6 April 2007"," The art of cinema refuses to lie down and die.
","An astonishing, breathtaking piece of cinematography. Well realised characters played to perfection, a true hero in the pre gun-porn fashion, flawless composition and direction, truly seamless merging of effects, an eclectic score, and a plot that is finely calculated to bring the viewer's involvement to a peak.<br/><br/>Of all the great things about this film, it's the pacing that impressed me the most. It sets the dystopian tone firmly from the very start, but then throttles back a little. For a while it seems to be coasting, but this is just the prelude to a very gradual ramping up of the scenarios and intensity until by the time the final sequences roar onto the screen, your investment in the characters and their situation is absolute. This is helped by the often demonstrated fact that absolutely none of the protagonists in this film are untouchable, and that their demise can be instantaneous and unheralded. You cannot afford to look away for a second, and nor would you want to; I can't remember the last time I could say that about a film.<br/><br/>The only point that can be criticised is the very occasionally clumsy exposition of the back-story to the dystopian world. However, most of that also serves as character development, so I can forgive this tiny flaw. The almost spooky similarities to the setting and tone of the computer game Half Life 2 are, given the production timing of the two pieces, either co-incidental, or due to them independently drawing on the same source material. And if being compared to Half Life 2 is the worst that you can say about a film, it's a high compliment indeed."

I do remember one particular shot running about 5 minutes long that is just incredible...it must have taken extreme rehearsal in order to get that shot down.

"jfreeman5","2","3","6","5 April 2007"," Well Made But Stupid Plot
","Well I will say the film was well made. Acting and directing was great and the film did create a gritty foreboding impression of the future which I so enjoy. However the plot does not really make any sense at all. No one has given birth in 18 years. OK, how does that then drive the countries of the world to ultra nationalism and isolationism? One of the main reasons that western Europe including the U.K. has allowed so much of an influx of immigration from all over the world is the fact that birth rates in these nations have been so very low. These nations need a large tax base to support their governmental structures. If there where no babies born, logic would dictate they would welcome in even more immigrants. It's as if they thought of this really cool idea of a zero birth rate future, but then threw in a subtle swipe against nationalism and anyone who believes in any form of immigration restrictions. There was a scene in which Muslim's in the Warsaw ghetto type ""refugee camp"" where chanting ""allah akbar"". As if they were a part of ""the uprising"". So its just the same old tripe of making the terrorists look like the poor little victims and the white Englishmen as the evil oppressors."
"nauticaboi555","9","3","6","3 April 2007"," A movie for those who look closer
","Children of men is a fantastic movie and I fail to realize why so many people on this website have posted comments about how bad the movie is. Their are many people who have ridiculed the plot by questioning the secrecy of the human project or the meaning behind Kee's pregnancy. Why must so many people need everything explained to them? <br/><br/>For those who looked a little deeper the symbolism in the movie was overpowering and present throughout the films duration. The greater meaning behind Kee's display of her pregnancy in the barn, the presence of the Pink Floyd pig outside the apartment Clive Owen visits in the beginning, etc. It was excellent. I have read statements from people who question the whole issues of infertility and the immigrants. Infertility does not need to be explained, the reality behind infertility and governmental control (as symbolized in the Pink Floyd pig) is veiled for a reason, it is meant to show the audience the confusion and despair inherent in the imagined society and to allow the audience to draw their own conclusions regarding it.<br/><br/>The immigrants head to England for a reason, it is the one country that soldiers on. Many people question why individuals would bother to risk their lives when civilization was crumbling anyway. If you are still alive and you believe that their might be a shred of hope for you and your loved ones in another land, it is only human that you will do everything in your power to survive. The mass immigrations are explained both through basic human instinct and the presence of newspaper clippings throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The lighting is beautiful, the acting is above average and the camera work is nothing short of spectacular. The use of entire sequences consisting of only one camera shot is simply incredible. The camera work was incredibly innovative and I have never felt so embroiled in a movie as when the camera was splattered with blood and then, in one shot, the blood was digitally removed. All technical aspects of this film were mind-blowing.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film there is a group of activists who say that ""infertility is God's curse"". The simple presence of those protesters put a debate in my mind as to who the blame should be placed on. At another point the radio station announces ""let's take you back to 2003 when the world didn't believe in living for the future"". The issue of infertility is simply a metaphor for our disregard for our environment. Only through the proliferation of catastrophe will the world be willing to alter their lifestyle. This movie is a fantastic representation of that. People who want everything explained to them in a movie need not apply here because your impatience will only breed your ignorance as to the quality of this film."

I rank this with some of the best 'mood' sci-fi in cinema history, with Metropolis, the Empire Strikes Back, Blade Runner, 2001, Solaris, and more recently Minority Report and Dark City. So rare is it to go into the theatre these days and be completely and utterly awe struck by the power of a film, that when it was finished I immediately bought a ticket for the next showing and looped right back around and sat through it again. What an experience this was to sit through! A word that comes to mind is 'rich'. There is such careful construction to every aspect of Children of Men, I was flabbergasted when it was passed over for a production design nomination by the Academy. And personally I think the cinematography award was stolen as well... This is some tight, tight film-making right here. I wish I could write more but my brain can hardly process the impact this movie had on me.. I'm without words. I suggest you see this if you still can in the cinema, this deserves to be seen in surround sound in your face more than any other film this year."
"bob-rutzel","6","3","6","1 April 2007"," Powerful Nightmare
","The year is 2027 and man has not procreated for the last 18-years when a virus or plague caused this condition in everyone worldwide. Well, that is until this movie. The movie opens with the news that the youngest living person on the planet has just died and he was 18-years old. Theo (Owen) takes on the responsibility of taking a pregnant Kee (Ashitey) to her people (shhhhh, no one knows she is with child). Yes, this is all about hope.<br/><br/>If you haven't had nightmares since you were a kid, you can get reacquainted with them thru this movie. One shouldn't go from watching a movie where a whole country goes killing-mad (Blood Diamond) to another movie (this one) where all of England goes killing-mad. It's a nightmare. Theo and Kee are constantly dodging bullets, bombs and rocket grenades thru some of the most desolate and bombed out towns and cities one could only conjure up in a nightmare. So I guess it's safe to say the cinematography is really good?<br/><br/>What we have here is this: someone took a short story and made a long movie out of it. Plus to confuse us, they decided to make everyone speak English, you know, from London Town and the only ones we could understand, for the most part, were Michael Caine and Owen. Okay, we understood Kee as she was clear as a bell with no accent. However, I think, in the future, for ""English"" type movies that Michael Caine should play all the parts so we can understand what the heck was said. When the director views the movie before the editors get it, can't he tell no one can understand much of the dialogue? The problem is that he knows the lines and anything close will pass. What a guy.<br/><br/>Maybe the movie should have been titled The Great Escape (already taken) because 95% of the movie is Theo and Kee running trying to get Kee to safety and no one can be trusted. I don't call dodging bullets acting, but that's not being fair as there was some good stuff in here by Moore, Caine, and Owen. Except for not hearing clearly (maybe it's me) the acting by the entire cast was fine. And, the dogs and chickens performed well too. My problem is that the whole movie reeks of a nightmare no one should have or even live thru in a conscious state. I hope they didn't waste color film on this because everything I saw was black and white. Ooops, the police car lights were blinking blue come to think of it. <br/><br/>So if you can console yourself that it all about hope you might enjoy this movie. But, it is brutal in the telling, so you are warned. And, as a thriller, it's pretty good too. However, I need to pick up some of those almost-comedic comedies. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: Yes, Language: Yes"
"socrates99","9","3","6","30 March 2007"," 2027 is realized in a way no one could call implausible
","And that is truly impressive. My sole reason for avoiding this film until it came out in DVD was that I assumed it would all be burnt out buildings and unrealistic gun play. The burnt out buildings are there, but shot in an almost lyrical way that makes them seem as though they could be home. And that's not the only cinematic magic conjured up. Alfonso Cuaron and friends are flexing their artistic skills like confident masters. Clive Owen is perfect, and so is Michael Caine. It's amazing how powerfully they can bring you into the story. The gun play, and particularly the sound of bullets thudding into walls, is very much like the real thing. And the emotions and reactions of those around the protagonists are impossibly evocative of being there in a world despairing of its lack of children. Their reaction to the first pregnancy in 18 years seems so much more insightful than what I visualized. And throughout Cuaron is careful to notice those little things that evoke the sensual familiarity of the scene like being in a rowboat on the ocean, or walking around in flip flops. I'm betting everyone involved in this movie's production is quite rightly proud of it. Well done!"

","In itself the movie has an interesting theme: what does the world look like without children, if we are all dying, no new breed comes. Unfortunately this theme is barely touched by this movie. It says so in the intro, you see some pictures of deserted schools, etc.. And of course the main character is special because she is the only pregnant woman in the world. However, the rest is just the evil chasing the pregnant woman against the hero protecting her and helping her to reach her goal, the ship 'Tomorrow'. I must admit that in itself the acting is good, especially the hippie like character Jasper Palmer by Michael Caine. But other than that, there is nothing interesting going on. So, if you like high school like chase movies, then please go and watch this one, it is thrilling. But if you expect that the main theme of the movie is worked out and some kind of vision is given, then please skip this movie, it isn't worth your time at all."
"captainmarvel1331","10","3","6","6 March 2007"," A once in a lifetime experience...
","This was a movie I had high hopes for. When I watched the trailer in the summer of 06, I immediately bought the book for some sort of means of comparison. The book is good (despite it's obviously religious undertones) so the hype of the movie increased the suspense. Come January 07 I went to the theater with my family and witnessed the best film of the year, and one of the most memorable of the decade.<br/><br/>Similar in size and spectacle to 28 Days Later, Children of Men is an apocalyptic thriller seeking a higher understanding of themes such as hope and love. Alfonso Cauron's direction is immaculate, handling live ammunition, many extras, gargantuan set pieces, and long takes with pitch-perfect sight. A scene shot entirely in a car with one long camera take stands out, as does a shoot-out near the end. The cinematography adds an underlying texture of depression and madness to these magnificent wonders, ad a digital baby looks all too real coming straight from the womb. While it may be the photography of the movie that make it bonds, it's the characters that strengthen it.<br/><br/>Clive Owen, an actor almost unknown to me until now, gives us a powerful, heart wrenching performance as Theo Faron. He is almost numb to the things around him, struggling with his estranged ex-wife's (Julian Moore) plan to sneak someone out of the mass immigration target Britain has become. His surprising re-encounter with her essentially brings him nothing but trouble. Her name is Julian, and her role, although short, is lovable. Then there is Michael Cain, who plays the retired political cartoonist Jasper. He is Theo's only source of friendship and company. But purposely, Theo keeps their relationship distanced. Jasper asks Theo why he won't come move in with him, and Theo replies, ""Because then what would I have to look forward to?"" The smaller roles in the film are powerful and moving as well. There is Kee, the last pregnant woman on Earth, Miriam, a gentle lady who was a mid-wife before babies stopped being born, Luke, the activist who wants the baby solely for political purposes, Syd, a corrupt cop who sneaks Theo into a neo-concentration camp, and Marichka, an immigrant in the camp Bexhill who sacrifices everything to help Theo.<br/><br/>If these aspects of the film aren't dazzling enough, listen closely to the beautiful score composed of John Tavner's Fragments of a Prayer, which breaks your heart every time...like many of the scenes. A docile deer, not startled by the sight of man, running in front of Theo, might shake you. As will the sight of men carrying explosives across a roof right before a battle scene. There are too many of these occurrences to name quite frankly. A cafe exploding as Theo spikes his coffee. An elderly woman holding her dead son in her arms, referencing Michael Angelo's ""Pity"" The camera forcing us to look at two dead police in the road, a door being shot through while Theo attempts to squeeze through it, and of course, Kee and Theo pacifying hundreds of soldiers while they walk with a crying baby between them.<br/><br/>Movies with this kind of emotional core don't come out often."
"perla_arabia","9","3","6","15 February 2007"," Thought provoking
","Its a great movie to watch, but the story was dense i think and was fragmented into many pieces to fit this movie. Many things in the story did not make much sense, for example whats with the Muslim march?. And was it that other terrains so over ridden with war or water (floods)? that everyone fled to UK?. Many things were left loose.. but i think it feels like you have wandered into someone's life by chance in year 2027 and you have to deal with whats around you rather than on what it is based. Clive is outstanding as usual. The basis of this movie is the value of innocence in the world, and how children make the world worth living in. Yet the world only remembers what is lost, and takes the presence of innocence for granted and looks for ways to abolish it. The movie made me think of millions of unborn and born children dying every day in every war torn country, and how would the leaders of armies like it if they were handed a bloody corpse of their own child, because that is what a parent receives wherever there is a war that randomly takes lives. How do we set the price on a child's life, how do we report it as casualty of war, or as losses for greater purpose when these children don't even know what life is!. This movie is thought provoking, and the fact it trans-locates you into the near future 2027 makes more effective in positioning you into that state of mind. Michael Caine in his last 20 years seems to have enhanced mastered the art of selecting great movies, his presence is Golden (as his hair once was :D)."

","I agree with those who say the film does not deserve its current high rating. I had high expectations after reading the reviews. I was rather disappointed. Clive Owen is good, and the film is well filmed in general. The action scenes are realistic. However the film is much shallower than it pretends to be, and there is little that is original in it. Much of the film shows people shooting at one another and otherwise being vicious. But for the ""world-gone-to-hell"" near-future settings, there are better films. There is little character development either. I liked the animals--cats, dogs-- in the film (and there are quite a few). They seemed to embody some sort of normality. It is worth watching if you are a Clive Owen fan, but this film left me with the feeling that it is evasive, escapist and soothing, instead of being bold and thought-provoking which I think it was meant to be."

The cinema has hope.<br/><br/>You watch the first scene as everyone is crowded around watching T.V and then Clive Owen appears in the picture as the camera follows him around after he leaves the store to get his coffee. You think nothing of it then all the sudden something huge happens and from right there to the very end, I was hooked on the story from its complete originality and incredible directing.<br/><br/>There are more than one scenes that the camera keeps on Clive Owen for more than a minute as quick edits and camera angle changes were not common in this masterpiece. There are scenes itself that already completed my thought as the best directed film of the year even (in my opinion) beating out Scorsee in The Departed (also a brilliant film). I really loved this movie as you notice glitches such as blood gets on the camera lens by mistake that could have been edited out but was kept there to give it more character. I also was intrigued by how random people would risk their lives to help Clive Owen's and Claire-Hope Ashitey's character as they took the dangerous journey to save the baby.

Those types of movies are fine, but you have to at least leave the theater with some type of satisfaction. There is no background into anything that was happening in the movie. The only information we had was that no new children had been born in the last 18 years. Well, 27 minus 18 would be 2009. Now, look at how destroyed the world was and how everything is in chaos, wouldn't you think they everyone would be working on trying to figure out why everyone was infertile? There appears to be a lack of updated technology in the movie, but yet in certain scenes you can see what looks like updated technology. A drugged out old man who lives in the woods and smokes pot. This just doesn't seem like a realistic scenario. The reality is that the census would be able to detect a problem like this before it got out of control..there would be a massive panic to collect and save sperm and eggs so that they could create life.<br/><br/>The story line is open ended so nobody knows what happens after this. Just a bunch of senseless killing with no story line. Oh, and who would trust a pot smoking cop. The fact is that none of the story line makes any sense at all. It just wasn't a realistic film.

No character development, with the exception of the character played by Caine. <br/><br/>You can never tell who is doing what to who and why. <br/><br/>I am told the PD James novel on which the film is based was good, but the film is a mess.<br/><br/>Save your money."

","With a 8+ rating, any keen sci-fi fan like myself would surely have had a lot of expectations for Children of Men. So why do I feel so disappointed? In a nutshell, because the story is so simple as and unembellished as to be non-engaging.<br/><br/>WARNING, EXTENSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>It's 2027. The youngest person in the world has just been murdered by an irate fan, because the former wouldn't give the latter his autograph. The whole world mourns. This global child-drought has been in play since 2009. There's no explanation as to why.<br/><br/>No children, no hope, so the world has largely spiraled down the path of despair and anarchy. At least that's how it appears in England, who apparently is still top-of-the-heap. Other countries have fared even worse. The Establishment still exists, but seems to spend a lot of its resources battling a disparate rabble of anti-Govt forces.<br/><br/>Enter the Saviour, or should we say Saviouress, a young, black and very pregnant woman, Kee. Again no explanation why she has been singled out as The Exception. She has her child, aided and abetted by the films antihero Theo, a Govt worker who has some sympathy for the AG forces. His mission is to ensure Kee makes it to the ""Human Project"". There's no elaboration as to the latter, though one can guess. The mission isn't a walk-in-the park by any means, but it offers little above Northern Ireland street-fighting and let's-get-that-terrorist. Theo dies fulfilling his mission.<br/><br/>Once the basic mission is established about a third of the way into the film, there are few if any surprises. London-of-despair is fairly well done but like all scenery it is just that. Brief appearances by Julianne Moore and Michael Caine lift the tone a bit but they are both dispatched relatively early in the film. The film devolves to, OK we've been in some inexplicable child-drought for 18 years and now, just as inexplicably, it's about to break - cool.<br/><br/>Too liberal use of the F-word was a distinct turn off for me - I suppose everyone in 2027 is very angry at life and the general situation.<br/><br/>On a completely different tack: It's largely overpopulation which is creating many of the world's problems, so a child-drought for a generation mightn't be such as bad thing. A world capable of easily sustaining perhaps a billion First Worlders is struggling with Seven, all wanting that better consumer standard of living. 3 of out 10."
"toytrainbob","3","3","6","17 January 2007"," An Inane Story that Survives Only through its Gratuitous Violence
","At times slow and plodding, this movie comes to life during scenes of extreme and gratuitous violence. And admittedly, the violence has such a realistic feel, leaving nothing to the imagination, that the film can be gripping. But you need more than misery and bloodshed to make a good film. Story is important and this film gives the impression they were making it all up as they went along. Some scenes are so incredibly inane and clearly set up for one purpose only, to allow the audience to observe more unrelenting and meaningless violence. Yes, I get it; the world has collapsed, and, yes, there is a strong sense of finality. There are no children, and, therefore, no future for man. And a pregnant girl represents hope and power to those who would exploit her. However, rather than getting caught up in the story, I continuously found myself asking the question ""why"". There is almost no scene I found even plausible, not for the action in front of me which could be mesmerizing, but for the purpose that scene had to the storyline. And that is ashame because the film does have an eerie quality about it. But in the end, it fails to deliver. Yet, I predict this film will have a cult following like ""Dusk to Dawn"" because of its graphic and gratuitous violence."

","Pretty good film with good action sequences and high production values, a decent plot and very good acting. I particularly liked Michael Caine. Lots of social allegory but nothing really concrete about why women can't have children for the previous 18 years. I think a little more background concerning this would have helped here. Why there are waring factions in England centered around illegal immigrants left me puzzled. If here are no kids being born worldwide for a score of years then it seems to me that there'd be lots more resources to go around. Why waste all the energy on nazi-like vendetta? Over all I thought this felt like the middle of a movie with an uncultivated beginning and a dubious ending."

It would be an OK made for TV movie, but not much else. The politics of this film are sophomoric and self-contradictory.

I am surprised he didn't include the wizard of Oz - oh wait a minute, that's Jasper, isn't it. She is searching for a never explained Utopian group called the human project? Illegal immigrants, quite possibly responsible for most of the fascist state's brutal control of the general population, are the sympathy object of the movie? No country on earth could ever accommodate an infinite influx of illegal immigrants and survive. Terrorists are the Heros? Take 12 monkeys and 28 days, smash them together, throw in sympathy for millions of illegal immigrants swarming England and you have children of men.

"chewblocha","6","3","6","9 January 2007"," Not Bad, Not Great
","I went into ""Children of Men"" expecting a very good movie. A friend told me it was one of the best movies he had seen all year (meaning 2006). Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed. While I didn't think the movie was bad, I don't see what the incredible hype is all about. I did think it was above average (hence why I gave it slightly better than a 5 rating), but it wasn't the type of film I would be truly excited to see again.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the cinematography was excellent, and the war scenes/explosion scenes were top notch. I thought the one extended scene that Cuaron shot without a cut (which apparently cost $1 million to shoot) was incredible and the blood droplets that hit the camera added some realism to the shot in my opinion. I know some people have had mixed reviews on this scene, but I really enjoyed it and felt like I was really there running through the shrapnel and gunshots. I also thought the acting was quite good. Clive Owen was great, and I really enjoyed the quirky character that Michael Caine portrays. Julianne Moore was solid as well, although I don't understand why people are saying she deserves an Oscar nomination (she just isn't in enough of the movie to warrant that honor).<br/><br/>Here is what I didn't like about the movie. First off, I felt like there were some things Cuaron (the director) was trying to say in his film that he decided to drive into the viewer's brain instead of being subtle about it. He names the xenophobic government's wing that wants to keep foreigners out of England ""The Department of Homeland Security."" Yes, Alfonso, we understand that you are making a point about treating aliens in a poor way. You didn't need to go that far and link it to America trying to keep illegal aliens from crossing the Mexican border to make said point. Also, the boat at the movie's end which is supposed to bring hope for the future is called (surprise!) ""Tomorrow."" If you are going to use that little subtlety, why not just name Kee's character Mary, her baby Jesus, and Theo's character Joseph? I feel like because of the message he is trying to get across to the audience, Cuaron gets a free pass in how he does it. I thought he could have gotten the point across in a much more subtle manner and not treated us like we couldn't understand simple symbolism. Granted some of this could have been taken directly from the novel, in which case my problem is more with the author than with Alfonso Cuaron.<br/><br/>A few plot points also troubled me. I'm pretty confused as to how the group of anarchists keeps finding Kee and Theo throughout the film. Do they have some sort of tracking bug on them or something? Michael Caine's cabin is in the middle of the woods in a remote place that even the government doesn't know exists. How do these guys manage to find it? Then they somehow manage to find them again later on in a city of people who have been arrested and is filled with war zones? Give me a break! Also, why would the government be giving out suicide kits to citizens when the human race is slowly being diminished? Shouldn't they be trying to keep people alive for as long as possible to try and find a way to prolong the species? Perhaps the biggest problem I had was with the main point that we as human beings should take a look at where we are headed before it is too late. It is a very good message, but why does it make sense that if women are infertile, the world would fall into anarchy? Maybe I am just too optimistic, but I would think there would be more ""The Human Project"" stuff going on where countries tried to solve the problem and less total anarchy and violence. I just feel like there would be less war and more working together to discover what was wrong in a situation like this. I guess that is the main thing that troubled me about the story.<br/><br/>In the end I would recommend a viewing of the movie as I thought its positives outweighed my problems with it. I just thought it could have been better."
"mkohary","9","3","6","8 January 2007"," Best ""End of Times"" movie ever
","Fans of end-of-times movies, great news - this is the best one yet.<br/><br/>It's the near future. Women are infertile. There are no more children, and no prospects for procreation. The youngest people on the planet are 18. Schools lay fallow in disrepair. Nations are collapsing. Britain still operates as a police state, and has closed its borders to all immigrants - only British citizens are allowed to live there. Illegals are rounded up and sent who-knows-where; they are badly treated. Radicals violently protest this injustice, and terrorism is a daily fact of life. You risk your life simply getting a cup of coffee. The end is nigh, the end is nigh! <br/><br/>Against this backdrop, we get both a superb action plot and a high-impact human drama, that rarest of motion pictures. I shall reveal no more and leave the pleasures of the intricate story to the viewer. It's expertly directed by Alfonso Cuaron (""Harry Potter/Prisoner of Azkaban"", ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""), who also co-wrote a brilliant screenplay. The genius of the movie is in the pacing - it starts out fairly sedate with an interesting examination of the world as it exists at that time, and gradually ratchets up the tension until by the end we can hardly stand it any more. The characters are deep and memorable, the dialogue is rich and natural, and the machinations of the plot are unpredictable and pack a great payoff. The acting (Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine among many others) is nothing short of immersive. Our ""hero"" is no Superman, and he spends most of the movie just doing the best he can, which makes him very appealing. The effects are utterly seamless. They're so well integrated you can't even tell what's an effect and what's not. This is no Hollywood picture; there is no melodrama and the camera doesn't flinch from anything, nor does the script ever resort to cliché or convention. In fact, quite early on, it clearly signals that anything goes. The cinematography is top-notch, easily the best I've ever seen in this genre. The soundtrack is suitably downbeat and never gets in the way.<br/><br/>Like I said, best ""world apocalypse"" movie yet. Better than ""28 Days Later"", better than ""Dawn of the Dead"", way better than ""Night of the Comet"". The whole production is triple-A, and a major artistic achievement for Cuaron and his crew. 4 stars out of 4."
"setzerman","Null","3","6","7 January 2007"," Great original piece but well short of a masterpiece
","Children of Men takes a new spin on the sci-fi disaster scenario and does it in style. The cheesy special effects are left in the closet, and the focus is on the story. While the movie is ultimately uplifting, (though it seems not for everyone as some of my movie goers can attest to), there are some deeply depressing/troubling passages, which should be left to a mature and prepared audience.<br/><br/>The result is all in all very convincing, thanks in no small part to competent acting by Owen and a well-written script. Owen's empty whiskey-soaked stare is worth a thousand words and Cuaron seems to have understood this only too well.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie, though I was bored by the prominent religious imagery and concept, and a bit annoyed that plenty of ends were left untied. This is still well worth being seen at the theater or rented on DVD. I would not waste my money on a DVD purchase though, as its re-playability is frankly limited.<br/><br/>Clive Owen (Theodore Faron) - 9/10 - Convincing stuff, good job, hope he doesn't drink as much in real life.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore (Julian Taylor) - 7/10 - Good, but she's frankly a short forgettable bystander in this movie.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor (Luke) - 8/10 - Once again, Ejiofor delivers, though it would be nice to see him play some other role beside the super-action figure all the time.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuarón - 8/10 - Turned a great movie from a great idea, but the religious overtones won't/can't be appreciated by all."

","First I have to say that I liked the movie, had an overall good feeling when I left the cinema. But it was not the same feeling when I first walked in, expecting something more.<br/><br/>The idea of a near future where something like global infertility has effected everyone with out of control chaos and forced order in society appeals as a good main story, too bad it is only a background one here. This movie is more about hope, good vs evil, redemption, and maybe a little love. We also see that the chaos in the setting of the story has its roots in the issues we have to today. Issues like terrorism, immigration, homeland security, dirty politics and many others. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Hollywood prevails, and even though i have not read the novel, i doubt the movie is a close adaptation, there is forced added-in humor all around, sometimes unexplained things and extraordinary feats, and useless detours that felt out of place.(I am talking about the urban firefights near the end, that were visually very well done, but did fit-in for this movie)<br/><br/>I would of like to see more of the world's state and how society lived, especially in other countries. So if you think this ""Children of Men"" is the new ""1984"" your wrong(sadly)<br/><br/>If you are just looking for a ""better"" Saturday night film this is it, its thought provoking, good acting, entertaining and visually spectacular. A 8 out of 10 for me because i never forget it could of been made better."

"Mxzplk","Null","3","6","21 December 2006"," The End of Times: In Children of Men, humanity confronts with its slow and absolute extinction
","The most elegant and studious British crime authors, P.D. James, 86 years-old, is also the one that knows best the subject which she writes about: married to a doctor that came back schizophrenic from World War II, she felt obliged to become the supplier of the family by initiating a career as public server that would culminate, in the 70's, with a high post in the criminal division of the Interior Ministery - from which got her to deal with criminal authorities from all over the country, and to recruit criminal pathologists for the British forense medicine labs. It was one hell of an experience, and P.D. James made use of it not only in elaborated (and pessimists) thriller books but also in a story which, at first glance, is a strange body in her curriculum - the science fiction Children of Men, where the human race is predestined to disappear not in a sudden way, due to a cataclysm, but little by little, because of an eruption of infertility that has been going for years. With the romance, the writer puts in focus a commonly peripheral question of all apocalyptic fiction: how men and women would behave in the day-by-day, and what moral choices they would make, if they knew that there is nobody left to inherit their world? That is also the idea that Mexican film maker Alfonso Cuarón keeps firmly centralized in his adaptation of the book to the big screen.<br/><br/>Before anything else, it is necessary to say that the brazillian title inverts the meaning of the path the film walks on. (I say brazillian title because that's where i came from, and where i watched the movie as well) It takes place in 2027, and since 2009 there isn't a registration of any birth on the planet. The youngest human being just has been murdered for refusing to sign an autograph - and the last ones that were born are treated like gods and act like ""assholes"", according to the definition of the bureaucrat Theodore Falon (Clive Owen). Faron lives in England, one of the few countries that still resist in some way. The rest has already turned into vinegar, and the British borders live pursued by multitudes of immigrants. When these swell, the more grows the number of policemen and the control of the State. What the movie of Cuarón transmits better is the futility of these efforts. Without a biological tomorrow, there isn't a way and neither a why to contain the material and spiritual disintegration. Here it is, then, the paradox that treats on both book and movie: it is the most primitive of all impulses - of the continuity of the specie - that lies the reason for all civilization. There goes as well the title, which paraphrases the 90th psalm: ""And the Lord said: 'Come back sons of Adam, to the dust which you left'"" (something like that). Against all his beliefs (or lack of them), however, the bureaucrat Faron gets involved with a rogue group that located something that no one imagined possible - a pregnant woman. It is a miracle so huge as any other in the Scriptures. But this new Eve, black and illegal immigrant, is a political triumph for anyone that puts their hand on her. Despite the notable nimbleness of Cuarón (also known for And Your Mother Too and the third Harry Potter) as a narrator and visual creator, Children of Men imposes a first obstacle to the viewer: it is necessary to buy its premise in one go. Surpassed this barrier, it becomes one of the most intriguing movies, that doesn't get tired of exploring an unsolved dilemma: there is nothing that the human being isn't capable of corrupting, and nothing that he isn't capable of saving as well."

","The idea was great the execution weeeeeeeeeeell not so much :-( Between now and 2026 there's such short period of time that it is very unlikely that anything even close to what is depicted in the movie would happen. Also not much has been said on how the situation evolved into being a war between immigrants and .... who is on the other side British citizens or the government? Who is the leader, is there still democracy or - human rights hardly exist. What is that? Is is Britain or Guantanamo? Infertility affecting all, Hmmm that is interesting but how is that gonna happen. <br/><br/>I also lol'ed at the German immigrants in the caged areas. Is it a shout out to Germany in any way? <br/><br/>For me the movie was too shallow tapping on certain issues (immigration, racism, Muslim -Christian conflict) without providing the audience with some depth and a glimpse of the multilayered problems - and points of views - that are behind. <br/><br/>Ultimately it came down to good guys and bad guys (even if you could argue that the bad guys meant good). Cliwe Owen looks good but there's nothing else in it. My all time favourite actor Michael Caine is sadly not given anything to show.

","I will be very honest, I wouldn't have said that about Children of Men four years ago. When I saw it for the very first time, I didn't like it very much, while I loved the cinematography, direction and soundtrack I found it rather dull and confusing. On rewatch some time ago, I was dumbfounded at how wrong I was initially, and since again it has very quickly become a favourite of mine.<br/><br/>I do agree that there is the occasional surfeit of plot exposition and that it is slow. However, the story with its wonderful concept left me transfixed throughout. As for it being slow, I got the impression it was meant to be slow to add to its haunting atmosphere. Also Children of Men is one of those movies I think that you need to see more than once to truly appreciate it.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is very well chosen and beautifully incorporated into the story. The two John Tavener songs were very beautiful and haunting, and brilliantly performed. Jarvis Cocker's Running the World was okay, while the Shostakovich was a real treat. Same with Ruby Tuesday. My favourite was Mahler's amazing Kindertotenleider, sublimely sung by the king of Leider(for me anyway) Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Clive Owen is really quite excellent in the lead, with a brooding and charismatic presence this is the best I have seen him act. Julianne Moore is lovely and very believable. Michael Caine is the real star of the cast though, his turn here is simply glorious.<br/><br/>The best assets of Children of Men are the visuals and direction. Children of Men is a triumph when it comes to visuals. The decision for the use of hand-held camera was a risk but it worked so well with the dark and affecting atmosphere. The scenery is also miraculous and the colours are wonderful. But for me, this is Alfonso Cuaron's movie, a very underrated film-maker Cuaron's direction is absolutely superb.<br/><br/>Overall, maybe not completely flawless but amazing. I also disagree with the naysayers that it is overrated, in my opinion it is the other way around. This film is very well made, has a great soundtrack, an interesting concept and story, exhilarating action sequences, fine acting and I seriously think Cuaron should have more credit for his direction here. Maybe not for everyone, but I loved it, something that I almost definitely wouldn't have said four years ago. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

The film was full of wonderful cameos by Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, and a wonderful performance by Clive Owen in the leading role. The movie is a comment on our current climate with an interesting proposal about our future that states itself in a non-forceful way, and the camera work, at least from my ignorant perspective, was some of the most beautiful I've seen.<br/><br/>There were long, sweeping shots that were beautifully choreographed (one notable several minute scene is obviously all done in one perfect take because you can see the blood spattered on the camera lens), and there is so much (so much) in this film that is said without words. In fact, I would say that there was more said without words than in the scarce dialogue, and the scene with Clive Owen walking a frightened mother through a crowd of armed men toward the end of the movie brought me to tears with absolutely no words said.

There was absolutely no story line (well actually there was a bit of one but they really didn't follow it). I personally do not know why people have gave this movie such a high rating when it is pure crap. All they do is shoot people the whole entire movie. And the ending? dear Lord the ending... shows the chick and her baby floating around waiting for the boat and that is it. If you are planning on seeing this movie (dont) I strongly recommend renting it. Do not go out and see it. You will be waisting your money."

","Children of men is philosophical, Intelligent and frightening realistic. Thumbs up for the small futuristic indications in music and technological gadgets throughout. A surprisingly good performance by Clive Owen for a change. Outstanding one-take camera-work. You must love the dirt on the lens. Excellent cinematography and editing. A technological masterpiece. You really wonder if it is really cgi. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. Totally cult already. <br/><br/>This film has been in my mind ever since I went to see it.

","This movie is a Saving Private Ryan rip-off. It's one man's quest to save another person, from what, we are never told - but why bother with details? The violence is so graphic, and frequent, it must consume half the movie! To be perfectly honest I left the theater feeling bored and empty! I was also incredulous: Where's the story? At least Saving Private Ryan had a beginning, middle and end. This mockery of a sci-fi film had virtually no beginning or end - it felt like one overly long chapter of a book taken out of context. Not my idea of good story telling!<br/><br/>I can only speculate this film is doing so well in the United States because a large segment of the American public enjoys watching scenes of incredible violence and destruction. I'm tired of it! It's dreary, monotonous, and annoying! We have enough butchering going on in the real world that I don't need to pay to watch it, too!<br/><br/>What makes this movie so incredibly sad is the waste of such outstanding acting talent! Don't actors, and their agents, bother to read the scripts before they sign on? If top acting talent started saying no to junk, then junk would be harder to sell to the movie-going public!<br/><br/>What messages are the viewer left with while watching this godforsaken movie? The human race will go barren for no apparent reason. The entire world, except Great Britian, (for some strange reason), will be reduced to savagery. The British government that does survives will, of course, be fascist. Those who oppose the government will have to be terrorists. The good guys are so few, there's only a handful of people willing to save the last child on earth. People become terrorists because, ""they just want respect!"" (How touching, I never knew terrorists had such sensitive feelings!) The good guys come out of the blue, and you will know absolutely nothing about them, except they know how to pilot a large boat. People die constantly from stray bullets. (Then don't stand-up while the shooting is going on silly!) So many people die in this film, it becomes an art form: How many different ways can people possibly fall down in the same movie? It must set some sort of record! <br/><br/>I repeat! This is not sci-fi! This is a war film, geared to teenage boys and young men. If you want to see really powerful & intelligent sci-fi then let your fingers do the walking over the Internet and purchase (not in any special order): 1. Zardoz, 2. Soylent Green, 3. Beneath the Planet of the Apes, 4. Silent Running, 5. Enemy Mine, 6. Light Years (By Rene Laloux), 7. Fantastic Planet, 8. Final Fantasy - The Spirit Within, 9. Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), 10. Bicentennial Man, 11. GalaxyQuest (for comic relief!). While taste in film is personal, like any art, these eleven films, seen together, could change a person's life!"

","Well - as you can see I am a Romanian. It seems that in all movies we appear we are shown as being ""gipsy"" or some inheritans of Dracula (a character who never exist in reality). All these things proves me that the people who wrote the screenplays has no knowledges about history (Universal History) and geography and more than this they don't even come in our country to see the difference between us and what we are calling ""Rromas"" (gipsies). For others info, ""Rroma"" can be meet in many European countries under different local names and their roots are in India from where they start to migrate arround 1050 and arrived in this regions with Tartars invasion. Opposite, Romanians (a very unhappy similar spelling between ""Rroma"" and ""ROMAnians"") have very old roots (from Dacs and Romans) and they belong to this country thousand year before ""Rromas"" started their migration. As a conclusion, rather than called us in your movie ""gipsy"" and give this name to actors who speak romanian language you should open a history book and learn that because our people who stopped the Turks Empire here on the Danube river you - Western Europeans were able to develop everything you have (we didn't have the ""privileges"" as you have to build huge castles or palaces as we had to burn all the time our villages and hide the women and children in the woods or caves in order that our men to fight against turks) Regards people and don't forget you have no rights to name us ""Rroma"" as are no similitudes between us and them(just that they have settled here as a different ethnical)"

","In the not too distant future, women have stopped giving birth. No one knows how it happened, all we know is that it happened. The world is on the brink of destruction and only Britain remains intact. After word that the world's youngest person has died at the age of 18, a bomb goes off killing dozens of people in a coffee shop. Theo a former activist meets up with Julian, former lover and activist and discovers that a young woman KEE is pregnant. It's now up to him to get her across the dangerous road side in order to save humanity.<br/><br/>Cuaron directed the best Harry Potter film to date and scores again with his recent film Children of Men. Children of Men is one of three films directed by the ""Three Amigos"" the other two being Pan's Labyrinth and Babel. I haven't seen the other two but it would take something very special to take the top spot. As depressing and desolate as this film is, there is a message of hope all throughout.<br/><br/>Theo, the main character played by Clive Owen is thrown into a mission that could mean his life. There are dangers all throughout the world and the last thing he needs is to add more of it near him. Theo never seems to smile, other then when he is with Jasper, his hippie friend, played comically by Michael Caine. Caine does well with what he's got. Even though the character is suppose to be the comedic relief, Caine plays him with a bit of sorrow. Owen plays Theo with a calm undertone and is convincing as a man torn apart by one terrible incident in his life. It's a strong performance.<br/><br/>The film's pace is slow when it needs to be and fast when it needs to be. All the characters have one goal in this film and the film never strays from that goal. Theo must get this woman to the Human Project. There are twists and turns on the way to their goal, of course, but it never gets overdone with any subplots. This is surprising because a lot of futuristic films are hard to follow (12 Monkeys for example).<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Children Of Men is the most visually stunning film of the last 5 years. There are 3 distinctive scenes in which everything is simply breathtaking. First of all would be the ambush on the car. Although it's not all done in one take, it is cleverly edited to make it appear so. The scene itself is not only beautiful but thrilling. The second scene happens half way through the film, but I won't say what happens so I don't spoil it for you. The third scene in question is in climatic battle at the end that is stunning beyond words. The hand held camera adds more authenticity to the scenes in which we all feel like we are in this war torn world. That last scene is as scary as it is brilliant. Having Owen and the camera operator run through these dangerous encounters is wonderful. I can't praise this one scene enough. Probably one of the best scenes to grace the screen in cinema history.<br/><br/>The film itself is frightening in it's dark crisp vision of the future. Children of Men is a remarkable experience and an incredible achievement in film. Cuaron and co have created a future that some will claim is a clear cut copy of what we are living in today. Politics aside, this future he has presented us is dark. The film has only a handful of lighthearted moments, most of them are with Caine in his hippie state. Cuaron never sticks us in the face with the film's message, while films like Blood Diamond are heavy handed with it's message, Children of Men asks us to simply think about our future and what we can do to help it.<br/><br/>I can't say enough praise for this film and what it has achieved. It's not only a bench mark in film, but it's entertaining. With strong performances from everyone involved and Cuaron's keen eye behind the camera, this film is a wonder to behold. I urge everyone to see this film, even if it's just for the last scene alone. Visually pleasing and if you can handle it's bleak overtones you will enjoy yourself. One of the years top five films."

","This movie was absolutely horrible! Most of the action was seen io the previews. You never find out why children aren't being born. And you never find out where they are taking the pregnant girl. Which is really ridiculous, because if the entire human race was going extinct, I thing the duh-heads would want to take the girl to scientists, so they could examine her and the baby. This movie was obviously made by left-wing anti-government ideologues. Michael Cane played a neo ""60's acid causality'. The anti-war propaganda was quite evident, replete with references to ""Bush"". The left-wing propaganda notwithstanding, the movie was slow paced, lacked plot depth, and was painfully slow moving. I couldn't wait until it was over."
"ascott-24","3","4","10","4 February 2007"," Actors OK ...Production gets an F
","The director, the director of photography and the camera person should be ashamed of themselves. Camera panning causes blurred images on screen which cause eye stain. Extended camera shots in boat on water actually caused motion sickness. In the scene where some blood splatters on the lens (too long on lens) made it seem like a documentary. The blood splatter was good but as the action moved on, it should have been removed. The storyline was OK but left me wondering, what is the ""Human Project"". It was never clearly explained what it is.<br/><br/>I think Clive Owen did a great job with his character and I have always liked Michael Caine. His portrayal of a life long hippie was great."
"andrewxrogers","10","4","10","29 December 2006"," The Best Movie This Year
","Children of Men constantly tugs at your mind while you watch, pushing your understanding of today by reflecting it in a grim and hopeless tomorrow.<br/><br/>The movie works on a number of different levels. Obviously, there is the intellectual attraction in a good examination of a possible future. How we got to where we are is never bluntly explained, but slowly slipped over to you in newspaper clippings taped blotting out windows in the background of an interrogation cell or mentioned in passing in a news broadcast. This subtle exposition leaves sparks as many new questions as it answers, and leaves your mind thirsting for more context and a second viewing.<br/><br/>The actors give wonderful performances. Clive Owen is reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart as the worn-down hero pressed by circumstance into an unsought role of protector of humanity's hopes. This is a protagonist who weeps at the death of friends by cowering behind a tree as the shock of the horror he has witnessed (and perpetrated) overcomes him. Julianne Moore provides a textured reading as the leader of an extremist group, clear-eyed but boiling with barely suppressed rage. Michael Caine is a joy to behold as a twinkle-eyed satirical pothead living off the grid while caring for his wife who had been tortured into catatonia by the police.<br/><br/>The supporting performances are similarly strong. I was particularly affected by Pam Ferris as Meriam. Introduced as a caregiver to the pregnant Kee, she grows and expands throughout the film, hearkening back to the quiet tragedy as women stopped conceiving children years before.<br/><br/>But it was the visual impact of director Alfonso Cuaron and his team who lift this film from good to great. The set design perfectly captures a believable future of no hope: technological improvement at the margins while the dirt and grime only gets worse. The opening scene is filmed in one shot, ending with a devastating shock. But two set pieces stand out far above the rest. A stunning action sequence moves around and outside and back inside a car under attack from a gang of marauders, featuring motorcycle crashes, shootouts, and a complete shift in mood from buoyant playfulness to intense fear and then to despair without a single seam. The camera trickery could come across as showy, but it instead sharply enhances the storytelling by bringing the audience inside sequence.<br/><br/>The tour-de-force of the film is a shockingly long 8-minute single shot that begins with Clive Owen's Theo pushing a woman in a wheelchair through a crowd and proceeds through an ambush, series of gun fights, into a bus loading with refugees, a tank attack on an apartment complex seized by heavily armed rebels, a trip into the building and up several flights of stairs, a lengthy exchange of dialog and finally the incredible exit of Theo, the new mother Kee and the first child born on earth in almost two decades through the lines of soldiers, rebels and cowering civilians out of the building and to a waiting boat. The gritty realism of the scene, combined with touches like blood splattering the lens, lend it a documentary quality that greatly increases the power of the film. This is virtuoso film-making that does not overpower the story but instead powers the story to higher intensity.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is a powerful political comment on our own times. The refugees crying for help as they stand in cages like animals continue throughout the film and are strongly reminiscent of fascist-occupations in the Second World War. The arrival at a refugee camp evokes images of concentration camps and Abu Gharib, Guantanemo Bay and the gulags. The sharp juxtaposition of images leaves the viewer haunted by the knowledge that this evil is being perpetrated on people right now, by our own government. This is not science fiction, so much as exposure of the costs to liberty suffered in the war on terror. Like the best artists under the soviets or the mullahs of Iran, Cuaron attacks the powerful through carefully veiled fiction.<br/><br/>I can hardly wait to see it again."
"twistedsyntax","8","4","10","24 September 2006"," Deep Political Symbolism
","Being somewhat of sceptic of any movie coming from Hollywood, I find myself pleasantly surprised with this movie. Alfonso Cuarón paints a picture of society set in a not so distant future, a society where class divide, discrimination and brutal repression have become integral polices of the British Government. The movie uses contemporary social issues affecting the U.K and in general the Western Hemisphere to highlight the main theme of social injustice and despair. I feel the story of women being unable to procreate is merely a sideline, the true message focuses on what the world has become, drawing on the example migrant resentment and hate, the film also outlines that Islamophobia and discrimination of Muslims has become common place in a not so distant Britain. The film uses a Neo-Marxist approach to understand the society, where the ruling class government will boycott minorities (migrants), use fear and manipulation to create a totalitarian and authoritarian state. Evidence of this is subtly put when Micheal Caine sates that when there is political scandal of sort a bomb goes off, deflecting the attention of the masses away from the government. The vivid imagery and violence adds a true sense of realism to this film, this of course is visible most of all in the end battle scene or ""Uprising"" as mentioned in the movie and is the pinnacle of the movie, what must be noted that if you looked closely when the refugee camp scene starts you will spot the words Intifada(uprising) written in Arabic on one of the walls. The refugee camp scene draws many parallels with Guantanamo Bay(camp x-ray) and in Iraq the Abu Ghraib Prison used by the American army to dehumanise Iraqis not to mention conjuring up memories of the holocaust. The most important parallel of the movie is the end battle scene one cannot help bridging the refugee camp and Uprising (Intifada) and tanks rolling in and bombing the city to bits an echo of the Palestinian West bank refugee camps being destroy by Israeli army incursions. The end scene is without a doubt the most gripping and powerful of the movie. Clive Owen, Micheal Caine and Julianne Moore give a excellent performance in this eye opener of a film."

The plot, the acting and all the lose ends combined with the non-ending end made this movie deserve not more than a 0.<br/><br/>Okay so mankind is almost extinct and the whole world has become crazy. So what happened? only one word said in the movie: ""The Flue"". That didn't explain the weird hippie like behaviour of the immigrants and why they where fighting. That means that no one knows what caused this problem and the world needs saving. Then the miracle happened; a child is born! So now what? Well if you have mother, father and child and you immediately start figuring out how and why this child is born there might be a chance that A This is just a coincidence B neither the mother nor the child have the answer, but the father of the child or his grandparents have the answer C the child and/or mother have some magic blood and the world is saved. What if the father has the answer? No one knows who he is. So why children of men as a title and not child of unknown man? I admit the action was not very bad, but the acting was.

","My friend saw this movie in the theater and just wouldn't be quiet about how awesome it was.

I didn't hesitate when I saw it and I watched it this morning and I have to say that this film definitely kept me going, it was so scary to see how much of a possible future we have. It was so realistic and just scary to think of how fast we turn on each other. Not to mention how we take for granted the sound of a child or a baby's cry, we complain about it all the time, did you ever wonder what the world would be like without that sound? <br/><br/>The year is 2027, a world where there are no young people. In fact, the youngest person was 18 years old and was murdered, there are no children, and it's not possible for a woman to get pregnant. But when Theo gets back in touch with his wife, she begs him to help a woman who got pregnant somehow. He must help her in this savage world and time where she will be killed for being an illegal immigrant. The task gets harder and harder when there is a group of terrorists after them, not to mention the government.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a truly horrific movie that everyone in my opinion needs to see. I don't know why it got to me so bad, but that I think this future may be a strong possibility. The film in itself was very brilliant and makes you think. The casting couldn't have been more perfect.

"KnightsofNi11","9","3","7","10 August 2011"," Sci-fi masterpiece
","Great sci-fi only comes around once in a while in this day and age. A truly brilliant piece of science fiction will rarely appear amidst the sea of mediocrity that is today's sci-fi flicks. And it also comes in the most unexpected form, a form like Children of Men, a bleak story set in the near future where the human race has become infertile. The film follows Theo, a cubicle worker and former activist. Theo's wife, Julian, is the leader of an activist group who get Theo to join their cause. Theo is reluctant at first but joins when he realizes they are protecting a woman who is miraculously pregnant. It is then Theo's duty to transport this woman to a sanctuary at sea, because she may be mankind's only hope in this dystopian hellscape the world has plunged into.<br/><br/>Children of Men has a fantastic plot which exceeds all expectations. The film begins by throwing us headfirst into this chaotic and grotesque future. It opens with a group of peopled crowded into a pharmacy watching a news report on the world's youngest person being murdered. Theo enters, makes his way through the crowd to the front counter. And then, as soon as he leaves the store a bomb explodes next door, leaving us with a ringing in our ears as we watch a woman who's arm has just been blown off stumble out of the store. This image is brilliantly haunting and so perfectly sets the stage for the rest of the film, a bleak dystopia full of hopelessness and despair, violence surrounding us and lurking around every corner. This mood is never lost in the film, and every plot twist drives us further down the dark pit of despair that the world of Children of Men encompasses.<br/><br/>The story and structure of this film is great, but what really makes it the masterpiece that it is, is the atmosphere. This film has a fantastic look to it that perfectly matches the tone of the characters and events. Every scene is overcast and we are boxed in by grey buildings and grey skies. Even in scenes with trees, the green has a bleak tint of grey to it, accentuating the lack of hope which humanity now has. And even more amazing is the way this film's ingenious director, Alfonso Cuaron, captures this atmosphere. He directs this film with the most sincere attention to detail. Every single setting and every last scene matches the atmosphere of the film perfectly with so much detail that you will surely get something new out of this film every time you watch it.<br/><br/>And Cuaron plunges us right into the middle of the action with his direction. The film is shot on a very personal level so we feel like we are right next to Theo as he runs through the haggard streets of London. I realized how much Cuaron wanted us to be in this action when, at a certain moment, somebody gets shot close to the camera and blood sprays, actually leaving specks of blood on the camera lens. The shot lasts another couple of minutes with these specks of blood dragging us into the intensity in an uncanny and ingenious way. There are shots in this film that last literally five or six minutes as the camera follows Theo around the streets, dodging bullets and tanks, people running amok and buildings crumbling in every direction. This film will put a wide eyed look of awe on your face, a look which you can't wipe away until it is all over. It is a true spark of genius.<br/><br/>This is a film I could watch over and over again, gaining more from it every time I watch it. It is brilliant on so many levels, and is the true utilization of sci-fi as an art form. The film is smart and atmospheric, drawing the audience into the film in a way few films can, especially one of this genre. This is a must see film that will absolutely blow your mind as you watch such eloquent destruction unfold so well on screen. I can't say enough good things about this film. You have to see it for yourself."

","My score: 7 out of 10 I expected this to be yet another set-slightly-in-the-future, run-from-the-fascist-government, your-friends-drop-off-one-by-one survival movie, urban-warfare movie. I suppose I cannot honestly think of another movie that combines ALL those elements. ""Minority Report"" - a brilliant original concept - has all but the friends-dropping aspect. ""Logan's Run"" omits most of the urban-warfare. Frankly, I felt ""The Pianist"", which, of course, is set in the 1939 Warsaw ghetto, comes the closest to matching the feeling of being on the run from a omnipresent fascist government and surviving under barren war-torn conditions as in ""Children of Men"".<br/><br/>The incredibly-long-single-continuous shots in the urban warfare scene deserve a rewind: I lost my attention span somewhere halfway and don't remember where each edit cut begins.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but think of Clive Owen in ""Shoot 'em Up"" and every other high-octane film where he is constantly being shot at and laugh a little bit.<br/><br/>The acting is great. I believe they got the technology ""right"" for the year 2027 - very little improvement: a few animated advertisements on the sides of buses (and weed is still illegal!).<br/><br/>Here are the three big negatives: no where is it revealed specifically WHAT the UK government and what the Fishes want with the newborn baby. I really wanted to know that throughout the entire movie. Was one side desiring to repopulated the earth, or just one portion of it, and the other side opposing, or vice versa? What did the two major issues of infertility and an immigration problem out of control in the UK have to do with each other? For this kind of movie, I felt they really needed to be related, because, otherwise, my mind could not help think throughout the movie that a long period of worldwide infertility implies a general DECLINE in human population and, hence, a REDUCTION in immigration problems? I was SUPREMELY disappointed in the sudden ending, expecting the story to go fully into whatever the Human Project was about, even if it was to repopulate the earth. I still needed to know the details. Perhaps, that was NOT its purpose: who knows? Perhaps another twist lay in wait."
"mentalcritic","9","3","7","9 May 2007"," An amazing vision of the future
","Every so often, one sees a film that affirms everything they believe in, or changes the way they see the world. Children Of Men is a little of both, not least because it constructs the world in which it takes place with meticulous attention to detail. Based on a story describing one of our greatest nightmares, Children Of Men can even be loosely interpreted as a metaphor for how we would respond to living in a world where we perceive everyone around us as taking for granted what we consider an impossible dream. Set in a somewhat distant future, Children Of Men tells the story of an England that is part of a world where infertility has become the one universal trait for every woman in the world. Through a number of visual cues, we are informed that infertility rates started to accelerate until around the year 2009, no woman will conceive or carry a child to term for another eighteen years. The result is a society in which youth is so highly prized that it can bring instant fame to those in possession of it.<br/><br/>The story begins with the news that the youngest known citizen of the world has been killed. As tragic as this news seems, things are about to get even worse for Theo, a rare good performance from Clive Owen. Theo is a former activist working at a government bureau who finds himself being suddenly abducted by still-active activists, led by Julian, an even rarer good performance from Julianne Moore. So far as Theo knows at the beginning, Julian is simply asking him to help escort a woman to safe haven. But after the first stage of the trip goes haywire due to the intervention of one political faction, Theo is shown the Earth-shattering truth by the woman he is escorting. Not only is this the first woman to have conceived a child in around eighteen years, she is also the first who looks like she might actually deliver. Never mind that she looks all of fifteen years old, as they say, this event is so highly amazing, it is a credit to the filmmakers that they can make something so mundane seem like the second coming.<br/><br/>During the first seventy minutes of the film, the world our characters inhabit is so well-realised that we accept its reality within ten minutes. Suspending disbelief is a lot like teaching someone to swim. You either do it in slow, graduating steps, or you throw the person in and hope they float. The latter approach is the riskier of the two, but it can be done if the right set design or props are in place. Both of these things and more are present in Children Of Men, and I was frequently left wondering where all of the seemingly abandoned locations were found. During the 1980s, films that depicted a bleak future with the world on the verge of collapse, or already in the throes of collapse, were becoming a flood on the market. None came so close to selling the illusion that they were live photography of what they were depicting as is the case in Children Of Men. This is as close as a film in the English language has ever come to depicting a world after its end, or is ever likely to.<br/><br/>Alas, the film is not entirely perfect. The last twenty minutes in particular degenerate into a repetitive action scenario, with the final struggle to get Kee and her newborn child to the promised land in particular letting the side down. It almost feels as if the writers got to the final act and decided that getting the child out to sea without a mass gunfight was just not climactic enough. Also letting the side down is the photography. While there is no deliberate shaky-cam, overuse of the wrong camera technique can lessen the impact of what one sees. Sleepers, for instance, suffered badly from the constant steadicam work, and Children Of Men falls victim to the simple fact that there is just too much hand-held. I fully expect people to defend this decision by claiming it puts the viewer into the action. The meticulous set design and storytelling did that for me already. What the wobbly camera does is give me the feeling that I am watching a drunk uncle's home video. And trust me on this, my uncles' lives are not that interesting.<br/><br/>Speaking of the photography, most of the film is shot in long, continuous takes. Unlike the hand-held, this artistic decision pays off in spades, giving the effect that the hand-held, and the shaky-cam in other films, fails to. The initial sequence in the car when we are introduced to Kee is a continuous twelve-minute take that must be seen to be believed. Speaking of things that must be seen to be believed, the moment when the soldiers stop firing to watch as the baby is brought past them is one of the most mesmerising shots out of all the two dozen films I have seen this past fortnight. They went to enormous trouble to accomplish what was intended in this film, and the end result has made it worth every penny. The hand-held camera and final action sequence aside, Children Of Men is one of those happy accidents of film-making where all of the elements come together exactly at the right time. It always strikes me as ironic that the most affirming and encouraging films or stories often come from their creators being willing to face up to the darkness in all of us.<br/><br/>Children Of Men is a flawed masterpiece denied perfection only by a few ill-advised artistic decisions. A nine out of ten film."
"crix-4","3","3","7","5 May 2007"," The voting mechanism is corrupt
","I am astounded that this film has ranked in the top 250 films and opens a big question about how the voting mechanism is open to some form of corruption. I cannot believe that so many people seriously think this film is a top 250 film. It starts with a great concept and turns it into a very ordinary chase movie. All plot point do not have to be expanded on but one hopes that at least some of the story points are fleshed out to some degree. There was no credible reason for any of the actions of any of the characters. Stylistically it was well put together but at the end of the day one expect a good story and it was ultimately nothing but a trite chase movie. I was very disappointed and have difficulty believing that my view is so discordant from the majority opinion."
"dromasca","8","3","7","10 April 2007"," back to the dark future
","None of the visions in science fiction films about what expects us in a few or a few tens of years is too positive. This reflects the global pessimism derived by recent political developments, terrorism, global warming. Director Alfonso Cuar贸n's vision in 'Children of Men' is however by far the darkest that I saw later.<br/><br/>'The world collapsed' and the last refuge is Britain, which has become a generalized Iraq combined with a Orwellian vision of a super-patriot and anti-immigration laws. Beyond looking like a huge wasteland the world was struck by infertility, no children were born in the last 18 years. When a woman is pregnant, and when this woman is a black illegal immigrant she becomes the treasure and Mesia of the oppressed, and the object of hunt for rebels and police as well. It is such a coincidence and the killing of his ex-wife that determines the hero played by Clive Owen to get out of his gray carcass of a semi-human semi-robot and start acting as a movie hero.<br/><br/>What makes the film remarkable is the skill and consistency of the director vision. We have seen already after all many pictures which described a post atomic era or such. Yet, none of them built that carefully the vision of what our planet could become if we do not pay attention."

","One of my friends had been telling me to watch Children of Men since it came out in December but I kept putting it off. I finally saw it today and it was in one word: Amazing! From Cuaron's 6-minute-long single shot to the very subtle Pink Floyd reference - the entire movie was amazingly well done. The Dystopian UK setting reminded me of A Clockwork Orange. The movie resonates the same level of brilliance as Kubrick's work. Clive Owen's acting is unparalleled - he brilliantly pulled off what seems to me to be a very challenging role. And Claire-Hope who played Kee did a very great job for a young newcomer. I'm amazed that this movie managed to miss the spotlight at the Oscars. Shame on the academy. Anyway, Insanely Well done Cuaron and co.!"

","I was greatly disappointed with this movie. I had read great reviews and the rating on IMDb was very good.<br/><br/>This is one of the typical art movies with a big budget and good special effects.<br/><br/>The movie offer no explanations or clues as to why women became infertile. Similarly why the single woman became pregnant. There are simply too many loose ends.<br/><br/>If this was a Holloywood big budget movie, I can understand they leaving loose ends to make room for sequels/prequels.<br/><br/>Avoid the movie if you can."

","Like the summary says: Read the book. The movie bears no resemblance and the book is excellent. The whole POINT of the book is entirely lost in this ""adaptation."" (Ever see the move ""Adaptation""? There you go.)<br/><br/>DON'T watch this movie. The only resemblance to the book are the character names. The events are not the same, nor the relations of the characters nor the political climate.<br/><br/>The author's intent in the original book is to show mankind without a future, some would say mankind under judgment. The movie makers take that premise but come to wildly different conclusions, and extremely shallow ones at that. So the problem isn't with just the change of details (which can get annoying in any adaptation) but a misdirection of the intent. And THAT should annoy anyone. You can tell the same story in a different manner, but this isn't even the same story. Don't bother."

I know it's a unusual film but I just couldn't buy into it, to be honest it's all bit pointless and daft, I wanted so much more.<br/><br/>Michael Caine's character is atrocious. Strawberry cough...it's not real humour, the correct spelling of humour by the way.<br/><br/>Clive Owen leaves me cold, he's a very wooden actor, a one trick pony, Britain's answer to Ben Affleck, both unable to display more than a couple of facial expressions.<br/><br/>The film crescendos to an end which was rather like opening a bottle of pop only too discover its gone flat.<br/><br/>Personally I cannot believe people really think this belongs in the top 250 films. Maybe they're easily pleased.<br/><br/>Not good, not bad, just very very average."
"shonshu","2","3","7","16 February 2007"," Poor
","This film watches like a party political broadcast. The idea that gangs of white terrorists would form so that illegal immigrants could come into the country is ludicrous. What would be their motivation? The film is summed up best by the scene where Michael Caine asks the main character to pull his finger so he can flatuate. That is around the intellectual barometer reading for this movie.<br/><br/>This is a good example of how not to make a science fiction movie. There is a train of though that says science fiction says more about the time we live in now rather than the future. In this film it is blindingly obvious we are dealing with the present with a highly improbable storyline tacked on. Encounters with highly unpleasant characters in a grim boring looking world form it's core. To be honest I could only sit through the first half hour. This is a film that should not have been committed to celluloid. <br/><br/>A big budget, all-star disaster which was notably only nominated at the BAFTA's for it's cinematography."
"rob-1850","10","3","7","13 February 2007"," Scarily reminiscent of current day totalitarianism
","This was the 2006 film of the year by some margin in my humble opinion. A fantastic blend of sci-fi fantasy, thriller and road-movie, whilst also being political ""issuetainment"".<br/><br/>I have been harbouring negative thoughts about Clive Owen since suffering his performance in ""Closer"", but this film was almost made for him - a very strong performance, and supporting actress Pam Ferris was a revelation, a million miles from ""Darling Buds of May""! Julianne Moore was also a powerful presence, as was, inevitably, Michael Caine.<br/><br/>The only negative was the flagrant product placement by Philip Morris Inc, with the Clive Owen character chain-smoking Marlboro Lights in this future dystopia - seemed a little anachronistic to me, as the forthcoming public smoking ban in England will by then have seen the demise of cigarettes, to be replaced by Snus, Snuff and Nicotine Continuation Treatments (patches, gums, inhalators, and the new nicotine lollipops) as alternative delivery mechanisms for the drug nicotine - unless, like me, present day nicotine addicts attend Allen Carr's Easyway programme and get off the stuff permanently! I urge all IMDb readers to catch this movie if you can - truly one of the best of all time."
"mitzvah-1","3","3","7","2 February 2007"," Nauseating photography
","The plot is well thought out and interesting, and the acting exceptionally good, however the photographer often pans the camera without focusing and jumps the scenery around as the story moves forward. The visual effect they created made me physically sick during the viewing, did manage to see the entire film, though, and would not recommend it to others because of the nauseating effect of the photography. My escort also felt the shooting was making him motion sick, so it wasn't just me. At one point there is blood on the camera lens that they leave in place for a prolonged period. This distracted from the plot because the viewer starts to wonder who is following Clive Owen's character around filming him. Not entertaining."
"dfranzen70","9","3","7","24 January 2007"," Spellbinding; good companion to V for Vendetta
","In the near future, mankind is in deep trouble. For some reason, all of the women on Earth have gone infertile. Consequently, everyone's in a state of panic, and anarchy has more or less broken out in the now-dystopian England. Illegal immigrants are swept up and deported, if they're lucky - many are instead shot down in cold blood. Things look mighty grim as the populace slowly realizes that its own extinction is imminent unless a baby can be born.<br/><br/>A former activist, Theo (Clive Owen), is asked by a former flame, Julian (Julianne Moore) to acquire transit papers - shades of Casablanca - for a young woman who's trying to get to The Human Project, a band of rebels well outside of London. The woman, named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), is pregnant - the first pregnancy in the world in 18 years. However, the rebels don't want Kee to fall into the hands of the oppressive regime, because they're afraid Kee might be ""disappeared."" So Theo agrees to attempt to transport Kee to a safe ocean passage to The Human Project, in order to save the human race.<br/><br/>Children of Men is an exhilarating story that simply never lets up, following Kee's journey from when she meets Theo (and is accompanied by several helpers of varying degrees of morality) through to the bittersweet, tragic ending. It's not giving anything away to note that bad things happen, and not all who support Kee's cause will live to see the end of her tale.<br/><br/>The London in Children of Men is apparently a fair representation of the Baghdad of the real world, with disparate factions at war with each other to assume control in a largely lawless (outside of walled areas) society. People are shot without warning and with little provocation, all in the name of protecting the ""good"" people. Theo, as a bureaucrat, is largely unaffected by the chaos other than minor inconveniences, but when he's accosted by Julian's cohorts (the ol' throw a sack over his head and toss him in a van bit) and sees Julian for the first time in many years, he throws his hat into the ring as well, I think partly for old times' sake (he used to protest with Julian).<br/><br/>The unrelenting violence in the movie is often jarring, unsettling the viewer and setting one's teeth on edge. Political atmosphere aside, one desperately hopes Kee is able to succeed in her quest, partly because of the whole saving-mankind bit but also because Kee herself - and those immediately around her - is so believable and likable. She's no shrinking violet, but she's also not of the same stripe as the rebels (gritty and raging against the machine); she simply wants to have her baby safely.<br/><br/>The entire cast is dazzling, although the overall success of the film really hinges on the growing relationship between Theo and Kee; Ashitey more than carries her weight in a tough, complex film, and Owen turns in his usual solid work. Moore is ravishing in the few scenes in which she appears, eyes alight, face glowing, you completely believe she's become this heralded leader of an insurgency. She's simply divine. As is Sir Michael Caine, in a showy (although somewhat unrecognizable) role as an aging hippie/ex-political cartoonist who's the cheery, bouncy foil to Theo's ordinarily morose, workmanlike attitude. Caine's wonderful, although seen only briefly.<br/><br/>The best part about the movie is, really, the ending. I give nothing away by noting that the film isn't wrapped up in a neat little box, with confetti and unicorns and flowers falling from the sky. The story does have an air of hope about it, but we do not get closure. I think that's for the best; imagine if we had an ending in which Kee and Theo ran off into the sunset, her baby saved and life returning to those pre-anarchy days. Instead of cheating us with such a trite Hollywood ending, the filmmakers decided to continue with the overall maybe bad, maybe good tone, to the betterment of the movie."
"lake_america","10","3","7","24 January 2007"," Beautiful film about our ugly world
","With Children of Men Alfonso Cuar贸n continues his skill at making films that are beautiful to watch, layered with political commentary, and leave the audience with enough ambiguity to interpret the film for themselves.<br/><br/>The backdrop is a not-too-distant future where problems like war and ecological destruction have reached a breaking point causing both mass migration and infertility. A single woman, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), becomes pregnant and must navigate through an oppressive nationalist England as well as revolutionary groups concerned only with their own agendas. Kee gets help from the jaded alcoholic Theo (Clive Owen) on their way to a secret project that aims to undo infertility.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully dark with each set packed full of information about this strangely familiar world. There are piles of burning cattle carcasses, ever-present advertisements for drugs, and immigrants being rounded up and hooded. Long ""single-shot"" action sequences that incorporated digital splicing help move the story along. Cuar贸n straps us into each car chase scene making them feel almost like amusement rides. In Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuar贸n used an erotic teen adventure to tell the tale of contemporary politics in Mexico. In Children of Men, he uses the escape plot line to tell the story of an issue that is hardly action-oriented: infertility.<br/><br/>Children of Men refuses to give us any simple answers. The government labels a sympathetic Julian (Julianne Moore) as England's number one terrorist. The revolutionary group ""The Fishes"" cannot be trusted. There is no named cause for the mass infertility. There is no single cause for the global collapse that seems to have happened outside of England. The ending is ambiguous. Theo comments early in the film that he is not sure how much new babies would help since the world was already a messed up place. In our contemporary world we have wars, authoritarian governments, climate change, collapsed fisheries, refugee crises, toxic pollution, infertility, disease and water shortages, any or all of which can lead to the world of Children of Men. There is also a quiet acceptance in our modern society that we have crossed a threshold that we can never return through. We might not get a happy ending. Children of Men unnervingly represents this lack of hope.<br/><br/>When Kee is in the barn, she makes an aside about how the ""cut the titties"" of dairy cows because the machines can only fit 4 nipples. Only in a world based on masculine values would such a barbaric act be perpetrated in the name of production. Ultimately, we are all children of men and world we have created is the child of men. We have been raised to value violence, material production, authority and ecological destruction. Issues like fertility and compassion for our fellow humans fall to the wayside to oil wars and deporting immigrants. The children of men very well may spend their dying days oppressing immigrants and pointing guns as they march violently into the hell of their own creation.<br/><br/>If this interpretation is true, this would make Children of Men the only contemporary ecofeminist film to my knowledge. In the end we are left to wonder, ""If children of men have destroyed this world, can the children of women heal it?"""
"joyerbides","5","3","7","19 January 2007"," I can't see what the excitement is about ...
","Let me start by saying I am a huge SciFi fan and will watch anything of the genre. I went to see Children of Man because I heard somewhere that it was the Bladerunner for this decade or something like that. Well I don't know what the fuss is all about. This movie was certainly not up to Bladerunner. Sure it has a life message for humanity as Bladerunner did, but not much substance. There were so many holes in the film. We are never really satisfactorily told why there are no more babies. We are never told why there are mounds of burning animals and stuff all over the fields of England. We are never given any reason why they are rounding up foreigners. One would think with the human race dying off already we would not need to round up immigrants and kill them thus accelerating the problem. Plus there was nothing really techno in the movie at all. We are never told what the 'Human Project' is trying to do. We are never given a clue what is going on in other parts of the world other than they are evidently worse of than England. I think the movie fails as a SciFi movie, I think it fails as an action movie and some of the acting just fails. Hello Clive! Show some range will you. He does get better as the movie goes along.<br/><br/>I think the movie was simply a plea to our humanity to live in peace or face the consequences of the end of that humanity mixed with a little 'children are our future ... let them lead the way ..."". That message is clear. There is also definitely more than a tinge of anti-totalitarianism and anti-terrorism in the film, so that works as part of the overall message as well. Maybe that is what amazes so many critics, but I left feeling a little cheated."

","I went to see this movie because of all the high ratings it was getting on IMDb. I was not impressed and am not sure why it's getting such high ratings.<br/><br/>First off this is set in 2027 so you'd think they had not killed off all the scientist and we'd at least have some idea as to why women suddenly became infertile. Gamma rays from a nearby exploding super nova or some disease or something. Instead we are told that no one understands why it happened. Not even a clue as to why it might be occurring. The best reason we are given is when someone is speculating it's some sort of punishment from God.<br/><br/>There is also little to no explanation as to why everyone is fighting or why all foreigners are being deported from England. You'd think that if no children were being born life would become more precious.<br/><br/>I also found it a little implausible there would be a hippie hanging out in the woods. He would have had to have been a very young hippie back in the early 60's.<br/><br/>The movie does have it's moments of interest but for the most part there are just a lot of car chases and killing. I did like Julianne Moore's character but then she's killed off way to early in the movie. The rest of the movie is just Theo trying to get Kee to a boat that may or may not exist. There is seemingly no emotional attachment between the to characters. She doesn't even know who the father is and apparently Theo doesn't stick around to help out in that aspect.<br/><br/>Overall, I would have to not put this movie on my list of ones to see but then since enough people disagree with me, perhaps you should see it for yourself."

"LaurieMann","9","3","7","13 January 2007"," Best Movie of 2006
","2006 was a pretty awful year for movies, but Children of Men is an astonishing exception. Well-acted, well-directed, mostly intelligently written, Children of Men is one of the best movies ever. The fact that it's a science fiction movie gauls some to the point where they will not call it science fiction. It's a dystopia set over 20 years in the future. It's a science fiction movie with great acting, which makes it a rare movie indeed.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta, the other big British dystopia, got more attention earlier in the year as it was a very flashy, explosive movie. But what Children of Men lacked in explosions, it more than made up for in a stronger sense of reality.<br/><br/>I'm sure you've heard the plot - it's about 20 years in the future, women stopped reproducing and a flu pandemic killed many children. There's no one left younger than 18, so the remaining countries are in complete despair. Clive Owen is the poster boy for despair. I've enjoyed performances by Clive Owen in the past, but he's emotionally naked in this movie and he's absolutely superb.<br/><br/>There's an extraordinary scene late in the movie that may be one extremely long tracking shot (or, then again, maybe not). It follows Clive Owen into a street battle and into a ruined apartment building. It shows the harrowing nature of urban warfare better than almost any movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>While it was a very violent movie in places, it's not gratuitously violent. The R rating may be more for the language than for the violence (well, and one scene involving a naked woman, but the nudity is not gratuitous either).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

","I don't have much that I feel hasn't been said, there was not one moment while film rolled that I didn't have my jaw hanging wide open. From the beginning the rhythm of the movie was set to a pace pushed the story forward relentlessly, yet flowed so well it left nothing behind. I was in a state of complete awe, this is without a doubt the absolute best film I have had the good fortune to enjoy. The actors were sincere in their delivery, as you watch their body language, listen to their voices, and look into their eyes you will come to an immediate understanding of the sad and hateful darkness that engulfed the world. Excellent and seemingly well funded sets and action scenes, very graphic, yet poetic and clean. The directing is, to my eyes, without parallel! The ability to draw the watcher so deep into the plot, story line, and character conflict invites the audience into the chaos and madness that are rampant in this future world. Shot angles and camera positioning gave you excellent perspective of the environment and general feeling of the locations. If I were to wager, nothing else released in 2007 will compete with this film, specifically directing and cinematography. Without a doubt in my mind, I will say, this is the best film I've ever seen. Complete. Utter. Phenomenon."
"aygent26","9","3","7","12 January 2007"," Stop viewing this movie through a political lens
","One of the best I've seen in a while, but I can't stand reading these posts about how the movie is any kind of a warning or political commentary---it is not---it is a story. Having said that, I took the movie as a fascinating look into the ability of childbirth to make us feel just a little bit immortal, perhaps just enough. In the world today, we are all going to die, just like the world in the movie, the only difference in the movie is that these people cannot pass life along, but just as they are witnessing an end to their species, we're witnessing the end of every living person on Earth, the only difference is that in this world dead people are replaced with other people, who will eventually die. Sorry if this seems bleak, try not to discount it as despressing. As far as leftist/Georg Bush-ist views on the film, can't we learn more about ourselves by REMOVING a story from our own world? and its biases and spins? I'm not saying relevance is bad, its very important for our understanding ... but please leave your politics at the door of the theater.<br/><br/>Also to answer the ridiculously distracted post about the black baby... do you really think that woman and child were going to have thousands of kids and repopulate England alone? First of all, if babies were born again, perhaps the world could be rebuilt as a result of increased morale, so it would not be any kind of Black England, as scary as some you bigots may find that; second of all, the girl was not going to have the world's population come out of her belly, the scientists were going to find out how she was different biologically from all of those who were infertile, and hopefully allow others to have children.<br/><br/>One question, why exactly were the those people pelting the trains with rocks? I'm assuming it was a microcosm of the impotent frustration of society over the condition of the world. (sorry about the pun) I'm out like jean short, Hayes"
"brackbatter814","10","3","7","11 January 2007"," Absolutely Wonderful Movie
","In the past three weeks I have had the good fortune to see Pan's Labyrinth, The Prestige and Children of Men in succession, and what a streak of wonderful movies, I must say! I only mention the three of them together because each takes a subject normally for children, be it fairy tales, magicians, or an action-adventure chase, and turns it into a thought provoking adult entertainment. I recommend that one views children of Men without any knowledge of the plot or characters, as this will make the film more rewarding upon initial viewing. Some people have complained that the trailer for the film was misleading, and I say, GOOD! Too often trailers spoil some of the more innovative twists and set pieces, and in Children of Men, I am pleased to report that the fact that I was really uncertain as to what this film would be about, allowed me to enjoy it more. It's such an old cliché to say that you sat on the edge of your seat in suspense throughout a movie, but Children of Men had this effect on me, and I cannot remember the last time any movie was able to do that. You care about the characters, and the world they're thrust into is a believable hellhole that you could envision yourself in, which makes it all the scarier. In most post-apocalyptic dystopian thrillers, the world is so unbelievable that you can detach yourself from what you're viewing and as a result, sympathize less with the characters. Children of Men presents a future much like today, with chilling minor differences that seem entirely logical. THe crisp and clear cinematography and complete lack of any glamorization either of stars or environments, allow one to project oneself into the film and appreciate it's messages concerning the follies and triumphs of humanity. Strongly recommended. I haven't been this touched by a film on more than ten occasions in my life, the others being the likes of Doctor Zhivago, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, 2001 and Star Wars. I hope people see this and talk about it at length. Also, I recommend the novel Blindness by Jose Saramago to anyone that enjoys the film. It explores similar themes of what man will resort to when the status quo is thrown out the window."

It was finally released in the USA for general theaters last week and I had just left the theater about an hour ago.<br/><br/>No need to go into the details of the story as you may have seen in trailers and the movies description on this website.

The direction of actors and photography is amazing.

But when there is no future, society would collapse. This movie will have many people thinking after the credits.<br/><br/>I have already called up a few friends telling them to SEE this movie. I give a 10 score for every aspect of this film (okay, a shadow of a mic got into frame for a few seconds). This movie does belong in the category for best film."
"monster_dark","10","3","7","11 January 2007"," Despairing hope (spoilers?)
","Alfonso Cuaron hammers out a totally believable distopian vision based upon P.D. James' novel, ""Children of Men"". A film about a future in which the human race is on the verge of extinction due to the sudden and inexplicable infertility of all women, where the last surviving shred of civilization is the police state of England where euthanasia is advertised on television, illegal immigrants are hunted down like animals and 'deported' (many never get that far), and Clive Owen is the only hope the first pregnant mother in over 18 years.<br/><br/>Clive's character, Theo, drifts through his character development sequence as a lazy and stoic antihero. Our story begins on the day that the youngest man alive dies, killed by an angry mob after refusing an autograph request. Theo hears the news in a café that explodes shortly upon his leaving it. He then heads to work as if it never happened, only to discover that, as evidenced by the weeping ladies in the cubicles surrounding him, ""Baby Diego's"" death is so traumatic for the women of London that he'll be unable to get any work done. He takes the day off and calls his old friend Jasper played by the illustrious Michael Caine, who lives hidden just off the highway and is our comic relief.<br/><br/>Upon returning to London he is kidnapped by his wanted ex-wife (Julianne Moore) , who asks for his help in procuring traveling documents from his rich cousin. After some establishing events that I won't bring into focus, as you'll enjoy the surprises, Theo becomes the sole protector for Kee, played by the lovely Claire-Hope Ashitey (who I sincerely hope we'll be seeing more of). Kee is the aforementioned mother. His mission: escort key to the coast, where she'll be delivered into the hands of 'The Human Project', an enigmatic group trying to save humanity whose existence is only rumored, via their ship, the aptly named 'Tomorrow'. Theo sheds his antihero status at this point and we see the uncompromising 'activist' he used to be. Given this purpose, he understands that this mission is more important than anything he's ever done, and subsequently takes us on a journey through the film, showing us concentration camps, bleak countrysides, and senseless human conflict, featuring an edge-of-your-seat urban combat sequence that rivals the beach landing in 'Saving Private Ryan'.<br/><br/>But here's the thing. None of that is what this film is about.<br/><br/>The infertility problem is never explained, and Kee's story ends as abruptly as the film began because they are simply the plot device that allows Cuaron to take us on a trip through this apocalyptic world. They are just plain unimportant. Make no mistake, 'Children of Men' is not about hope. And if you think it is, you're quite the optimist. The tag-line says it all: ""No children. No future. No hope."" No joke.<br/><br/>In the end, 'C.O.M.' is a despairing look at what a wretched species the human race is, so wrapped up in our politics and religious differences that nothing distracts us (for more than 90 seconds) from the wholesale destruction of ourselves. The fact that this future world is so believable shows this to be true. Cuaron seems to be saying, ""We aren't headed here for sure, but it's a possibility, isn't it?"". It forms parallels to current events without hammering any specific political ideology home, just the horror of what we're doing to ourselves and where we could be headed as Earthlings. The closest thing to hope that we are offered is that this cycle will, indeed, continue."

","There are certain movies that come along every once and a while that you watch and then will almost do anything to get someone else to watch. The Children of Men falls under that category. With a blend of realism and fantasy that touches almost too closely on the ""Yeah, that's how it'd be"" part in us all. The direction is remarkable, the chase and action, perfect. But most importantly in any film it comes down to the story, and this film, does what any good film should do. It tells a compelling story that has you on the end of your seat with so many twists and turns you aren't sure just what might come around the corner next, but at the same time says something about the world we live in, about the human condition. But what makes this film rise above the rest, is that this story combined with great direction, the magnificent Michael Caine and Clive Owen, blended with great cinematography come together that leave you with the feeling that you have seen a slice of life and as a result, learning something and ultimately come out of the theater with a changed perspective a closer eye on the dirty ways of the world. And that is what a good film should do."

","Children of Men, based on the PD James dystopic book is simply the best movie of the year, and there is nothing wrong with it, nothing. Every performance is exactly right; measured and precise and just quite amazing. Clive Owen, of course, is perfect as the disillusioned former militant who is dragged into a plot that has, quite literary, the future of the human race at risk.<br/><br/>The direction is Cuarón's best to date and both Julianne Moore and Michael Caine turn in two of the best, albeit short, supporting roles of the year. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Serenity, Inside Man) is also strong in a smaller supporting role.<br/><br/>This movie has deep political roots, and is especially appropriate in the US with all the anti- immigrant fervor being stirred up by the Republican Party. Watch it once for the story, once for the politics, and once for the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is of special note because it is stunning in its quality and variety."

They had five hundred years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce?...The cuckoo clock."" Great art stems from turmoil and pain and this movie reflects that paradigm. 2006 has been a year for bleak futures in film exemplified by Inconvenient Truth, Idiocracy, V for Vendetta and now Children of Men. In the early 70s amidst the quagmire of Vietnam, the civil rights movement and the corruption of the Nixon administration the cinema produced Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green and THX 1138. Now amidst the quagmire in Iraq, the legitimization of torture, the suspension of habeus corpus, and the corruption of the Bush administration director Alfonso Cuarón has woven a cautionary tale set in 2027 England but the issues at stake could not be more topical. The single take tracking shots drag the viewer by the hair through a world more terrifying than any horror film could conjure. I was riveted by this pre- apocalyptic drama to the very last frame. When the credits rolled I looked at an audience quite literally stunned and silent. I cannot recall another film that delivers such a punch. I felt so raw afterward I had to have a drink. It is without a doubt the best film of 2006."

James, an author I like but I didn't read this book (yet). Well, I was surprised - it is an excellent movie, really. There are good actors, quite a few of them are totally unknown to me but I consider that more of an advantage. Seems a bit strange this movie hasn't received more PR - its not a low budget SF movie. The story is good and you really don't need to focus on what it was that made the world go unfertile, if you do that you kinda miss out the point of this movie. For me personally it was a totally convincing picture of how wrong things could go... if you take in the aspect of what humans are willing to do against other humans. The only reason I don't give the movie a higher rating is the ending. Sure it might get you thinking about things but I'd like to have known what happened to the girl and her baby..."
"Filmfan-NL","6","3","7","27 December 2006"," Derailed half way
","The story outline is promising, and scenery, acting, cinematography all match the grim situation mankind is in, in 2027, roughly 18 years after homo sapiens lost the ability to procreate. The first half of the movie is a nice mix of character introduction, allowing the viewer to get into the non existent but feasible alternative reality, some great and quite realistic and shocking action (without the typical Hollywood style massive explosions), and plotting out the route towards the inevitable. ***SPOILERS MOSTLY FROM THIS POINT ON*** Up to and including the self sacrifice by Jasper (Michael Caine) and his brutal killing I liked every bit about this movie. As if the director switched his 'subtle & typical British' hat for his Hollywood one. Action becomes the main ingredient, far too much useless war imagery and an over the top 'public discovery' of the first known newborn baby, like Jesus' resurrection or something, and everything else is a bit of a letdown. Can you say cliché? <br/><br/>I am still puzzled about how big a contrast the first and latter half of the movie are. Pity, really. It would have gotten 9 out of 10 for the first, and 3 or 4 for the latter half. So in total 6/10.<br/><br/>I hope someone takes this great premise and invents a less action packed scenario from the middle stages of the movie."

Although the fact that it's a sci-fi might deter some people from seeing it, this is one of those rare masterpieces that should be seen by anyone considering themselves a movie connoisseur.<br/><br/>It begins as a story of despair in a world full of death and destruction, but ends as a captivating race of a man who found his hope and a hope for the entire human race and is trying to save it. Not only does the movie progresses at a perfect pace, but it also involves some of the most amazing shots I have ever seen captured on camera. These include an intense single scene shot of an urban survival in the middle of the war, truly magnificent in the way it was shot and delivered and a very rare and a very realistic footage of human birth that some people might find strangely disturbing. To present the story with as much realism as possible, director chose to implement footage that was shot with a constantly moving cameraman that gives us a strange feeling of being present wherever the battle is raging or whatever it is hero is doing. The movie sets are realistic and although simple in appearance, they deliver a great addition to the overall feeling of a dark future.<br/><br/>I give Children of Men 10/10 the only movie I gave the highest score in 2006"
"matej-poljak","6","3","7","16 December 2006"," Massive migration problems vs. lack of children
","I think that movie was quite good, especially first half hour of it. But then it more and more tries to convince us that there are too many people world-wide, despite the fact that there were no new kids in 18 years. If we look at the Sierra Leone for example, half of the population consists of children aged up to 14 years. We can imagine what would happen if there were no natality for so long. There were also many other activities such as discriminatory emigration policy, terrorist groups in GB, but the reasons for that were never told. They for sure cannot be consequence of lack of children and common misery because of it. Immigrants are surely not the only reason (if at all) for the world to collapse into chaos. I think that many important themes were too much simplified in order to present one problem. However, violence, riots and civil disobedience which led to unrest were shown very well and realistic, but reasons for them were not defined."

Maybe if you pay attention you would find out at the end.

","I would certainly like to see more films like this one. This film had the feeling of the movie ""12 Monkeys"" by Terry Giliam - yet Alfonso Cuarón is a more sophisticated director than Giliam. Cuarón thrills you all the way. This movie is built to the smallest detail. I will not forget the amazing one-shot in the car, as the characters were being attacked - so intense! Amazing shot. I enjoyed the storyline - that in the future women can no longer have babies - I think it's brilliant. My problem was that the movie ended quite poorly. No answers or theories were given as to why women cannot have babies - or to why only a single woman miraculously managed to get pregnant. Like many futuristic movies, this one carries lots of criticism on our world today, which is fine by me."
"staffiwilson","9","3","7","14 October 2006"," Britain faces the end of the world
","The thing that most impressed me about this futuristic drama was the cultural accuracy in the depiction of London and England. Set 20 years in the future, you can clearly see the present day cultural influences in the characters facing the destruction of the human race. Unlike most sci-fi, which concentrates on the technological, the concept of cultural progression is central to the characterisation - how might present day hippies, new-age travellers, city hedonists, left-wing activists, terrorists, governments; - develop under the threat of destruction? The accuracy in the depictions of the different strands that make up British society, gives the feeling that the film always has an angle on you. You can see who these people were before this tragedy took hold and distorted them. This is a future that you could belong to.<br/><br/>The background of Armageddon, reveals the superficiality of these cultural pretences, and leaves you with the raw humanity of the characters. Showing, as sci-fi can so ably do, the temporality of our present day cultural identities.<br/><br/>The film has plenty to say politically too. The future government maintains power and tries to hold society together by creating a common enemy, immigrants and terrorists. The references to nationalistic propaganda are very well done and hit all the right prejudices. It serves as a necessary reminder of how close we are right now to George Orwell's prediction of constant war with an unseen, unquantifiable enemy.<br/><br/>What makes this a great film in my opinion is that it does all this and it also manages to entertain in an edge of your seat fashion from start to finish. The photography and special effects are superb, especially the use of cgi - which is pretty much undetectable and used not as a flashy spectacle but as a highly effective tool, similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the fire-truck chase scene in ""Terminator 3"". The story constantly takes you by surprise and ably conveys an atmosphere of chaos and confusion, as we are shown a self terminating society. Life is cheap when humanity is doomed, and a sense of meaninglessness pervades the film. The last third is very action heavy and creates incredible tension as the protagonists stumble through a series of encounters and situations that are highly unpredictable and chaotic.<br/><br/>Feels very fresh and a great mix of genres, sci-fi at its best."
"cosmic_quest","9","3","7","5 October 2006"," Bleak yet thought-provoking
","This gem of a film might not burst the box office with the hallmarks of an autumn blockbuster but, like the excellent 'V for Vendetta', 'Children of Men' has to be seen for it is a film with a powerful storyline and hidden lessons that must be learnt. Based on the novel by PD James, whose forte is usually crime fiction, this film is set in the bleak 2027 when the planet is on the brink of social and economic collapse and worldwide infertility has meant no child has been born in eighteen years. Against the backdrop of a London divided by anarchy and a totalitarian government, jaded former peace activist Theo Faron is forced to set aside his disenchantment to help a pregnant girl named Kee across the country to deliver her to sanctuary.<br/><br/>With a strong cast comprised of a variety of talented actors, 'Children of Men' never had to worry about delivering a good performance in that department. Clive Owen was perfectly cast as the disillusioned Theo, world-weary haunted by his past until his protective instincts are rekindled in Kee and her child. Pam Ferris and Michael Caine were excellent as always as Miriam and Jasper respectively, two likable characters who display quiet heroics and eliciting empathy from the audience for their determination and kind natures. And Claire-Hope Ashitey delivered a top performance as Kee, despite the fact she would have been barely eighteen when filming this and still so new to acting. If she had been dire in her role, this film probably would have failed but, thankfully, she proved she has acting talent in her ability to depict the determination, vulnerability and strength of her character.<br/><br/>'Children of Men' is certainly a very chilling film that would leave even the most complacent worrying what the future holds for mankind. Watching scenes of a desolate England where refugees are herded up like cattle then transported to concentration camps as world away from the luxury enjoyed by the rich, where corpses of people and animals rot by road sides and bombings are the norm, the imagery is terrifying to the core because it could so easily happen if hope is ever lost. The film was successful in showing cruel governments can be as destructive as terrorists and the lines between justice and the unjust can blur if one forgets their convictions. There were a variety of nice touches that only strengthened the story of the film such as how pets had taken the place of children in people's lives, how heroes don't have to be gun-totting Steven Segals and the sound of an infant's cry can touch the soul of even the hardest of hearts, especially when it comes in a time where the sound of children's laughter had long fallen silent.<br/><br/>It would have been interesting if the film had further touched upon exactly why females couldn't carry babies and reflected on how the world reacted at the time this realisation was starting to sink in. It would also have been nice to see how the rest of the UK had fared since England had obviously gone to pot, despite refugees from countries which had already crumbled seeking asylum there, and if Kee was really a sole miracle or were there other pregnant women out there offering the planet a second chance. That said, the film did not suffer an iota for not touching upon these issues.<br/><br/>This is certainly a film for 'V for Vendetta' fans and for those who, every once in a while, like a film that leaves them pondering over the issues raised in the plot even after the end credits have rolled. 'Children of Men' is also a film that the leaders of the world should see because maybe mass infertility isn't a problem for the here and now but there are lessons to be learnt on how war, hopelessness and destruction can destroy us all."
"gareth-110","9","3","7","2 October 2006"," An interesting film beautifully realised.
","I really wasn't sure what to expect going into this film. I was expecting a rather intellectual film with very little action. Well, the film delivered on the intellectual front and it also delivered on the spectacle. The action scenes were tense and emotional at times, visceral in a way that hasn't been seen since Blackhawk Down.<br/><br/>The film starts sedately enough in the near future, far enough for newspapers and advert signs to all be electronic, but not far enough for things to look much different. It quickly becomes obvious, through the use of TV news reals, that the youngest person in the world is an 18 year old Argentinian and that no other children have been born since him. As you watch the film you get a sense that something is missing, not quite right, until you realise that there are no children in the film. That would explain why there are so many animals, from dogs to chickens to pigs etc. These are presumably there to replace the children that people long for but are unable to have.<br/><br/>From a rather slow start the film slowly winds up the tension and suddenly changes from a Gattica type film to something more akin to The Fugitive. The acting is first rate, with some very well known British actors and actresses putting in some terrific performances. Clive Owen plays the party superbly, with an understated style that makes his character at once more believable and more sympathetic.<br/><br/>In the end, the story is a rather simple one, but it is expertly directed and told with sense that it both European and Hispanic - definitely not the usual Hollywood fare. I am not surprised that many Americans did not get the film or appreciate it - no sex, one-liners or pointless violence. It is roller-coaster of a film that surprises at every turn and in the end leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>My rating, 9 out of ten."

"axisofpete","10","4","11","15 February 2008"," Think about it...
","I think this is one of the greatest SCI-FI movies of all time. No doubt it doesn't compare to The Godfather or Street Car Named Desire but if you're in the mood for an amazing mind blowing, quirky, sustained thrill ride (almost like I took it from a Hollywood circular), then you should pick this one up. At least give it a chance and go in with nothing to lose (you're going to ""waste"" a couple hours sitting on your bum anyway). It'll surprise you if you don't hold back. <br/><br/>To all those that didn't ""get"" this movie, that ranked it with one star and then complain the voting is rigged. Those asking questions on certain aspects (i.e. the political purpose of FISH, the immigrant situation in England, the war zone, etc.) and saying the movie needed more substance. This is exactly what the movie intended to do! It's a sci-fi movie which basically asks ""what if..."" It doesn't exist to answer all the questions it raises. It exists simply to ask these questions."

","If I wasn't with 3 other people, this would have been the first film I've ever walked out of. I was completely offended by the director's liberal agenda and anti-American propaganda which was splashed in our faces literally every moment of the film. It is clear he was so obsessed with making outlandish, radical parallels to our current political climate that it compromised anything artistic he was trying to accomplish, and quite honestly, made the film just silly. I was actually laughing. The man is off his rocker like the rest of those radical liberals who do their part to terrorize our citizens with crap like this- which is what most of Hollywood is, let's face it. No doubt that's why the reviews are apparently so good. They lap it up for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight snack. And let's not forget it sells. The coolest trend if you're an American citizen these days is to be anti-American. And this film is catered to those who like to feel part of that 'exlusive' group of people who act so misunderstood and feel that special camaraderie when they get together and whine about the policies of our country and express their misguided sympathy to anything or anyone that is minority (including Islamic terrorists- yes, just one of many repulsively obvious themes) just to make themselves feel charitable and a worthy human being. This is one reason why so many of our youth associates with the leftist mentality- they get to feel part of that not so 'exclusive' group while still being able to rebel against anything that resembles authority or mainstream society. Once they mature hopefully their angst subsides, as does the peer pressure they feel from those they long to be liked by who are similarly brainwashed- and their vision of reality grows clearer. Then they realize that they don't have to be told how to think by the media, movies, and silly celebrities whose most frightening nightmare is to be blacklisted by the leftist media who control their careers. Obviously that is not the case for this film's director- he has not matured. So I say to him- Hey loser- go smoke some more Mexican weed, whine about Western ideals, and listen to that utterly horrid cover of Ruby Tuesday which you made us listen to throughout the film. The smart ones don't buy your pathetic drivel."
"Quinoa1984","9","4","11","6 January 2007"," recommended for anyone interested in a (rewardingly) bleak futuristic thriller
","Alfonso Cuaron, make no mistake, knows what he's doing with the style of Children of Men. Following from the same cues he started off with Y Tu Mama Tambein, his and Emmanual Lebiznaki's camera never stops to go onto a dolly or just to stand still, it's always hand-held and on edge with the characters and the dire situations they're set in 2029 Britain. Sometimes this allows for some really incredible long-takes implemented (my favorite a very pivotal death/chase scene that occurs surprisingly early in the film), allowing Cuaron with complete subjective freedom of perspective. There's never a moment to relax in this world, as just setting a cup of coffee in the middle of the city square could have the next second arriving a bomb just next door. However, perhaps if only for me, the style called attention to itself sometimes, or to the fact that it's all 'just a movie'. Not that there isn't some very gritty action and horrific bloody violence that comes out, notably in the climactic ""uprising"" as Clive Owen's Theo almost escapes being annihilated among the total chaos in an especially long take (blood spats on the lens included).<br/><br/>The whole set-up of the story of Children of Men is simple, and I (unfortunately maybe) knew most of it from the trailer. Owen works a dead-end job in the only country where there is some ""stability"" (note the quotes) at a time in the world where infertility is dead and the youngest man alive has just died. There's terrorists everywhere, no one can really rest easy, and the police state makes it very hard to get around on the roads, not to mention the immigration problem (sound familiar?). Enter in Julianne Moore's character, who was once lovers with Theo, and needs his help to get a foreigner across to safer grounds. But it becomes further complicated when the cat's out of the bag- she's pregnant, and needs to get to safety to have her child. So then the characters are off on the mission, however complicated further by the (well laid) twist that the group that were originally going to help get the woman to the ""Human Project""- where she could be looked after with the best spark of hope- really just want the baby as collateral to propagate their uprising against the government. Meanwhile, the chaos continues and continues.<br/><br/>In a sense, this is probably the bleakest futuristic ""pro-life"" movie ever made, however pro-life in relation to Children of Men is actually a necessity rather than a political or religious point. There seems to be no respite from civilization eating itself up at the thought that humanity will end if procreation becomes nothingness, and so part of the strength in Children of Men is seeing the conviction behind the main message in the film. In a time where there is practically a culture of death by way of a lack of governmental control and a burst of extremism, the only hope is new life, if only in a small dose. Populating around this message- which only becomes a little thicker by the end of the film- is a strong performance from Owen, who maybe doesn't have as much range as usual due to him being mostly a reactionary (mostly with shock and conflict, and early on malaise) at what's around him. Michael Caine also turns in the amusingly human supporting turn as a pot-smoking ex-political cartoonist. Even the woman who plays the most crucial one in the picture- who may or may not name her child Bazooka- is very good in the part.<br/><br/>So why didn't I respond to it with overwhelming enthusiasm and with a place for it in my top 10 of the year? Hard to say even hours after seeing it. Maybe there is almost a certain lack of momentum even as the clock ticks down on the pregnancy. The bleakness that carried over the picture is so thick and disparaging it's half a relief from seeing other futuristic pictures that don't deliver so much on the dread and decay of humanity gone to the dogs, and half a desire for it to not be as such. No doubt I recommend it to all who'd like a serious trip into an original Orwellian-nightmare-popcorn-thriller (if that makes sense), though I don't think it's necessarily a full-blown masterpiece...<br/><br/>AMENDMENT TO PREVIOUS REVIEW (month & a half later): I rewatched the film, and I liked it even more; it gets deeper, with its message more impactful and the staggering long-takes even more powerful- and it is one of the best directed films of the decade."
"imseeg","9","2","4","17 May 2018"," Gets more impressive every time I see it...
","Some movies just take my breath away. Some movies just leave me behind in awe.
""Children of Men"" does all that to me. And mind you, I have seen it now over 5 times, and honestly it does get more impressive every time I see it...<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" has got a heart. A warm endearing heart that pulsates louder than the exploding bombs in this movie. A lust for life runs through this picture that is like an adrenaline shot.<br/><br/>Superlatives dont suffice to describe this gritty, violent, bleak and depressive story about a world in which a virus has caused an epidemic of child deaths at birth. No children have been born in years. One girl only, an illegal immigrant girl, has gotten pregnant and she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders because the existence of humanity is at stake here. If her new born dies, humans as a species, will cease to exist. If she can manage to keep her newborn alive, mankind has got a chance for survival.<br/><br/>Clive Owen plays the man who accompanies this young pregnant girl literally through a battlefield, towards a safe haven. I think it is one of his best performances. Michael Caine and Julliane Moore play supporting roles that are to die for as well. The acting in this picture is sublime!<br/><br/>Alfonso Quaron directed, wrote and edited this picture. He has also made ""Gravity"" (with Sandra Bullock in space), which has won numerous Oscars. This director is a movie genius. He only makes 1 movie in every 4-5 years, but he creates classics EVERY time.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" has got a natural beauty and rhythm to it, that is astonishingly impressive. How many times have I seen movies that flow so seemingly effortlessly? Not that I want to get technical, but this movie is as real as it gets in front AND behind the camera. The photography of this picture is Oscar worthy. Just follow closely how long the scenes last without ANY cut in it at all. While bombs explode, buildings are tore down, when people storm the streets, minutes and minutes go by without any cut in the scenes. That takes an effort similar to an orchestration of a classical symphony. It must have taken enormous efforts and time to make this picture as ravishing as it has become. ""Children of Men"" has that quality of real life imagery, so real that you just forget you are watching a movie. It is enticing, worrisome, suspenseful, heartwarming and thrilling.<br/><br/>And still I feel I havent giving it enough praise. A classic can have that effect on me. I wanna conclude with a statement of the director himself:Alfonso Cuarón has stated that he ""didn't want to make a film that ends when the credits roll. He wanted to make a film that, when the final credits roll...that's really the beginning of the film"".<br/><br/>This movie left me behind with a feeling of bewilderment about the future of mankind and the disgraceful world we live in now..."

","This film, ""Children of men"", represents the highest level of filmmaking. It is one of the most realistic Sci-Fi thrillers of all time, thanks to its amazing technical accomplishment in cinematography, sound mixing, music score, film editing, sound editing, and visual effects. At the same time, it is thought-provoking and successful in the screenplay and the storytelling, serving as a fantastical cautionary tale and making every viewer emotionally resonant. <br/><br/>By making such a masterpiece, which is even better than ""Gravity"", Alfonso Cuarón simply proves himself to be one of the best directors of all time."

Being a huge fan, I decided to give this movie a shot. And wow, did it blow my mind<br/><br/>The dichotomy the movie draws between darkness and light is astounding.

","one of the great films who transforms its viewer in witness. not only for the pressure of theme - one of the most bitter nightmare of humanity but for the wise manner of Alfonso Cuaron to give entire freedom to the actors to explore the nuances of the roles. Cliwe Owens does one of the most powerful roles of his career. Oana Pellea, in a small exotic role impress as one of the key of search. and the dark atmosphere remains , after the end of credits, as a warning-state. a film about sense of life. and about the force of responsibility as form of hope. one of the films who remains out of the plot. because it is a precise definition of the fight for survive essence. and a fascinating bitter poetry of the self definition as part of the others."
"jacob-g422","10","2","4","10 February 2014"," Masterpiece, and nothing less
","Looking at the original cover and hearing the title it sounded like some cheesy acted action chick flick, but man I could have never been more wrong. This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, and I am one of the harshest film critics. The impossibility of directing some of these 5 minute long takes (the camera literally doesn't cut in many scenes) as the characters go through some of the best action sequences (and most realistic) you will EVER see. This was nothing short of a Masterpiece, and that's understating it.<br/><br/>Owen really never had his 'role', and this was it. He plays the reluctant, dis-envisioned loner Theo who, despite his poverty and the fact that the entire world is crumbling around him, maintains his composure through constant flask drinking, gambling, and herbal remedies with his old friend Jasper. When his old liaison, Julian Moore, approaches him for an offer, he reluctantly agrees after learning of the money he is promised. Unaware of the situation he is entering himself into, he is thrown into the melee when the transport of an illegal immigrant goes horribly wrong and he is stuck trying to smuggle the last pregnant woman on earth out of the country, while being discovered, hunted, and chased by multiple terrorist groups. Meanwhile the country is in an uproar about illegals. Because of how dangerous the rest of the entire world has become most illegal immigrants are murderous and in gangs (or perceived as such), and they highly outnumber the rest of the population. The baby is a source of political motives, being that it's the last on earth, and Theo quickly realizes that besides the mother he is the only one looking out for its best interests.<br/><br/>It becomes readily apparent that despite always being drunk, stoned and unarmed Theo becomes a quick witted, highly agile escape artist when his adrenaline kicks in. He battles through hell, alone, and for most of the movie without shoes, striving to get this woman and her baby to safety. In one of the final scenes, Theo is walled in with her in a refugee camp being invaded by multiple terrorist organizations, and scheduled to be bombed by the military. I've never had such admiration for a hero as I did watching Theo run through the streets dodging bullets and cheating death, it was one of my most favorite scenes in movie history, and it was over 7 minutes of non-cut camera action. You witness firsthand the horrors of war, as everyone around him annihilates each other. It will have you on the edge of your seat, and then falling off it. This will ALWAYS be one of, if not, my favorite movie of all time. It has set a landmark with its camera-work and cinematography. No one has yet to accomplish anything like this. It should have won multiple Oscars, no argument. To me Theo is one of the greatest heroes in movie history. Trust me, see it. Give it a half hour and the action will start and it won't stop. 12 out of 10. <br/><br/>As far as the casting and acting, it's beyond flawless. With the camera not cutting you must choreograph everything down to the exact detail, and timing becomes a science. Owens' acting in this movie is some of the best I have EVER seen, it just exposed how amazing he was. Just watching him break down in tears was PERFECT, the spit connecting from his hands and he tried to wipe it away while breaking down in an attempt to light a cigarette, spine-tingling perfection, Art at its finest. It astonishes me that anyone could not like this movie, or even comment on the cast or the storyline or plot remaining undeveloped. The director takes you on a journey and has you perceive everything unfold. You witness a lot of what's happened by seeing headlines of old newspapers reused as wallpaper, you witness cattle being burned in circles on the countryside, you see chimneys reminiscent of Auschwitz expelling black smoke near refugee camps as they pass on the road. This is not for the Transformers or Jet Li fan boys. This is true film. It's gritty and it will pull you in. Truly remarkable."
"noeragerlegeplads","3","2","4","10 September 2013"," An average movie..
","Just saw ""Children of Men"" yesterday. I have heard very praised words about it, so my expectations was relatively high. It starts well. Then after 15-20 minutes I sit more and more waiting the story to unfold. Was is behind (the plot) and who are these people (the main characters)? As the minutes passing by we get almost nothing really to know about them. The lesser characters is, friendly spoken, sketchy The story stay throughout very thin and untrustworthy - had the makers not the slightest knowledge of human psychology? Both concerning the character's playing and reactions as well as the viewers? Where is the suspense for example? A thriller? A horror movie? Nope - it getting more and more boring as time passes and the involvement in the characters are almost zero. Sad, because it could have been an interesting movie if the screenplay has been much better and the characters given more to work with. An artistic movie? The cinematography works but that's it.<br/><br/>A political movie? I am nor member of a sect or a special political party looking thru special colored glasses. I am a viewer who use eyes, ears, senses, logic as well as emotions (not much of emotional stimulation in this empty going movie though). You need to tell some story to get the audience interested. And a story can be told in many ways - but need to be there! The whole ""plot"" appears both very illogical and poorly explained. The worst thing is - until the end - still hoping for some explanation or revelation of just something. Nope. A decent ending, a conclusion and alike could have saved something in this movie - but no. I understand a certain hype had been around this actually under average movie - but the movie makers need their money back. I don't see any deeper philosophical or many thoughtful levels for the the ""Mensa- peoples"". The story is so very straight and poorly told and ""drowning"" in its own often noisy/hysterical surroundings. Humor is lacking - the intended jokes fail and the fun episodes are not intended (the escape in a jump-start-trying car!). The worst is when you see something and have a feeling of this could have been good but the audience/viewers are somewhat neglected in this process, like in ""Inception"", another over-hyped movie. Some like it, fine - but if it was a book as told in the movie it would be even more boring.."
"Spondonman","7","2","4","24 August 2013"," ""Ain't Life Unkind?""
","I better start with that the premise of this particular work of fiction held no promise but it was recommended to me by a supposed optimist. To live in a country with no hope and no future is something we hope to correct in the present, and to know we are simply sheep to our Betters is to live in hope they get a shearing instead. This portrayal of a violent flatland is good science fiction because it's thought provoking but ultimately the grim relentless pointlessness of it all ensures once I've chewed it over it'll be filed away and forgotten.<br/><br/>In 2027 infertility rules mankind until Clive Owen stumbles upon heavily guarded heavily pregnant woman – guarded by a terrorist clique who seem to want unfettered immigration into this grey and unpleasant land. It's a bloody and chaotic journey to get her to safety abroad. Everyone has guns and is trigger happy in support of various useless pointless causes except Michael Caine, who I thought turned in his best performance for years in here. Maybe because it was brief though. The mystical condition of pregnancy is shown as having been completely forgotten about by everybody in the 18 years since the last birth – which only shows to me how young and immature the writers and makers of this film were. Like Owen I didn't see the birth scene coming, but then again, didn't really want to! It seems the idea is that in the future our beloved government will spend endless amounts of money to maintain a violent ultra-strict anti-immigrant policy while endless amounts of foreigners don't realise this and continue to flood into paradise. Even in the midst of the chaos in Beirut in the 1970's people still bought Coca Cola and Esso ensuring capitalism's smooth running and their Betters healthy bank balances. In this film's vision all people seem to want are guns and weed. There is an emotionally upbeat climax with religious overtones which is quickly quashed with the final depressing scenes on the boat with the ship coming. It left me thinking: do the world a favour and have the ship sink the boat.<br/><br/>It's very well made, well acted, well thought out and well out of order. We are indeed all doomed one way or another – religion and capitalism can only speed us on our way. Pax Vobiscum."

Owen plays a disillusioned unknowing hero who ends up trying to save the life of a young mother and child.<br/><br/>The world portrayed in the future - very bleak and oppressive is very believable. However, what I found a bit weak/hard to believe is the entire premise of why there have not been any children born into the world for the past eighteen years (Truth be told, it is always going to be difficult to replicate the entire storyline of a book into a movie).<br/><br/>In particular the scene where when the mother is carrying her child down through the building and all the soldiers/fighters stop fighting and look in awe - but as soon as the first gunshot was fired the Owen, the mother and the child were ignored as they continued their gun battle.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall an entertaining movie which I would recommend seeing if you can palate the premise behind the movie."

Some of the fighting scenes are somewhat gruesome, but have a touch of reality like those car accident commercials. It is a very scary idea to have no children in the world, a great concept for a movie anyway you look at it.

I am not a fan of 'pornographic' violence namely the swathe of rubbish like the saw and hostel films which frankly portray images I don't want to see and which is why i haven't. However, real film making like Children of Men make you feel every punch or kick thrown, and certainly every explosion and bullet wound. Someone being horrifically injured or fatally wounded should shock us if we are being confronted with mature thoughtful film-making.<br/><br/>I'm in danger of turning this review into a one-sided debate about screen violence so I'll just stop there.<br/><br/>Personally I think this is the best dystopian future movie to arrive since Blade Runner and I include the Matrix in that.<br/><br/>See this movie while you can on the big screen and buy it on DVD. <br/><br/>See this movie.<br/><br/>I would love it if this was considered for the Oscars, certainly for it's cinematography which was simply breath-taking."
"bigbadfutha","8","2","4","28 September 2006"," Very good British thriller
","One perhaps which Brits will enjoy most (being set in England and dealing with current issues) but highly recommended for anyone. The Britain of Children of Men is in a bleak world under siege by international terrorism and where illegal immigrants are rounded up and imprisoned. It is a highly plausible scenario (apart from the fact that women are infertile) and adds a great sense of realism. On the subject of realism, I believe the movie was shot using a hand held camera, which is an interesting approach and really draws you in. There is a long 'battle' scene and a fight scene involving Clive Owen which really are top notch in terms of realism (apart from the fact that Owen seems to have had several years of military training). Owen and Michael Caine put in some top drawer performances, and are ably supported by the rest of the cast. This film is an extremely enjoyable and thought provoking piece of cinema."

A lot of it has been seen before in other films but at the same time it was still pretty uncomfortable to watch.<br/><br/>And some of the action sequences are just jaw-dropping. I'm not sure how much film-trickery was involved but several of the action sequences (2-3 minutes and more!) appear to be filmed in a single take. If anything the length of the takes was so extreme as to have me distracted - wondering how on earth they'd done it! The sequence where the group get ambushed in the countryside and are driving backwards with a motorcycle in pursuit is impressive enough - but then the section in the Bexhill refugee camp with the army etc is almost (but not quite) up there with the Saving Private Ryan battle scenes.<br/><br/>Michael Caine steals the show in a part that seems to have been tailor made for him! Clive Owen and Julianne Moore do well, despite the latter's disappointingly short time on-screen! Not a film you'd want to go and see if you want to be cheered up - although there's a surprising number of laughs to be had! <br/><br/>Well made and well worth going to see.

This could easily be real, could easily happen & feels real.
The movie is relevant & shocking but also exciting too. Clive Owen gives a great intense performance as an ordinary guy protecting a pregnant lady at a time when there hasn't been a baby born in years, the world is in a panicked & depressed state with no hope. No one gets pregnant anymore & no children anywhere, there's a big mystery to all this & a real sense of loss & sadness, loneliness & desperation is the atmosphere in this Thrilling piece of science fiction.<br/><br/>Clive Owen as Theo must get the ONLY pregnant women to a safe place amongst a devastated England that has collapsed & fallen.

","Back when it was released, 'Children of Men' was a controversial concept and unlike many other films given the futuristic setting and dark subject matter (a dying, infertile world). Since its release, many other dystopian stories have been told through film with varying success. The reason why 'Men' works is because of one man - Alfonso Cuaron.<br/><br/>Cuaron has proven over and over that his ability behind the camera has been appreciated, through Academy Awards for cinematography and directing, among others. In 'Men,' there are a number of aspects that are signatures of his, with the hallmark being a extended single-shot sequence that immerses the audience into the events on the screen. This kind of execution is not for novice directors, and Cuaron is able to pull it off flawlessly. But aside from the technical aspects, there is a difficult story at the center of 'Men.'<br/><br/>As the leads, Clive Owen and Julianne Moore balance each other out in their time on the screen together. It's clear that Moore is the superior actor, as Owen is his usual wooden self, but they do a good job when paired. There are also some supporting performances from the likes of Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Caine that should be praised, with Caine taking on a role that is outside his usual buttoned up self. And Clare-Hope Ashitey portrays a woman who becomes a symbol of hope who must be protected at all costs.<br/><br/>Despite the doom and gloom throughout the film, there are plenty of reasons to enjoy the storytelling that comes through 'Children of Men,' and it's likely it will be remembered as a cinematic achievement years from now."

The last half scene when Clive Owen and others go down the stairs was very good. I was so implessed that my lips couldn't stop shaking. Children are really innocent and sacred, and therefore many people can feel it--regardless of their positions, languages and wealth.<br/><br/>I didn't realize the famous 10 minutes long takes because I knew it after watching it.

","I've read a handful of reviews for this film and many feel the story is somewhat prophetic; one writer states that it's a 'gut wrenching look at an all too possible future"". If that's the case, maybe we should all give up right now. There's a place for dystopian films I guess, but this film doesn't offer much in the way of hope, even if Theo Faron (Clive Owen) completed his mission posthumously by delivering Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) and her baby to the 'Tomorrow' ship. It would have helped if there were some good guys in the story, but the government forces and the insurgent 'Fishes' they were aligned against were both so brutally extreme that it was difficult to pick the side with a nobler cause. And then you had the refugees, the 'fugees', caught in the middle with their own hopeless situation.<br/><br/>It was really confusing early in the picture for example, when Theo and Julian (Julianne Moore) were making their escape with Miriam (Pam Ferris ) and Kee, and they were being attacked by a mob that one would consider part of the 'Fishes', but Julian herself was the principal leader of that movement. So big question mark there. And 'breaking into' the Bexhill Refugee Camp just so Theo could rescue Kee and her baby OUT of the camp seemed like an exercise in redundancy. Yes, the militant Syd (Peter Mullan) was Theo's contact inside the camp, but the whole roundabout nature of what was to transpire got very muddled.<br/><br/>Probably the best I can say about the film has to to with the performances of Clive Owen and Michael Caine as the strangely anachronistic (for 2027) pothead Jasper. I would have included Julianne Moore as well but she didn't last very long in the story. It was inspiring that Kee and her baby made it safely to the rescue ship, but thinking about it some more, if the youngest person on the planet was just a tad older than the eighteen year old who was murdered at the beginning of the picture, humanity's best hope was still a long way off before human births could be considered a normal event again."

You will miss a lot if you do. 5) Stellar cast lead by Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Chwetel Ejiofor 6) The film is set in a post-apocalyptic/dystopian England in a future in which humans are infertile. The treasuring of youth is an important aspect. 7) This film can be viewed as Cyberpunk. Advanced technology exists and is commonly used, but only by the top. The rest of society is left to suffer. 8) As this film is based of the novel of PD James, fans will notice significant changes at some points. Be warned. 9) Go see this movie."

","""Children of Men"" is set in 2027, where all women are infertile. But then Theo get's approached by an old friend of his, who wants him to reignite the flame of his activism and help her to bring the one pregnant women to safety.<br/><br/>That was my little synopsis of the movie. Now I'll discuss the more thecnical side of the film. First the directing. Alfonso Cuarón was responsible for this. He did a very good job at it. He used hand- held camera throughout the movie, which I generally don't like, but his use of it, felt so natural and fitted with the rough theme of the movie. Cuarón also used long takes, which created these beautiful scenes. The tension was built and he showed the background more in those longer scenes, so you could get a better feel of the movie. One of my favorite scenes of the movie was one of these long takes. The one I'm talking about is where Theo, Julian, Kee, Luke and Miriam are sitting in the car and get ambushed. I have a little analysis of that scene at the end of my review. Alfonso Cuarón was also able to bring a good chock factor to the movie. He did this in various ways, but most notably, for me at least, is the scene where Jasper get's shot. In that scene he let's the gunshot echo through the forst, just like our reaction hangs around for a bit. There is a lot to say about that scene, but I already have one scene analysis, which is enough for this review. The editing was also very well handled. In the long takes, there were probably cuts (I wasn't able to spot any, but there obviously were some hidden with cgi), but the fact that I wasn't able to spot any is a sign of good editing. If you are a more experienced movie-goer than me, you would probably notice them, though. The soundtrack was remarkable. It stood in contrast with the often references to older pieces of art, that were also visualized in some scenes. <br/><br/>The acting was magnificent. Clive Owen, who played Theo, gave his best performance yet. He was absolutely remarkable. I can't comprehend why he didn't even get an Oscar nod. He gave so much extra to his character and he was a charismatic hero. He achieved well in the emotional scenes. Not only Clive Owen was good, but Julianne Moore too. She was marvelous in her role, except I would've liked to see her more in the movie, just because she was so good. The chemistry between her and Clive Owen worked very well, and gave a fantastic on-screen romance. Michael Caine played something different that I'm used from him, and I've got to admit that this is one of his most amusing roles I've seen him in. He was funny and acted the part flawlessly. The actress of Kee, Clare-Hope Ashitey, too was good. The actors that I haven't mentioned were mostly good. There wasn't someone who did a bad job, or someone who broke the immersion.<br/><br/>The screenplay was written by a lot of people, so I had my doubts with it. Most of the time when it's written by that many, it turns out badly. But it turned out good this time. This wasn't the part of the movie, that stood out to me. The story was simple, but effective and the characters were good. You cared about the main character due to a lot of subtle character development. The dialogue felt very natural and didn't feel out of place at all. The story progressed well and the villains of the movie had a good reason to hunt down Kee. This shows both ways to view a situation. The jokes were good and never got old. Micheal Caines line delivery for those jokes was on point.<br/><br/>And here to end my review is my analysis. This scene (the car scene) stood out in particular, because of the fantastic cinematography and tension-building. The cinematography in that scene reached that level of goodness, because it constantly managed to keep the framing right. You'd expect that some pieces of that scene were ugly-looking, due to the lack of movement for the cameraman, but this wasn't the case. The tension-building was also something that I mentioned This is because the build up to the action was done brilliantly. Alfonso Cuarón first showed us that Theo and Julian were really close before - we knew this already, but here he explores it a bit more - and he also shows them in quite a relaxed state. But then the flaming cars roles down, and panic starts to occur. The beep of the car works as the tension-building score on it's own: the high monotone pitch. Now, because you are more invested with the characters, you are on the edge of your seat, because you don't want anything to happen to them. Then, terror happens. From loud noises we go to silence with the beep tone again. Just to show the contrast again, just like before. Then: peace to violence. Now: loud noises to silence. But when you think it's over, the cops arrive as well. Everything seems to be going fine, but then Luke shoots them. This comes as shock, because we were thinking it was going to go well. Luke asked for the passports, so you'd think that it would just go by, without any problem. The brilliant part of the scene is also that it doesn't need any music to build up tension. It needs visuals and that's something that I found very impressive. <br/><br/>So that was my review and analysis of the movie. It was a very well directed and acted one, with fantastic long takes, who immerse you into the film even more. Alfonso Cuarón created a world, that was believable and harsh. <br/><br/>9.5/10"

","Throughout the movie you could watch that the people didn't have a hope of a change or of a difference and when the movie ended, the baby was the miracle and the hope that people were not expecting which you could notice how the people were surprised by it, and how they acted when they saw the baby. You can relate today's society with the movie by that, because people is losing their identity and hope and are just following the crowd instead of being like Theo and risking his life or taking action and not letting their fear win. (participating on a difference) Sometimes we need to put our hope or our trust in other people, because we don't really know if we are going to keep leaving or sometimes we just need help. Everything will matter at the end. For example with Juliana, when she died, she told the woman to only trust Theo, and so she did. At the beginning it was difficult for her because she believed what the others said which at the end were saying the opposite of what Juliana was telling them to do. Also, sometimes we need to risk our lives for the people we care or love in order for them to be safe for example the old man with Theo and the lady's guardian that was in the bus and an official took her and killed her in order for them to continue their mission and to save the world."

","Granted, I do not appear in the movie, but at some level I should be able to connect with someone in the movie and from there feel my way to the end. This did not happen anywhere.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The human female population of the world is infertile. The world is upset about it in a very cliché mid-life crisis sort of way where we want to break up with everybody and have our own way. The imperial powers are locking down their playgrounds and the armed body politic is guarding the gates. Countries on the periphery seem to be evacuating causing the imperial powers to create a refugee crisis. As told and depicted, none of this makes sense, and not because human violence of this sort is nonsensical, but because there is no pattern, method, hook, or plot line to examine and go along with.<br/><br/>Where the hell are we?<br/><br/>We are in Britain. This is true.<br/><br/>We are in a year where the youngest child is no longer a child both in the sense of being a grown-up and in the sense of being dead.<br/><br/>We are in a political climate where the government is repressing non- Britains.<br/><br/>We are on a journey to move a pregnant woman through Britain to meet a clandestine group who might be associated with Greenpeace.<br/><br/>We are in a rush, but in a way that never feels rushed.<br/><br/>We have a baby.<br/><br/>We walk with the baby amongst reverent onlookers.<br/><br/>We escape.<br/><br/>All of this is somehow connected.

It is just your standard anti-authority flick with a bunch of 60/70's music thrown in which really doesn't match the year 2027, considering todays music. It was as if an old hippie was given a camera and told, ""Go make a futuristic movie in which women can't have children. Oh, and add some old hippie music also!"" There also is nothing very futuristic about the future, not even modern. Evidently no one has cell phones, pocket TV's, GPS, or anything else we all carry around with us today. They run around in very old cars with a little extra fiberglass for body style, and none of their weapons even have laser sights. My house is more futuristic than this movie! This movie just seems to ramble on and on going nowhere. It might have made a good 15 minute short film, but not 2 hours. It didn't have anything new to say and certainly doesn't make you think. In fact, I thought it was a rather brain-dead conglomeration of anti-establishment nonsense. This movie is a lot like the old hippie movement itself. It exalts anti-authority rhetoric but then gives no viable alternative at all. In the end it just amounts to a bunch of really stupid and childish people carrying signs saying ""Hooray for our side"", flash with no substance. Which is what this movie is.

"conmech","9","6","21","19 November 2007"," I'm in Love With This Movie
","I watched this movie right after ""300"", and felt like cleaning my mouth with fresh water after eating something with a bad taste. This movie is probably one of the best of its kind, if not one-of-a-kind. A good movie always keeps one of your emotions at its peak while watching it, it can be fear, joy, excitement, even misery. What I felt watching this movie was admiration.<br/><br/>Now I would simply say ""No need for words, go and watch it"" but I wanna be different than the haters of this movie who cannot say anything about why they didn't like it. Actually, I intentionally searched for haters because I wanted to see what is there that someone can dislike. There are apparently many 1 stars, but they can't go further than saying ""I want my money back"".<br/><br/>So I will tell you why I loved it. The foremost reason was the directing. There was definitely more work in the movie than many CGI loaded ones. Some scenes were shot as a big chunk of 10-15 minutes, and they were the hardest and most exciting scenes. Watch out for especially 3 scenes. 1) Where the characters try to runaway with a car which doesn't start and it's going downhill 2) The inside car scene where terrorists intercept the car and attack them 3) And of course the final scene where Clive Owen is trying to get inside a building under heavy battle.<br/><br/>All these scenes were shot as big blocks which I couldn't understand how they were shot. Of course the director probably did it the hard way, set everything up, set the timing, and tried the same scene for tens of times until everything went smoothly. This is not all, the choice of places and setting up the scenes were brilliant. It wasn't covered with filters or heavy background music or ever-changing angles so it successfully made me feel I was there with them, in that forest, on that hill, in that car, in that building. I think Hollywood directors have a lot to learn from this movie just by watching it. <br/><br/>The second reason is the brilliant acting. Audience like me don't understand much from good acting but if the characters make me forget that this is just a movie and if I have have real feelings for them, this MUST be good acting. My favorites are Jasper and Kee. I would give more details but I don't wanna give any spoilers.<br/><br/>And I can't believe even the story was hated by some people. This movie has got exactly what a good sci-fi should have. You stick to all laws of reality, you change just one of them, and predict the reactions. This movie does this perfectly. The fact that it doesn't have a lot of CGI makeup makes the movie even more believable.<br/><br/>Final statement, brilliant work of art. Especially if you are interested in directing or movie-making you cannot afford to miss this movie. It will blow you away..."
"phantomshane2004","10","4","12","29 February 2008"," An Adventurous and Imaginative Journey
","I can't believe how amazing this film was. They say you shouldn't write a review right after you watch a movie, because you may get caught up in the moment and was notice the flaws until the second or third time you watch it. Well, I first saw this movie over 4 months ago and I can't stop thinking about it. The plot just captures your mind right away. Humans cannot reproduce. You instantly are confused and want to know how/why/when it happened, because the sheer fact of infertility sounds preposterous, you don't think its possible, so your friend asks ""how?"" ""Well here's how, we watch the movie.""<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anybody, a fan of sci-fi or not, this doesn't seem like a sci fi film, due to a collapse in the chain of mankind's productiveness. Nuclear fallout, wars fought over resources, or the fact that the human kind is ending. One of the most interesting concepts the human mind comprehends. The plot is intriguing. Riots and protests, and more have lead to Great Britain being the strongest country, but even this country, has problems crawling toward the light of the government. Humans are at a state of perpetual chaos, and the scenes viewed in this movie leave you in absolute awe. The destruction, the sheer notion of pure human misery at every square inch of the earth. ""We will be no more."" Humans are on the verge of extinction, and a relationship that ended with the death of a baby from a flu pandemic, Theo and Julian are brought back together. Julian is the leader of terrorist organization, who has stopped random acts of violence. <br/><br/>She offers him money in order to escort a woman to a biology institute called ""The Human Project."" Theo is an alcoholic, for almost every scene in the movie he is taking a swig of some strong beverage. Something interesting if you didn't already know, that Theo gives up his alcohol in order to wash his hands before the birth of the baby. Bam, Theo has overcame his problem. Just one of the little things and symbolism throughout the movie. Over the course of the movie Theo loses almost everyone he knows, slowly losing sanity and reasons to live. But he, has to transport the first pregnant woman in 17 years. There is a reason to live. He does everything he can to avoid the deaths of the people around him, and realizes its out of his hands. <br/><br/>The sheer amount of symbolism in this movie cannot be comprehended, something can always be alluded to a flaw or signs and logic seen by humans on a regular basis. Women miscarriage because of what the characters think is gamma rays, pollution, etc. All which pose major threats to human survival. Theo presses on as he watches his friends pass on before him. <br/><br/>The direction and sound is flawless. The soundtrack is amazing, which consists of songs from artists rarely heard of, except for a few. Some of now my favorite songs I heard in his movie. The direction is in a style that immerses you. The camera doesn't switch 300 times during a conversation to see the people who are talking. Although shots that seem the longest were actually stitched together using CGI to make it one cut, almost all of them are longer than usual, the camera lazily drifting to something important on screen.<br/><br/>Be careful with this movie, you really have to pay attention and really appreciate it for what it is. Don't be quick to judge this movie, it certainly isn't a movie made for women at all. It is very violent and there's some technology advancements and it would appear a guy movie, because of a lot of the violence, but maybe thats too much of a generalization. You must take not of everything that goes on in this movie because it becomes important later, and becomes very rewarding when you can figure out something thats powerful, like naming a baby after a baby who died.... those who have seen the movie will understand. This is one of the most emotionally dwelling and depressing movies out there, with some music that puts and chill down your spine and you begin to choke up with sadness. Oh yeah, and I'm a male."
"dragonshield","10","4","12","5 June 2007"," Absolutely phenomenal, I am stunned
","I had seen this movie before but I had to memorize things from it for reviewing so I watched it again 4 days ago. It still is as excellent as a movie can pretty much get. I actually had to shorten this review as it passed the 1000 word -limit, so I apologize as some things are obviously and sadly left out. For example comments on Julianne Moore, the plot and a more detailed commenting on the story's depth. So don't get frustrated, as you may find some parts of this review simply missing something.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is how incredibly well it's made. The way the futuristic world is made is probably the best I've ever seen in a motion picture. It is so detailed and so believable. All the visible corruption, trash all over the street, ruins of buildings and this darkness and sadness is just so top notch it makes you wonder how the hell did they make it. I mean, it's just so realistic that it makes the movie one of those movies that leave you with your mouth open. The visual side of the movie is just so effective.<br/><br/>I am very happy to say that Clive Owen finally has the perfect role for him. To be honest I've never liked Clive Owen before as he has always been sort of tense and annoyingly stiff, and that deep voice he has hasn't really helped him in his past roles either. Owen does an astonishing role performance as Theo Faron and he is just perfect in the role, he in fact is the character itself. I especially liked the verbal work he did, it sort of boosted up the character and really gave it a true soul. Then there was the great Michael Caine, who is by the way one of my favourite actors of all time. To me the role of Jasper Palmer, an aging hippie selling his own self grown weed, was so ideal yet so surreal for Caine and he did a truly amazing role performance. Caine surely was at his best and if you ask me, the role performance was so good that it should have been at least worth an Academy Award nomination for best actor in a supporting role, but sadly he never wasn't nominated for it.<br/><br/>The brilliance of this movie doesn't end here, as it also includes surely one of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a motion picture. Probably even the best one. Most of it is hand-held, but there are still shots as well, which kinda balances the whole overall cinematography a bit so it won't be a ""shaking ride"" throughout. Usually hand-held cinematography these days is used for symbolizing depressing moments and it gives the actors more room for improvising, which we've seen over and over again, and happily that isn't the case of the cinematography in ""Children of Men"". Hand-held is also a very effective way of shooting when it comes to war movies and the action scenes in them, it gives that true edge of a real battle and the viewer feels like he is in fact in a middle of a massive fight. Not only using hand-held to figure the action scenes, ""Children of Men"" does more than that with it. It kind of makes it feel like a real future, so it makes the whole sci-fi thing something that could actually take place some day, so it makes the movie even more believable and it also high-lights the whole theme of sorrow and sadness. It makes it reality. A truly superior achievement indeed.<br/><br/>The story in its wholeness is simply stunning. The screenplay written by Alfonso Cuarón, Timothy J. Sexton, David Arata, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby is very well written and I could presume that Alfonso Cuarón as also the director of ""Children of Men"" has been the head writer of the movie. Of course I can't be sure, so I can't really praise it as Cuarón's work, but I can harmlessly praise it as the work of the writer of the original novel written by P.D. James. She has invented a dramatic, a true and a real story with a depth that can not be measured. It is just so deep and so detailed. There's so much tension and intensity in it as well, which also makes the movie a very thrilling thriller, backed up by the totally terrific directing by Alfonso Cuarón. This is complimented by the fantastic music the movie has to offer. It mainly consists of these songs that are just so fitting for the main theme of the movie, but there is also this relaxing and absolutely beautiful opera/new age -song which is repeated several times throughout the movie, making the film overall a soothing, peaceful experience despite its actual focus on the action and the thrill.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" shines with excellence and to me it is all in all just so perfect. It has a very original, unique story which I can't honestly imagine being a disappointment to anyone, though some viewers may find it slightly disturbing. In my opinion, the overall attention the movie got wasn't nearly what it deserved and it should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award for the best motion picture of the year. You don't see me giving 10's so often, but this movie deserves the highest score without a doubt. It is one of the best visions of the future ever translated on the big screen being that provoking and effective itself and it will most certainly climb up to my personal Top 5 Movies of All Time -list. I just love this movie, it is simply superb and I feel ashamed that I can not compliment it enough. There were many great movies last year, but if you ask me, this was the best one."

Seeing very rave reviews and understanding how praised this film has been, the outcome of the film left one disappointed and confused as to why it has been as highly as praised. The ending of the film came at a surprise where it was a ""that's it?"" ending. The film does pick up some pace but barely though overall the film isn't very thrilling.<br/><br/>It is more basically a chase/escape film about a London worker (Clive Owen) who must protect and safe guard a London refugee to a safe place since she is the only woman pregnant in the last 18 years. We understand this but the character of the pregnant woman is rather unlikable as we wonder what's the point. When we look back on the film, not much of a story occurs as the film goes through it's typical plot points with an ending that is rather unsatisfying and it simply ""just ends""<br/><br/>A lot of unanswered questions are left in which one would have expected to been explored more.

"Madmax56","4","3","8","12 March 2008"," Ideas behind Film Need to be Further Examined
","I really wanted to like this movie. I admire Clive Owen and take interest in presentations of dystopian alternate universes. The film is great, visually, and there is definitely a tense sense of conflict throughout for viewers. However, the writing and ideas behind the film should be further analyzed. If you like Leftist anti-Western Civilization propaganda, or suffer from a major mental illness, this is just the movie for you.<br/><br/>The absurd plot is based on the idea that women will cease to have babies because of something mankind did to the planet to somehow end births You get the drift: anti-capitalist; anti-business; anti-Big Bad Corporations.<br/><br/>So naturally, the people of this future world go absolutely ape, tribal and start killing off one another with glee after the awful truth sinks in that they are the last generation. This to my mind would be a rather bizarre reaction, since a zero population growth would open up all sorts of employment opportunities in the more wealthy nations, and, logically, immigrants -- the object of Government hatred in this movie -- would be welcome to keep things moving until the end days, even if they are illegal.<br/><br/>I realize that facts, logic and reason have little to do with modern film making by the neo-Communist Alfonso Cuarón, but after introducing us to this ""Brave New World"" of a brutal, dark and dirty Bombay looking futuristic London, bombs start going off, and before you can say, ""Holy Crap!,"" rebels jump out of nowhere to take the hero, Theo (rather anti-hero, he's a drunk) into the heart of darkness where ""Homeland Security"" (British soldiers wearing American style uniforms and helmets) seem to be killing out of hand everyone who isn't British, or throwing a lucky few into concentration camps for deportation.<br/><br/>Of course, the soldiers and police are themselves being bumped off in wholesale lots by the rebels who don't take anyone prisoner for long except for our hero and drunk , Theo (who really gets into Drunk Acting 101 with attention to details like always carrying a bottle, losing his shoes and never taking off his raincoat), although it does help that Julian, his Feminazi girlfriend, is one of the Head Rebels. I suppose her character is meant to represent the ""good and pure women"" in this era who drop everything to oppose the ""Fascist"" regime of the day.<br/><br/>Then our anti-hero Theo meets up with an elderly Michael Caine. A sort of ""grandfather hippie"" with long gray hair and they have a discussion on why women can't have children -- I couldn't follow the logic his explanation, but I think it was just a general denouncing of the Industrial Revolution as the root cause of the end of births, you know, typical Leftist cheap thought.<br/><br/>After that glorious scene, the story becomes a mad rush across a bleak Britain where the sun never shines, but finally our anti-hero Theo meets up with The Pregnant Girl, Kee (The first mother-to-be in twenty years who just happens to be a black and a single mom for reasons of multiculturalism and political correctness) whom he takes (I missed the reason) to something called the ""Human Project."" This makes both the Government and Rebels very unhappy and gives them an excuse to create an even higher body count in comic book style action and another video game for the personal computer.<br/><br/>Ronbo give this movie only a one star rating for being crude, stupid and anti-American.<br/><br/>How about more realistic movie about Britain twenty years into the future where Islam has taken over the country and by force converted all Britons to Islam, or killed all of them, except for one lone pregnant Christian woman who is attempting to flee Britain to Christian America with the help of an atheistic yet noble modern day knight and member of the Underground while hunted by various Islamic militas and the dark forces of the Islamic Republic of Britain?"

","Apart from one scene of dodgy acting, and some continuity problems, this film completely blew me away. The scene in the refugee camp when they are fleeing the fish is just incredible, even when the blood splatters on the lens. I had no idea what this film was about before I watched it, which made it all the more amazing (I thought it was about Bosnia from the trailers!). Clive Owen is very well cast. At one point, he puts on a pair of flip flops, which you can then hear throughout the rest of the movie. It was this attention to detail which also stood out. The acting is excellent and the direction is superb. And the special effects are awesome. Really really good stuff!"
"DeeNine-2","7","3","8","16 May 2007"," Mostly a routine action film set in a childless future
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>Science fiction is always about the present. This has been true since the beginning of science fiction. It has to be true since we can only extrapolate from the present to the future. Only rarely, once in a million tries perhaps, does somebody come up with something truly original, or something unpredictable. Leonard Da Vinci foresaw submarines, but if you think about it, he had the example of turtles, whales and dolphins. Who foresaw nuclear energy? Who foresaw electricity and all that it can do? So this is about the present. The refugee camp could be in Palestine. The round up of immigrants is what many people in Europe and the US want. It may happen tomorrow; in fact it is happening to some extent. The irony and perhaps the illogic of this film is that with no babies being born, now for eighteen years, there is no labor force coming on to do the grunt work of society. So why are the Brits in a frenzy of anti-immigration? Apparently because of a fascist government has come to power.<br/><br/>This reminds me a bit of something from Terry Gilliam who directed 12 Monkeys (1995) and Brazil (1985). There is something about the decadent and bombed out feel of the scenes that is the same.<br/><br/>This is a film for the underdog, for the oppressed. It is in a symbolic sense a statement about aging Europe with its declining birth rates needing the fertility of people from southern climes, people of color to save the world from extinction. In Europe today there are countries with birth rates so low that their populations are declining. In both Europe and the US it is immigrants who are supporting the declining populations which are increasingly old. In the US we have winked at the influx of illegal immigrants for decades because those in power know two things: (1) cheap labor is good for their bottom line; and (2) without young people paying into social security, the system will go bankrupt.<br/><br/>The sets were exquisite, the battle scenes in the refugee camp seemed as authentic as the nightly news, well focused and involving. The camera work was outstanding and carefully set up. Michael Caine as the aging hippy was perfect. I saw him recently in The Prestige (2006) and I have to say, he is like a man with a new career in his mid-seventies. Claire-Hope Ashitey, who played Kee with her big eyes and her fresh face and her reserved style was also very good. Clive Owen looked as heroic as the part demanded, and Julianne Moore in a limited role was good.<br/><br/>There was some corniness in the movie and some politically correct stuff, like Kee braiding the old woman's hair and our hero being sensitive enough to be a midwife (today's men are above and beyond the purely macho). There is also a root for the underdog feel throughout with the good guys (relatively speaking) being outsiders. The scene where the government troops stand in awe of a baby's cry was striking (imagine how Spielberg would have milked this!), but I suspect that somebody, at hearing of the first human birth in over eighteen years, would have ignored the resumption of fire and stayed with the only woman on earth who was fertile. I think everyone would have wanted to protect her and her baby.<br/><br/>A nice touch that director Alfonso Cuaron could have brought to the film was to show us people doing extreme things in their desperation to have children, worshipping icons of fertility maybe, acting out weird rituals while imbibing strange concoctions. Instead of just showing some religious demonstrators blaming the lack of human fertility on sinfulness, we might have gotten a glimpse of fertility cults drinking the essence of goat eggs or rhino horns as they danced around some fertility symbol. Maybe there could have been a national health crisis as myriads of people, especially women, went crazy or committed suicide because of depression brought on by infertility. Actually there was a hint of this in the movie but it was greatly underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Another problem with this film (from my POV; for others this might be a plus) is that the direction relies heavily on action sequences. There are chase scenes (and a nice car door opening gimmick used twice, once to knock the bad guys off their motorcycles, and once to knock down one of the fishes holding a gun). But there was little subtlety in the story. Most of the subtlety in the movie is in the scenes themselves and in the camera work. And the characters are rather one-dimensional. Theo (Clive Owen) is merely heroic. He fights through the bullets and the other obstacles to help Kee and her baby. Kee herself is hardly developed at all. Michael Caine's character Jasper is the only one with any real depth.<br/><br/>Two final points: I don't think this film is nearly as interesting as Cuaron's Y tu mama tambien (2001), and I would not dream of watching this film without subtitles since a lot of the dialogue is almost inaudible to these ancient ears.<br/><br/>By the way, a discussion of why women were infertile and how the movie differs from the book can be found at the IMDb."

The plot had very nice twists and the film as a whole had great shock value and makes you think for sure.

","After seeing the trailer to the Children of men, I was at first excited to see this feature, it had looked interesting. During the months that passed, I got my hand on the Children of men novel, read it, and wasn't sure whether the movie would be good or bad. The book left me overtly disappointed.<br/><br/>As I watched the movie, I felt, indifferent. I was not moved to tears by any of the scenes that were suppose to provide an emotional uplifting or an emotional downpour. Clive Owen although a good actor didn't really strike me as someone who I could be touched by. I did not feel a whole lot different.<br/><br/>The movie, neither left me with any positive or anything negative. I think the positive image of hope is deplorable and it's completely cliché. Why did the girl suddenly have a child, they did not explain this and although the book itself was rather weak at the reasoning it was more or less better at trying to do so.<br/><br/>Overall a disappointing feature and I think that the budget and the effort could have been channelled into providing something more than just entertainment, more than just an hour and a half of sitting waiting for something to happen."
"kintopf432","10","3","8","12 January 2007"," Clever, clever, clever
","I must laugh when I read critics saying things about this film like ""powerful, but doesn't explain enough,"" or raising objections like ""unfortunately, we never find out what caused the infertility in the first place"" or ""how a single baby is going to change anything is never made clear."" Ha! Despite the inevitable appearance of the term *dystopian* in their reviews, these writers seem unaware that what they've seen is a satire  and satire, whether it's funny or whether it's sad, is always a kind of fantasy, and needn't play by the same rules as an artwork that pretends to exist in the real world. (I don't understand why these critics wanted the movie to explain itself more anyway, since the early scenes where it *does* do a lot of explaining are probably its worst.) In fact, probably the film this most resembles is another famous film satire, ""Brazil,"" right down to its possibly-government-sponsored terrorism campaign and WWII-type propaganda. (""Suspicious? Report it"" is right out of the earlier film, and the hilariously plausible ""The world collapses . . . *only Britain soldiers on*"" should have been.) On paper, the plot is just as classically comic, with a naïve, reluctant hero (he's even a civil servant!), recurring characters who pop up in unexpected places, and hairsbreadth, coincidence-based escapes.<br/><br/>But the key difference is that where Terry Gilliam inflated his movie with a cartoonish artifice, here director Alfonso Cuarón employs a punishing, sometimes shocking realism. The result is a film that, despite its (mostly visual) wit, feels so immediate, so intense, and so horrifying that you forget you're watching a comedy. But this isn't a criticism  it's exactly that irony that makes the film seem so fresh. We usually associate irony with things which make light of very serious subjects; ""Dr. Strangelove"" works by taking something grave and terrifying and making it ludicrous. Cuarón is even cleverer  he takes something ludicrous, a sci-fi chase caper, and makes it grave and terrifying. It's even moving  you feel like you've been through ""Schindler's List"" at the end of it. His technique is masterful . . . his style, and the artistry of his cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, suggest documentary without ever fully giving over to it  apart from a somber opening theme by John Tavener, there is no original music, and the production team puts the viewer into the film at the best/worst of times, as in the escape from the Fishes' compound, the raid on Jasper's house, the final hellish descent into the Bexhill ghetto, and, especially, in the harrowing attack on Luke's van. This scene, filmed from inside the vehicle and executed without any cuts (that I noticed), is one of the most gut-wrenchingly horrifying movie moments I can remember. (But even this comes with a Hitchcockian wink, as the nominal female lead gets snuffed out a quarter way into the film, without so much as a final speech.) <br/><br/>But while the film uses the realistic to transform the absurd, it also incorporates a third, even more surprising element: a poetry that gives this world a unique haunted quality. London makes a great ruined city; it's hard to imagine a New World metropolis having the same impact, as modern European cities already carry with them such a sense of lost and ancient civilization. In its use of architecture (actually, not only in that), the film sometimes resembles the latter part of ""Full Metal Jacket,"" only this time the ruined British buildings are actually supposed to *be* ruined British buildings. The wet, green English countryside is used as a contrast to the urban horrors (though any tranquility it suggests proves false); most important of all is the amazing placement of animals  they're everywhere in the film  which are used in various ways. They give us welcome reminders of human kindness (the many beloved pets) and irresponsibility (the dead animals from farms that have become unmaintainable or unnecessary). Most of all, they are reminders of hope  or at any rate of survival, as they appear in abandoned schools and buildings under siege. (And they, too, are reminiscent of Gilliam; remember the zoo animals that flourish in the plague-emptied Philadelphia of ""Twelve Monkeys."") <br/><br/>In a world and directorial conception this size, the characters and the performances seem appropriately small. But they're all good. Claire-Hope Ashitey has an appropriate radiance, without seeming like too magical an earth mother (Kee's joke about immaculate conception is a great comment on our expectations). Clive Owen resists any temptation to be movie-heroic, and as a result Theo comes across as surprisingly, authentically brave, as when he plunges into the tank-surrounded building in the climactic battle scene. (Compare this character with Tom Cruise's in ""War of the Worlds"" and you'll realize what a failure that casting choice was.) Michael Caine gives a witty and ultimately very moving performance; his Jasper gets a brave death, too, although it's one of the moments where Cuarón edges perilously close to sadism. Pam Ferris brings real dignity to her faithful old nurse character (another familiar comic type), and Charlie Hunnam and Peter Mullan find the perfect scary/funny balance (you want to cheer when they get killed).<br/><br/>But again, it's all Cuarón's show, and ""Children of Men"" is really an amazing directorial achievement. There are movies that make you want to live inside them, and there are movies that make you want to live inside the brains of their creators. ""Children of Men"" is neither, but it gets under your skin as well as any movie in my recent memory; at least for a little while, it changed the way I looked at my own reality  I was looking for its world in the real one. ""Don't you expect to hear gunshots?"" I said to a friend as we walked up the sidewalk after the movie. I think he thought I was crazy. 10 out of 10."

"coolfortheone","10","3","8","9 January 2007"," One of the best science fiction films in recent times!
","Happy New Year! I'm hoping 2007 will give us all some great cinema. Not too much though, because I still have not seen all must see movies from 2006. I guess I will have to try and catch up on them now, because man I'm glad I saw Children of Men! <br/><br/>Indeed a hard film to describe but I will do my best. The story takes place in the post apocalyptic future of 2027. Post apocalyptic because for nearly 30 years women have been unable to reproduce and absolutely no one can figure out why. People of the world have lost all hope and civil wars have broken out across the globe. Our protagonist is Theo (Clive Owen) a bitter depressed man with a dark past. He has accepted humanities impending doom and seems content to rot away with the rest of the world. That is until his ex-lover (Julianne Moore) gets him involved with a group of revolutionaries led by Luke whose girlfriend happens to be very pregnant. Obviously this is a huge deal and Theo has plans to escort her to the safety of a top secret scientific facility where research could supply the right people with the answers to save humanity. Unfortunately this task is made much more difficult when the whole worlds a battlefield and few people can be trusted. It sounds depressing, but ""Children of Men"" is really a hopeful and human story of triumph and sacrifice.<br/><br/>Directed by Alfonso Cuaron (Harry Potter & the Prizoner of Azkaban), here he establishes himself as a master of his craft. The world he has created here is one of the bleakest, realistic, and fully realized universes in the medium of science fiction. He lets the action unfold using some of the most incredible camera-work I have ever seen. There is a section near the end which has Clive Owen racing through a bullet-ridden battlefield and into a bombed out building to rescue the girl. The 9 minute sequence is done without any takes and it blows my mind how Cuaron pulled it off. The action scenes are as intense and exciting as anything I have seen from a legend like Spielberg (which says a lot, he is me and Mike's favorite director.) ""Children of Men"" is a tour de force of direction.<br/><br/>I know what the skeptics must be thinking know. ""Don't be stupid, I only care about the story!"" Well you are in luck because Children of Men tells it really good. Clive Owen is excellent as Theo, a man who instantly gained my curiosity and sympathy. His transformation from hardened cynic to noble hero is completely believable. Julianne Moore is one of my favorite actresses and I wish she was in this more. There is also the great British actor Sir Michel Caine as Theo's old mentor. He manages to steal all the scenes he is in. The rest of the cast is very effective as well, though I have not seen many of them in other films. No problem though, it is easier to suspend disbelief and be caught up in the story that way. The acting keeps the films emotional center in place saving it from becoming a mere technical exercise. Some viewers may complain about the lack of closure involved in the end but it did not bother me at all. By the time the credits rolled I felt emotionally satisfied while still having much to think about. Like many great works of hard sci-fi, and indeed great films, ambiguity is one of its greatest strengths.<br/><br/>That aside, ""Children of Men"" still remains a heartfelt, unique, and thrilling cinematic experience. Bottom line: One of the best science fiction films in recent times."

","Children of Men is a surprising, vital and fascinating movie portraying a future in which immigrant-phobia becomes malignant. Without reviewing the story here, the script is an extraordinarily timely one, taking to the extreme a possible scenario resulting from extreme ""Homeland Security"", and lack of understanding that immigrants are people too, something that is already happening here, and abroad. I particularly liked the allusion to the birth of Jesus with the concept that it was an immigrant baby that was the savior of the future of mankind, not to mention that the movie came out Christmas weekend . The scenes are stark, brutal and terrifying because of their realistic possibility. Of the actors, Clive Owen is spectacular as he goes from an apathetic man, having lost his child, and all hope, wandering aimlessly through the gray and crumbling city, to a man who cares desperately, for the new mother, the baby, and hope of a future. Michael Caine is marvelous as the quirky ex-hippie friend of Theo (Clive), and the actor who plays Sid is wonderful as well. Julianne Moore has a very small part in this movie...she didn't do much except play that pure good person she always plays. But, the character's early death in the movie made real the impact her death had on Theos' despair, and really added to the sadness of the movie. A wonderful script!!"

In Cold Mountain, there was so much indiscriminant killing that after a period, you were no longer saddened or even affected by the plight of the performers.<br/><br/>There are moments in this film, for example when the warfare stops briefly, that are pure emotion, and stunning and lengthy camera shots which were a testament to all those involved in the films.<br/><br/>This film is seriously harrowing and not for the faint hearted. It is also very hard to pitch to the cinema going audience, but is a well written piece of drama and I would heartily recommend it to almost anyone."

","I went to see this film last night and I found it at times shocking, moving, exciting and funny. The storyline is a little thin with many things (such as the Human Project) not fully explained. However, for me this added to the total effect of the film. Instead of an old fashioned chase film where your concentration rests on the next obstacle/explosion I found myself resting on the fact that Britain could turnout like this. It is, in my opinion, the most realistic portrayal of what the near future may be like. Immigration is already a political hot potato and illegal immigrant probably would be locked up in cages if everyone was trying to get into the UK. Anyway, I am clearly getting off topic.<br/><br/>The acting is first rate, notably Caine as an ageing hippy who grows his own weed! Owen does a good job as well but he always seems to play the emotionally torn role in almost everything he does.<br/><br/>It is very well directed, at times Blade Runner-esquire, and at times comparable to Saving Private Ryan, (in an excellent battle sequence).<br/><br/>All in all, I give this film 8 out of 10, could have been better, but not by much."
"Mighty_sheman","6","7","27","25 September 2006"," Surprisingly Flat Political Sci-Fi.
","After arriving on a wave of hype Children of Men had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately the result was a huge disappointment. Don't be fooled by the trailers like I was, don't expect high tension or a gripping sci-fi plot.<br/><br/>The premise of a near future where human kind is facing extinction due to women becoming infertile (surely science could find a solution?)should be enough to craft a gripping drama. However the result is strangely flat and unmoving and lacking in tension. There is plenty to marvel at technically, from 10 minute+ tracking shots and chaotic street battles however throughout this I never felt the tension or terror that a post apocalyptic movie really should be able to evoke. This is not helped by the fact that many of the moments of 'comic relief' come during the most tense scenes.<br/><br/>It seems young director Cuaron has perhaps taken on more than he can manage with this project. The screenplay seems to lack realism and focus, straying from the original gritty Sci-Fi setup to drama then to a thriller then to a pro immigration/unity message and never really hitting a nerve along the way. I had gone to see a Sci-Fi and ended up getting the director's (or author's) political views delivered in a confused vessel of a movie. Much of the story centred on a vision of a future Britain where immigrants are caged in the streets and then sent to Gantanamo style camps and the battle between the state and the immigrants and the freedom fighters instead of the idea of a world without children.<br/><br/>The performances are OK on the whole, only Michael Caine is really 'on form' and Clive Owen is his usual moody self and struggles to carry the movie at times but does a decent job on the whole in a very difficult role with little material to work with.<br/><br/>Overall Children of Men is a Sci-Fi drama that is low on the Sci-Fi and only just above average in the drama department. Most of the positives are in the marvellous technical achievements on show and a first quarter that delivered a horribly plausible future vision and a sombre atmosphere that unfortunately was not built upon. Falls short of expectations, if you are looking for a gripping vision of the future try the mini series 'The Last Train' which pulled off the terror and drama of a post apocalypse Britain with superior results."
"pyrofanatic","2","6","22","22 November 2006"," Not so easily fooled
","This film reminded me of my days in film school in London. There were a great majority of wealthy background students who were overambitious and inaccurate with their projects. Children of Men is like one of those projects. The idea for the film is excellent, but only truly obtainable on a big budget. Children of Men fails to convince on a number of counts. While the filming is polished, the sound is well mixed and there are C list actors, the budget just hasn't stretched far enough to pay for a realistic backdrop. Using Michael Caine instead of paying for realism wont sell the film to me. The main big fault is the fact that the cars are present day models, with added bits of plastic to make them look ""futuristic"". While this may fool the average American who hasn't seen these models of vehicles day to day, the average British person isn't so easily fooled. Imagine a Buick or a Chevrolet with a plastic elongated bonnet but the same standard features left elsewhere, and you get the picture. This brings the feel of the film right down to low budget level. Children of Men reminded me of that Australian (with fake U.S accents) TV programme - The Tribe. Watch it and see for yourselves."

","This film, basically, is alright. It's not great - but it's not awful either. As an actual film, it lags out a bit, at some points it sort of feels like it doesn't know where to go. As a concept though? It's amazing. What would happen if we were suddenly unable to have children? That's the positive of this film - it really makes you think about how the world would go into complete havoc if there were no more children to make the future. Clive Owen's character Theo doesn't seem like a hero, but he pulls it off - and seems genuine. One thing that I really did like about this film is that they didn't make it too modern. Normally if films are set in the future - even if they're only about 20 years in the future, everything will be stupidly modern. Everything will be clean and full of mind-blowing technology. This film however, keeps the British roots, and keeps it real. I think the biggest technological improvement was moving adverts on buses instead of still ones. It may sound odd - but it's nice to see that for once, a film that is set in the future isn't using fake technology to make it seem like it's set in 2027. This film is OK, it's not brilliant, and can be boring at times. But it will definitely make your mind boggle as to what would happen if there was no children for the future. 5 out of 10"

"MovieAddict2016","9","4","13","5 January 2007"," A rarity in cinema these days - an intellectually and emotionally stimulating action film (with a few flaws)
","""Children of Men"" would be easy to describe as a futuristic thriller about the last pregnant woman on earth and how a reluctant alcoholic with a troubled past makes it his mission to transport her to safety in a world gone mad. But that would make it sound fairly tired and routine.<br/><br/>It would be easier, perhaps, to call it a chase film, a war film, a buddy film, a variation on Wells, a political commentary, a satire, and even  to some degree  a comedy. The truth is, it's all of the above, and it manages to combine all these different aspects into a provocative whole.<br/><br/>The year is 2027. Women are infertile due to pollution, gamma rays, or something to that effect. No one really knows for sure. But the world is a wasteland of disease and pestilence  England appears to be the only country on earth still thriving, its citizens torn apart by political ideologists revolting against the increasingly fascist government by using terrorism tactics, while those in power isolate the people of the country and have them shipped away to enclosed camps where they live like animals (World War II, anyone?).<br/><br/>The rest you probably know from the marketing campaign already: the first pregnant woman in decades is discovered, Theo (Clive Owen)  an ex-political activist  decides to help transport her to safety, etc., while a group of ruthless mercenaries hunt them down to use the baby for their own political leverage.<br/><br/>Owen is an impressive leading man here. He brings to life one of cinema's most recurring characters: the cynical, reluctant anti-hero. But Owen brings Theo to life and gives him a personality  something not many actors do when approaching these types of characters. Theo's progression throughout the movie is believable and moving.<br/><br/>The film was helmed by Alfonso Cuarón, a director of great vision and ambition. Here he captures the grime and grunge of a truly desperate and depleted land  the sad thing is, it doesn't look so terribly far away. ""Blade Runner"" and ""1984"" were always distant and had a certain ""what-if?"" element  but ""Children of Men's"" futuristic landscape doesn't really look all that far away. Make no mistake, the film is very much a politically driven vehicle  Cuarón isn't exactly subtle in his use of references to current government. (A nametag with the word ""Bush"" can be seen accompanied by bloodstains and bullet holes alongside it.) We are told that the year 2003 was the beginning of the end, and what is perhaps most horrifying about ""Children of Men"" is that by today's standards it isn't such a fantastical adventure  it's eerily plausible.<br/><br/>But for all its power and competence, ""Children of Men"" is not a perfect movie. The screenplay, written by Cuarón and more than a handful of writers (based on a novel by P.D. James), is serviceable but contains some lapses in logic (which, if I were to divulge into, would no doubt spoil many of the film's surprises). The movie is not too long, but certain scenes could have been edited to better effect early on.<br/><br/>The ending, however, is such a visceral and hard-hitting experience that it almost makes you forget the few flaws of the film. Cuarón executes one of the most impressive single-take action sequences in all of cinema  rivaling the opening D-Day invasion segment in Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" in terms of realism (blood spatter stains the camera lens as the audience is put into the heart of an intense combat scene). In fact, ""Children of Men"" has the most realistic violence I've seen in any film from its genre  an important element of the movie that makes the proceedings all the more effective and gut-wrenching. Every gunshot, every death, and every dying scream resonates with an importance that few other ""violent"" movies are capable of carrying.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" is a breathtaking cinematic experience  exactly what a good film should be. It makes you think while delivering an ample dose of entertainment. It is not by any means a flawless film, but it is one that  as you leave the theater  will have you contemplating everything you just saw, evoking thought and discussion. And the ability to be moved physically, emotionally, and intellectually by a film? That's a true rarity these days."
"tributarystu","8","4","13","4 November 2006"," A Short Transcript of Vision
","I like Alfonso Cuaron. He's charismatic, works in Spanish, and his films are generally good. ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" was truly a bliss and Harry Potter 3 is, to my mind, the best HP movie out there. I actually like Cuaron so much, that when I heard his next movie was inspired by a book signed P.D. James, I went out to buy it. Although it wasn't easy to track down, I managed to do so. However...<br/><br/>The book was only decent and quite a disappointment, compared to what I had expected. Nonetheless, Cuaron still had time to turn it around when contributing with his ideas to the screenplay. Problem is, a screenplay written by five different people and filtered through five ""visionary structures"" is bound to be incoherent to some degree, on some level.<br/><br/>So, Cuaron's Children of Men has become a rather plain movie about a random, depressed individual being dragged into the story of a 21st century when women aren't able to conceive any more (actually, it's the men's contribution which is faulty), Britain is the last reasonably safe haven for society, half the people are just sad and miserable, while the other half tries to destroy whatever is left of the world. As our protagonist Theodore, played dully by Clive Owen, is kidnapped by his former wife Julian (Julianne Moore), currently the leader of a terrorist-like organisation, he is faced with the sinister fact that there actually is hope for the world, young Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) being the first pregnant woman in over eighteen years. After an unexpected twist, Theodore takes it upon himself to protect Kee from the interests of everyone around and to reach ""The Human Project"" with her.<br/><br/>The movie then goes on to portraying this extremely turbulent ""trip"", which ultimately costs a lot of lives. Now, here is my objection: while the book was far too ""tame"" for the given situation and extremely contemplative, the film itself is the perfect opposite. There is, actually, no ""hidden"" layer, no layer of ""thought"" beyond all the bullets and desperate cries for life. I mean, of course, nothing beyond the obvious tale of solitude and utter fear of terrorism. So despite the well spun together imagery of the film, it falls short at truly being an authentic work of art.<br/><br/>This kind of depresses me, mainly because the idea itself is quite brilliant and the implications such a scenario might have are enormous. There would be so much to explore as far as the human psyche is concerned, so many takes on ""shifting trends"" in society could be dealt with, a real creation of a visionary mind could emerge! Cuaron, however, chooses to go for a more contemporary problem, that of terrorism and such, amputating very much of what ""Children of Men"" could have been.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the film is bad; as a matter of fact, it's truly enjoyable and there are some scenes which might just stick on your retina. My problem is I cannot go beyond the frustration of what could have been. That's the general problem with imagination."

Totally out of place action-shooter war-scenes and the cheap Hollywood appeal on the senses which initially seemed to be left out, magically appears (alongside the terrorist cell) during the urban shoot-out and henceforth during the so called ending of this movie.

All i can say is that the Shawshank redemption is nr. 1 which is a good movie but never a top 10 flick or anything in that fashion (don't take that top 250 as actual fact).<br/><br/>Children of men has great cinematography, great acting, and a simple and effective story. I must admit at first time viewing i was a little disappointed at the end, but after watching it again it is just perfect for me.<br/><br/>As far as suspense, it's not a really thriller, but it is packed with tense moments. Don't compare this movie with movies like the usual suspects or even Blade Runner. wtf's wrong with y'all. <br/><br/>I love the realism of the camera work, the simple story and how the viewer has to make his own view, instead of being pampered with information on the world that is being portrayed.<br/><br/>If you like your Sci Fi bleak, realistic and truly engaging you can't go wrong with this flick.

","2006 was a year that had the type of coincidence that happens only in Hollywood. That of films all converging on the same theme. In this case, future dystopia's set in Britain. First up was the excellent V For Vendetta, and then later in the year, the even better Children of Men, one of the most daring, gutsy and conceptually dazzling films to grace our shores in quite some time.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by P.D. James, COM presents us with the Britain of 2027. A place where the people live under a police state, illegal immigrants are detained and executed, and most importantly, we live in a world without children.<br/><br/>The human race has become infertile. A baby hasn't been born in 18 years, and the youngest person on the planet (18) has died in a senseless killing. Theo Faron (the superb Clive Owen), a former activist turned bureaucrat has become resigned to the fact there's no future for the human race. But that all changes when his ex-wife Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore), still in with the radicals enlists his help.<br/><br/>Something wonderful has happened. Kee, an African illegal immigrant, is pregnant. She could give birth any day now. So its imperative Kee gets transit papers out of London as soon as possible, where she can have her baby at The Human Project, a safe haven for her and her child. But when Julian is killed en route, its on Theo's weary shoulders to get Kee to safety. That means fighting off ambitious radicals, sadistic police and fanatical fugitives at every turn to protect the mother of the future.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a completely mind-blowing experience. And I thought V For Vendetta was impressive. COM is an even greater film. Director Alfonso Cuaron has created a truly stunning work. One of the very best of 2006.<br/><br/>What impressed me is the way it doesn't lecture on anything. It transports us into this bleak depiction of the future without battering us over the head with long-winded exposition. Cuaron just lets the background do all the talking. <br/><br/>Cuaron's camera is almost always on the move. Details are packed around the edges of every frame. The opening scene in particular does a great job showing us the London of 2027. The sight of TV screens along the sides of Double Decker buses are bound to make you sit up and pay attention. Or advertisements proclaiming a crumbling society, but Britain continues to soldier on. They're presented in the most nonchalant and offhand of ways you're grateful to Cuaron for using such subtlety.<br/><br/>COM is a film with an often startling and dangerous edge. Cuaron shoots scenes with such intensity they really become quite unnerving. Even unbearable. The opening scene of an exploding café Clive Owen just walked out of packs quite a jolt. And some scenes are unbelievably scary. Like when radicals push a burning car into the path of Theo's. Its nail-biting stuff. Filled with frenzied camera angles. But most importantly, it feels naturalistic. And spontaneous. Its the feeling that anything could happen. Its all very frightening.<br/><br/>Cuaron milks the film for all the suspense he can squeeze out of it. Theo getting Kee to safety in a jump-started car while being pursued by radicals is pretty intense. But the crowning setpiece is the final 25 minutes. Theo and Kee are trapped in a refugee camp that erupts into a war zone. The radicals are trying to get in. The police are trying to keep them out. A situation made even worse when Kee goes into labour, so Theo has to deliver the baby, while at the same time keeping them alive long enough to do that.<br/><br/>Its an engrossing, brilliantly sustained sequence. Cuaron makes use of unbroken long takes that he utilises to dazzling effect. Theo and Kee run with her baby while bullets are flying everywhere and things are exploding all around them. Credit is due to Clive Owen for being willing to put himself in such mortal danger. Because when you see him, that's no stunt-double or stand-in. The camera never lets him out of its sight.<br/><br/>Cuaron has assembled an exceedingly fine cast. The excellent and very underrated Clive Owen turns in what may be his finest performance yet. A tired and weary man who glances at the world's misfortunes, but finds his fighting spirit rekindled by Julian and Kee. Newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey gives a performance that impresses by the way it rotates from bewilderment, horror and tough resolve at the things happening to her. You really feel hope for the future when you see her. That if she dies, the future will die with her. Pam Ferris offers fine support as Kee's midwife Miriam. Michael Caine is highly amusing as Jasper, a hippie editorial cartoonist who's the closest thing to a friend Theo has left in this sorry world.<br/><br/>The also underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor is great as Luke, one of Julian's activist friends. Its a beautifully nuanced performance. A surprising blend of self-serving ambition and thought for the future. Finally, Julianne Moore impresses in the brief but effective role of Julian. Although killed off disappointingly early into the film, she leaves a lasting impression on the rest of it. She had a son with Theo that died, giving him the incentive he needs to ensure that Kee's baby will live. She provides the dynamic that sets the film in motion.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a wonderful film. It contains many haunting images, none more so when troops, soldiers and innocents see Kee's baby, the first they've seen in 18 years, and fall to they're knees in astonishment. Brilliant! Also great for the way it uses what's happening in 2027 as an opportunity to comment upon the politics in contemporary society. Not just one of the greatest films of 2006, but one of the greatest films in a decade."

","spoiler alert<br/><br/>How wildly divergent are the opinions about this movie. Amazing. This is a movie I've seen twice now and intend to see again. It bowled me over. One of the times I saw it was with my college-age daughter and she didn't care for it. The reasons she didn't like it are parallel to many negative comments here, to wit:<br/><br/>""Why is this happening to humans?"" There is no ""why."" It's simply a literary premise, perhaps based on mankind's ill treatment of the earth. Note that it has not affected the animals.<br/><br/>""No closure at the end."" The curtain after the final scene shocked me a bit at first, too, but the more I thought about it, it was the perfect ending. The risks will not end. The idea of Kee and baby being hustled through the ship with a crowd of doting docs and nurses as the music rises and we see she has finally reached safety, a tear for Theo running down her cheek. How CORNBALL is that?????? Some people just hate ambiguity.<br/><br/>""It's not like the novel."" Fair enough. I have not read the novel, but from what I understand it veers sharply from the book. Stephen King once said he's never upset when movies of his books go off in another direction. He considers the movies separate entities. It's not like the movies replace the books.<br/><br/>""Were the Fishes supposed to be good or bad?"" Neither. Probably started out good, but the decision to off Julian and keep Kee and use her for political leverage in England turned them bad. <br/><br/>Despite the sci-fi trappings, this movie is really about a wrecked loser being handed a mission and getting a chance for redemption. But he's not Bruce Willis. He never picks up a gun. He's wearing flip flops. He picks a car that doesn't start. He never cracks wise. He wears a shabby raincoat throughout the movie. He's terrified and confused. His main good point, and what keeps pulling his chestnuts out of the fire, is that he's trustworthy. <br/><br/>And to conclude, my friends, the awesome unbroken shot during the ambush in the woods, shot entirely from the inside of the car, is worth the price of mission alone. Check the extras in the DVD to see how they did it."

Good low key acting - hey some people face the end of the world differently! Then BAM! The car chase scene. So unexpected. My eyes pretty much popped out of my head, my expectations of the movie shattered and I was so brutally, viscously dragged into the world of Children of Men.<br/><br/>I've never experienced that with a movie before. It's like I had been watching a human interest news item about a bad place and then suddenly that world was crashing though my door.

I didn't understand what was going on, but I was there with Theo. The people that love this film were there with Theo!

A young refugee-girl is pregnant, and Julian Taylor's (Julianne Moore) leading activist group is willing to help the lonely girl to get to a mysterious ""Human-project"".

In the end everybody will bow in front of the miracle of life.<br/><br/>The racism and discrimination of the refugees reminds of the horrible fate of the Jews in the second World War. Every unwanted person gets dumped into a big wasteland-like quarter and if the hunger and diseases will not kill them the civil war and restlessness will.

We cannot stop the wonder of life happening by destroying everything. The title can also be seen in a religious way. Just an amazing script. P.D. James's original novel adaptation is brilliant. <br/><br/>The music in the film is very beautiful. Ending song Jarvis Cocker's song ""Running the World"" is an appreciation to women who are the carriers of life.<br/><br/>This movie gives us something to think about. Everyone in this world should watch this because no-one wants this kind of future where we are heading from."

","If you thought that ""V for Vendetta"" offered a bleak look at the future, just wait until you see ""Children of Men"". It portrays England in 2027. A pandemic many years earlier has caused infertility ever since. England has become a totalitarian state seeking to eliminate all illegal immigrants, and whenever politicians are in trouble, there occurs what the government claims is a terrorist attack (but the government probably was behind them*). That's when loner Theo Faron (Clive Owen) gets kidnapped by anti-government group The Fishes, who just might have the key to the future.<br/><br/>One of the movie's best aspects is the cinematography. There's a lot of hand-held long shots, creating a feeling of being there with the grim action. The dreary setting adds to this. As in ""VFV"", it becomes apparent that the revolutionaries might not be much different from the government which they oppose. But what's one to do in such a society? Especially one with the kind of immigration laws that would please only Tom Tancredo.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is one movie that I definitely recommend. It seems that the world is headed in this direction. It's something that everyone should understand. Also starring Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br/><br/>*See also the Reichstag in Nazi Germany and the Kirov assassination in Stalin's USSR."
"Buddy-51","7","3","9","27 January 2007"," falls short of greatness due to its formulaic nature
","One of these days, some innovative filmmaker is going to make a movie set in a future where the skies are crystalline blue, governments treat their citizens with decency and respect, and people live in relative harmony with both technology and one another. But until that time we have ""Children of Men,"" yet another dystopian vision of what life might be like in the not-too-distant future - and, as usual, it ain't a pretty picture.<br/><br/>Based on a novel by P.D. James, ""Children of Men"" takes place in the year 2027, a time in which the world has been thrown into chaos by war and disease, and the entire human race has been infertile for 18 years. Only Merry Olde England has, for some reason, been able to escape the generalized destruction (though not the infertility). In a bid to protect the nation from hostile outside elements, the government has begun to round up all its illegal aliens, locking them into cages and deporting them off the island (when it isn't slaughtering them outright).<br/><br/>The overrated Clive Owens plays a Ministry of Energy bureaucrat who, much against his will, finds himself caught up in a plot to transport a young pregnant woman - the world's first since 2009 - to a place of safety so she can hopefully help to restart the otherwise doomed human race (although one wonders how a single child in the world will effectuate that outcome).<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" has much to recommend it. It has a strong sense of time and place, with a look that is just right for its subject matter. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has drained most of the color out of the picture, and director Alfonso Cuaron has filmed the scenes with a great deal of immediacy and excitement. Cuaron certainly knows how to gin up the suspense and to make us feel like participants in the action.<br/><br/>But the film is less successful at exploring the profound implications of its theme. James has come up with an unusually intriguing premise - just what would life be like if we knew our species was going to be extinct in less than a hundred years - but the film doesn't do anything all that interesting with it. Instead, the movie turns into a surprisingly conventional ""chase"" movie, with characters running for their lives from hostile parties amid a ceaseless hail of explosions and bullets. Just why is it that dystopian dramas - from ""Fahrenheit 451"" to ""Logan's Run"" to ""The Island"" to ""Minority Report"" to ""The Imposter"" to ""Paycheck,"" to name just a handful - all feel the need to adhere to this tired narrative formula? Every so often, the film zeroes in on its theme, yielding, by far and away, its most effective moments: people sobbing uncontrollably as they watch a news story relating the sudden death of the world's youngest person; an art collector amassing many of the world's greatest sculptures and paintings even though he knows that in less that a hundred years there will be nobody left to appreciate them; a former midwife, sitting in an abandoned schoolroom, recounting with soul-wrenching sadness the day she realized children would no longer be gracing the world with their presence; combatants momentarily stopping their gunfire to stare awestricken at a newborn babe. We yearn for more of these psychologically astute and insightful moments, but, alas, this is not to be, as Cuaron and his team of writers pour on the action scenes pretty much at the expense of everything else.<br/><br/>Owens, Michael Caine (in the annoyingly stereotypical role of an aging eccentric hippie) and Julianne Moore are the ""name"" players in the cast, but the most powerful performances come from Claire-Hope Ashitey as the pregnant woman and Pam Ferris as the person assigned to be her midwife.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" is a good film that could have been a great one were it not redolent of so many likeminded movies that have come before it."

","'Children of Men' is one of those rare films which seem to pop up ever so infrequently these days, putting your faith back in cinema. With it's fresh approach to cinematographic and superb locations, you get a real sense of how scary and feasible the plot could be. It's good to see a film of this calibre shot on British soil and makes you question why we don't get to see more UK based films, as apposed to the same Hollywood drivel we get time and again! 'Children of Men' has that grittiness about it in a similar way to Danny Boyle's 2002 Sci-fi '28 Days Later', in that you feel very much a part of the story and are taken on a journey with the characters not knowing what could be round the next corner. Clive Owen who plays Theo portrays a guy who is obviously fed up with how the world has become a hell on earth, and we get to see how he battles his own demons with the hope he has found in Kee one of the main characters, both played very convincingly, as with all the cast. One of the best Sci-fi movies of the year for me, action from beginning to end, the time just flew by...a must watch!"
"jackgdemoss","8","2","5","25 November 2018"," Interesting action shots and memorable characters
","Children of Men finds greatness in two distinct ways; characterization and cinematography. The latter of the two I am historically a sucker for. My being drawn to the excellent character building in this film was a surprise to me, however, because it did not accompany an interesting and developing plot. I view character building as secondary to plot building. I cannot think of a film off the top of my head that I applaud without an interesting story. Children of Men is truly lacking in narrative, but it gains back a fair bit of ground by making the audience feel like they are with the characters. I believe this feeling is partly because the characters are so well crafted and acted, and partly because the wildly drawn out action shots make us feel like we are following the group. One action shot is held for 5+ minutes without any camera break. This style of cinematography really works in war movies or gunfights, and I hope to see more of it in the future."

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","2","5","8 November 2008"," Incredibly well-made and important futuristic action drama
","London, 2027. The world society has collapsed into widespread chaos, and as the news reports in England loudly proclaim, ""Only Britain soldiers on!"" Needless to say, the British have sealed their borders and have begun forcefully exporting illegal immigrants and, for nearly two decades, no one on earth has been able to conceive a child. There is global grief expressed when a teenager, the youngest boy in the world, is killed in a fight in South America. <br/><br/>On a purely aesthetic level, I love that futuristic London looks almost the same as it looks now, which will certainly be the case when 2027 finally does roll around, with the exception that in the movie it is a frightening police state. There are no flying cars or bizarre outfits, just normal people going about their lives in a decaying society. The most futuristic things in the movie are the video billboard (which are here now, by the way) and the crazy looking iMacs that people are using. <br/><br/>The movie is basically about the approaching end of mankind, the gradual disintegration of modern humanity as we know it. There are a lot of clever political jabs inserted into the plot, such as some ham-handed ones like a bunch of anti-Bush stickers on the wall of a key character's apartment, but also more clever ones, like the revelation that suicide kits are made available to the public but marijuana remains illegal. <br/><br/>There is global fear about the inability for anyone to conceive a child, and it provides a much more immediate threat of the end of mankind than the gradual decay of civilization. If no one can procreate, the human race is sure to die out. This is an even faster and more effective method of killing off the entire human population than the deadliest plague or virus, both of which always leave survivors. The strength of the human race is founded on our diversity, but if we can't reproduce we are certainly lost.<br/><br/>When an African woman turns up pregnant, the government wants her and there is a frantic race to gain custody of her, complicated by massive political turmoil. Clive Owen and Julianne Moore play Theo and Julian, respectively, ex-spouses who team up to protect the miraculously pregnant woman and deliver her to a location that is safe enough so that she can give birth and restore hope in the future of mankind.<br/><br/>The movie makes an interesting and frightening assertion that mankind will not end with a bang from an asteroid or nuclear war or an act of God, but will gradually fizzle out and destroy itself, that we will bring it about ourselves, powerless to stop it even as it is happening around us. It's a scary thought, but one that we should really allow to affect the way we lead our lives and our international relationships"

It was extremely boring, the story was very confusing, I was just sitting and waiting for something to happen and some kind of explanation of what the story was actually about.

"MrRazorz","5","2","5","10 April 2007"," Thinks highly of itself, but really doesn't deliver
","I expected to like this movie. I WANTED to like it. Bleak, apocalyptic visions of the future are right up my alley, and the premise of a world plagued with infertility is an interesting idea with bags of storytelling potential. But somehow, I ended up being feeling extremely let down by this one.<br/><br/>I enjoyed parts of it. The style is good, if a bit ambitious  I was especially impressed with the long, seamless cuts that the film considers its trademark (although at least some of them were clearly the product of clever editing). The cast were also excellent  this was one of those movies where I went in with only a vague idea of who was actually in it, so it was pleasant surprise to see Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor turn up. The early scenes are a pretty convincing portrayal of a stagnating society beginning to come apart at the seams, and parts of it are just plain scary. I rather enjoyed the subtext of the lefty freedom fighters being just as bad, if not worse, than the oppressive government they're fighting against. There are some also some impressive special effects, made all the more impressive by the fact that they don't LOOK like special effects. (The childbirth scene is a good example  for a second there I almost thought the actress had pushed out a real baby for the camera.)<br/><br/>As it went on, though, I started to see flaws. Much has been made of the ""gritty realism"" of the film, but to me it seemed to be trying too hard to be gritty and realistic  even when the events portrayed are just on the other side of ""far-fetched""  and it all came out looking manufactured. The story seems a bit confused about which high-minded social message it's trying to impart (Civilization is fragile? Refugees often get a raw deal? Children are the future? Babies are cute?) and yet it often gets caught up in its own self-importance, never missing an opportunity for a drawn-out moment of exaggerated human drama set to warbling opera music. Not only does this get mildly annoying, it also clashes with the ""documentary"" style used for much of the film, making it looked even more contrived. Things wrap up a bit too tidily with a clichéd ""bittersweet"" ending  though if the credits had come up a minute earlier, it would have made a far more effective conclusion.<br/><br/>All in all, what promised to be an excellent movie quickly turned into an overblown, pretentious muddle of a film that delivers very little of anything and thinks far too much of itself."
"prwhittle","Null","2","5","10 April 2007"," Children of men, the movie
","When did movies stop looking at the future with wonderment? 2001: A Space Odyssey was perhaps the last time the infinite possibilities of years to come were depicted as inspiring and expansive. In the last four decades, dystopia has reigned supreme on the big screen, and the time focus has got shorter and shorter. Now we look forward, myopically, only a few decades at a time, and what we see is so appalling it's no wonder we desert the wider world and take refuse behind our iPods and computer screens.<br/><br/>Director Alfonso Cuaron's just-released Children of Men (Cert 15), which is loosely based on PD James's novel, is the latest attempt to draw conclusions about the future from the mountainous problems of the present. And like so many other examples in this genre, the assumption underlying the whole story is that, in the interim, we have proved utterly powerless in the face of the chaos brought by complete social breakdown.<br/><br/>Cuaron's film is of interest mostly because of the picture it paints of everyday life in Britain in 2027. The weak story comes a poor second. Women have been made infertile (possibly by a massive flu epidemic), no children have been born for 18 years, an authoritarian government is in charge and Britain is besieged by illegal immigrants who are kept in cages at ports and rail stations. Clive Owen plays a burnt-out, passive bureaucrat (reminiscent of Orwell's Winston Smith) who is persuaded by a terrorist gang to help the escape of a young woman (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who somehow, miraculously, is pregnant. Hunted down by competing forces, Owen's character finds himself acting heroically in the midst of gun battles despite a seeming lack of either conviction or compelling motive. It is, in effect, simply a chase movie.<br/><br/>But the background scenario is plausible in many ways, and in its details and atmosphere is thoroughly convincingly depicted. London still has its red double-deckers, but they are covered in moving video ads, albeit far grubbier and washed-out than those in Bladerunner. Random bomb explosions rock the streets. People look roughly the same, only their expressions are even more defeated and passive than can be seen now on your average commuter journey. Disposable euthanasia kits ('Quietus - You decide When') are sold over the counter. Groups of feral kids attack trains with rocks, and passengers barely turn a hair. Everywhere, people are encouraged by disembodied voices to report illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>However what makes all this imaginative production design finally hollow is the utter vagueness of the film's political dimensions. We're left in the dark about the political make-up of the predictably 'fascist' government; the terrorist group, maybe environmentalist, maybe anarchic, maybe simply 'humanist', seems to have little agenda. The immigration problem which features so largely is emotionlessly portrayed - we're not quite sure whether we're meant to view the obviously inhuman treatment of these arbitrarily imprisoned (and apparently mostly Eastern European) refugees as the cause of the turmoil, or the result of it. All this makes it hard to become more than merely superficially involved.<br/><br/>And yet at the same time, it is this very vaguenes which makes the film interesting when viewed from our beleaguered present. We've become used to seeing a largely left-leaning vision of the future where the corporations are the root of all evil (as in Rollerball), or where a specifically right-wing Tory government crushes all dissent (the absurd V for Vendetta), or more weirdly still, where past liberal battles are played out paranoically as though they're still being fought (the ghastly and pointless remake of The Stepford Wives, or The Handmaid's Tale). But the ambiguity of Children of Men reflects not just the loosening of labels, and perhaps the death of genuine political debate, which characterises our own times, but the free-floating anxiety which consumes those who would still identify themselves as being of the Left and Right. Both points of view could find support for their arguments in the film's portrayal of a multi-cultural London in the midst seemingly of a slow-motion civil war, and certainly the central conceit of an infertile population could be seen as a metaphor for Europe's catastrophically plunging birth-rate. What, finally. touches a highly-exposed nerve is not just the sense that, despite the ceaseless efforts of the capital's boosters, London is recognisably already on the way to this nightmare vision, but that social and moral fragmentation has led to an overwhelmingly nothingness at the very centre of things."

No matter what happens to us in the future, all of the last remaining vestiges of current society-greed, paranoia, racism, etc.-will never cease to die. I felt that was the boldest step in the film. Those that had the money were hanging onto their pathetic dreams of wealth and status while the world slowly decayed from the inside out.<br/><br/>I felt all of the performances in the film were quite amazing, and the lack of flash and panache from the cinematography aided in keeping you focused on the story and not the way it looked. Once again, Alfonso Cuaron has helped establish the power shift in creativity is coming from Mexico. Cuaron, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Babel) and Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) have provided the best cluster of Mexican-made films since Mexicos Golden Age of Cinema in the 1940s and 50s.

","Start saying your prayers, friends, because the end of the world is here. In less than a hundred years, humanity will see its demise. Thanks to an unknown affliction humans are no longer able to reproduce, and all we can do is wait for the end. This is the bleak and dismal view of the future as presented by Children of Men. The film is loosely based on the science-fiction novel by P.D. James, and it paints the post-apocalyptic landscape of the world in the darkest shades of despair and helplessness.<br/><br/>Children of Men is the journey of Theo Faron (Clive Owen) as he takes the miraculously pregnant Kee to the safe haven provided by The Human Project. More plot details are unnecessary because the film isn't so much about the story. The film doesn't really have a deep message or agenda. Apart from the few scenes with the refugees and their Auschwitz-like camps, most of the film does not contain fodder for lengthy debates. So what remains are just the narrative and the visuals, and the film excels in both the departments.<br/><br/>The narration in the film is above par as events unfold with masterful fluidity. The story progress with a rare forcefulness. Characters, both big and small, are ended with almost no consideration for their weight because that is what the story demands. This is done without a hint of pretension or self-consciousness that one might see in lesser works. Taking the motif of realism forward are the dialogues. The conversations are so natural that they give considerably more significance to even simple lines. The film just has oodles of unHollywoodness all over it. The characters aren't testosterone-pumping hulks or know-it-all world-beaters. They are simple people caught in circumstances they don't know how to deal with, but know the significance of their actions. Even as a visual medium this film does almost just as well as its story-telling. The washed-out colours complement the hopelessness of the world it shows. The gut-wrenching refugee camp scenes show an unflattering side of humanity, a side that might not be so far behind us.<br/><br/>The perfectly-captured dystopian world, the unflinching narrative, and the strikingly real characters make for a very special film. Highly recommended."

It is a run-and-hide actioneer pumped full of adrenaline, and paralleled with an interested vision of the future. As the protagonists dart along the decaying routes of Britain in desperate hopes to save humanity, I was sort of surprised at how compelled I was at one point, from the amazing setting of crumbling buildings that look like war-torn Balkan countries to the political revolutionaries and snipers on the rooftops, the dark atmosphere is superbly breathed life into.<br/><br/>As for acting, as a notorious Clive Owen-hater, he is nevertheless perfectly cast in the role of a lifeless, jaded corporate drone who has greatness clumsily thrust upon him. Seriously, I've recited grocery lists with more panache. Blink and you'll miss both Julianne Moore and Michael Caine, for neither inhabit leading roles in ""Children of Men"". To compensate for it, Claire-Hope Ashitey proves a likable character throughout, even offering some humour along the way, and the dire circumstances automatically elicit sympathy for out protagonist centre. <br/><br/>Although ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a strong contender in the same category, the cinematography win should be a lock at the Academy Awards, and rightly so. Director Alfonso Cuarón coats his standard gliding tracking shots over the craggy British landscape and fallen citiea, and here it is bleakly perfect. On the other end of the spectrum, he aptly uses atmospheric shaky-cams to capture the frantic chases and escapes Theo and the girl experience on their way out of the country. Thankfully, it is not a-monkey-could-have-shot-this shaky, but appropriately moody.<br/><br/>The crux, and there nearly always in one, is the unspeakably lazy writing of the template script, undoubtedly by Cuarón himself. If you intend to make a film largely about science, you should probably at least nod to science. In the film, no explanation is ever offered as to why people can no longer procreate, and it becomes clear that the writers have NO IDEA what they are talking about. Luckily, ""Children of Men"" is cleverly crafted in such a way that it never needs to explain what caused the infertility or the technicalities of what is wrong (""We don't know what caused it""), but as a result it is neither very interesting nor very credible. No matter how you get around it, you need a firmer scientific footing to appeal a wider audience.<br/><br/>The film does, however, bring up important existential questions in bioethics. The implications of humanity no longer being able to procreate its species are wide-ranging and severe. In a way as humans it would not directly affect us since *we* would lead our ordinary lives to the fullest (albeit without having children). But undeniably, whatever distant genesmanship to our offspring and future generations, it would eventually provoke a kind of altruism that would lead us to act, much like Theo in protecting the pregnant girl, even if the child was not his, because in the end it would benefit the survival of our species  which is all that matters to the selfish nature of genes.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" has an admirably grainy and bleak tone, even though it is momentarily lifted by humour. It is a pity that its fans are doing most of the insightful thinking in the message boards, scratching their heads trying to come up with feasible scientific explanations for the infertility in the film (""carrying capacity of the population"", ""over-dependence on anti-depressants"", ""flunk of evolution"" and ""plague"" to name a few) something that the writers should already have sketched out in the writing stage.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"

","Wow. That so many would tout so highly so silly a film is nothing less than truly amazing... Anyone who's ever read science fiction (not to mention The Black Book from which the basic premise of this one seems to have been lifted) has to have come away from this one scratching their noggin in confusion. What's the big deal here? This is compelling science fiction the way Joyce Carol Oates's ""dissertations"" on boxing are insightful- which is to say, not at all. Forget the hackneyed storyline and the barely watchable performances: with the sole exception of the cinematography, there's nothing to recommend this one. Be warned."

","I especially enjoyed Michael Caine's and Julianne Moore's performances.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the overall political and philosophical aspect of the movie. Seeing the words ""Homeland Security"" over an internment camp for immigrants was especially chilling.<br/><br/>The script itself couldn't decide if it was an action movie or a film with higher aspirations. It has often been compared to ""Bladerunner."" As a matter of fact, that's what got me in to see the movie.<br/><br/>This film is nowhere near the movie ""Bladerunner"" is. The main problem appeared to be the script. It couldn't decide where to focus and how to progress.<br/><br/>The first thing that struck me was the ""Deus ex Machina"" evident in several of the action scenes where events appeared to conveniently rescue the characters from certain doom.<br/><br/>The second thing that struck me was that Clive Owen's character didn't progress through the movie. You didn't get a feel for him at the beginning, and you didn't quite understand why he was doing all the things he was doing from his perspective. There is some back-story given, but it is weak.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Clive Owen and Julianne Moore was very good. I could have watched a whole movie with just those two.<br/><br/>The development of the other characters is also weak for the most part. There are the ""evil guys,"" the coworkers, the ""evil guys you thought were your friends"", etc.<br/><br/>Besides the Michael Caine character, the only other one I really got a feel for was Marichka; a damn fine performance.<br/><br/>Overall, a ""meh"" and not what I was expecting."
"parks5796","6","2","5","4 February 2007"," pocket full of clichés
","I watched this movie due to the great rating it got on IMDb, but alas, I was sadly let down....In a world of predictable circumstances( except for the infertility thing, that was actually creative) where illegal immigrants are a big problem, and where a suicide product is being sold to the public; Theo, the main character, gets thrown into the fisher gang to help a girl get out of the country. At parts, I thought that it was a great movie, but it seemed to me that it only picked up, not really in action wise, towards the end of the movie. The characters were shallow, and most of the dialogue was contrived to a point that seemed inorganic. During the movie, it looked like the story would start and stop, lagging in the forgettable parts and picking up in parts that finally portrayed a humanistic appeal. Also, the background music was mainly opera music, that, to me, gave every scene with that music in it, a cheesy feel to it. As I watched the movie I thought Harrison's Flowers was a better movie than this. All in all, I have to admit it had good parts, but the story often amounted to a five point rating."

","I've read a lot of the reviews on this movie and know there are more detailed explanations of all the parts of the movie out there (the actor's performances, the music, the screenplay, the plot, etc). What has stuck with me though, and the reason I'm writing at all, is because of how amazing this movie was able to capture certain intense moments. This movie is unbelievable, unparalleled in a lot of ways in it's ability to impact its viewers.<br/><br/>Michael Cane is first off incredible as the old hippie Jasper, an absolute delight to watch perform. Clive, Julianne, and the rest are merely along for the ride of the unfolding of the plot, which just so happens to take us along for the ride too.<br/><br/>I was not so excited about seeing this movie to tell you the truth and during the first few scenes in the beginning I was thinking about leaving. It wasn't that the movie was bad at all really, I just have a rich taste for human dynamics and wasn't confident this movie would deliver. I was very wrong. Any intense scene, which involved the actual display of that world (future England), was so well shot it was experienced not just witnessed. I felt like that was actually happening and I was in the horror and realness of that world. I did not feel like I was watching a movie, it seemed like reality caught on film. Quite a feat for an entirely fictional piece of art. Director Alfonso Cuarón is a genius, or at least got very lucky when throwing this thing together, all the action scenes are like the landing on Normandy Beach in Saving Private Ryan. In fact this movie seems just as real as that film. Now that's saying something, didn't Saving Private Ryan win best picture? This movie had to be created from someone's imagination, private Ryan was based on something that actually happened, I am so blown away at how good the action of this film is captured. The only reason I didn't give it perfect marks is because the story isn't as incredible, although it's very good and fairly original. Go see this movie on the big screen, when I saw it everybody in the theater was weeping during the last war scene (including me) I believe it was because of the dynamic that was captured involving the baby, (I won't spoil it for you). Up there with the most powerful scene I've ever enjoyed during a movie, and I watch a lot of movies. Go see it even just to get that scene. Incredible.<br/><br/>I can highly recommend Children of Men to anyone who isn't afraid to feel our collective humanness. Children of Men will make clear to you, in the best kind of way. We're all one baby, we're in this together."

","Our last Hope, but who cares? This film has had rave reviews. Athinking man's action movie, It appears that the majority of reviewers have nothing but praise for it. Despite a very good cast and director this movie failed to move me, which was the least I was expecting from it. The baby is mankind's last hope, but I felt no emotional interest in its fate or the fate of any of the characters in the movie. Yes technically the acting and directing were excellent, especially the scenes of urban warfare, but its failure to draw the viewer in emotionally was a major flaw. Perhaps I have become too cynical to watch this type of movie and others will care about the characters. But for me its inability to do this ultimately ruined what could have been a great movie."
"The_Defiant1","3","2","5","26 January 2007"," Ugggh!
","Perhaps the saddest thing about this movie is the wasted talent in the cast. All are very capable actors brought down by the completely uninspiring plot.<br/><br/>The viewer is immediately thrust into a bleak future where people are miserable and the world is sterile. The cast makes the most of this slow paced and unexciting movie, but they fail to ever make it interesting or compelling. Michael Caine delivers such stellar lines as ""pull my finger"" repeatedly and Clive Owens spend the majority of the movie in solemn despair. Julianne Moore is initially set as a leader and focus, but she's pushed aside in the story fairly early.<br/><br/>The basic plot is nothing more than a group of people's attempts to exploit the discovery of one pregnant woman named ""Kee"" and use it for political leverage. The plot is essentially everyone's adventures as they get her from one point to another.<br/><br/>With the exception of Clive Owen, this movie pretty much gets handed over to the supporting cast who reappear at illogical and random times. There is no mechanism which brings them back into the movie other than the plot's desperate need for new dialog and something to move the story forward.<br/><br/>The future is so bleak and illogical, that their goal of getting Kee to the destination seems completely irrelevant and inconsequential. The movie boils down to a weak political commentary about life and the direction we are leading. The concept that the movie takes place in the future doesn't even come through very well. The settings and appearance of the locations look more like the 1970's than they do the future.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is just slow paced and boring. The characters aren't exciting so there is very little reason to get excited about the movie.<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD. This movie is a strong, bold 3 on a scale of 1-10.<br/><br/>Defiant1"
"spduhaime","9","2","5","23 January 2007"," Symbols/Significance
","I thought it was one of the best films I have seen in a while. I just wanted to open up a small discussion on the symbolism of names in the film. The most obvious example of this would be Theo the main character. Also I was interested in the strange mystic who helps them in the refugee town called Marichka. Last semester I read the Ramayana by Valmiki for the first time, and the main villain's (Ravana) brother was called Maricha. He disguises himself as a golden dear to precipitate the capture of Rama's wife Sita. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas about these and other loaded names in the movie. Also, language aside, symbolism in general throughout the film. Like how Theo is reduced to wearing flip flops at one point, exposing his feet to injury and infection. I thought for sure that the flip flops would go and he would spend the rest of the movie barefoot. I suppose that was too blatant for the director, and he eventually finds sneakers I believe. Anyway, very well put together. Only point of contention might be better score/soundtrack. It just didn't really serve to create emotion or a spartan wasteland (either one I would have accepted). Anyway, good flick."

","""Children of Men"" is a deep movie, which is at the same time futuristic and realistic. It presents a savage picture of human world, 18 years after the last time a woman has born a baby. It is really heavy and somehow different stuff. A point of view that nobody has presented so well in a movie.<br/><br/>Director Alfonso Cuarón did great job creating a society who still looks familiar but also somehow changed and alienated. His vision is marvelous and the atmosphere he creates is absolutely influential.<br/><br/>The actors did their best  especially Michael Caine. Everyone created a character that won't leave you indifferent to his emotions.<br/><br/>Despite the almost flawless presentation in the mentioned categories, one technical aspect would leave you entirely speechless. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is fully TREMENDOUS and INCREDIBLE. There are sometimes up to ten minutes, which also include marvelous action sequences, shot with a single camera without any interruption. I don't know if you imagine how difficult and time-consuming it is. If I could, I would give Emmanuel Lubezki an Oscar for his well-done job.<br/><br/>Finally, I would that this movie is not for everyone, for it is hard, dark and as I said  different.

","This film borrows heavily from the dark, brooding apocalyptic sci-fi downers of the late 60's and early 70's like ""Soylent Green"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" with a touch of ""Blackhawk Down"" gritty realism thrown in for good measure. The basic plot consists of a journey with a protagonist who gives us very little reason to like, relate or sympathize with him.<br/><br/>He is a former radical who is reintroduced to a former flame (Julianne Moore) whom he met during his protest days. The manner in which he becomes involved with these terrorists is contrived and forced.<br/><br/>This future-world is littered with revolutionary and terrorist factions who have a desire for an ""uprising"" against a ""big brother"" police state. The missing fact and the only interesting storyline in the film is that mankind is barren, impotent and incapable of reproduction of the species. A single, teenage pregnant girl is discovered.<br/><br/>The protagonist becomes her protector and guides us through this future world on her journey to ""The Human Project"" and collection of enlightened souls who desire to save the human race. Exactly WHY they wish to save the human race is unclear. After all if humans are so noble and worthy of life why would their inevitable fate be a world divided into a despotic militarized regime and terrorist factions?

It touched me deep inside and made me feel good because it showed me the last bit of hope that we as humans still have some decency left within us. I say, 10/10 for this movie.

The movie was dark, and depressing, some even said it was filled with propaganda, but the whole movie had hope in it. Since the beginning of this century, a lot of the movies that came out were good, but they had no hope at the end. What I mean is, the characters weren't redeemed from their actions, or that what they did justified their cause/reason. The endings tend to be nasty and vile, with no reason, except for the fact that the makers can get away with. Which is why I loved this movie, it is full of hope, a chance for survival and human decency. And the ending is the best ending that happened. It didn't answer everything, and a few pieces were missing for interpretation (in movies and books, less is more).<br/><br/>Overall, CHILDREN OF MEN IS THE BEST MOVIE OF 2006"

","I found the movie disturbing, not necessarily for the violence or the bleak scenery, but rather for the dismal view it gave of the capabilities of mankind. <br/><br/>Set twenty years in the future, _Childen of Men_ gives a view of a sterile Earth, a world where no children have been born in over 18 years. Supposedly, scientists have no idea why this has happened and are powerless to stop it.<br/><br/>The two biggest problems I have with this premise are: 1) There are three billion examples of each human gender on Earth. The scriptwriters would like us to believe that every single one of the females has suffered exactly the same fate from, one would suppose, exactly the same reason. This would have to assume that every female on earth is equally susceptible to one particular pathogen, a supposition which, scientifically, is so unlikely as to be almost impossible.<br/><br/>2) Science is an ever changing and ever improving series of disciplines. We are in an age where we wield an almost unimaginable power over our own existence. Yet, the movie would want us to believe that scientists have essentially given up on trying to solve what is arguably the worst possible catastrophe that mankind could possibly endure. With IVF births being practically commonplace these days, we are supposed to believe that in two years, scientists will suddenly become impotent (no pun intended) to solve a fertility problem? To me, that's an almost absurd supposition.<br/><br/>Admittedly, these are seemingly picky reasons for objecting to this movie. Still, these and other implausibilities made it impossible for me to suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy this movie. I can toss aside belief when the premise of the movie is sheer fun (as in _Men in Black_), but in a movie which is trying to send a message, these kinds of inconsistencies serve to make the message laughable, not laudable."

","In settings, cinematography, sound, lighting, casting, and above all, directorship this is mature film-making. The triumph is two-fold; firstly, it is remarkably low-key and refuses to shout its stunning credentials; it does not hit you over the head, but rather invites you to be the camera's eye, and secondly, none of the huge amount of detailing detracts from an unbelievably assured storyline; and the detailing shows in every shot. And it is the visual surprises that linger; just trying to take in the detailing in every shot is a delight; the faces and crowd-work, the graffiti, the modelling and styling of cars, architecture etc; the interiors are extraordinary in every setting, and the future touches are subdued and understated. <br/><br/>In the action sequences I have never seen or heard better bullet squibs: a totally different experience from the normal pumped-up ubereffects. Only wardrobe and hairstyling jerk us back too fast to where we are coming from. What is evident is a huge amount of love, care, and creativity has gone into the production design - and the production teams should get great work from this.<br/><br/>Cuarón captures a zeitgeist about fears of the political now and pushes it into a future that echoes our subconscious. I would hesitate to get preachy here and call it political satire directly, but you need look no further than Orwell and Bradbury for a suitable frame of reference. Though the pacing, story-telling, and look and feel certainly do not weigh down the film in any way: it is hugely enjoyable.<br/><br/>Is it a great film? What makes film great? Not that they made you laugh, or cry, or think; or even captured the zeitgeist. Rather, they linger. They invade the senses, and touch that part of us that we forget exists now and then...<br/><br/>We came away inspired and talking about how the film is a in a very real and powerful sense a call to ourselves: what world do we want? Are we so afraid of each other in other countries and cultures? What world do we want for our children to inherit? <br/><br/>We loved it: exciting, moving, and original.<br/><br/>One of the best films of the decade so far. Go see."

However, this movie moved me and struck me in such a way that I had to go ahead and give it a perfect 10.<br/><br/>First the acting: While some may argue that Clive Owen's acting may be a bit dry at times, he actually fits the part perfectly. Considering the setting for this movie, one cannot expect right off the bat extremely moving and deep acting. It's set during a time of pure despair and loss of hope. And by midway through the movie, you see him transform and see a side that you normally do not see from Clive Owen in his movies (particularly because of this type of movie and the producing of it). Julianne Moore still has that wonderful persona about her of being professional enough to fit her character and come across as a bit of a hard-ass yet still perfectly capable of pure emotions. Michael Cane's character(while his fate is unfortunate) cracked me up and was perfect.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot, story, directing, cinematography, etc: The story, while it has been speculated, and I believe been produced in possibly a few other movies, is so raw and radical yet can be seen as so realistic! The directing and cinematography could not have been done any better for this movie. The scenes were superbly set up in terms of what needed to be ""seen"" during them. The key scenes that struck me in particular were the following from off the top of my head(Spoilers):<br/><br/>1)In the beginning scene after Clive Owen comes out of the coffee shop and a bomb is detonated in that same shop after he walks about 30 feet from it (this is when i had a feeling i would in no way be disappointed by this movie).<br/><br/>2)The entire time from when Julianne Moore and Clive Owen's characters are riding the car playing the game with the ping pong ball to when she is killed. CRUCIAL to the film in terms of raw emotion and completely sudden occurrences.<br/><br/>3-?) There are so many more to be listed but I'd prefer not to spoil any more of the movie and let you watch it.<br/><br/>The cinematography was excellent especially in showing the complete and utter devastation and chaos that has come over the world in just the twenty years.<br/><br/>In a way I felt as if I were watching a George Orwell or Aldous Huxley novel being put to film. It was SUPERB. I will leave the rest of you to go see it for yourself!"
"Lebowski85","8","2","5","17 January 2007"," A Cutting Edge, Action Packed, Thinking Mans Action Film!
","The film is set in 2027. For the past 18 odd years the human race has been unable to have children. Full Stop.<br/><br/>This is all that is explained about the narrative during the film and this is all within the first 10 minutes. The film does little to explain what has happened, what is happening and what is going to happen after the film finishes. Normally, this would leave me feeling rather empty and unsatisfied, and whilst i would have liked more in terms of narrative throughout the film, what is included is prime viewing and delivers a very intense and gritty masterpiece that is as unrelenting in its imagery as it is compelling to watch.<br/><br/>The style of the film mirrors this lack of information. We don't know what happened to make the human race infertile because its irrelevant to what is happening on screen. With this film, you only know what you see and what you see is what you get.<br/><br/>First off, the aesthetics of the film are superb. Very gritty, very gloomy and most likely filmed on DV, with a similar look to 28 Days Later. If that gives you any frame of reference this darkish aesthetic almost mirrors the doom and gloom evident in the peoples lives intentionally feelings like Death, Poverty and oppression are mirrored using this medium. The obvious use of DV in the films plentiful action scenes gives the film a dimension of intensity as seen in the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan and the chase scenes in 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>The director manages to carry the film with a steady pace. It progresses well and not once was i left wandering where the film was going, which is strange seeing as we do not really know the ultimate objectives of the main characters. By that i mean we know where they are going but we do not know why or what is going to happen afterwards.<br/><br/>There are many many political references throughout the film. I do not care about politics enough to get into depth but the underlying morals and political references are clearly used to stimulate Leftist propaganda. There are obvious references to the Holocaust, Talitarian governments, Terrorists aka ""Freedom Fighters"", White oppressors, Lesbians, Black Saviours and many more. This doesn't ruin the film in any way and is actually used to good effect in order to create the feeling of oppression that is essential in carrying the film and its underlying moral narratives. But if proper propaganda annoys you, this film may be a little hard to take. But its a film, a cutting edge, action packed thinking mans film. A compelling watch from start to finish and if you like film to be slightly different and modern whilst being highly entertaining then i would seriously recommend Children of Men to anyone. ANYONE! 8/10 - It would be nine but i do feel that a little bit of an introduction and conclusion would have gone a long way to explaining the narrative and and ultimately giving the film a much more satisfactory conclusion."

","The movie ""Children of Men"" is very gritty, dark, violent, and some images are rather shocking. If you consider just what's shown in the movie, then it may feel unsatisfying. I've heard from a lot of people that they didn't like the movie or didn't ""get it"" because so little about the background was explained.<br/><br/>I think I liked just that, because it made wonder about those things myself. The effects that world-wide infertility would have on society are very difficult to contemplate.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie feels very short. Not very much happens, but related to it is a vast number of thought experiments to perform. So, if you want to be spoon-fed a story that wraps up nicely , you're not going to like this movie. If, however, you enjoy going through what-if scenarios and their outcomes on topics ranging from economics to politics, from psychology to sociology, ""Children of Men"" may be just your thing."

","I'm going to be very honest here. This was one of the best movies to come out all year long. I'm a sucker for post apocalyptic movies like this one. But this movie had great cinematography, a great story, pretty decent acting, and the sheer chaos that stays constant keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. This was on par with the departed, Borat, and all the other great films to come out this year. The one thing i thought was kinda week was how they killed off julianne moore and michael caine so quickly. I mean, one scene moore is alive and the next minute shes dead, i thought they could've added more. But Clive Owen does an excellent job acting his part and so do most others. Michael Caine looks like an old ass John Lennon and acts like it too. If it was possible i'd say this movie might have been nominated for best picture."
"michaelplewa","7","2","5","16 January 2007"," Ultimately Disappointing
","What a premise! What painstaking execution and set design! What a bunch of script problems! This is the kind of film that demands a satisfying 3rd act and ending. It eventually comes up just a little short. At the beginning of the film, it is clear above all else, youth is the ultimate commodity. A newborn baby, it would be assumed, would be the miracle of miracles for all of humanity.<br/><br/>Why, then, must so many characters be so wrongheaded about how to handle this? You have the government, who (never explicitly but are assumed) would discredit the mother and seize the infant as its own scientific property (and in this desperate hour, the Big problem is?) You have the radicals fighting for situational (and ultimately fleeting) freedoms of dignity. And then the vulgarians who always populate a post-apocalyptic story. You know, the ones who are so bent on survival at the lowest order that they are constantly laughing and easily fooled when the promise of money or food is dangled before them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Children of Men populates itself with too many characters from other post-apocalyptic stories and only successfully covers this up when the camera accomplishes what must have been the impossible. I give much respect and admiration to the crew capable of executing some exceedingly complicated and exciting long-takes. However, a 3rd act shootout provides a glaring reminder of the presence of the camera and its documentary-like hand-held omnipresence that it more disrupts than enhances the film's statement.<br/><br/>In final appraisal, this film had so very much going for it but ultimately comes up short where it should have been fixed months (if not years) ago. The script has an unsatisfying and ultimately tedious and anti-climactic ending. Pity. It was really something to behold until then."

","The Children of Men, a film I was very excited to see, you have Clive Owen, you have ""Rolling Stone"" saying ""Blade Runner of the 21st Century"" and the concept of the film is absolutely enticing.<br/><br/>Reality check, after watching Children of Men, I was compelled to go back and watch Blade Runner just to see what it was that ""Rolling Stone"" was talking about and I have to say WHAT?!?!? Children of men is terrific, it begins with a brutal hook and then pulls at the snared flesh for just under two hours.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is the extremely reluctant anti-hero who has clearly lost all hope, and for some reason Owens performance gets you to truly care. Not about this simpering drunk, but about the world he lives in and life as it has become.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor, creates another amazing performance, leaving no doubt that we can continue to expect great things from this very talented and versatile artist.<br/><br/>This film delivers on so many levels, not just in the dark reality of this war torn world, but also in the belief that life, new life is not only sacred and beautiful; but that even in the darkest times birth is a shinning beacon of hope. Hope for the future, and hope for ourselves if we could simply learn from all of our extremely relevant history."
"munrod13","10","2","5","15 January 2007"," Best Sci-Fi Film Ever Made
","The only filmic dystopian effort that even comes close is Blade Runner which was the long standing number one until the release of this tour de force. While Blade Runner was the most stylistic and heartfelt piece prior to Children of Men, it just cannot contend with the likes of the new champion. COM has literally set the standard for not just sci-fi film-making but all cutting edge cinema from here on out.<br/><br/>Starting simply with the cinematography it is so superior to any action film to date with its gritty post-neo-realism style that forces the viewer to look seriously at the illusion being presented. While Blade Runner's neo-noir style has truly stood the test of time and remains an important piece to this day, it pales in comparison to the rawness of COM. Of course the only reason that I can say this is because of the nature of the story and script, both of which dictate such texture and technique as is so perfectly executed in the film.<br/><br/>Next, the story and time dynamic are so tightly wound around the premise which might at times seem (like most sci-fi) a little convoluted, only because it is somewhat forced in the way that there are no exceptions to the war torn environment, and the inability of the entire human race to bare offspring. Coupled with the fact that only humans are effected by this plight, makes for a slightly less than fathomable existence. None the less, once the film gains momentum, which it quickly does, the pacing becomes so dynamic that it literally is one part of the cinematic tripod holding the film in perfect balance. The other two being of course the cinematography and the highly detailed and extremely well thought out plot. Each piece of information revealed or withheld is so precisely calculated and that with the dialog that is so plausible, animated, and fortified with wit obtainable by the average educated viewer, aids in powering this film into the position of possibly the number one movie ever made, period(especially if you enjoy the sci-fi genre, which, let's face it is becoming more and more relevant everyday).<br/><br/>Getting back to the tripod that these vehicles of storytelling form, it is clear that the what these stays are holding up is the root of all good narrative films: the performances.<br/><br/>Through out the entire film there is not one actor who didn't hold his or her own, helping weave together an intricate correspondence and rapport of such diverse and complicated characters the likes of which have not been seen in any Sci-Fi film, or even that many dramatic films made since the beginning of the theatrical motion picture.<br/><br/>There is not any one reason that I gave this film a ten out of ten, despite the graphic violence (which, if you ask me fit the piece in a way that violence has not been suited to a theme in film in a long time) but only a complex matrix of supporting threads which weave together this outstanding parable of hope in a world that has lost everything. Go see this movie as soon as humanly possible. It will change your life, and the way you view narrative film."
"reidhurt-1","9","2","5","15 January 2007"," One of the Top Films of 2006-2007
","Clive Owen delivers a very impressive performance as the disaffected activist of yore. He has seemingly given in to the "" one person can't really make a difference"" philosophy. Micheal Caine is scarily believable as the reclusive hippie who hasn't let his idealism wane over the years though the government has become increasingly oppressive. Claire-Hope Ashitey delivers as a dumbfounded new mother, unsure of what fate has in store for her. The only issue of cast I have is with the choice of Julianne Moore. She plays her part well as the activist muse who was once central in Owen's life, but seems slightly out of water. The movie has a certain noir that is reminiscent to me of "" Blare Runner""All in all, this is a complete work from director on down. Do yourself a favor and see a film that has both a message and appeal."
"liort88","5","2","5","15 January 2007"," It's just too bad...
","A wonderful cast, breathtaking cinematography and the end of the world as we know it are unfortunately not enough to make a great or even good film in the case of ""The children of man"", and it is too bad... The work of such solid-good actors as Owen and Moore and the brilliance of Caine can do little for the script that is simply bad and shallow. Surprisingly so, since Apocalypse is a bottomless resource as far as storytelling goes. The plot is pointless and lacks any kind of imagination. The film touches many painful, important issues but seems to pass them all by not giving any of the subjects enough depth to make them worth even being mentioned. The development of characters is nonexistent and lame, no motivation, no focus, no nothing Cinematography and direction is undoubtedly beautiful, almost perfect, but it too is wasted on a badly written script! A waste, all and all."
"walsh-211","9","2","5","14 January 2007"," It was my favorite movie of 2006, but it there were some problems.
","First off before I go any further, I want to say that this, along with The Departed was a movie that blew me away on so many levels. It had by far the best cinematography I've seen, and the acting I felt actually improved as the film progressed.<br/><br/>But a common theme on this board right now seems to be that if you dare explore the possibility that Cuarón made a few errors in judgement by leaving out key details, then you are not capable of ""appreciating"" the film. This just isn't true.<br/><br/>I'm 100% fine with the open ending, where you don't know what the Human Project is all about, and what will happen to the world once Key is aboard the boat. The children laughing at the very end gave the impression of a positive outcome but certainly guaranteed nothing. This is the best example of what should have been undisclosed.<br/><br/>However, why is it totally unacceptable to want to know more about the plot itself? I didn't necessarily need to know exactly why women were infertile, but I think if Cuarón had led us a little more towards some sort of reason other than a few suggestions made by Jasper in the beginning, then I would have been much more comfortable through out the film. I didn't NEED these details, but when you are watching a film about women being infertile, you do expect at some point for the director to address why, seeing as it was the basis for the problem the world was enduring.<br/><br/>The problem wasn't that I didn't know, but rather I was waiting for an answer during the movie and it never came (which took away from the watching experience itself). All in all I felt that the leaving the idea of what was to become of planet Earth and the human race a secret was brilliant and thought provoking, but also felt that the basis of why the events were actually occurring needed more explanation. Again, not necessarily a definitive answer, but more about the worlds' explanation of ""why it was happening."" Still, Unbelievable good movie. I've seen it twice in the theatres this week... something I haven't done in God knows how long. 9/10 for me."
"Bootydancinpunk","9","2","5","14 January 2007"," A must see film... Brilliant Sci-Fi drama
","My review and slightly spoiler-ish... So, you've been warned.<br/><br/>The premise: In 2027, as humankind faces the likelihood of its own extinction, a disillusioned government agent agrees to help transport and protect a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea where her child's birth may help scientists to save the future of mankind.<br/><br/>The premise was enough to peak my interest, for a simple reason: I enjoy seeing peoples fantasy of what the future brings and it usually poses a lot of what if questions, which make for great discussion. However, when I saw a commercial that said, ""Blade Runner for the 21st Century"", I knew I needed to see this immediately. Blade Runner is one of my all time favorite films and, really, watching Daryl Hannah run around in skimpy clothing fighting Harrison Ford should be on a list of things you should see before you die. Not to mention that its one of two movies Rutger Hauer was in that you should actually care about (The other is The Hitcher).<br/><br/>Director Alfonso Cuaron is responsible for a few other films you might of heard of, such as Great Expectations (A films whose fault lies in having very proper dialogue in a modern setting, but otherwise a good watch), Y tu mama tambien (Which is a good watch) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (My favorite one visually). He does a great job with direction on this film and chose his shots very carefully (The cinematography really takes center stage in this film, but Ill get very carefully). Not to mention, he really got A+ acting out of all of his actors. Its very rare to see a director do that. I cannot point out one actor who consistently was not directed and did not act well.<br/><br/>Clive Owen was really great in this role is probably his best instance of acting. along with Closer. Secretly, I was wishing the Converse would come out and he would get into a gunfight, but it didn't happen. His character in this film is very alone and just drifting through life in the beginning of the film (Apathetic). However, as the film progresses, his out-view on life changed and he becomes very concerned and very compassionate (Something he was the exact opposite of in the beginning of the film). Also, hes not an action hero in the film (I happened to think the trailer made out to be in a round about way). He has no fighting skills, no guns, no bombs, not even a plan (The guy tries to jump-start a gearshift car while being given chase).He accomplishes a much greater goal by doing small, insignificant things that at the end, are really part a plan he came up with on the spot.<br/><br/>Claire-Hope Ashitey as the pregnant women in question, Kee, fit her role very well and hopefully, well be seeing her in more films. Michael Caine was great Jasper, a pot smoking hippie type. The only character I didn't like in the whole film was the white guy with the dreads (I cant remember his name). He was just a douche. But, at least he was meant to be one.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the film really is the centerpiece. The atmosphere created by the director and the photography is second to none. The Apocalypse-like future never looked so desolate and depressing. The long shots presented at the end of the film were an amazing feat to accomplish, both in driving the films climax and as a technical achievement. The amount of choreography and rehearsal put into making these scenes is mind-boggling.<br/><br/>After I have basically given this film the equivalent of a rim job in this review, I have some minor qualms with the film. First off, Julianne Moore did a good job in the film, but her skin color. I mean, perhaps she was so pale because she meant to symbolize martyrdom (Because of her white like qualities=innocence), but everyone else in the film seems to have so much color and she looks like a sock puppet with red hair. It just urked me. In the grand scheme of the film, not a big deal but it just bothered me. The thing that did urk me and is a more valid complaint is against one of the long shots at the end of the film. I felt that the first long shot of Theo outside of a apartment building was meant to be the first in a series of long shots that were put in place to make you feel like you were watching a army newsreel. Fair enough. But, when someone gets shot, the lens gets sprayed with blood and it stays there, streaking down the lens for the rest of the first long shot. It was just out of place. The idea of shooting it like this was a good idea, but not just for a sequence, it should have been done like this the whole movie. It interrupted my suspension of disbelief for the film and just took me out of the universe the film had set up for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film a 9.5/10. I highly recommend it, it truly is a great sci-fi drama."
"pestercurio","Null","2","5","14 January 2007"," Not to be missed
","I have to say, that was one of the most terrifying, moving, and visceral movies I've seen recently. Of course, it's not even horror, but that's exactly what made it so scary--everything to me was very plausible, and all the details of how normal everyday existence has been affected also felt convincing.<br/><br/>Don't know what I mean? The premise of the movie is simple, but the execution is quite the harrowing thing to witness: for reasons unexplained, infertility of women started to climb, until in the near future, 2027, birth rate is halted. It's even more frightening that it's a mystery--as mentioned, it could be anything we are currently facing today--pollution? Global warming? Genetic experiments? How about all our funky new gadgets, cellphones, plasma TVs, genetically modified foods...all the recent innovations that are deemed safe now, but we ultimately don't know the long-term effect of.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't mean to suggest that these really are all screwing us over, and it'll be far too late in 20 years to fix anything. But it *could* be true--it really is not much of a stretch.<br/><br/>The vision of the future put forth by the movie is bleak and hopeless, opening with international mourning over the passing of the youngest person on Earth. The very idea is a little creepy. Much of society has gone to hell, and the only ""safe"" bastion we are aware of is Britain, though it's obvious it's a mess there as well with a (for all intents and purposes) Fascist government in reactionary mode. You can imagine what sort of social / political scene that spawns.<br/><br/>I mentioned detailing. From news clippings to semi-heard news broadcasts, and looping propagandist videos, there are a swath of brilliant little things observed offered as enrichment to what has happened in this future 2027. It's amazing putting these small things together, and gives the world such scope and believability, and that much of it is just gravy to the main plot is quite rewarding. You don't need all the depth we glimpse, but it's there to appreciate if you're of the mind to. An example: I absolutely loved this piece of graffiti seen briefly on a wall. Something like, ""Last person to die, please turn off the lights."" Genius. Just as irreverent and hopeless as you would expect from graffiti in such a world setting.<br/><br/>It's been an hour or two now since I saw the movie, and after some discussion, I can't see any holes; everything is airtight, has a reason, has a motivation. Things made sense as the characters progressed from each tribulation to the next. The acting was natural, an obvious fact as you realized you believed and really cared for some of these people. Clive Owen deserves a special note here; his performance was full of nuance and you really sympathized with this average guy put into extraordinary circumstances. His character's bravery and determination really shines through. Michael Caine, the hippie, was also a delight.<br/><br/>But perhaps deserving of the most kudos is the acclaimed Mexican director, Alfonso Cuarón. He had a hand in writing the script and editing, too. In short, everything is handled masterfully at all levels, especially with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki--their collaboration yielded thrillingly intense action sequences of which I've never seen the like. So much is happening on the screen, and there is such desperation that you'll find yourself rivetted. The shots are often cleverly staged, but the camera never feels obtrusive or presumptuous--it clearly follows Owen's character Theo, and everything he experiences, we do as well. This limitation of knowledge really works to the movie's advantage, because this avoids what many other films would degrade to: pseudo-science explanations for the infertility (where there is appropriately none to give), or perhaps the history of the Human Project. The last would have been particularly detrimental, because presented as a dim hope, it should remain so, rather than the ultimate solution for everything--nothing is assured in this chaotic dystopia.<br/><br/>The score was uncomfortable and responsive, and I'm friggin' glad to have seen a sort of apocalyptic film that doesn't blame it on some wayward asteroid or nuclear accident. The reasons are biological, and that's as personal and true as one can get, but it never felt preachy or moralizing. It's a story first and foremost, a warning second, and told so convincingly, it is a powerful one at that.<br/><br/>Children of Men needs to be experienced, and hopefully, it'll get some recognition as awards season again rolls around."

","I saw this movie tonight, and was mightily impressed. Slightly depressed, as well. Fabulous casting, wonderful cinematography, and interesting view of a future world. Go when when you are so up that something that has a rather dark view of the future won't drag you down, or when you are so down, that the hope and courage of the characters can bring you back up.<br/><br/>Don't think that contains any spoilers -- certainly not any more than the tag line for the movie -- but there you are. How can one write a review of this movie without saying as much? I rate it up there with another of Julianne Moore's best efforts: ""The Hours"". She's good at just about anything she does, but when she's given a role that she can really sink her teeth into, artistically, she can light up the screen. And I don't think there's any doubt that Michael Caine was born to play the aging hippie! Clive Owen lets his dark good looks, and the ability to speak of unimaginable pain through only the haunted look in his eyes work to good effect in this role. I gave the movie a 9 out of 10, so I think I must have appreciated it!"

","Children of Men is a post-apocalyptic vision of a world gone mad. The year 2027 finds all of the women on the planet made sterile. Entire countries collapse, and Britain becomes a shell-shocked land ravaged by racism, police brutality, and death squads.<br/><br/>Enter reluctant hero Clive Owen (who's brilliant in pretty durn near everything he does, ""Children of Men"" included). He is recruited by former lover Julianne Moore (slightly less believable as the rebel leader) to save the life of a ""fugie"" (short for 'fugitive') who, miraculously, is pregnant. He needs to escort the young woman to meet up with the Human Project, a Amnesty International-like organization who rescues such people from the clutches of the government.<br/><br/>This is a very dark movie. It's not directly violent, at least not to an extreme extent, but there are such subtexts, subtle and not, that are really reflecting a dark interpretation of our own world and the people who inhabit it (like all good speculative fiction stories should). We are shown a world where apathy and hatred are joined hand-in-hand, creating a world so terribly depressing it just oozes sadness from the screen. We are looking at a society without hope, and without hope, there is nothing but pain, torture, and death (handed out by the government in convenient carry cases of suicide pills).<br/><br/>The film does have many exciting action scenes, including a terrific scene of an ambush. I won't spoil the scene, but Cuaron practically invents a new method of shooting an action scene from the viewpoint of the passengers in a car. It's quite spectacular, and worth the price of admission alone. There are some other great action scenes, filmed not head-on (as Spielberg would have done), but as sidebars (Cuaron focuses on the hero's drive to find the pregnant girl, and simply wraps those character-driven scenes amongst great battle sequences).<br/><br/>The one and only reason I am giving this a 9 instead of a 10 is pacing in the early part of the film. I gauge a film's pacing by how often I look at my watch, and in the first half of this film I was so bored I took many glances (and even risked nodding off at one point). I think the director spent too much time developing the hero and his pot-smoking mentor (played cleverly by the great Michael Caine). The film could have used some tightening right there.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this is a great film.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 Barky"

They're better plot description then me so i'll tell you my personal views. The cinematography is top-notch, ti's gritty and make you feel that you are there. When a bomb goes off you hear screaming,crying, and little tiny rocks falling from the background.

","Based, extremely loosely, on the P.D. James novel by the same name, I went to this movie with my wife hoping/expecting much more than we received. While any director is allowed artistic license with a movie, Alfonso Cuaron essentially eviscerates the novel and leaves us with a jumbled mess that leaves one wondering ""what the hell was the director REALLY trying to tell me with this movie""?<br/><br/>There is little character development, little explanation of the ""whys"" of the situation, needless conspiracy plots and other issues that, in totality, ruin this movie. We both admire Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine and their efforts in this movie are wasted.<br/><br/>Cuaron omits or changes parts of the novel that would have added to the movie and one who has read the book immediately wonders why. For example, Quietus is not a suicide product in the book, it is a form of government-enforced mass suicide (think of the ""bring out your dead"" scene in The Holy Grail, but not funny). Theo's cousin is not a ""minister;"" he's the dictator of England. There are so many other examples that it seems Cuaron's ego got in the way when adapting the book to a screenplay that just ruin the movie that could have been made.<br/><br/>The L.A. Times critic labeled the movie ""the Blade Runner of the 21st Century."" What rot! There is nothing groundbreaking about this movie. There could have been if the novel had been followed just a bit more, if the characters had been a little more true to the novel and if the desperate, hopeless feeling that permeated the book had translated to the screen. Using government-enforced violence, a re-creation of the Abu Ghraib prison photo, and other attempts to make a political statement about current events in a movie based in the future and the premise of which is centered on procreation and the absence of it ever occurring again due to, seemingly, universal sterility clouds the message and, effectively, stops the hopelessness from translating to the screen.<br/><br/>Additionally, the topless scene in the movie is gratuitous. The important thing is not Kee's nude breasts, rather it is the swollen belly that is primary. The long scenes with her hands covering her breasts are just as effective as the two second shot of her breasts.<br/><br/>I give the movie a 6 out of 10 because it IS beautifully shot and framed, for the most part. As someone mentioned, the blood splatters left on the camera keep the violence in your face and on your mind. The actor's are superb overall in the delivery of their lines and the mood they impart, but the script is such a jumbled mess that any ability to make the viewer feel the mood to any level other than superficially is lost. Again, I fault Cuaron. Perhaps doing the screenplay, directing and editing were too much for him, or perhaps it's just that this movie fails to translate the novel to the screen effectively leaving anyone with knowledge of the book saying to themselves ""what a waste of a fine book, fine actors and a fine opportunity to make something special."""
"strawn1","10","2","5","12 January 2007"," Terrifying how realistic this Sci-Fi is..
","I saw this movie last night, knowing the plot summary and reading the buzz on the internet, but was still expecting just another ""end of the world"" movie. Children of Men is unlike any sci-fi movie I've ever seen. At times, as silly as it sounds, you feel like you are on the journey with Kee. There is plenty of adventure, drama, dry humor, and mystery to entertain all. While watching it, I was overwhelmed by the non-stop terrifying journey they go through in order to save Kee, and the chaotic world that has been created by the government....which terrifying enough, is referred to as ""Homeland Security."" Excellent acting, terrific script, and amazing cinematography. I recommend this movie to everyone, it will leave you thinking."
"benjaminhari","8","2","5","12 January 2007"," a political film worth loving
","Watching Children of Men was a real wake up call for me. Superb set design, an adult approach to character development, precise and enjoyable performances, gripping premise. But the slap in the face was realising that this was a mainstream film with something to say politically, and the confident manner in which it said it. futuristic films are notoriously fraught with dodgy inventions, bizarre social foibles and a sense that even the actors are sniggering at what's going on around them. Children of Men is a window opened wide upon the genre, a film that dares to treat its audience as thinking, imaginative beings, ones involved and curious as to the world around them. ""What could happen if we carry on this way?"" is played out on screen in a way that focuses on personal reaction to events and what happens to a society that has lost hope and placed its faith in repression, order and brutality. Go rent it if you need a shot in the arm, if you want to believe in the potential of cinema again."

","The long shots add to the tension of the story. Clive Owen and Michael Caine cushion our anxiety throughout a film of lightly controlled chaos. We see what looks like present day landmarks: Nelson's column out the window of Clive's cousin's house, plus the ubiquitous red double-decker bus. The street where Clive gets his coffee could be Tottenham Court Road. We see a separateness between Julianne Moore's character and Clive's character. Clive himself delivers a 21st century kind of guy, nice but apathetic,just getting by in life. How futuristic is that? He does get ignited and it is a movie about hope. The message is personified in these characters, but Alfonso Cuaron lets it sink in, doesn't hit us in the face with it.<br/><br/>This writer saw an early release on December 20. I haven't stopped thinking about how that movie relates to our world and neither will you. It captures you when you see it, but then you keep on trying to evaluate it here it is, three weeks later! That speaks volumes."

","Children of Men, loosely based on the novel ""The Children of Men"" by P.D. James, combines an intense depiction of a dystopian future with an avant-garde visual style. The director, Alfonso Caurón, who helmed such diverse films such as Great Expectations, Y Tu Mama Tambien, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, shows yet again that he can tackle any genre.<br/><br/>The film stars Clive Owen (Closer, Sin City) as Theo, a bureaucrat in 2027 London., who has refrained from human contact with everyone except for his hippy friend named Jasper, played by Michael Caine. We enter the film with news of the youngest person on earth dying, who is a little more than eighteen years old. It is understood that women are now infertile, but the reason for this disturbing phenomenon is not really explained. The characters in the film don't know either, creating the prevalent chaos. The plot gets moving when it is discovered that a young refugee, Kee is pregnant, and she needs Theo's help to get her to a group of scientists called The Human Project, in order to keep her baby safe.<br/><br/>Overpowering this compelling story is the amazingly impressive technical achievement, aided by Caurón's long time director of photography, Emmanuel Lubezki, and the art direction team. Like Cauron's Y Tu Mama Tambien, Children of Men is shot almost entirely in hand-held, a technique movie-goers have a love it or hate it attitude towards. Caurón and Lubezki manage to pull off entire scenes in what appears to be a single shot, as well as a battle scene that runs over seven minutes long. This scene contains realistically decayed, massive buildings, as well as flawless staging of actors and extras. The result is that rather than looking like science fiction, the film feels as if it was shot on an actual warfront in the future with a hand-held camera.<br/><br/>It's astonishing that a film so interested in its technical merits really held its own acting-wise. Clive Owen is wonderfully dry, yet caring as the cynical Theo, and Caine is at perfection in a surprisingly comical, scene stealing role unlike we've ever seen him before. Yet it is Caurón that reveals himself as the real star of the film, with a virtuoso directing effort.<br/><br/>Children of Men will definitely find some viewers who feel it is simply incredible, as well as many detractors, consisting of those who feel the film left too many questions unanswered, especially with its abrupt ending. However, most will appreciate the flawless technical accomplishments (apart from a fake looking CGI baby) of the film regardless of ones opinion about how fulfilling the story was. Nevertheless, Children of Men is a gritty, compelling, and occasionally funny film that is imperative for any serious movie-goer to see."
"moutonbear25","8","2","5","10 January 2007"," Hopeful Children
","The trouble with foretelling the future in film is that you need to make it credible. The viewer must be almost instantly immersed in a world that is unlike their own, be it entirely or just slightly. If successful, the viewer has the potential to form insights regarding the world they currently live in based on where it looks to be headed. If it fails, every intention the director weaves into the film will be lost on untrusting eyes. Alfonso Cuaron's near apocalyptic CHILDREN OF MEN opens in a coffee shop in London where the patrons stare in a state of numbed shock at the newscast that announces the death of the world's youngest human being. Baby Diego was all of 18 years old. There is no one younger because the human race has inexplicably stopped reproducing. The film is set only 20 years from now. Unfortunately, by carefully avoiding over-explaining how humanity got to this point, CHILDREN OF MEN misses achieving that level of authenticity necessary to fully engross the viewer, albeit just narrowly. Yet as more time is spent with the characters of this future, it somehow transforms into a compelling testament to the hope that keeps humanity going no matter how dire the state of the world. Given our current sliding slope towards an increased spread of apathy and despair, Cuaron has crafted an important film that serves as both a reminder and a tool to unify the global population  or at least the film-going one.<br/><br/>Part of the reason CHILDREN OF MEN fails to convince from the start is because of another device designed to foretell the future, the movie preview. To draw us into the intensity of the film, the preview shows an explosion that lead character, Theo (Clive Owen), just misses being killed in. This scene takes place early in the film and, given that this particular preview has been running even longer than most as the release was delayed by three months, the knowledge that the bomb is coming detaches the viewer as they brace for the blast. Had it been a genuine surprise, the shock itself would have served to announce the severity of the times, leaving the viewer as frightened and uneasy as the Londoners of 2027. The missing desperation allows for more time to make sense of what defines this future. While Cuaron's clues to explain humanity's collapse are clever and creative, the viewer is still left alone to play catch-up, trying to piece everything together on their own. Of course, it becomes clear that understanding how it happened is entirely irrelevant. The only thing that matters is that's where the road leads but the ground is not solid enough to get a good bearing, making it difficult to see past the details.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film is still surprising. And thankfully, once it does catch you off guard, it continues to do so until you understand what it means to need to survive at all costs. Theo must deliver Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to The Human Project, a group of the world's greatest minds dedicated to the rebirth of the human race. At the risk of pointing out the film's obvious symbolism, Kee is the ""key"" to this project as she is the first woman to conceive a child since Diego. Her miracle, although unexplained, inspires everyone she encounters to do right by her and protect her unborn child. As those who are accustomed to varying degrees of selfishness shed their ego-serving ways, their true colors shine through. Even those are meant to stop Kee so that they can use her baby to further their own purposes in the world ahead, from underground terrorists to an army that doesn't care who they blow up as long as something is being destroyed, are powerless in the presence of the potential savior she is carrying. It's as though everyone has given up and decided that their actions are meaningless and Kee's baby gives them a hope so pure it is unlike anything they ever knew before all the trouble began, as if they too are reborn along with the child.<br/><br/>What was impossible to imagine at the start becomes so vividly real that the viewer cannot help but be wrapped up in the urgency of Kee's need for a successful mission. Cuaron gives no reason at any time to think CHILDREN OF MEN will have to end happily out of a necessity to appease its audience. He makes every step of Kee's journey arduous and exhausting. After all, she is over eight months pregnant; her odyssey would be hard for anyone. Only she is not simply carrying a child. She is carrying the fate of humanity at a moment in history that could mean the difference between a chance to begin again or an otherwise likely extinction. Being only 20 years away, there could already be a ""Kee"" amongst us. Though hope sometimes feels difficult to muster, CHILDREN OF MEN shows us we will find it again when we least expect to and it will keep us alive when we need it most."
"Dragonsouls","9","2","5","10 January 2007"," Epic film, and an instant classic.
","I went in with low expectations, which might of helped, but I can't remember the last time I saw a better film than this in the past 2 years or so. This is a film in the Science Fiction category, but it's more of a Drama set in the future. Ill write this critique assuming the reader already knows what the film is about so Ill speak of it's positives and negatives.<br/><br/>The rare but not unique directing in this film is very much ala Kubrick, and ala Spielberg. Both used long takes, Kubrick mastered the tracking take and Spielberg the long take with extras and chaos in background. Cuaron' does a great job at doing this in 3 particular scenes and especially at the end with a 9 minute single take. The effect achieved with this method is ultra realistic, evoking a situational feeling which puts the viewer in the main character's shoes.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, throughout the entire cast, my favorite was Caine's character Jasper. I hope he snags up an Oscar just for some face time, he deserves it. I also wanted to elaborate on he atmosphere here. Managment of extras in this film was fantastic. People tend to forget about that aspect of directing. The setting is a Gothic future London and they really made it look depressing. I haven't seen such brilliance since Kubrick's Full metal jacket. COM has more action and epic-like war scenes that will give you flash backs of Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Now some of the flaws in this film include shallow writing. It's a drama at heart. Little philosophy about god, religion and science. Few scenes mention or explain such topics, but the film doesn't really concentrate on what caused infertility or why the world collapsed and how. You will see the hate Bush signs and some violent Muslims parading with guns. But it's all in the background, and your journey is the main attraction in this film. The moral is about one thing. Everyone has a purpose, whether you contribute to chance, or to the will of nature."

","OK, all I have to say is that you should watch this movie in theaters unless you have a home theater system with surround sound and a good picture. The way the film is shot puts the audience into the middle of the chaos in the most personal and intense way, but without a loss of clarity. I have to give mad props to the people who made this film. The attention to detail and the realism in everything makes the movie one of the best ones I have seen in a long time. High marks, all across the board. When I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought the premise was a lofty topic and would be difficult to portray. However, the plot is subtle and there is no feeling of being spoon-fed explanations. The audience is just along for the chaotic and thrilling ride. High marks, all across the board."

","One of the most moving films I've seen but not easy to watch, the plentiful violence is realistically done, mostly in one long shot, so the ugliness of it really hits you. There are many layers of allegory and many current issues are touched on. The thing I remember most is the cruelty of man against man. It really makes you wonder why someone would want to kill another person. <br/><br/>The photography and editing is documentary-style during the violent scenes but sometimes indulges in fairly close-up shots in quiet scenes. My only complaint is that the reason for the infertility isn't speculated on more. I would really like to hear at least a possible explanation..Overpopulation?.. A virus?...There are many ways this idea could play out.<br/><br/>I couldn't wait to see what would happen next..."

The very last scene of the movie depicted that you were to assume what happened after the movie ended, which by the way, couldn't have been more abrupt.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore and Clive Owen give deep, convincing performances.

"gpeltz","10","2","5","8 January 2007"," Stunning film-making
","My lady friend who saw, ""Children Of Men"" with me, did not like it, another lady I know thought it awful! The film is dark and gritty with a depressing ""End of the world"" scenario. The motivations of the lead players are questionable, and the ending is vague and ambiguous. Nothing is clearly spelled out nor simplified, So why did it I like it? The story depicts a time in the near future, the year 2027, The major world centers have already been decimated by the exchange of nuclear weapons, and only England stands as the last bastion of civilization with a governed populous. Humankind now faces a biological death grip. No woman on the planet has conceived nor given birth in eighteen years. The phenomena of worldwide infertility goes unexplained; it could be a plague, pollution, or an act of divine retribution. What is certain is that, with no children being born mankind has reached it's end.<br/><br/>England had adopted a zero tolerance for illegal immigration, people from all nations flock to the United Kingdom, for shelter and work. Immigrants are herded into refugee camps, and treated like criminals. In the streets, civil unrest rocks the country as armed leftists, with a pro emigration stand, and terrorist tactics, battle the governments repressive forces. The Leftists await the day when a grand uprising will bring down the government and its defense forces. It is a chillingly familiar and violent world, painted brusquely upon the screen.<br/><br/>As we meet the films protagonist, Government worker, Theodore Faron, played by Clive Owen, he is kidnapped by the rebels, under the command of his ex lover, Julian Taylor, played by a no nonsense, Julianne Moore. She needs to get an official document, almost impossible to obtain, a Document of Transport , for an illegal. The rebels have taken under their wing a young lady (Claire-Hope-Ashitey) from the refugee camps. She is pregnant, and they are seeking to transport her to a special group, only rumored to exist, called ""The Human Project"" There, scientists and doctors, concerned with the worlds survival, would care for the mother and child.<br/><br/>I heard on the radio, a conservative moderator call the film leftist leaning, with disdain. He cited the directors youth (46) and nationality, (Mexican) to back up his claim. I disagree with him, the film was even handed, It showed corruption on both sides of the political spectrum. The concern was for the young pregnant woman, whose child represented the hope and the future of all mankind.<br/><br/>The most striking aspect of this film, is the manner in which it makes one feel a participant, more than just a viewer. Not since Ridley Scott's, ""Blackhawk Down"" have I felt such intensity in it's depiction of urban street battle, as the government and rebels clash. The Director achieves this, by using a steady, but fluid hand held camera,and long single takes, filming the scene directly, without cross cutting. It lends a documentary feel to the footage. We are placed in the heat of the street battles dodging bullets from both sides. It feels remarkably real. This movie is a bravura piece of film making, it does not draw attention to it's techniques, while it engulfs the viewer in it's engrossing action. There are at least three remarkable long cuts that left me breathless, and a few more that left me in tears because of the emotional intensity.<br/><br/>End of the world anarchy has been the subject of several movies. The intelligent British film, ""Day the Earth Caught Fire"" (1961) and the American counterpart, ""Panic in the Year Zero"" (1962) sought to capture the fall of civilization, None has done it better then, ""Children of Men."" I give it ****1/2 out of five stars."

","Like many people I disagree with what is going on lately in our world. Children of Men is the first movie to make aware of what is going on in our society and the damages that we are doing to it.<br/><br/>The kind of world Children of Men portrays is a very scary one. Great Britain stands as one of the few countries still civilized. Every other place has either been bombed with nuclear weaponms or has been placed without order. People from these places have tried to immigrate to Great Britain where anyone who is not native born is considered an illegal immigrant and if caught are subject to torture, execution, or forced to live in a secluded part of the area. Britain is subject to bombings daily, and people live in fear of the day when man finally dies. Suicide pills are sold over the counter, yet ganja remains illegal. This is the world Theo Faron lives in.<br/><br/>When Faron (Clive Owen) is put into a race by his former wife Julien (Moore) to get a girl named Kee to a boat called the Tomorrow where the human project lies which is a place trying to cure infertility. This is where he finds out the miracle. Kee is pregnant. 8 months.<br/><br/>Not only is this film dramatic but it has it's share of action that the group faces trying to get there.

","I had to get out of the house. I pull up the movie listings and read a few quick summaries and picked the one that was starting in 15 mins. It turned out to be Children of Men.<br/><br/>I have never watched a movie and said out loud, 'Wow. This is an awesome movie!', but I said it twice during this one. There are several single shot scenes that last almost 10 minutes and they are enthralling. One immediately wonders how they pulled it off. I started to look for cgi effects or wires, but they mastered total immersion with this one. This movie is captivating. The action is immediate, the plot evolves at a nice rate, and the characters are diverse and developed enough to make their behavior credible and consistent.<br/><br/>And that says nothing about its theme and its relevance to current times.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!"
"theredcomet","10","2","5","6 January 2007"," I was completely blown away!
","At first this movie reminded me of a mix of ""V for Vendetta"", Vietnam war protest era, and ""28 days later"" (minus zombies obviously). But it was clear to me from the first ""Long-shot"" scene that this movie was unlike any other. It far surpasses ""V for Vendetta"" and any message that movie could ever hope to make. They use a very amazing camera technique where they film these stunning scenes without ever cutting, it's just one complete shot and the choreography is so brilliant and the way the camera moves fluidly within the scene. I knew right then from that first scene how brilliant the director, Alfonso Cuarón is. Sure, he did a fantastic job with the look and feel of Prisoner of Azkaban, but this is just completely on another level.<br/><br/>How to describe this movie? It's a desperate end of the world type situation where, much like V for Vendetta, Britain is the last standing civil nation among the world with all other world powers falling into disarray within the near future of our time line. Humanity has lost the ability to reproduce and people are just waiting around to die out amidst chaos and futileness. We see Britain, much like a Nazi Germany state, where ""Homeland Security"" is top priority as every last illegal alien is hunted down and transported to camps. We see martial law abound and advertising reflects much of what the government is trying to control. All throughout the movie you can see tidbits of news from the past 20 years which echoes of ""Bush's War"" and ""Bring our Troops Home"" leading up to the great decline of society and mankind. We see terror groups in Britain bombing the populace to get their agenda across, then find out that the government is really behind the bombings in order to control the populace through fear. We see internment camps and Guantanamo-style prisons where prisoners strongly reflect photos seen in Abu Ghraib. The very last scene of the movie is about a 20-minute long ""one shot"" scene of just pure anxiety and emotions. It follows Clive Owen through this harrowing escape as he's navigating his way through war torn streets, militants shouting ""Allah Akbar"", things blowing up everywhere, people being shot, and utter chaos. How they managed to shoot this whole scene in one take is completely beyond me. But the camera style of following right next to his body and having the camera peer out from behind cover reminds much of a First Person Shooter type game, immersing the audience in the story. Christ, the last half hour of the movie was nerve-wracking, I was sitting in my seat shaking, with my stomach twisted in knots. The theater I was had such a good sound system that when the British Army were firing their tanks into building, you could feel the explosion in your body. It was just... jaw-dropping! The music is brilliant Vietnam War era backdrop which provides a very strong social commentary for the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has some really strong messages about current events in the world today and sends across a very strong message, for those who are intelligent enough to understand it's meaning."
"thepowerofhat","9","2","5","5 January 2007"," Beautiful and intense, but not without flaws.
","As Oscar season rolls around, one trend that I find seems to occur among films is this: entertainment gives way for art. Movies become less focused on giving the audience a good time, and more focused on getting awards. ""Children Of Men"" is lucky enough to have some entertaining moments, and yes, it's worthy of a few awards. But it's not perfect.<br/><br/>The acting certainly doesn't take center stage here, which is fine in some ways, as it keeps the viewer focused on the events surrounding the characters rather than the characters themselves. Some of the actors stand out, of course, and this both adds and detracts from the film. Clive Owen must be noted, as he is the main character and gets the greatest amount of screen time. Unfortunately, I feel he was miscast. I don't doubt that Owen is a good actor, but his character here seems very underplayed. The situations that Theo is in are suspenseful, amazing, frightening, and intense, and sadly, Owen seems to nearly always have the same expression on his face and in his voice. He could have used a greater range of emotion.<br/><br/>Another character that stands out - for the better, this time - is Jasper Palmer, as played by Michael Caine. It's a pleasure to watch Michael Caine as a playful, jolly new-age hippie, and you can tell that he had fun with the character. He's one of the few really entertaining things about the movie, and I think it was cast very well. The character of Syd, played by Peter Mullan, also stands out, and like Caine, Mullan manages to actually entertain the audience. It's a very small part, granted, but you'll remember it, and I consider those sorts of memorable characters to be far more worth the price of admission. All in all, the acting was what you'd expect from an Oscars-focused film, and the only thing that really hurts it there is Owen's low emotion levels.<br/><br/>Speaking of Oscars, two places where this film truly excels are the cinematography and sound editing. The movie has a very gritty feel, which shows especially well in the battle scenes towards the end. Really, that large battle scene is probably one of the most amazing parts of the movie. There are some extremely long hand-held camera shots that are executed extremely well and do a great job of keeping the audience on edge. The action is very intense, but still easy to follow and understand. It really helps to draw the audience into the movie, and this is achieved even more by some amazing foley work. The sounds of weapons firing, explosions, people yelling, bullets hitting concrete - they all sound amazing. Truly, the cinematography and sound are so good in this movie that they're reason enough to go see the movie. Renting it when it comes out on video really won't do it justice, as this level of immersion can only be achieved in a theatre.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie leaves a bit to be desired. You'll come away feeling like you should have been shown more, and you'll know that it was intended to make your mind linger on it afterward. You'll also know that you're glad you saw it in theatres, but that it's not going to be an absolutely necessary addition to your DVD collection."
"superduperspit","10","2","5","21 December 2006"," A masterpiece.
","This year's best Oscar winner will not deserve its win. A big claim you might say, but after watching Alfonso Caurons masterpiece of film-making Children of Men I have no hesitation in saying it, because when this film finally gets overlooked in the Oscar shakedown mainly due to inept Fox release scheduling and tepid marketing the final five going for the gold statue will know they're in a field bereft of the best movie of 2006.<br/><br/>From the start this film has the deck stacked against it. It lays in the genre of Dystopian Sci-Fi a section of cinema that's the ultimate anaemia to an Oscar voter. And it doesn't feature any blatant Oscar baiting characters to worm into the hearts of the Oscar judges an essential ingredient to convincing the academy for a vote. Instead what you get is a movie built on stunning cinematography, understated but pitch perfect acting, seriously engaging issues and a generally all round aura of every piece fitting perfectly into place.<br/><br/>The world given to us by Alfonso Cauron is a painstakingly constructed vision of near tomorrow where women have become infertile and the world has slowly descended into chaos with only the battered but still standing Island of Britain left to live out the last days of civilization. The detail of this work is at a level that has never been achieved before in film. London is a smog ridden shadow of its former self as people move about in old battered cars and litter lays in large quantities on the streets, while the little glimpses of technology that could be conceivable be in use in the year 2027 (the films setting) are woven into the film seamlessly, never looking like a crude superimposed extra.<br/><br/>But it isn't just the visuals that stand out as we get a number of truly memorable scenes throughout the movie. One of Theo (Clive Owen) visiting his cousin Nigel (Danny Huston) in citadel-like ""Ark of Art"" is at turns haunting and touching as they stand in the remains of humanity's visual expression. Then there is a scene in a farmhouse which is one of the tensest sequences ever put to screen, but the main set piece is the battle sequence near the end of the movie which is played out in one incredibly constructed single shot which no cuts at any stage. It is a compellingly realistic snapshot of urban warfare which no other film has ever come close to matching and is perfect showcase for the director's visual flair.<br/><br/>Even men like Michael Caine an actor who has of late descended into predictable roles doesn't disappoint, his Pot smoking yet gentle hearted Jasper is a highly enjoyable play against type while elsewhere people like Chiwetel Ejiofor as one of the figureheads of the ""Fishes"" an anti-government group and Julianne Moore as Julian the Fishes leader give performances at par with the best of their careers.<br/><br/>Mention should also be made of the films interweaving into the plot current hot button issues like terrorism, immigration and racial tolerance all of which fits seamlessly into the film. Even the soundtrack is without fault with each song fitting its scene in an apt manner.<br/><br/>It's a film that in the coming years will be looked on as a true classic if only this reviewer was proved wrong on Oscar night and it became a current classic as well. Here's hoping.<br/><br/>Review by Gulli, written for film site www.boxofficefanatic.com"

Is US and nothing else who is putting in danger the future of humans.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is the perfect as Theo. I don't think anyone else could have done it better or more perfect in any way. And Julianne Moore is truly amazing too; Michael Caine (one of my favorites) is just brilliant in this movie, I love him... a true amigo for Theo, Julian and Kee."
"sinanonline","9","2","5","2 December 2006"," Strong Message on Current Society
","The movie successfully aims to give a message to the audience about the current society through a finely-crafted plot in a dark utopia setting.<br/><br/>My first impression about the movie was that there was an inconsistency in the plot: Nobody seemed to understand how important the baby was. Then I realized what was going on: Nobody is indeed caring about the baby; just as most of the powerful parties in the world do not seem to care about world peace, but religious or political conflicts. The initial reaction of the audience is ""God - how stupid can they be not to understand how important that baby is,"" and the second reaction is ""God, how stupid are we all living in the current society?"" The baby is a symbol for the world peace.<br/><br/>At about the end, the audience enjoys a very expressive camera shooting impressively long scenes. The movie assumes the tone of a live war reporter; and the scenes are reminiscent of a lot footage we see on the news everyday.<br/><br/>The movie is an enjoyable experience as an action movie set in a dark futuristic environment, and it delivers a strong message through simple symbolism and innovative use of camera. I find myself optimistic about the future when I see the artistic reaction to today's problems."

","The thing that immediately strikes you when you walk out of this film is the sheer scale of the thing. Not since some of the more memorable battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan have i seen such a large area being used at once. (Not counting CGI films of course).<br/><br/>The size of the story and its surroundings is not the only aspect that makes this film such a hit though. Considering that they are tackling a subject that could be so easily overcome by the sentimental trash that often swamps futuristic films, the producers avoid many, if not all, of the potential traps that this genre sets. The acting is superb throughout, and even Pam Ferris, maybe the most unlikely freedom fighter ever cast, is brilliant."

","Children's laughter, children's cries. These have all vanished as Alfonso Cuarón tells us a story of the possibility of women being infertile by using a gritty, war torn backdrop with an unlikely saviour. I completely took this movie word-for-word as I watched it; I couldn't sit back and not pay attention because I was immersed into the fallen nation of a post apocalyptic 2027 because of the solid acting of Owen, Caine and Moore. The cinetography played an important role in the film as well, it played you. It played the man watching Owens character struggle through London's brilliantly remastered city to the shanty towns of the English coast because of the natural progression of the cameras movement, it was so natural. I really thought Cuarón paid close attention on Britain's society, it was so plausible, it brought a new definition of a British stereotype when he made the sub characters to be so diverse, it could almost bring fourth a possibility for this likelihood to actually happen. I always thought the achievement of capturing the heart of a viewer was so hard to master, the expression given on the first child born in over 18 years was simply remarkable, I gave heart in hand as I witnessed the scene of two opposing forces to stop their conflict and bow down to a newborn child. The film was executed perfectly bringing both a scary crisis of the future and an epic struggle to solve it. 9/10"

","First off, watch this film - i don't usually enjoy helping to fill the coffers of Universal, but in this case we can let it slide because Children of Men is the kind of film that doesn't come along too often - a 'silver screen jobby' not a 'wait until it comes out on DVD' film.<br/><br/>it has all the elements of distopian sci fi at its best, and whilst not quite on the epic scale of blade runner, it pitches to us the idea of a future we can visualise - a future in Britain thats a present in much of the world. you can take this film on face value as a high paced action flick with a story line (remeber those Hollywood - come on, dig deep) or you can look at the myriad of little asides to the plot that help paint a vivid picture of the world in which its set. references to the war in Iraq, the abuse of prisoners in abu ghrabe prison camp and the refugee camps in the UK that could have been taken right out of Lebanon.<br/><br/>its a powerful film that shows us a Britain we can imagine, a future that is pieced together from images we see daily no the news and which almost seems to be the real message of the film."

","The solemn feeling throughout this movie is clearly there as soon as the title appears on the screen. The bland, white on black line 'Children of Men' really sets the mood for this epic drama/thriller from the get go. Moving on to the actual movie and what a movie it is. The fact it is set about 20 years from now really strikes a chord for watchers as it could, and could being a key word, happen with some of the policies and 'agenders' set about by politicians in 2006. Clive Owen plays a superb lead and gently pursues an English accent-not flamboyant and cockney but surprisingly realistic. The actors filling in the tidy amount of other roles are also up with Owen in believability and just make the world seem so much more real. The film is jumpy, at points, as it is witty and breathtaking. The music and set pieces are excellent if not slightly clichéd at points. Characters are believable and you fell even for the bad guys and even a small tear jerker appears unexpectedly at the end. The ending, however, is not as expected but the build up towards it is mesmerising. If only certain facts were told somehow at the end, the film would feel completed, but questions like What happens to her/him? still linger in the mind. And linger is what this film will do. You will think about it a day or so after viewing and the message will still be there whether that be about the future or what will happen with immigration. The film tackles both with flare and the whole base of infertility becomes side tracked but still there and still important, as shown by the expression and reaction when a baby does appear..."

","Children of Men is the best film I have seen at the cinema this year. I didn't expect it to be so good, but it more than surpassed my expectations. The story concerns a world in which fertility has mysteriously ended, rendering the human race to a fate of extinction within 50 years or so once everybody has finally died. Set in 2027, the world is a bleak and violent place, in which military rule plays a large part in everyday life as law and order have collapsed and terrorism grows. Clive Owen, a former peace activist who has turned to fags and booze to ease his pain at earth's sufferings, is reluctantly drawn into an underground battle between terrorists out to promote immigrant rights and the authorities keen to persecute all opposition. When he discovers an immigrant woman who is pregnant, he realises he must help her find the 'human project', an undefined but much-hoped for scheme to save humanity. Cue lots of chases and thrills as he battles violent terrorists on the one hand and trigger happy troops on the other. Along the way, we meet Michael Caine, sporting a silly wig and seeming to portray a cardy slut. Children of Men certainly has its lighter moments and is worthy of great recognition. Go and see it!"
"glennwalsh44","7","4","14","21 September 2006"," A great film, but not 'The Children of Men'
","This is a very difficult review to write, because I am torn in two very opposite directions over this film, its relationship to P. D. James' book and the political statements it makes.<br/><br/>As a film, it is probably the best piece of British cinema made in years. It is extremely well shot, obviously had a decent budget and the attention to future detail has you scouring the screen to make sure you miss nothing. There are two long single takes that are technical tours de force and one in particular will probably go down in cinema history. These takes, filmed with hand-held cameras had me thinking of Stanley Kubrick and that perhaps he at last has a worthy successor.<br/><br/>Clive Owen gives a career-defining performance and is the ultimate reluctant hero and Michael Caine is just wonderful and obviously enjoying himself immensely. The supporting cast, especially Ferris and Mullan are excellent and inject the film with a useful dose of humour and colour.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, great cinematograpghy and even great acting does not a great film make. That has to lie in the story.<br/><br/>In the opening credits it reads 'Based on the book by P. D. James' and therein lies the problem. The additional words 'very loosely' should probably have been included. James' story is one of great beauty and is concerned primarily with the cycle of life, of death and re-birth and there is an overt spiritual element to the book. The screenplay abandons most of this and instead becomes a polemic statement about the treatment of illegal immigrants. The issue of universal infertility, the centrepoint to the book, is buried under these political statements to the point where it is barely relevant.<br/><br/>Whether or not you will be emotionally engaged by this film will ultimately depend on your views on immigration and can accept that at any point in the future the UK, with the most liberal attitude to immigration in the western world, would ever start to close its shores.<br/><br/>Perhaps the director's nationality has something to do with this, I could understand that and empathise with it, but why not give the film a different name, a slightly different scenario and make a better film for it.<br/><br/>As someone with personal experience of infertility, I expected to have my heart strings tugged by this one, but it didn't happen because the film isn't about infertility or the effect it would have on our society. James' story goes into lots of detail on how people cope with having no children and it is this that shapes their attitudes. The film has none of this except the odd nod and even the Quietus, a key element in the book, is reduced to almost nothing and not even properly explained.<br/><br/>Finally far too many points of plot are left unresolved. Maybe this is an attempt to highlight the confusion of the times, but I found it frustrating and a destraction. A few important things appeared to happen for no particular reason except perhaps as the set-up to a piece of action.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing, but read the book if you really want to explore the concept.<br/><br/>8/10 for technical achievement and acting. 5/10 for writing."

Whilst the main goal during the movie is quite clear, the reasons why are not. <br/><br/>I do not believe it had a very good story line but do believe that its intense action and suspense at times throughout partly made up for that.<br/><br/>I think what the film lacked was conveying the audience into its world, leaving the viewer with the feeling at all times of, ""This is just another movie.""<br/><br/>**SPOLIER BELOW**<br/><br/>I am quite unhappy with the ending of the story, as it cuts short too soon.

"wingless422","10","3","10","13 November 2012"," One of the most underrated movies in cinema history.
","Looking at the original cover and hearing the title it sounded like some cheesy acted action chick flick, but man I could have never been more wrong. This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, and I am one of the harshest film critics. The impossibility of directing some of these 5 minute long takes (the camera literally doesn't cut) as the characters go through some of the best action sequences (and most realistic) you will EVER see. <br/><br/>Owen really never had his 'role', and this was it. He plays the reluctant, dis-envisioned loner Theo who, despite his poverty and the fact that the entire world is crumbling around him, maintains his composure through constant flask drinking, gambling, and weed. When his old liaison, Julian Moore, approaches him for an offer, he reluctantly agrees after learning of the money he is promised. Unaware of the situation he is entering himself into, he is thrown into the melee when the transport of an illegal immigrant goes horribly wrong and he is stuck trying to smuggle the last pregnant woman on earth out of the country, while being discovered, hunted, and chased by multiple terrorist groups. Meanwhile the country is in an uproar about illegals because of how dangerous the rest of the entire world has become most illegal immigrants are murderous and in gangs, and they highly outnumber the rest of the population. The baby is a source of political motives, being that it's the last on earth, and Theo quickly realizes that besides the mother he is the only one looking out for its best interests.<br/><br/>It becomes readily apparent that despite always being drunk and stoned Theo becomes a quick witted, highly agile escape artist when his adrenaline kicks in. He battles through hell, alone, and for most of the movie without shoes, striving to get this woman and her baby to safety. In one of the last scenes, Theo is walled in with the woman in a refugee camp being invaded by multiple terrorist organizations, and scheduled to be bombed by the military. I've never had such admiration for a hero as I did watching Theo run through the streets dodging bullets and cheating death, it was one of my most favorite scenes in movie history, and it was over 7 minutes of non-cut camera action. You witness first hand the horrors of war, as everyone around him annihilates each other. It will have you on the edge of your seat. This will always be one of, if not, my favorite movie of all time. It set a landmark with its camera-work, no one has yet to accomplish anything like this. It should have won multiple Oscars, no argument. To me Theo is one of the greatest heroes in movie history. This is one of my few movie reviews in 10-15 years on this site, because this movie truly deserves it. Trust me, see it. Give it a half hour and the action will start and it wont stop. 12 out of 10. Great movie. <br/><br/>I've recommended it to so many people, more than any movie I know, and most of the times they've never heard of it, and are always happy they saw it. When I first came to IMDb it had a rating of 6.3, now it's 8.0, and it's still too low. Owens' acting in this movie is some of the best I have EVER seen. It's a lot harder to act when the camera isn't cutting for 5 minutes, your flaws come out, and it just exposed how amazing he was. Just watching him break down in tears was flawless, the spit connecting from his hands and he tried to wipe them away and everything, it reminded me of Day Lewis in TWBB. Truly remarkable."

","It's kind of ironic. At a time when Great Britain appears to be declining into terminal wimpiness -- multiculturalism the orthodoxy of the day; swatches of London turned into Londonistan; Britain's military cut in half; her once-great navy reduced to coastal patrol; her sailors groveling with self-abasement before their Iranian captors, then attempting to sell their stories to the tabloids; her prince kept home from the war lest he be kidnapped; in short, a nation of pacifists, appeasers, and peace marchers -- the makers of ""Children of Men"" have concocted a leftie's dystopia in which today's soft-headed nanny state has improbably morphed into a nation of ruthless fascists who hunt down dissidents and cage, torture, and murder innocent asylum seekers. ""Children"" celebrates the trite old radical mind-set that sustained us in the '60s: the government is evil, off the pigs, open the borders, we're brave members of the underground, a cadre of romantic revolutionaries, blah blah blah... It's the sort of self-pitying fantasy that must warm the hearts of Guardian and Independent readers everywhere as they search their papers for signs of police brutality they can tsk-tsk over."
"Ahmetas","7","3","10","28 September 2006"," ""Will the last one to die please turn the lights off?""
","I had seen the trailer of Children of Men some time before it came out and heard some good reviews about the movie so I was hoping I would not be disappointed.<br/><br/>And I must say I wasn't. Overall, I found the film to be very moving and enjoyable(as much as a dystopian movie can be). Think Clive Oven's acting could be better but it was certainly intolerable. I just think he went too over the top with the ""hopeless, uncaring and broken man"" acting. Michael Caine was just perfect and the scenes he is in are easily the most enjoyable and positive scenes. Julianne Moore was also good although I did not expect her to be killed off so early in the movie.<br/><br/>I have not read the book(except a short summary) but I knew the story in the film would be different than the one in the book. Come on. There is little possibility to make a successful movie appealing without adding or changing some things. Overall, I liked how the story and bits of information were told. You will not be seeing clichéd news or billboards that poke the reality to the viewers face all the time. The fact that no children are born is a reality of life and even if its rarely mentioned very openly, you know it is there. Its in the air. And you can feel it all the way through the movie. Thats another thing I liked. In almost every scene of the movie, there is a sight that reminds you that things are falling apart despite the best attempts to hold it together. You can sense the hopelessness whether its in the form of a cracked window, a distant gunfire, the dirt and grime in the cities or the detention cages that illegal immigrants are put to. And all those images and the atmosphere, put together, make Children of Men one of the most emotional movies I watched.<br/><br/>However, the movie is not flawless. The first half of the movie felt somewhat slow and condensed. Something that I have experienced in other movies of Cuaron (such as Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban). During the first half, I got a feeling that the movie was just skimming through the story and hurrying up to reach the second half. I could swear that some scenes were cut or shortened just before the movie was released. However, the movie does shine in the second half that starts roughly from the sequence where the main characters leave Jasper to meet Sid (who is, by the way, a greatly written character on itself) and the whole Bexhill sequence. The scene where Kee gives birth and Theo has to act of midwife and the following sequences of the street battle and the ""Fish"" holdout in a tower block filled with civilians is one of the most violent, yet moving scenes that shows the ravages of war and the ruthlessness of its combatants all too well. I loved the shot where Luke keeps going between a state of war frenzy and a state of compassion for the newborn is, to me, a scene that reminds me of the things humanity lost in its fear of extinction and death. But the high point of the movie is the shot just few minutes later, when the whole world seems to stop for a moment upon the sight of the baby. I mentioned emotions and how Children on Men was a movie packed with it. That scene is the prime example and one of the most moving scenes I have watched.<br/><br/>The movie ends somewhat abruptly. The question whether humanity is saved or not is not answered. But I don't think its such a bad thing. An ending that humanity got saved would be a cliché and unfitting with the grimness and bleak perspective of the movie. An ending that humanity did go extinct, however, would be a bleakness that was too forced and would have made the story pointless. Thats why, it ended just in the right place.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a very bleak and depressing movie and I left the theatre feeling that way. But I don't find that as a bad thing. Shows that the movie was capable of invoke feelings. Also, as a lover of dystopian movies and books, I would have expected no other way. As a movie, it has its low points and it has its (very) high points. Thats why I did not regret seeing this movie at all and recommend it, but only if you're a lower of the genre. If you expect people cooperating each other for a better future and all that nonsense, pass this movie. It is one that shows the best and worst of humanity without cringing."

","Imagine a few years from now, and the 'war on terror' has engulfed the whole world with Britain (haha!) as the last refuge from attacks. The economy is in tatters - possibly to pay for the almost omnipresent Homeland Security - but the really bad news is that the human race has become infertile years ago. Pregnant black woman, Kee, appears to Save the Day.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a powerfully devised (if heavily flawed) movie. It uses a mish-mash of modern day fears, realistically projected 20yrs into the future, and a welter of populist, barely disguised religious metaphor to help audiences to identify with its miracle baby and mythical promised land themes.<br/><br/>In 2027 the youngest person is only eighteen years old, and is killed after being asked for an autograph. Clive Owen (who is in every scene) is a disillusioned bureaucrat separated from his long-term partner Julianne Moore who now works for one of a number of resistance groups. She arranges his capture so he can help deliver Kee and her unborn baby to safety.<br/><br/>The scenes of London mix familiarity with desolation, Homeland Security rounding up illegal immigrants into cages and shipping them through a Guantanamo-style holding centre to Bexhill, which has been turned into an enormous refugee camp. Bexhill itself looks more like war-torn Iraq, with various factions, some of them good and many of them not so good, vying for power.<br/><br/>Owen gives a tolerably good performance even if the character looks and sounds like most of his previous roles. Moore, on the other hand, breaks away from her excellent screen personas where she expresses much without words and action, and throws herself into an excellent butt-kicking female militant character. The direction is taut throughout, maintaining tension and shocks as well as some crisply delivered laughs. The plot does meander as the group have numerous adventures to reach their goal, but the gradual and admirable escalation of violence and bloodshed shows a respect for pacing that keeps us on the edge of our seats. Michael Caine puts in a touching supporting performance as an aging hippy caring for his Alzheimer-stricken wife and the scene where Owen turns into a midwife is priceless.<br/><br/>Given the deep issues at stake here, the odd scene suggesting Theodore Faron (Owen) does some soul searching would not have come amiss, but this is a movie crying out for a sequel: could we yet see a more mature approach to this undeniably interesting plot? Pigs do indeed fly, the pig in this episode being an inflatable one over art-enclave Battersea Power Station - Pink Floyd fans should be delighted. When George W Bush assumed power, I recall an American liberal saying they would now start a stopwatch to world war three. In the film, the British Government bomb hundreds of innocents to eliminate insurgents and we hardly notice, playing on our fears to give substance to any hope, no matter how improbable. The credits roll out with an old angst-filled Jarvis Cocker song, (c*nts are still) Running the World."
"csulpw","10","3","11","18 January 2012"," One of the best movies in recent memory
","I've seen Children of Men several times now and it gets better with every viewing. This isn't a hard film to follow, but it is undeniably gorgeous in its portrayal of a bleak and dismal future where humanity has ceased to procreate. <br/><br/>It certainly raised a lot of questions from its premise. What happens when human kind can no longer reproduce? The film begins with the death of the youngest known person in the world. Younger people are cast as celebrities due to their rarity. The film is set in England and we see the negative effect this would have on society. People are depressed, the economy is in the tank, immigrants are harshly deported, and humanity seems to be nearing an end. The film even hints at catastrophic wars across major city centers around the globe.<br/><br/>Several sides are presented here. The English government is rounding up immigrants and placing them in concentration camps or deporting them, terrorist organizations are resisting and plotting their own uprisings, and a mysterious organization called the Human Project is researching the reproductive phenomenon offshore. <br/><br/>Clive Owen's character, Theo, is brought into the fold when his ex wife Julian (played by Julianne Moore), asks him to escort a girl out of the country that her terror organization is protecting. The back and forth is handled well. Julian dies and Theo is asked to protect the girl, Kee, at all costs. He learns she is pregnant and that handing her over to the government or his wife's organization would be a bad idea as both sides would use her to further their agendas. The rest that follows is intense and well thought-out. Theo eventually gets Kee to the Human Project after finding himself in a war between both sides. <br/><br/>The performances and minor touches in this film drew me into its world. Michael Caine (Jasper) played a great part as a hippie father-figure to Theo. I won't hear Ruby Tuesday the same way ever again after having watched those scenes. The music portrayed in the movie (as in the confines of the world) was this brash screaming concoction and I felt the writers did some research to imagine what music may sound like in the future (also representative of the depression and angst people faced, so that was a nice touch). Other things like the cars and some of the interfaces were really neat as well.<br/><br/>Technically, the action scenes were enormously complex and gritty. Children of Men features several composite shots that need to be seen regardless of anything else. The scene everyone talks about is the fight at the end of the film. This shot spans 6 min of unbroken filming and it's truly a masterpiece in editing and execution. <br/><br/>I am a big fan of post-apocalyptic films and Children of Men looks at things a little differently. It's not famine, planetary resources, or overpopulation that leads to humanity's end, but our loss of procreation, the most important resource for our survival. The atmosphere was spot on and perhaps more realistic than most scenarios that threaten to end our existence. This movie places up there with my favorites."

"thebengalimafia-1","10","3","11","18 February 2008"," The Best film of 2006!
","In the year 2027, the world has gone 18 years without the birth of a child. It's a bitter place and the only place left standing in one piece (according to the British media) is England. Theo (Clive Owen) is asked by his ex-wife to help a young fugee (British slang for refugee) named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) get to the coast. Imagine his bewilderment when he finds out she's pregnant.<br/><br/>I found that the visual storytelling of Children of Men raises implications on three levels; social, political, and religious. The social implications on a world without children are the most obvious. Everyone in England is bitter, drunk, and sometimes both. British police treat people like animals, locking them up in cages; even the buildings look haggard as if they were people too. Because there are no children, the world has no hope for survival. As Jasper (Michael Cain) notes, ""bloody Government hands out suicide kits but ganja is still illegal!"" There even television ads for the suicide kits (called Quietus) that say ""You decide when."" I found this bit of dark humor first class.<br/><br/>There isn't much dialogue in terms of the political implications but the visual imagery and iconography are non stop. The reason Theo, Kee, and the rebel group Kee was apart of can't make the pregnancy pubic is because Kee is a refugee and she also happens to be black. The rebel group known as the Fishes is afraid that the world's first baby in eighteen years would never be accepted as the child of a black woman. They hint at the possibility that maybe the British government would cover up the real birth mother and make it look like the baby was born from a white woman. The fugees are hunted down in the country's crackdown in illegal immigration. Britain has its own Department of Homeland Security, mirroring that of the United States. The film makes countless references to the US with special regards to the treatment of unlawful enemy combatants (a term that applies all too accurately in Guantanamo Bay). One of the most chilling (and uncut) scenes in the film; British soldiers line up refugees and strip them naked. They then put black bags over their heads. As the camera moves further right, we see a row of dead bodies; naked and black bagged. The most obvious reference to the use of torture is a brief shot of a man wearing a hood over his head with his arms spread out, standing on a box; a blatant portrayal of Satar Jabar, the real life torture victim at Abu Ghraib in Baghdad.<br/><br/>I've always said that movies like Children of Men require more thinking than most other films. This isn't Rush Hour or Mr. and Mrs. Smith. This isn't a Bollywood film. What I'm saying is, this isn't ""leave your brain at home"" cinema. So frankly, people who watch (and relish) the aforementioned films/genre are unlikely to pick up on the fact that Theo and Kee are made to represent a modern day incarnation of Joseph and the Virgin Mary.<br/><br/>There were several examples of the imagery we associate with Jesus. Jesus was born in a manger. Kee reveals her pregnancy to Theo in a barn and she is standing in front of a manger and Theo is standing next to one. When Theo sees this he utters the words Jesus Christ. In fact, every time someone sees the baby from that point on in the film they say Jesus Christ or they make the sign of the cross; Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost. While Kee and Theo are trying to make it to the coast, there is a brief shot where politics and religion collide head on (as they usually do). We see a woman on her knees holding the dead body of her son. This is a direct reference to two famous and infamous images we have become familiar with (with the exception of the Bollywood crowd). The woman holding her son very obviously resembles ""La Pieta""; the Michelangelo sculpture of Mary holding her son Jesus. No doubt, this could also be interpreted as the National Geographic image of the woman holding her dead son during the Yugoslav wars (the Balkans in particular), which was also taken in a manner meant to replicate La Pieta.<br/><br/>All this might be a bit overwhelming. I take my knowledge for granted sometimes. Some of you might be asking, ""So the baby is Jesus being reborn?"" I don't think so. But one thing is for sure, after 18 years without children the world is miserable. With no hope for children, there is no hope for a future; the world and humanity are doomed. We hear the phrase our whole lives but we take it for granted. ""Jesus Christ, our lord and savior. The baby isn't Jesus; the baby is the savior of humanity. This is Alfonso Cuaron's best film to date and undoubtedly the best film of 2006."

","(No spoilers here, but I write this for who you'll be immediately after you see this movie.)<br/><br/>Movies fulfill in sublime moments, as lives. This delivers well. An unmistakable silence in the middle of mayhem, of awe among the hopeless. In a scene dripping and oozing with metaphor and morale, for parents of grown children, for nations with stale enmities. Pay attention, this isn't a movie you'll want to see twice. Even the shockingly beautiful English countryside (a sensuous curved road through a tall tree forest) impacts most fresh. The movie skillfully delivers in other ways: plot twists that surprise without making too little sense. Character development, from girl to mother, from fool to hero. Oh yes, the violence, tragedy and despair overflow. Urban war intentionally, indelibly palpable. <br/><br/>But in the middle of it all comes a sound. And I'm still not even sure what it was it said exactly, but it spoke to me. What do you think it would feel like to hear for the first time the cry of a baby?"

","I will have to admit, there's nothing like a director finding his place artistically and getting things into gear. The Universal execs screwed this film over with terrible promotion and press, and I still am in outrage over that, even more so after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>The story is known : Theo (Clive Owen), a disillusioned ex-activist, exists in a bleak future where humanity has been rendered sterile and the country exists in a state of great depression wherein refugees are segregated and dragged into camps that eerily resemble Auschwitz. His only friend is Jasper (Michael Caine) and his immobile wife. Theo's life changes when his lover Julian (Julianne Moore) requests him take a young girl, Kee, out of this country for protection.<br/><br/>The first thing that stands out is the incredible cinematography. The camera truly works like a brush on the easel of film-making in the capable hands of Emmanual Lubezki, and the future as presented to us in this film seems even more stark, real and gritty thanks to the great camera work.<br/><br/>The sets, the dialogue, the outstanding supporting cast and the fast-paced editing keeps this film - whose plot about a dystopian future may cause some people to dismiss it as the usual tripe - taut, thought-provoking and entertaining. It is refreshing indeed to see some smart film-making being done nowadays. This film is one of the highlights of 2006, and should be remembered as a modern classic."

","Gritty, dark, heavy, deep, real, and I can't over-emphasize the word real. There are just a few, and an extremely limited few adjectives that I would use to describe this movie. ""Children of Men"" is rich with symbolism, not too much unlike the movie ""V for Vendetta"", but many times better. Where ""V for Vendetta"" was an artsy poetic way of depicting a grim future, ""Children of Men"" took a more direct, realistic, in your face route. I had to ask myself was I watching a movie about the future of the western world or present day Iraq, Palestine, or Afghanistan? <br/><br/>This may very well have been an extremist view of the future, but it was presented in such a gripping and veritable manner that it could not be dismissed as fiction or extremism. The war scenes were done so magnificently, they were like an embedded cameraman was following one of the battle participants. The fight scenes were captured in such a realistic manner that at one point the camera lens even had blood and dirt on it. But more important than the visual capturing of the happenings of this movie are the emotions and atmosphere captured through the happenings on screen. A lot of focus was placed upon immigration, terrorism, and of course, Islam's role in it all. It really posed the question of what was doing more harm: the immigrants and the ""terrorists"" (who could range from mere protesters on up to actual gun wielding killers) or the government and the laws and practices they put in place. Without doubt, Kee's child was a symbol of hope for all of humanity. With darkness, infertility, and hopelessness all around, a single woman was able to give birth after 18 years of no known births. So, even as tormenting and utterly depressing the future was, hope did exist. Whereas this movie showed the perilous route mankind is on and the fateful demise we could meet, it also showed that there is always hope. As one of the interviewees in the bonus features stated, hope exists when there is despair."
"Anonaman","10","3","11","5 June 2007"," Destined to be a classic
","Children of Men is a masterpiece, but it is not easy to watch. The violence and tension is relentless, and the movie is so well filmed and edited that you can't help but be swept along. The reward is as emotional as it is cerebral  you are forced to ponder just how valuable life is, despite humanities wholesale disregard of it.<br/><br/>The movie supposes that at some point in the near future, humanity stops having babies. The reason is never explained, and is a mystery to the characters as well. The effects were disastrous. 18 years later, we find the lead character Theo, a disillusioned office worker and former activist, just trying to survive.<br/><br/>Religious groups across the world have declared the absence of babies to be punishment from god. Some try to do penance by self-flagellation, others cause uprisings. Governments have fallen across the world, and Britain (the setting) is holding on by a thread. Resorting to a fascist state, the main function of the government now seems to be oppression of immigrants, and battling various terrorist groups.<br/><br/>Theo is unwillingly drawn into the conflict by his ex-wife, Julian, who never left activism and now runs a quasi terrorist group bent on gaining rights for immigrants. Theo's brother is a high ranking government official, and Julian wants Theo to get papers and help escort a young woman out of the country. The kicker? The young woman is pregnant.<br/><br/>What should be a simple smuggling trip turns nightmarishly complex, as factions from all sides seek to control the mother for their own purposes. The sheer disregard shown for life by these factions is all the more shocking because they are supposedly trying to protect a life. Along the way we can't help but be reminded just how precious life is  and how fragile."

It's like ""War of the Worlds"" done by a Brit. We are spared nothing. It's one long, slow slide into despair and chaos.<br/><br/>The most affecting scene for me were the torture chambers at the refugee camps with people having their clothes stripped off in lines at gun point. The camera makes a long, slow point in this sequence, hovering first over men kneeling with the arms clasped behind their heads, then people tied up in cages, then rows of people being marched around in circles, then rows of naked bodies. None of it's done with slick sci-fi technology, it's just the same old techniques on display across the news everywhere these days.<br/><br/>Nothing works properly in this society.

The terrorists motives are entirely understandable but they are so totally wrong-headed in everything they do that they're doomed from the outset.<br/><br/>SPOILER The minute Jasper walked on-screen I knew he was completely doomed.

I think it's convincing because it's currently extraordinarily fashionable to wallow and the wallowers are easily convinced of a sort of indefinable inevitability. Especially if you're fiscally comfortable.<br/><br/>Personally, I disapprove of this wallowing, and the entire film's awash with it. So, although as an exercise in stylish, grey-minded, desaturation-filtered wallowing it deserves the full ""10"", as a *film*... I can't say it's all that good.<br/><br/>This film has many serious axes to grind, and worthy axes they are too and long due a sharpening...but I have a nasty feeling the film-maker doesn't know which end of an axe is supposed to be the sharp one..."

","In 2027, humans have lost the ability to procreate. It has been 18 years since the last child came into the world and no one understands why. Earth faces extinction if a miracle doesn't arrive soon.<br/><br/>The world is in complete chaos. The rich have everything and the poor sit in cages waiting for some unknown fate. Our protagonist is a man called Theo (Clive Owen), who finds himself working for an anti- government organization called the Fishes. He is paid to transport a young woman (Kee) out of England, to something called the Human Project.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) is pregnant. Is the human race finally saved or will Kee be killed before reaching safety? Theo sets out on a journey to save Kee and possibly the world.<br/><br/>Children of Men is what I would call an intelligent and philosophical science fiction movie. It doesn't waste time on the technology of the future (except perhaps in a couple of scenes) instead it focuses all its time on its story. In this movie, the future is bleak and there is little (if any) hope. Most have given up and give little thought on tomorrow. What is important is now today. For them the world is about surviving. Kee is different. She represents hope and perhaps a future. To emphasize this, at the end of the movie, the boat that comes to get her is called Tomorrow. A little cheesy, but since it is the only cheesy part of this movie, I can easily accept it.<br/><br/>While it is tempting to compare the baby with Jesus, the film makes no such claim. In fact, when Theo asks who the father is, Kee makes a joke that she is a virgin. She is not a virgin and her child is no Jesus. The big question is, what will happen when the world learns that a baby has been born?<br/><br/>The setting is very believable. It is gray and dirty, a strange mix of plasma screens (ads and warnings), graffiti, filth and broken down buildings. The colors are certainly meant to enforce the bleakness of the world. We know that something has happened because old newspaper articles proclaim that a nuclear war had broken out, but other than that, it isn't a part of the story. Perhaps the cause of the childless world is radiation, perhaps it is just the way of nature. A curse on mankind, because animals certainly don't have that problem.<br/><br/>The movie is all its own and I find it hard (if not impossible) to find any other movie that has directly influenced it. Most science fiction stories are about characters surviving, but in Children of Men, it is not just a story about Theo and Kee, it is a story about all mankind.<br/><br/>(small personal note: I can't mention this movie without also mentioning Michael Caine. He is a very cool actor and his role in this movie (Jaspar), while small, is one of his absolute best. He is one of the few hopefully people of the world and makes sure that you will laugh at least once during this movie.)"
"simplisticreviewsblogspo","10","2","6","14 March 2013"," The Epitome of Sci-Fi
","Review by Matt:<br/><br/>Lately in film, especially futuristic sci-fi fare, the preferred city of devastation is London. It used to be that Godzilla would stomp Japan into oblivion, but of course we all know that giant lizards bred out of nuclear irresponsibility is completely far-fetched, right? But putting fantasy away, London has been a hub the past decade or so for apocalyptic visions of the future. From Rage viruses to an infertility pandemic, I'm not sure ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" would be enough for even London's strongest citizens to get behind. This brings me to 2006's ""Children of Men"" one of the most captivating sci-fi films to be released in recent memory.<br/><br/>Here's the scoop; we visit London in the not too distant future where there hasn't been a reported new birth in nearly 18 years. Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, the youngest person in the world, lovingly named Baby Diego, has just been murdered. With the world in mourning, we follow happy-go-lucky Theo, played by Clive Owen. Theo is the type of guy that loves to get high with his hippy friend Jaspar and get kidnapped by a terrorist group called ""The Fishes"" led by his former activist wife, Julian, played by Julianne Moore. The plot thickens when it's discovered that Theo is carrying some precious cargo, namely a baby in the belly of a young refugee girl named Kee. With the government, crooked cops, and members of the terrorist group hot on his heels, Theo has no choice but to protect Kee and try and deliver her to The Human Project, a mysterious group researching why humanity become infertile so many years ago.<br/><br/>""Children"" went largely unnoticed during its theatrical run, which is odd for how good this film really is. The acting is spot on, the setting couldn't feel more real, and the message is relatively universal. Sure, there are some preachy moments, and even some of the imagery and names are obvious, case in point, the young girl Kee, (even though it's technically pronounced ""chi"") who just might be the ""key"" to civilization's survival. But those are minor quibbles.<br/><br/>Directed by Alfonso Cuaron, who some might know for ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" or to an even wider audience as the director the best Harry Potter film installment ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."" Some might disagree with that assessment of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, but it was the moment that the series went from light-hearted and childish to dark, brooding, and serious.<br/><br/>Cuaron lends that trademark style to ""Children"" and creates a dystopian London where all hope seems to be lost, refugees are treated like Jews during World War II, and ethnic tensions are slowly coming to a head. With all of that being said, Cuaron is still able to capture small glimmers of hope in a hopeless world, and some humanity in some of the more monstrous characters. But the highlights of the film revolve around the long take action sequences which last upwards of 6 minutes. Even though it has been debunked that these scenes are not one long take, the fact remains that these scenes highlight the film and create the most memorable moments in ""Children.""<br/><br/>Despite the fact ""Children"" was critically praised, the fact it didn't bank more at the box office was a crime in and of itself. It's also a movie I'm always shocked people have never seen; at that moment I slap them in the face, hand them the DVD, and bid them Godspeed.<br/><br/>Check out other reviews at simplisticreviews.blogspot.com"
"irtsoup","10","2","6","8 December 2011"," Great Film, Awesome Cinematography, so many Rants
","I just watched Children of Men on TV, for the fourth or fifth time and I wanted to read the reviews on IMDb just out of curiosity. Most of them are highly praising, but there are a LOT of them burying the movie. Much has been said about the virtues and drawbacks of Children of Men. I think it's easily one of the best films of 2006, at least. I especially loved the grim atmosphere and the fantastic camera work, which gives you the impression of watching a war documentary and not a movie.<br/><br/>On this review, I will stand on the haters, that are focusing on lots of things, like the non plausibility of the story. God, it's science fiction, the story tells you that women are infertile no-matter-what, you take it for granted, end of story. It's not Discovery Channel. Science fiction, is by definition exploring the fiction with a touch of science, it's not science only. Others hate the camera work, but that's just a matter of taste. Camera works well in my eyes and perception, it's a matter of aesthetics. And the documentary-like feeling, fits awesome into the whole atmosphere. Some other guys said: ""how can a single baby revert the situation and make women fertile again?"". True, but in the movie it's never stated that this child would be the Messiah: it's just a hope, nothing more nothing less.This is why this film is so good, it leaves the viewer wondering about things like: ""Will this child be the answer?"" or ""What if this Human Project is another organization like Fish?"" or ""Presumably this baby is the solution to infertility, will the world become a better place or is it already too late?"". These questions make this film deep: the urge to ask yourself ""What if?"". Anyway, haters are gonna hate, but I find it greatly unjust for a movie that had a great cast with really humane behaviors like any other regular guy, approached all action scenes entirely different than Hollywood would and provided a simplistic theme-story, so that everyone could relate to, to be ditched that way."

","IMDb Top 250: 221<br/><br/>That is what comes to mind when I watched this movie, and that's a very good thing. Alfonso Cuaron has created a very believable future in this original and unique movie.<br/><br/>From the beginning, this is a film like few others. It successfully creates a weighty atmosphere, where everything is necessary. The people in the coffee shop aren't extras in Theo's way, they're concerned civilians. Ads aren't there to create an urban feel, they let you know about the situation. And the gunfights and explosions make you feel right in the scene, something few other films can accomplish.<br/><br/>In an unsettling way, this vision of the future is nervously close. Small technological advancements have occurred, but this isn't the Jetsons. It seems like this scenario could happen next year, which puts the thought in your mind, ""Could something like this happen?"" As said before, the plot is original. No babies, no kids, no future. But there is one, and it's up to Theo to bring her to safety, with obstacles on the way. With the adventure-for-safety plot, the scary future Britian, and a very realistic shooting style, you can see the similarities with 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Two issues with the plot: one, I'm not sure if I missed it (the talking is awfully quiet) but I don't quite know what the 'Fish' organization is fighting for. Until we learn about what they did to a major character, there's no reason to think they deserve to be called terrorists. Second, and this is only my opinion, but I thought the film ended too soon, without a chance to see what the future brings. Some might like that, I found it a little cheap. How can one birth change fertility worldwide? I can see Alfonso didn't want to delve into the science of it all, but maybe some explanation would make a very good plot great.<br/><br/>Clive Owen does a great job, maybe his best, as the chauffeur-for-hire to protector of the future hero type. He was well casted as the modern, rough around the edges guy trying to get by.<br/><br/>The direction here is phenomenal. The camera shots successfully make you feel the tension and danger of apocalyptic Britian. The entire scene from the Russian shelter to the dock was amazing, as well as the car ambush.<br/><br/>Overall, Children of Men succeeds in telling its story of hope, while making you think of our own fragile future. With likable characters, thrilling moments and amazing realism, Children of Men is one of the best movies of the new millennium. 9.0/10"

"ackstasis","9","2","6","19 February 2009"," ""Very odd, what happens in a world without children's voices""
","It's been just over two years since first I saw 'Children of Men (2006),' and I'm still utterly blown away by it. Alfonso Cuarón's cautionary science-fiction tale, the finest film of 2006, is not only a masterclass in technical film-making, but also, and above all else, a 100-minute roller-coaster ride that doesn't let up its intensity until the final frames. This decade has, all things considered, been a pretty good one for science-fiction, and numerous directors have brought forth their own intriguing visions of the future. Many, like Alex Proyas' 'I, Robot (2004)' or Michael Bay's 'The Island (2005)' were determinedly bright and dazzling. Stephen Spielberg's 'Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001)' and 'Minority Report (2002)' were largely optimistic, but also noticeably alluded to a darker underbelly. Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later (2003),' whatever my thoughts about the film itself, depicted a frightening and morally-barren post-apocalyptic Britain. The animated 'Renaissance (2005)' took the classic neo-noir route, channelling the artistic style of 'Blade Runner (1982).'<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuarón's despairing vision of the future is frightening, not because of how much the world appears to have been changed, but because it feels like only one step ahead from where we are now. Just as Spielberg reproduced horrific images of the September 11 terrorist attacks to give immediacy to the alien invasion in 'War of the Worlds (2005)' {Tom Cruise emerges from the initial attack covered in a smothering white powder}, Cuarón too plunders our own unstable political climate to predict a bleak, oppressive future for future generations  if, indeed, there are to be any. At a concentration camp at Bexhill, there stands the infamous ""hooded man"" of the shameful Ghraib Prison scandal. A coffee shop bombing recalls the devastating July 2005 London bombings, and decades of IRA terrorist attacks. Cuarón seems to be suggesting that the capacity for human depravity is already present in modern society; it would take only a single unexpected tragedy  such as an epidemic of infertility  to finally push our ""dominant"" race over the edge into genuine, unbridled barbarity.<br/><br/>Clive Owen isn't a leading man typically known for his versatility, but here his flatness is put to good use. Over the years, many actors have attempted to duplicate the weary-eyed laziness of Robert Mitchum, and Owen's Theo is a strong attempt, a disillusioned nobody who finally finds something to hope and fight for in Mankind's future. Able support is provided by Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor, but the real star of the film is Emmanuel Lubezki's dynamic camera. Entire set-pieces are played out in single takes (though much post-production splicing took place), and, unlike other recent efforts such as the Dunkirk beach sequence in 'Atonement (2007),' these long shots actively propel the film's plot. Indeed, on first viewing, it wasn't until afterwards that I realised the sheer extensiveness of the technique's use. The extended takes, in a similar manner to Hitchcock's clever usage in 'Rope (1948),' place the viewer in a unique position: not only that of a voyeur, but of an active participant."
"piksplanet","9","2","6","1 January 2009"," hope.
","The closing credits of Children Of Men starts with the laughter of children, echoing a line spoken in the film itself - 'Very odd, what happens in a world without children's voices'. That line itself sums up the shocking nature of the film. This is not make believe science fiction. This is not human beings turning into zombies due to some drug. This is the slow death of the human race. This is humanity which has not heard a child's voice in almost two decades. This is chaos. This is disorder. This is dystopia. And amidst all that, this is hope.<br/><br/>Children Of Men sports all the characteristics of an action-packed science fiction film with its outstandingly orchestrated long and drawn-out single-shot action sequences, it's grim setting, the hinted darkness which is present throughout the length of the film, the beautifully grim and dead and at the same time uplifting background score and soundtrack. It is all that, and it is more. Within, lies hope. Lies faith. Lies redemption. Woven together with spellbinding perfection by director Alfonso Cuaron, Children Of Men is an apocalyptic film that raises the bar for films of the genre.<br/><br/>Based on P.D.James' 1992 novel of the same name, Children Of Men is an extremely well-written and well choreographed piece of cinema. The screenplay, most of the credit for which goes to Alfonso Cuaron and Timothy J. Sexton is an absolute gem. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography takes you to an entire different level in the art of film-making. The action sequences are brilliant. The picturisation, perfect. It is a relatively small film supporting an immense story. At an hour and forty four minutes, it never ceases to be jaw-dropping.<br/><br/>The year is 2027. It has been almost twenty years since the birth of the last human being. Starting of with the death of the youngest living human on earth, we are thrown into a world of turmoil. A world where human beings are grasping onto whatever hope they might have left. People are glued to the telecast airing the death of the youngest living human on earth. And hope, it seems, is fading away, ever so slowly. What Cuaron succeeds in doing at point blank is something we have already witnessed in some science fiction films of the decade. It is the same as what Spielberg did in The War of The Worlds, it is the same as what Abrams did in Cloverfield. We are tossed into the middle of a horrific crisis with no hope whatsoever of question or recovery. It takes us a few minutes to realize what exactly is going on. And therein lies the genius that makes this film brilliant.<br/><br/>The films boasts of some fine performances by Clive Owen and Michael Caine. Michael Caine, there for only a few sequences is a treat to watch. Oana Pellea, who plays Marichka the gypsy deserves special mention. She plays the character, who perhaps, gives you a feeling of hope. She cannot communicate much, yet she goes out of her way in order to help out as much as she can.<br/><br/>Children Of Men is simply a treat to watch. It is a film that will put you on the edge of your seat. It is a film that will get your heart racing. It will get you involved. There will be scenes that will shock you, scare you, awe you. And all to show you something even greater. Something even more important. You will feel the pain. You will feel the fear. You will feel the helplessness. You will feel the human race clawing for a grip at the edge of humanity. And at the end of it all, there will be hope.<br/><br/>Hope."

The cinematography is some of the best ever captured. It has amazing long-shots, that really transport you inside the film. <br/><br/>Children of Men is a visual masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi films ever made"

","... although I don't quite get what it's about, apart from the obvious. I'll give it a whopping 10 stars out of 10, just for being so radically different from the usual sterile and/or infantile crap on screen, especially in fiction films.<br/><br/>Most fans of the book appear to be disappointed with the movie. One commenter praised the book as ""profoundly religious"", which to me isn't exactly an appetizing label  rather the opposite. Instead, speeches and moral statements are totally absent from the film, realism and immediacy rule. The film does a very nice job in bringing its one (ligitimate) ""religious"" issue across: the miracle of human procreation. If it has a message, it is: Down with racism, blind faith and intolerance, Stop killing each other, and Try Not To F**k Up Humanity. Thankfully, these ""messages"" are implied and not preached with finger-pointing. The action benefits from leaving much to the attention of the viewer, rather than explaining loose beginnings or ends. A good fiction film is like getting thrown into strange and murky waters and enjoying the drift. So those interested in the whole story will surely watch it over, or buy the book.<br/><br/>It's a wonder this thing avoided the Hollowwood swamps of stereotypes and platitudes! Its saving grace must be in the down-to-earth ""British touch"" and/or the director's Mexican heritage. I wouldn't believe this same director made ""Harry Potter"", but documentaries  yes, definitely. The creators deserve praise not only for the realistic representation of shabbiness, squalor and violence, but for showing us believable human beings, which is a rare thing especially in ""action"" films.<br/><br/>All in all, nine stars for the experience, and one for the guts to make something that's surely not to everybody's taste."
"fuzileer","9","2","6","4 November 2008"," For the 1 star ratings...
","I am extremely surprised to see that there are so many people who give this movie a one star rating. I suppose this film is a ""marmite"" film - either you love it or you hate it.<br/><br/>What the negatives fail to understand is that this is Hollywood Filming and we don't need all the questions we ask answered. The movie itself starts off by stating that there's nobody left on the planet under the age of 18. It doesn't answer why this is the case, and I think all the better for it. If they did answer it, the film would have no plot at all. Films are here to entertain us and make us think about certain situations that could arise and how the world would react to it. Although the fact that there's no children at all in the world may seem far-fetched, but we're supposed to believe this is the norm because that is what the narrative tells us to believe. The film's description says that there's no children left on earth, so you go into a cinema full well expecting that to happen and not question it. So if you don't believe it, it's your own stupid fault and have no reason to bring that matter up.<br/><br/>As an overall film, this is a great film. A powerful cast brings a realistic performance that is incredible in every aspect. Michael Cain's performance is legendary, he really does fill it well. I won't go into the film as a whole, however, since this really is one of those movies where you have to watch it through without any hints towards the events that follow. The only real concern I had was that I wasn't exactly sure why they decide to leave the country in the first place, but I probably overlooked that bit whilst watching.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film - definitely worth seeing."
"beregic","10","2","6","23 April 2008"," a both visual and content rich masterpiece
","this, to me , is a MUST HAVE in my collection( i can say i had been watching it 4 times already). why? well here it goes: lets start from beginning. ever since about 7-8 years ago i started watching more and more British features or co-productions and i find them more and more superior to Hollywood ones for various reasons but especially because the realistic subject matter generally found throwout.even the horror genres deals with real possibilities. it reminds me of the ""british invasion"" when it came to music, a few decades back. well now would be something similar when it comes to plot developments and not only.<br/><br/>so this is the reason i picked up this one, already with high expectations. usually that does not work because the higher the expectations the bigger the disappointment can generally get. based on reviews i was expecting something like a ""post- apocalyptic"" movie like ""28 weeks later"" for example. but just after about 2-3 minutes in i was GLUED in until the end , something rarely happening to me. if want to exercise your own perceptions of reality, with a bit of imagination as well, then this is 110% for you.<br/><br/>the movie is so RICH IN DETAILS, there are so many things going on with many visual subplots beside the main one which basically consists of focus on Clive Owen character. ALL the characters present in the movie give real substances , enhancing the normality vibe given by the MOST MODERN POST-REALISTIC camera directions ever to be captured on film in recent memory. at times you even feel like watching a historical documentary of events ALREADY past. yet the movie keeps moving forward with such speed that might require a second viewing ( there is only one scene in an abandoned park where i feel it slows down but even that one is essential to answer a few ""why"" and ""how""'s). the dialogs are generally VERY witty especially between Clive Owen character and his ""old man"". the level of desperation is such on a high note that the whole story becomes over the optimistic(in an emotional manner without giving ""suggestions"") when the ""discovery"" is made. great play in direction with human emotions, BUT again lets aside, as it should do, the ""fear"" factor ( as i keep noticing those more and more in the Hollywood features).Clive Owen gives the his best ever performance in my opinion as a broken man in an already, long-ago, broken world and without hope.the movie does not offer answers and especially not suggesting ones; the evolution of both mind and matter will take care of that regardless of what everyone's understanding of ""faith"" leads them to be believe onto or not. salvation can take many forms both physical but most clearly at a spiritual level.<br/><br/>the one thing that stands out for me is the whole political take alas George Orwell style. in a way the whole movie looks as an ""update "" to ""brazil-1985"". it is very rich on takes on human conditions. the scenes where Clive Owen visits his cousin( the minister of art) is absolutely chilling and gives the whole movie a dimension of need for righteous hope that is not ""made up"" out of desperation, but of evolution. also the whole movie stands out as a PRESENT TIME SATIRE to give a clear IMAGINE where humanity is driven to by the present social-POLITIC climate of having political correctness as the ""ideal"" goal for an eventual world full of smiles and submissions, but completely empty of any instinctual individualistic hope.<br/><br/>also important to mention is the fact that this feature manages to engage all age groups and even past and, possible future, generations. also worth to mention the presence of other well know foreign actors that portrays the characters belonging to various ethnic back rounds, colors and cultures. something of a melting plot that goes very well in sustaining the present realistic trends of global ""meltdown"".<br/><br/>from an entertaining point of view, this movie delivers as well RAW action scenes. it seems that NO cgi effects were used at all but the realism in brutality is such jaw-breaking to me. those scenes , in-between create a truly REALISTIC apocalyptic background. issues regrading real terrorism perpetuated even in a more gruesome way by a government out of touch with reality in times when ideology is the only thing that keeps all sides going nowhere but to sudden-death.<br/><br/>all in all together i doubt that there would be someone completely disappointed with this production in itself, at least in style, development and well defined content regardless of ethics and morals on display."
"freaky_dave","10","2","6","20 April 2007"," Disturbing and incredibly well made
","Children of Men was a wonderful film. Alfonso Cuaron delivers another intelligent thriller here. It's a movie that is disguised as an action film but contains science fiction elements as well.<br/><br/>It's the year 2027. For the past 18 years, mankind has been unable to reproduce. This of course has led to a lot of terrorism and violence. Only Britain has any kind of government left. The rest of the world is in chaos. This film reminded me a lot of V For Vendetta in creating what seems to be the final days that must be changed for the better. This time however we don't have a vigilante trying to get the people to step up against their corrupt government. Instead we have one Theo Faron (Clive Owen), who seems to be no real hero at first. He is given the assignment by his former lover (Julianne Moore) to help get the only pregnant girl left in the world to the safety of a sanctuary on a boat where scientists can study her pregnancy and find away to save mankind. Of course there are obstacles along the way, including betrayal that I won't discuss here, and that is the plot of the story. Will Theo, with the help of certain rebels, manage to get the pregnant girl to the boat safely, or will he fail. You have to watch it and see what happens.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was phenomenal. Clive Owen looks scrappy at first and not like somebody that can help get a pregnant girl to safety. He pulls his part off quite nicely. Michael Caine, as an old bearded friend of Theo's, and looking much like a 60s hippie here, also manages to steal every scene that he is in. The other actors were good as well.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a gritty looking film with some great editing sequences, and some terrifying images that will stay with you for awhile. It also contains some haunting images of a future that might be closer to the truth then we realize. A great film all around, with a pace that never becomes boring, Children Of Men is highly recommended. I would also consider it one of the best films of the year."

","I really had never heard of this movie until i read it in the paper, and the local movie reviewer (Dan DiNicola) gave it an A- which is outstanding from his standpoint. I don't normally agree with his grades and taste in movies but i figured i'd give it a try because i had liked previous Alfonso Cuaron movies. And i'm happy to say it was well worth the hour trip to the nearest theater playing it. It was informative and it had a dangerous portrayal of our near future. It really made me think after I watched it. Clive Owen gives a very strong performance and has etched himself in my mind of new up and coming actors that will be legends in the end. Cuaron also made this movie very well, mixing in the right amount of drama and suspense to keep me interested. There were some very memorable scenes, like the birth scene in the old hotel room. One that has reached the top of the charts in my book. Over all a very fulfilling experience, and very much worth watching for any fan of movies."
"spockwillow","4","2","6","1 April 2007"," Sadly predictable and underwhelming
","Children of Men has such positive press and often positive reviews that I actually bought the DVD without renting it. So it was with great anticipation that I settled in to enjoy this critically acclaimed movie. Sadly at the end of it I lamented losing 90+ minutes of my life I will never get back along with the 20 bucks of which I will only be able to re-coup a couple dollars of when I sell this DVD. So P.D. James's story on the surface of a world in which there are no children being born is interesting. Clive Owen and Julianne Moore are fine actors, but this movie cannot figure out if it is a Mad Max type story or not. There are interesting references from the future back to the near future which is fun to work through. While they have been done before they are entertaining. Nonetheless this is a movie that has almost no suspense. You can definitely predict the ending from the moment a late term pregnant women is discovered. I never thought for one second that the child would not survive. It was a coin toss on the the mother or Owen's character to make it. A few decent chase scenes but the overall movie left a lot to be desired. There was so much more there for the taking that was not addressed. I was disappointed."

"oddvincent","10","2","6","28 January 2007"," Well Done Dystopic
","There's nothing I like better than a good dystopic and this pic has its dystopia down pat. Set in a near future that has seen the death of the world's children and a pandemic of infertility the film moves deliberately forward to the inevitable great hope, about which I'll say no more, across a sad grayscape of loss and despair and survivor's guilt and survivor's humor.<br/><br/>I was so happy to see Michael Caine's jolly little performance here because, while he's always an asset (except in movies such as Bewitched which appear to render assets an impossibility), I was beginning to wonder if he still had any life, any vibrancy left in him after seeing him in some of his recent, more quiet roles.<br/><br/>I was also extremely impressed (and relieved -- because I always want very much to like the movie I'm watching, after all) by the fact that this film, while out of necessity relying on certain conventions of the action and science fiction genres manages, when some of its protagonists are ""on the run"" to avoid devolving into the usual chase/fight/wisecrack scenes as too many potentially good films do (The Island, for example, which peaked early and went south fast.), but instead shifts gears during the fugitve segment to resolve the pursuit by way of a (correctly) dreary sequence of urban combat on a near-documentary level of reality suffused with the sense of a clumsy, desperately stumbling struggle to live and maybe live better.<br/><br/>I'd like to tell you why I liked the ending, but I don't like spoilers when they can be avoided, but I will say that I like both types endings to pictures with dystopian settings. I like a hopeful dystopia if it's accomplished correctly, without hypersentimentality because such a work causes me to think: Yes, that's us, it's bad, but somehow we'll always make it because of the potential that's inside each and every one of us. And I like a hopeless dystopia, if it's accomplished correctly and without excessive heavy-handedness because such a work makes me think: Yep. That's us. We've screwed things up to the point where everything we do to try to make things better can only screw them up more and sooner or later we'll be the death of us.<br/><br/>Anyway, I liked this film because it made me think: That's us."
"cbent","10","2","6","27 January 2007"," Unbelievable! This is an incredible movie but not for everyone
","Unbelievable! I just want to say that this was one of the most intense movie experiences I've ever had. A masterful movie on so many levels that I don't know where to start. Yes, the performances were all great and Clive Owen restores my faith in the casting of leading men. And yes, the movie has an important message about our current state of affairs as much as the affairs 20 years from now. And of course, the action scenes are among the most creative and heart stopping I've ever seen and will no doubt be copied to death in the years to come. These are all good reasons to see the movie but they are not what make this movie truly great in my mind. What makes this movie outstanding is its honesty and authenticity. Authentic in the big picture: in its depiction of a world in which humanity is faced with its eventual extinction. A gray and dismal life in London under totalitarian dictatorship based on the fear of illegals, and the rest of the world descending into anarchy and chaos, yet people still go to work and bet at the racetrack. Life goes on, albeit for only a short time. Also authentic in the small details: a bomb explodes exactly how it would in real life - no fiery explosion (why does Hollywood need to blow up 1000 gallon gas tanks to make us believe a bomb's impact). Pets are everywhere, I suppose because they are our only substitute for the loss of children. Illegals are rounded up and put in cages while passersby (Theo included) barely notice.<br/><br/>A lot of reviewers were disappointed that the movie didn't go far enough to explain the premise of mass infertility or to explore in more detail its ramifications. I think that's unfair. Why do we need to be hand-fed this information? Rather than get bogged down with the details, the movie just asks us to just go with it. As with the ramifications, I think the movie does enough here to get you going. Connect the rest of the dots yourself. I think the movie's main objective is to put you into Theo's life and follow his story to its conclusion.<br/><br/>For those that think the movie is a major downer. Well, yes it is. In fact my wife came out of the theater and said it was one of the worst movie experiences she's ever had. I know what she means. Its rawness and bleakness and overall vision of the future are tough to take. But what also got to her was its authenticity. It was such a realistic portrayal of a bleak future and how humans would interact in that world that she couldn't discount it like she could other movies that were as violent or bleak. But it's not all bleak. There are true moments of tenderness and compassion that transcend the violence and chaos. Some scenes are so poignant I can't get them out of my mind. Such as the gypsy women helping Kee and Theo escape. She takes the baby so they can get through a tight door and leaves the camera for a few seconds. I'm thinking she's stolen the baby and I'm sure everyone else in that audience is as well even though the director has given us no good reason to suspect her. She comes back of course and in that instance I'm left feeling sheepish for my assumptions (would I have thought this if an English speaking women was in her place or even if she just simply wasn't a ""Gypsy"") and immensely happy and relieved as if this women in that one instance restored my faith in humanity. And of course there is the baby. The film's ending is somewhat ambiguous but in my mind it is hopeful."
"Godluvs123","10","2","6","25 January 2007"," Near Perfect
","I loved this movie. It was incredibly sad, uplifting, funny, tragic...it took me through every human emotion possible. The acting, directing, and cinematography couldn't have been any better. I gave this movie a 10, which I never do because a movie can't be perfect. But this one is pretty darn close. I wouldn't change a thing about it. <br/><br/>I saw it with my sister and she would have liked it to be more uplifting, especially at the end. The uplifting parts are more subtle because of the horrible surroundings, so I didn't mind this. I would compare this movie to War of the Worlds (the Tom Cruise version). So if you liked that movie, consider seeing this one. But if you didn't like WOTW, don't let that put you off seeing this one."
"kento-com","1","2","6","25 January 2007"," Booooring. V for Vendetta is infinitely better.
","I almost left the theater because it was not keeping my attention. I probably dislike the movie even more than I should just because of the undeserved praise it has received. The intended shocking parts are usually predictable, such as the fate of Michael Caine's character and the halt of fighting when the baby is revealed. The camera work is fittingly shaky at moments but also ambiguous in others. It is hard to tell if it is for a desired effect or just bad cinematography. I originally chose the movie only to kill time and its show time coincided with my schedule. I had little expectations going in, which usually drastically improves my opinion of a movie if its any good, but it didn't even fulfill my fix of entertainment. It had potential to be much better. It seems undeveloped as if production was rushed. Again I rate the worst in any rating or poll for this movie because it has way too many supporters. But hell, go see it anyway. You may like it but no one will convince me it is worth a second viewing."
"lucasaq-1","7","2","6","22 January 2007"," A provocative and artistic science fiction thriller.
","I will admit that I am far from the biggest fan of hand-held camera-work. The Bourne Supremacy's shakiness annoyed me to no end and almost ruined a great film for me. Here the camera-work is much better as it serves to make us a player in this provocative and artistic science fiction thriller. It took awhile to get over the initial shakiness, but then my sense of balanced kind of became attuned with the picture being shown.<br/><br/>Now that I have what has been called the greatest part of the picture covered and nothing to great to say about it, well my review would seem to be a downer on this film, but it a ways from it. The film is a top-notch science fiction film with the premise and dystopia society that is shown in the film. Once again like in the year's earlier release, V for Vendetta, the government is putting a full show of strength, but this film takes a few more hits at society, which I don't agree with, but I will let fly for the sake of entertainment. The biggest hit it takes is against immigrant deportation and the guarding of the border. It is a tough issue, but this film shows it in an extremely narrow view. The deportation is shown as brutal, inhumane, and a government cover-up, kick the immigrants out to appease the people. The immigrants are the scapegoats. Perhaps that is one view, but at least show the other side. Well enough politics.<br/><br/>I want to judge this film as science fiction film. It's entertainment value. It is a thrilling film. It is anchored by rugged Clive Owen, who has a problem with keeping his feet covered. He is an unlikely hero. He has lost his cause, his way, his hope, his child. Yet it is he that his former wife, trusts. Julian Moore is great if short in her performance. She is the leader of the group and the group that has found a pregnant woman, but she doesn't trust anyone, especially the government to take the proper care with pregnant woman and her child. It is a desperate situation in a seemingly hopeless world.<br/><br/>Among these dire and uncertain times Alfonso Cuaron, the director, has Owen's father portrayed by hippie Caine who adds a much needed sense of humor to this at times deeply depressing film. Caine is brilliant as usual and quirky although I didn't mind his musical taste.<br/><br/>While I point out all these great things for the film, I must comeback to one other gnawing problem. I had this problem since I saw the trailer. The premise always bugged me with the fact that woman can't conceive babies. The film offers no solution, although, no one seems to know anyways, although Caine offers several suggestions. I had a big pain accepting and buying into this idea, but by the end I had to some degree.<br/><br/>The film is intense thriller with a great sense of where it was, great concept design, great actors, and to some degree strong cinematography. But it had minor flaws here and that that made me question the reality as well as purpose of such a film. I would call this the artistic equivalent of V for Vendetta, which made it slightly better film overall for me because of the actors involved and the great characters they portray."
"charchuk","10","2","6","22 January 2007"," A fantastic achievement
","A classic masterpiece in every possible way, from story to direction to acting to visuals. Given the hype this has built up, I was afraid I would be disappointed, but it more than lived up to my expectations. A brilliant concept heightened by a fantastic execution. One of the best films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>One of the better things about the script is that you never hear exactly why the world has fallen apart. It wouldn't make sense for the characters to explain to each other what everyone already knows, and no explanation is really needed. This is not a straight sci-fi film, it's a war drama in a sci-fi environment. The story, then, focusing on just Theo, is perfect. No long tales of future history are told, only snippets, and that's perfect for this film.<br/><br/>I really can't do justice to the amazing technical aspects of this film. The camera work is simply jaw-dropping, combining long takes with fluid movement, so that one becomes a part of the action without becoming nauseous. The visual effects are great but subtle - similar to Cuarón's Prisoner of Azkaban - and are effective at presenting a believable future society. The music choices are perfect, and the production design is stunning. Not to mention the fantastic direction. There are several shots that had my head spinning. Visually, a superb achievement.<br/><br/>Clive Owen was by far the star of this movie, both as an actor and as his character. His quiet performance contrasts perfectly to the scenes he's in, and it drives the film. All of the other performances are solid - especially Michael Caine and Claire-Hope Ashitey - but this is Owen's film, and he excels. I enjoyed all the little touches to his character - his lack of shoes throughout, his talent with animals - that just add to the greatness of his performance.<br/><br/>I've no doubt this will be remembered in many years time as one of the best films in recent memory, and certainly of 2006. It definitely deserves it."

Maybe I am missing something? I really hope it gets some recognition at the Academy Awards because it definitely deserves it. The acting by all was great. The writing was suspenseful, thrilling, interesting, and socially relevant to many contemporary issues. For me though, I absolutely loved the direction and cinematography, in particular to two scenes (the ambush in the forest and the battle in Bexhill). I just found the way that the camera followed around the action, and the way it was all portrayed was technically genius. I've always loved Shayamalan's usage of extended takes on a shot, but he really needs to take page out of Cuaron's book, because this movie blows anything M. Night has ever done. Well done!"

This is a film that just grabs your attention and doesn't let up until the final moment. And it's a dozen times more interesting than ""Apocalypto"" and the Matrix sequels. From the cinematography to the well-written plot along with top-notch performances from Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Clair Hope (in a breakout role)adds up to a poignant and thrilling experience. I must admit that the film was slow at first, but patience (to this viewer, don't know about anyone else) is rewarded when the story gathers momentum. The film's imagery is superb and the best of any post-apocalyptic film, past and present. Scenes of human misery and decadence are haunting and disturbing.<br/><br/>In contrast to ""28 Days Later"" and other post-apocalyptic films, I suppose some will stay away from this film, which is a shame because its one of the best films of this genre. I suspect that the film may be hitting a little to close to home in their mindset. And they may be right; especially in this day and age where the thought of society on the brink of self-destruction is becoming brought more and more into fruition. The film may be sci-fi in nature, but its sense of verisimilitude is a stark reminder of our chaotic world.<br/><br/>Go see this film and let it give you food for thought. You won't regret it."

Alfonso Cuaron handles the gritty action like a war correspondent's report - with *12 minute* takes and seamlessly realistic violence. With the startling attention to detail - visible in newspaper clippings, sides of buses, propaganda, adverts, television broadcasts, packaging... - it does not feel as if you are watching a film, it feels as if you should be running for you life along with the cast.<br/><br/>This film does not preach. It does not tell you why suddenly, no one can have children, it simply drags you along on a post-apocalyptic, but surprisingly funny, journey with perhaps a glimmer of hope at the end.

We are thrust directly into this bleak future with the announcement of the killing of the youngest man in the world. Shortly thereafter, a building explodes, one in which the protagonist, Theo Faron, has just bought coffee. One minute, a bustling store, the next, rubble. Within ten minutes Cuaron has effectively grabbed hold of the audience, a hold that will remain there throughout this expertly paced film.<br/><br/>Theo is basically directly in the center of a conflict that has been ripping apart the societal fabric of this futuristic world, a conflict between a group of freedom fighters and the government. A Everything is very strictly regulated, but Theo soon discovers something that will change the fabric of the society. A woman named Kee is pregnant, a woman whom Theo must safely transport to a safe haven known as the human project, where scientists can possibly use the miraculous birth to figure out why women are infertile, and maybe even find a cure.<br/><br/>Cuaron is not interested in the miracle of why this woman is pregnant. He is not interested in exactly how the world came to be such a horrible place because women are infertile. He is more interested in, as many critics have put it, presenting this story as a cautionary tale. There is some very deep and powerful societal commentary in Children of Men. This is not a film about how much the world has changed. One of the things that makes it so frightening as that the kind of oppression seen in Children of Men is exactly like what we have seen before, even if it was less concentrated. Rounding up old people, fugees, homosexuals, and all that, putting them into cages, is reminiscent of World War II. Freak bombings like the one seen at the beginning of the film remind us exactly of bombings in Europe, or even the US. It's tangible, and because it's tangible, the prospect of living in such a future is not entirely out there.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this movie is how brilliantly paced it is. There isn't a second of wasted space. It's an hour and forty-nine minutes long. It's not some huge sci-fi three hour long epic, but it IS epic. The tension remains constant throughout everything. Everyone who has seen the previews or heard anything about the movie knows that there is a pregnant woman in it, so a failed build-up would have destroyed a lot of the tension. Cuaron gives us the perfect build-up though, and the momentous revealing of the pregnant belly feels just as world-changing as it should. Everything about that scene conveys how mind-boggling it truly is. Clive Owen's acting is brilliant as he stares, open-mouthed, at Kee's belly. It is one of the greatest moments of the movie.<br/><br/>Besides the pacing, the muted quality of everything conveys how tragic this world is. This isn't some great futuristic world. This is a horrible dystopia of a place that no one, no one would want to live in. There is no moment, as there are often are in similar films about the future, of ""Oh, wow, wouldn't that be cool!"" Anything like that would have done nothing but a detriment to the film. You keep on thinking, ""Oh my gosh. I can't believe that just happened. That's horrible."" There's no glorified action or stylized violence. It's all just real, and there, and the simplicity of everything makes it so much more in-your-face and powerful than it would have been otherwise.<br/><br/>There isn't much about this movie that I didn't like. I felt pained many times throughout the movie, and many times I was not enjoying myself at all, but when I look back at it, it only made the movie that much more great. This isn't exactly a movie that can be enjoyed in the traditional sense, but it's a wonderfully impressive technical achievement. The acting works throughout - the main actress who plays Kee, though, is obviously less talented than Clive Owen. Clive Owen's performance is brilliant in many ways, but it's nothing Oscar-Worthy. It could just be that I don't enjoy Michael Caine as an actor, but I found his part to be very grating, and if a better actor had been found it would have helped a little. The music of the film didn't really strike me as very important, but it does its job, and it was very moving.<br/><br/>Aside from the horrible advertising, though, this film is just simple genius. It's the kind of movie that is so well done that you don't even notice all the amazing directing and writing choices until after the movie is over, and even though you've probably just lived through some of the bleakest hour and forty minutes ever put on celluloid, you'll want to see it again. Don't believe the horrible advertising. This is a movie that deserves to succeed, so go see it. No way in hell should ""Stomp the Yard"" make more money than Children of Men. Anyone with a brain and an eye for quality can see that this is a great movie, possibly the best movie of the year. Like I said, everything about it screams genius. It's a painful, bleak reminder of what our world may come to, and a lot of people may not like. Sometimes, though, quality is not about what we want, but what we need to see. And Children of Men needs to be seen."

","Many great Science Fiction works have problems of today's society couched in issues of the future. The original Star Trek series did this successfully numerous times, this movie does not.<br/><br/>The directory, Alfonso Cuaron, has used this movie purely as a vehicle to push his personal political agenda. The premise of this movie borrows heavily from Margaret Atwood's the Handmaiden's Tale. Children of Men is set in England 20 years in the future, 18 years after all women are infertile and unable to conceive children. In this bleak future, society begins to collapse and wars, terrorist groups, and apocalyptic religious cults are ubiquitous. In this futurist England, the government has used the strife caused by women's infertility to turn the country into a police state. From what I can determine, the main goal of this police state, which the director hammers home, time, and time again throughout the entire movie, is to stop illegal immigration. Meaning the British government has police squads that round up illegal immigrants, places them in internment camps that resemble Manhattan in Escape from New York, and I assume eventually deports them. However, the main plot is suppose to be about a lone girl that somehow managed to conceive a baby, getting her to a safe place to raise her child, and hopefully finding out why she can conceive children.<br/><br/>Such a plot gives ample means to deliver a compelling story. For example, maybe the government plans to use the girl to repopulate the earth through selective breeding, or some other means. However, Cuaron chose a different path.<br/><br/>The movie has many plot holes and does not fully explain why they must get this girl to safety and he even contradicts himself regarding people's supposed reactions and actual reactions to this girl. Furthermore, throughout the entire movie he mottles the plot with his pro-illegal immigrant political message. However, the main question that comes mind is that if women have not been able to conceive children for 20 years, certainly the population of every country would start to decrease. So, why would the government be so concerned with stopping illegal immigration? If the population decreases the government's tax base would decrease, to combat this they would need to attract immigrants. Huhh, I guess the director did not think that far ahead.<br/><br/>Anyway, what I took away from this movie is that Alfonso Cuaron being Mexican is unhappy with the US's illegal immigration policy that affects so many of his countrymen, which is not suppose to be the premise of this movie."
"jeffdjacob","6","2","6","11 January 2007"," Disappointing
","I saw this movie because I was intrigued by its premise, an infertile world, the beginning of the end for the human race. Instead of an intelligent science fiction movie I viewed another Hollywood action movie packed with near death chases and cliché heroic actions.<br/><br/>I wish the filmmakers concentrated more on the mystery surrounding the infertility and Human Project rather than making another predictable, boring excuse to spend $10. Im sick of these stupid movies already, I cant remember the last time I felt satisfied walking out of a movie theater, maybe Memento.<br/><br/>Although the acting in this movie was not half bad, it could not make up for the lack of script. And besides, these peoople should act well in their movies. Plumbers fix sinks and actors act."

","This movie shows a future not so far from now that really could happen! There are a lot of serious themes touched in this movie but handled in such a way that you can laugh about it if you want to! It is nice to see sensitive issues like immigration and terrorism portrayed in this way! But how important the subjects are for me it didn't matter that much! To me it was about the wonderful performances by Clive Owen and Micheal Caine! Finally Clive Owen has got a part he can show what he can do as an actor! I knew he was a good actor,after seeing him in ""The croupier"", ""privateer 2:the darkening"" and ""Second Sight"". He is an actor who is able to show you the changes a character goes through! He is able to give a normal character a very dark side without making it ridiculous! Also in this movie you see development in his character. The way Clive Owen acts is done as realistic possible! When a bomb explodes he is genuinely scared and bothered! It is just fun to see him act! Micheal Caine was a joy to see also! He'd really make me laugh! Children of men is a good movie!"
"Kryzak","7","2","6","7 January 2007"," Emotionally disconnected, but a good movie nevertheless
","I had very high hopes going into ""Children of Men"", and although I wasn't completely satisfied, the movie explored a very possible and realistic dark future for mankind if there were no babies for 18 years. The movie is dark, depressing, and draws you into a world that has lost hope and where governments enact fascist regimes to keep civilization from falling apart. People either try to live on hopelessly or take government sanctioned suicide kits to end the misery. Happy stuff, huh? =) With this in mind, Alfonso Cuaron does a great job creating the world, the atmosphere, an the believability of the world. There're no sci-fi gadgets or technobabble popping up in a movie that could have easily fallen into that trap. The cause of the infertility remains hidden, and only the effects are shown. Different people react to the situation differently and is well portrayed by the various actors in the movie. Clive Owen and the girl playing ""Kit"" does a great job throughout the movie trying to survive and reach a utopia called the ""Human Project"", hoping that her pregnancy will save mankind.<br/><br/>While the movie didn't engage me as much as I had hoped, I appreciate and admire Cuaron's mastery of making a movie as thoughtful, realistic, and depressing as this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a very well made movie in all aspects, but for me, the lack of any explanation and too many loose ends not tied up irked me a little. Overall, a strong movie that should be watched, but it could have been much better."

"jzappa","10","2","6","7 January 2007"," One of the Most Beautifully Made Films of Our Time
","The lush yet bleak ambiance of the film is created by the absolutely astonishing cinematography. Every setting is given such character by the attachment the camera has to the film's people. There is a profound quality in the scenes of hand-held camera-work, and also a beauty in perspective during its long shots. There is even a scene, a spectacularly different and uniquely suspenseful chase, that is filmed during the process of night to dawn to daylight, something that I have surely not seen before in a movie. The cinematography of Emmanuelle Lubezki, which is also what walks away with most films to his credit, such as The New World and Sleepy Hollow, is a reestablishment of true visual artistry in the movies. Cuaron's masterful and unHollywoodlike pacing magnifies the effect of the lens in the wonderfully different futuristic world of England he creates.<br/><br/>The violence in Children of Men is very disturbing, only because of the realism given it by the cinematography. Throughout the film, violence is always portrayed as something seen from afar or seen through one long moving take, like the perspective of someone there. For instance, there is a scene shot from inside the car occupied by many of the film's characters, and a frightening omen of the impending violence is seen far ahead, and all that happens is seen from within the car, the camera panning, the outside perfectly choreographed and fantastically stylized.<br/><br/>Cuaron is one of cinema's finest recent directors, and a lot of that is evident not just in the visual style of his films, but also the many subtleties. In Children of Men, many characters use guns, but the hero, Clive Owen, never touches one. He's always in more danger than anyone else, making his entire journey all the more thrilling and powerful. Also, he eavesdrops in several intermittent yet extensive scenes, revealing a secretive side that only the audience can know about him.<br/><br/>Clive Owen, whose range expands and whose presence grows with each surpassing performance, Michael Caine, who in his fortysomething years on screen has never failed to steal every scene he's ever shot, Chiwetel Ejiofor, whose presence is very strong, Claire-Hope Ashitey, who makes a breakthrough here, Pam Ferris, who give all to the melodrama her character particularly experiences, Peter Mullan, who gives another fun little bit part, and Julianne Moore, with her limited amount of screen time, all pack a punch.<br/><br/>Children of Men also has one of the greatest soundtracks in recent years. It is filled with great older rock music, surprising alternative stuff, and a hauntingly subtle score. The film is also, perhaps aggressively, a celebration of love and affinity for animals, every character seeming to have dogs or cats or farm animals that they are attached to, all of which freely roam through every scene. This is a magnificent break from the increasingly infuriating bad omen of the death of the family dog that has been plaguing cinema for years along with a few other animal-based clichés. There is literally nothing wrong with this movie. It is first- rate cinema."
"cali_sooner82","10","2","6","7 January 2007"," At a loss for words....
","When I first saw the trailer for this film and subsequently heard the title, I didn't get the ""have to see this"" reaction initially. It seemed interesting enough, something I could wait to see on DVD, but after hearing initial reviews I thought I'd give it a go. Thankfully I chose the latter - because I was blown away by this film.<br/><br/>The best way I can describe it is ""Eraserhead"" meets ""Blade Runner"" meets ""1984"". It is undoubtedly a bleak look at a future world mired in violence and hopelessness. Each scene is beautifully framed by Cuaron; who illustrates a world that only a visionary could create.<br/><br/>There are two scenes which clearly stick out in my mind and will most certainly be long remembered, which I won't go into detail on. I will say one scene contains one of, if not THE most incredible tracking shots I've ever seen. Some of the hand-held shots are done in such a way that you get absolutely lost in the action. The camera angles and perspectives Cuaron chooses aren't truly innovative but somehow they feel as though they are. The film has some truly poetic moments which contrast the beauty of new life against the gritty, tough and violent backdrop.<br/><br/>Clive Owen proves yet again he is one of the most gifted modern actors. He balances the action sequences with the quieter, more dramatic moments in a seamless fashion; his performance is powerful to say the least. Owen is surrounded by an ensemble cast of unique characters headed by an interesting portrayal by Michael Caine, his ex-wife/activist leader Julianne Moore and a nice performance by Claire Hope Ashity, who plays ""Kee"", the one light in a world of hopelessness.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there will be those that lump this into the ""leftist propaganda"" mess, political jargon, blah, blah, blah. You can't deny the statements that the film makes but this movie is so much more than a simple political statement. It is a work that will be looked at years down the line as one of the more amazing and noteworthy accomplishments of the last several years.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and go check this film out."
"frankwhat","9","2","6","7 January 2007"," ""Children of Men""  The Brainchild of Humanity
","There has been a lot of emphasis in movies lately that depict the topic of the ending of both humanity and civilization. However this is the first one to breach on the idea of is that really such a bad thing? At first look, yes it is terrible as all humans no matter what they feel at times have an inherent survival instinct. But on the outside looking in, it's being said now that people are too destructive in their consumerism to be able to blend in peacefully with the rest of Mother Nature.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" examines the pure chaos that would result if every person in the world knew that the end of life as they know it was coming to a screeching halt in less than a century. Instead of life being put up on a pedestal it has the reverse effect and becomes even more worthless than it is considered today, which says a lot. Terrorism runs rampant and the government has gotten out of control, deliberately abusing all of its authority. The ugly side of human behavior is flashed at the viewer just about every chance there is and the worst part about this fact is it's completely realistic. While this film shows what will happen to societies in the world if nothing is done about the growing intolerance we share towards one another, it's actually being done right now in more parts of the world than we'd like to think.<br/><br/>A good amount of symbolism is relayed throughout the duration such as dogs and cats get treated as children and water represents life. Also many potshots are taken at American practices, some are hidden while others are direct blows. The most obvious hits were at Homeland Security, foreign refugees, and the illegal alien policieswhich mostly criticized the Bush administration. While it wasn't officially declared, it appeared as if a state of emergency had been activated in London and emphasizes why we should never consider that as an option here.<br/><br/>Every aspect of this movie tried to produce a sense of realism and the result was very effective. The cinematography was gritty and contained one amazing lengthy take towards the end that would stop the harshest critic dead in their tracks. The script was great and highly unpredictable. The scenes contained so much information that this'll be one of those films where you'll catch something new with each viewing. Many clues were lurking in the background. It's very easy to miss a small detail so make sure you pay close attention as the pacing can get extremely fast without warning. What really stood out above anything else was the tremendous success of humor. There was such a mix between subtle, dark, and even downright twisted comedy that helped make all the horrible scenarios bearable to the audience.<br/><br/>Finally the acting was superb as everyone really put in the work. The two that stood out the most had to unsurprisingly be Clive Owen and Michael Caine though. Clive must be the best actor with the most limited range and I say that with great admiration. He never plays anything different but we all love him anyway and rightly so. Starting out as a detached alcoholic that had an ambitious past, he begins to regain his sense of responsibility and the belief he can make a differencewhich he does. Michael is cast here as a hippie, yes you read that correctly, and was absolutely delightful. An honorable mention is Chiwetel Ejiofor who easily brought to life a cold-hearted villain with a purpose. While everyone in the government is basically portrayed as bad, the terrorists are split into those that possess good intentions and the ones that are downright radical lunatics, which certainly shed light on an important issue.<br/><br/>This film is not for everyone, but on the other handeveryone should see it. It's meant to require all watchers to do some soul-searching and realize that positive change is needed. But even if everyone stopped his or her hatred dead in its tracks and reached a pinnacle of self-realization, there'd always be at least one idiot out there who'd ruin it for everyone else. While preservation of our species is a priority, should it beand does it even matter at this point? As the movie itself shows, human attempts at correcting the wrongs of the world are always short-lived and hence it very well may be too late."
"nived84","10","2","6","6 January 2007"," An instant classic
","In Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men we see a startling vision of a future society (2027 London) not on the brink of chaos, but already buried knee deep in it. As massive pollution, super-controlled immigration, violent protests, and constant wars have engulfed the world, as a side effect it has rendered women infertile; unable to breed future children. It's as if God's saying, ""If you can't play nicely together, you don't deserve the right to live anymore."" The world is slowly coming to an end, and anarchy rules the day. At the start of the picture a man named Theo, played with great skill and charm by Clive Owen, is going through his usual routine of picking up his morning coffee. The televisions report the news that the reported ""youngest person in the world"" has officially died after taking his own life. The world gathers around the TV and mourns his loss. It's only seconds later; after Theo gets his coffee that a large bomb violently obliterates the café. This is the world of Children of Men; one of the most brutally realized visions of a future all too real to be simply dismissed purely as being mere ""science fiction"".<br/><br/>When Theo is contacted by his ex-wife, Julian (played by Julianne Moore), who has been working with a militant group of vigilantes, she asks for his help in obtaining official government papers that will allow a friend of hers to travel to a safe zone. But when she is suddenly killed by a wild group of rebels, Theo discovers that ""her friend"" is a young pregnant woman; just days away from giving birth to the first known baby in over eighteen years, and the possible savior of the human race. Theo takes it upon himself to personally transport the girl through the dangerous countryside and war torn cities of a destroyed England. As Theo tries to escort the woman amongst all the chaos we see a frightening vision of a furious world, painted so vividly, and so painfully real, its images will be burned deep into your subconscious; it's unforgettable. And Cuarón, whose last film was 2004's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (my favorite in the series), is just the right film maker to bring this uncompromised vision to the big screen. The future has never seemed so real before in any motion picture I've ever seen, and the effect is absolutely chilling.<br/><br/>Everything about Children of Men is stunning. From Emmanuel Lubezki's gritty cinematography to an Oscar worthy performance from Clive Owen and a wonderful supporting performance from Michael Caine as an aging, pot-smoking hippie. The film oozes with heat-pounding suspense and gut-wrenching drama at every unexpected turn. And for along time I would have put Paul Greengrass's United 93 or Martin Scorsese's Departed at the top of the list for this year's Best Picture, but by and far this stunning achievement now sits atop the throne of great films this year. It works not only as a human drama, but as a science fiction fable and as an action-thriller; whatever it is that you're looking for in a great movie-going experience, look no further than Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men. This is an unforgettable film, and in my opinion an instant classic."

","I didn't think it possible for Alfonso Cuarón to top himself, but this movie is a masterpiece. Part ""Road Warrior,"" part ""Nativity Story"" -- this work stands as one of the best films of 2006. Sadly, the film may be too bracing, original, and honest to find a mass audience.<br/><br/>There are at least three set pieces, seemingly uninterrupted shots running for several minutes of intricately choreographed action, that draw the viewer into the story like no other film before. I'm certain some digital trickery was employed to achieve these impossible results, but the effects were fully hidden on a first viewing. Alfonso Cuarón deserves every directing award available for these three scenes alone.<br/><br/>But a word for the original author is in order: P.D. James wrote the novel about this Malthusian nightmare future and should not be forgotten. Ezra Pound once described poets as 'the antennae of the race.'

Although the theme may sound familiar, this version is quite good and makes one think about consequences of going against the ""rules"".<br/><br/>Well acted and very well directed.

","You've seen the advertisements so you know the basics. Women mysteriously stopped having children. Some time before this Theo (Clive Owen) and Julian (Julianne Moore) lost their only child to an illness. The movie is about a number of things but of course the preciousness of life. How much more poignant would the story have been had Theo and Julian aborted the child rather than his death be due to illness? But of course, no matter how much the Hollywood clique rails against state sanctioned violence (executions, war, 'police actions' etc..) no criticism of abortion is ever to be found.<br/><br/>Aside from this criticism, its dystopian vision is unsettling and intriguing. Well cast and well acted. I have only bothered to see 8 movies in the theater this year but this is clearly the best. I do not understand why the release is so limited, it was a real pain to hunt down and travel to the only theater in the DC area showing it."

","This movie shows what homeland security and other present political directions will lead us to, with or without children.<br/><br/>The thread and absurdity of a modern police state is depicted in a very realistic and probable way by showing the cruelty and stubbornness of the system and contrasting it with the helplessness and purity of a naked human life. The aesthetics of the film have a hyper-real ""right there, right now"" feel to it, due to long shots in ""action"" sequences, a very tense screenplay and effective cinematography. Also big credit to the art department for creating totally believable sets that also tell a part of the story, shifting our everyday environment into a careless future with people only worrying about themselves."

","what an astoundingly gritty film. Amazing co ordination must've been used for the extremely long tracking sequences. my mind is blown. Anyone read the book 1984 by george Orwell? similar theme of unchecked immigration and paranoia. anyone know why Britain is usually the scene of dictatorships and oppression, similar to in V for vendetta? But god,what realism(in Children of men)! I even saw it twice!obviously much better the first time, though. Anyone know what the dead cows symbolise?or the ones in the barn?or the myriad of dogs involved in almost all the scenes? i am glad that somethings were left unsaid though. Leaves the viewer guessing.Some one said that Cuaron should try his hand at directing a war movie,I agree. That would be amazing. Another element is the detail in the scenes. The ending wasn't that strong. were those french jet planes coming across the channel to bomb the town? But why?"
"Jockie","9","2","6","4 October 2006"," Gripping and moving piece of cinema.
","I went to see this at the local multiplex last night and must say that is one of the most satisfying cinema experiences i have had in a long time. I went in with high expectations, firstly as a unashamed sci-fi fan and in particular of dystopian visions (although the daily mail may see this film as more of a utopia) such as Brazil which i consider to be a sort of companion piece to this film, secondly as a cuaron fan who made a Harry Potter film that even i could enjoy and thirdly as someone from England who is tired of the same old genres that we appear to have in this country ie. corny gangster films, kitchen sink dramas and historical adaptations I have to say that this film lived up to all my expectations and then some. Without going into the plot too much it concerns England in 20 years time, with the human race infertile and the outlawing of immigrants leading to a fascist style government. Sound a bit like v for vendetta? well i assure that comparison couldn't be further from the truth because the future displayed in this film felt so grounded in reality and so possible that it made my stomach turn. The performances in the film were almost uniformly excellent with Clive Owen clearly playing the kind of role he was born for and Michael Caine giving a fantastic performance which could so easily could have been ridiculous in the hands of a lesser actor or lesser director.<br/><br/>However the thing that impressed me most about the film was the visual style the hand-held camera and documentary style gives the film a gritty feeling yet also allows for beautiful shots that appear natural and not as forced as in other large productions, *MINOR SPOILER* Towards the end of the film is a major set piece set in a war torn refugee camp that is simply stunning with explosions and gunfire that had me gripped and close to falling off my chair as the world falls apart around the films protagonists. I must stress that this film has to be seen in a cinema with surround sound for full effect as a normal DVD set up will not do it any kind of justice.<br/><br/>A few minor criticisms of the film for me are that some of the lesser characters don't feel very fleshed out and a couple of supporting performances didn't ring true for me (slight overacting). With that out the way i feel the need to stress once more that this piece of cinema needs to be seen in a cinema. Lets just hope we can look back on it in 20 years and laugh at how wrong was."
"ceritigger","10","2","6","27 September 2006"," A scary thought provoking vision. Who cares about the logic holes!!!
","OK so some things aren't explained but you know what..... it really does not matter. I for one am sick of being spoon fed by film makers. I liked the sense of not knowing what was going to happen and why. Clive Owen is an amazing actor that previously I had relegated to pretty TV actor (OK so I was wrong) He has an understated quality and some fabulous lines that will alternatively have you laughing out loud and then blubbing like a baby. Children of Men is poignant, it is thought provoking but above all I hope it will change the way our world is going. Cuaron is a director to watch out for. He has really got a refreshing style. Be warned this is a film that leaves the dead to die and suffer with no fanfare. Watch it!"
"marcdnb","9","2","6","26 September 2006"," Futuristic, bleak, depressing....but really rather good
","Wow. In a word. There is a sense of scale in this film, though set only in the U.K, that sets it apart from most films that have been released in the last few years. The futuristic London is, scarily, completely believable. The gritty dirtiness of the place led me to believe i was watching a Terry Gilliam film. The film features long takes where Clive Owen is followed around by the camera for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. This all helps towards the wow factor. Clive Owen puts in a good performance as the man who's given up hope, as does an upbeat Michael Caine. This film will keep you glued to it. Take the time out to see this wonderful film. It's shocking, depressing and awe inspiring. You won't be disappointed."
"SmackBang","10","2","6","22 September 2006"," A work of art
","Seeing this at the cinema. Being dragged along not expecting much of a movie. But then suddenly the movie took pace from the start the acting was good and this didn't look like what i had imagined it to be. No NO instead instead i am greeted with a wonderfully gritty tone, some in your face violence and tense scenes. The basic plot of Children of men is simple.<br/><br/>*Warning Spoilers* Its 2027 and Humanity has gone into chaos because women around the world have a infertility defect (they can't become pregnant). The only country that seems to have law left is Britain which is now hunting down immigrants and putting them in camps. At the very start the worlds youngest person has died at the age of 18. The news says he was stabbed because he never gave a fan an autograph. In comes Clive Owen (Theodore)who is watching the news in a bar. He walks out, a bomb explodes, from there on in he is thrust into humanity's last hope. To protect the worlds only pregnant woman. The goal: to get the pregnant woman to a boat for an activist group that will take care of her and find a cure for the infertile woman. Out of the movie i think the best area was the immigrants camp which looked very gritty, harsh and terrifying. It also is an obvious reference for the Jewish Ghettos in WW2. Except the only difference is people of every nationality apart from Britain that were fleeing the chaos have been crammed in this area.<br/><br/>All in all its a very worthwhile movie to see. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely be buying it on DVD when it releases on it."
"bobbyfletch85","9","2","6","20 September 2006"," Gritty, electric and eerily real
","A powerful and energetic film that takes the gritty textures of 28 Days Later and the dystopian noir of Bladerunner creating a memorable and fierce movie that, is at times, spectacularly realistic.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is slowly but surely becoming a very decent actor and in this, save for a few patchy pieces of bad dialogue where he simply swears through scenes, does a good job as the movie's protagonist. Julianne Moore is an odd choice; playing an American leader of a British terrorist movement and yet again, I feel she delivered an empty performance. I really don't know how she manages to get into so many good films.<br/><br/>Through a severe depiction of 2027 London, Children of Men is an advertisement for what Britain could become in the future. What is most clever from this film is the gritty, long shots of action, reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan, where action unfolds before our eyes without cutting and flush with rawness, so stunningly real it'll leave you feeling you've been hiding behind Clive Owen till the very last spray of gunfire. The film is layered with intelligent, meaningful points and messages; perfectly timed for the current climate on immigration, nationalism and racism.<br/><br/>Though the pace dips in places where exposition takes over, it's delivered by charming hippy Michael Caine, but be warned his repetitive salvation ""Amigo"" may irritate. Electric and vividly clairvoyant, you won't see a better film this year. Britain has had some dire films in it's attempt to battle Hollywood but as Children Of Men's London proclaims ""Britain soldiers on""... well after seeing this film, you'll be checking yourself for flesh wounds."

"NicolasCostoglou","10","1","2","23 December 2016"," Masterfully grim and realistic Dystopia...
","Children of Men is one of my all-time favourite films, and most of all the most realistic depiction of a dystopian future i know.<br/><br/>The movie is settled around the question, what happens if no more babies could be born, and the shown result of a future without hope is as realistic as it possibly could. There are small indicators of a futuristic time, but everything seems to decay because no one gives a crap anymore.<br/><br/>The actors are ALL amazing. Mostly Clive Owen who is incredibly comprehensible, so that it works flawless to see this world through his perspective.<br/><br/>And with this we get to the unbelievably great cinematography, which gives us the feeling of being someone, who walks through this world, along the characters, without being noticed. We never leave our protagonists view and get all the information we need, mostly out of the background, so that we have the chance to get it on our own. The movie also has three of the longest and most incredible choreographed longtakes you will ever see, they are amazing, mostly the last one in the final act.<br/><br/>Also the use of music is very interesting, because you only get to hear music when the characters do (through radios for example) or to underscore the more dramatic scenes. <br/><br/>What baffles me the most is that this movie has some of the most unnoticeable visual effects ever ""seen"" and wasn't even nomitated for an academy reward, which is incredibly weird, seen how i recently watched the movie (now nearly eleven years after it's release) and i'm still not sure what's real and what isn't, the only thing that i know that it's not real for sure, is the baby, but just because my father told me after i watched it the first time, but the birth scene (alias, the second big longtake) is still so convincing, that i have to assure people who never saw this film, that it's not real...<br/><br/>The movie is also filled to the rim with interesting metaphors, ideas, and themes which give you something to think about, even long after you've seen the film.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a masterpiece that shouldn't be missed by anyone who is even remotely interested in the art of film..."
"dholliday-imdb","9","1","2","6 May 2015"," Superlative camera work lifts this above most
","No spoilers here as ever, if you have the DVD then beware of the title screen! It shows you a dramatic development which you'd rather discover spontaneously.<br/><br/>Children of Men has a lot going for it: excellent cast, intriguing premise, expert use of sound and very effective editing. Most of all, the film shines with its use of that most valuable of all tools: the camera.<br/><br/>Remember that legendary tracking shot in Goodfellas, where Ray Liotta and his girl walk through the busy restaurant kitchen? Take that scene, lengthen it, add dramatic action and use appreciably-different variations about 3 or 4 times during the movie. Absolutely riveting stuff! <br/><br/>Just as important are the cast, and without exception they're all brilliant. I was never that keen on Clive Owen but he plays a blinder here: one of the best (and most realistic) heroes I've seen on-screen. Michael Caine is surprisingly-effective as his hippy mate. Clare-Hope Ashitey plays Kee pitch-perfect. The support cast are all memorable: especially Pam Ferris & Peter Mullan, but also kudos to everyone else. They all create believable stock which was vital in suspending disbelief of the sometimes-unreasonable plot development.<br/><br/>Also big plus points go to the realised near-future London the production created: subtle & effective.<br/><br/>Just go with the flow (it's essentially a chase/escape movie rather than science-fiction) and enjoy the superlative action."
"advaitkamat","8","1","2","18 October 2013"," A remarkably-crafted dystopian tale of optimism and sadism.
","I've never had a thing for science-fiction movies, especially the ones that are dystopian because they sustain themselves on the garish special-effects they bring along with them. But Alfonso Cuaron's ""Children Of Men"" urged me to reconsider my views on the genre. An expertly-crafted violent chase thriller, ""Children Of Men"" scores points on how believable it eventually is. Set in the near-future, it tells the tale of Theo Faron, a civil-rights activist, and his singular mission to transport a heavily-pregnant teenage woman, Kee, the first pregnancy in eighteen years after a bout of infertility, across the country during a communist uprising.<br/><br/>Straight away, we find out that this is no ordinary movie. The first scene, in which we see Theo (Clive Owen) buying himself a cup of coffee in a shop which later explodes, tells us exactly what we're in for. Theo is later kidnapped by a group that calls itself the Fishes, a group that vies for an equal place for illegal immigrants in the country, and is told about the developments. Theo's ex-wife, Julian (Julianne Moore), who heads the group, informs him about the job which he is supposed to carry out - to transport a girl, Kee (Clare- Hope Ashitey) across the country to the Human Project. As they're ambushed by a mob which also leads to the killing of two officers and the death of Julian, Theo and Kee figure out that they'll be the hunted ones in connection to the deaths. Theo digs out an old junkie friend of his, Jasper (Michael Caine), who agrees to help them get to the boat, where the Human Project awaits them.<br/><br/>""Children Of Men"" is fueled by a manic energy that Cuaron weaves into the neurotic setting. Sensationally directed, superbly scripted and competently acted, ""Children Of Men"" has got it all. There's style, there's substance and enthralling action sequences that wholly deserve to be whistled at. We're often being shown a voguish futuristic world which we buy into but seldom has anyone tried to think out-of-the-box. That's where Cuaron's boundless imagination comes into the picture. He gives us an frightful representation of what the world is about to turn into, cautions us and then takes our breath away. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski ably backs his visionary chronicle, giving us a series of visuals so stunning that I was left lost for words. Technically sound, Cuaron and Lubezski team up to create an erudite experience that can just as be a documentary as a thriller.<br/><br/>Owen, in his most eloquent performance yet, is terrific. His journey of making Faron a hero from a sympathetic loafer is absolutely moving. Ashitey, in her debut, hands in a dignified, scintillating performance. Moore and Caine exceed well in their small but significant roles.<br/><br/>""Children Of Men"" works well as a cautionary tale, a dystopian chase-thriller which is conceivable and ultimately satisfying. Richly textured and emotionally explosive, there is no way that it should be ignored. It shows us why fraternity is so crucial even during those times when we are left with no choice."

"Beercat","10","3","12","14 June 2007"," Should be compulsory viewing for all politicians
","Starting with the set dressing, this film is scarily prescient of what, with very few key drivers, could become of western society - a bleak view of what happens when those in power think they know best. And yet, there is always hope. To put it in perspective; ""Blade Runner"" was an example of a dysfunctional utopia - the power of the individual against an otherwise benign state, where the nature of what makes humanity is explored; ""Brazil"", on the other hand, was a functional dystopia - the power of the state against the 'little guy', where individuality is quashed, and humanity is, where possible, extinguished; ""Children of Men"", on the other hand, is a truly dysfunctional dystopia - individuals battle against friends and enemies alike to define the human condition. There are no ""good guys"". There are no ""bad guys"". Practically everyone has their own agenda, that they want to pursue, using the promise of the unborn to try and suborn morality into ""their solution""<br/><br/>Politicians often claim to be on the side of right. And yet, all too often, the result of their self-serving actions makes for more misery and chaos. To try and forestall this, just like the corrective therapy applied in ""A Clockwork Orange"", all politicians should be made to watch this with their eyes wedged open. Just so that they realise that they have to think of others, rather than themselves, to make things better."

","This was one of the best films I have seen this year. Very interesting look at a society that has suddenly become infertile, depicting the government in a very violent and proud way and the terrorist groups mainly the ""fishers"" in a very violent way as well. Clive Owen plays a former activist who has lost his faith after his child with Julian Moore was killed by disease. Despite this he becomes an unlikely champion for humankind when he discovers the first pregnant woman in years. When I first saw this title and saw Clive Owen in it, I was skeptical that it might become another movie selling out its ideas to just making Clive Owen look ""badass"". However this did not happen, and I particularly liked the entire sequence at the end when Clive Owen is in the middle of a war zone with the new born baby and her mother and he does not once pick up a gun and start shooting. This movie does not sell out to cheap Hollywood ideals to sell more tickets. This movie becomes a movie about fate chance and having faith in human kind to make a change. It is very relevant as we move into a day and age when overpopulation, war, and terrorism are beginning to cause us to question our own faith in each other to live peacefully together."

","My experience with this film was the most high level of reality. From start to finish it is adrenaline and pure excitement. ""Children of Men"" is the definitive extremely realistic experience of a sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>The story begins with Theo Faron (Clive Owen) a journalist who lives in a near future in the year of 2027. A future where pregnancy in women's no longer exists. Theo lives in a chaotic and dangerous London where there is an insane persecution against illegal immigrants, placing them in ""concentration camps"". Theo walking in another normal day, he is suddenly captured by masked men and taken by a van. Theo wakes up and finds himself captured by his beautiful ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) who is wanted for terrorism because she works with the ""Fishers"" one rebel militia who fights against the government, helping immigrants. Julian says she needs Theo's help arranging passes out of the country for a young black woman, receiving 5000 pounds in return. Theo through some powerful contacts get the passes and makes a date with Julian and the young woman to deliver the passes. On another day like any other, Theo awakens, go attend a race of dogs and meets with Julian on a bus. From there, Theo and Julian head to a car and deliver the passes for the young and promises to help carrying her to a farm on the border of the country. During the trip, everyone laugh and have fun, suddenly appears a burning car in the middle of the road blocking the way and an army of hungry thugs starts attacking their car. During the attack Julian gets shot in the neck and dies. Later they manage to arrive on the farm. When Theo is ready to go back to London, he is called by the young Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) who wants to show you her secret, a secret that can save the world, she is pregnant. Now Theo is in the middle of a civil war and the only hope of the life of humanity.<br/><br/>The idea of the story is excellent, and the way that Alfonso Cuarón (director-writer) and four writers, explore it in a tremendous reality and at the same time with elements of futuristic sci-fi giving a fantastic delivery. Along with moments that can be funny and entertaining with normal language and released as of today, alongside with strong emotional charges extremely strong that the audience faces throughout the film.<br/><br/>But the technical aspects of the film are AWESOME. We are faced with a real huge production, giving us scenarios, places and landscapes frighteningly huge and realistic. And the direction of Cuarón is breathtaking. It literally puts the viewer in each scene, increasing the tension and suspense with every minute that passes, and the concern for the fate of the characters becomes really personal.<br/><br/>One of the best sci-fi ever made, a direction and writing extremely superb, excellent performances (especially by Clive, fantastic as always), a future.... that I really expect that doesn't happen."
"funkyfry","9","2","7","7 February 2011"," Very fascinating dystopian film
","I thought this was a really striking movie, very different from any of the (many) futuristic or post-apocalyptic movies that I've seen before and much more visceral than what we usually see in terms of action/sci-fi with big budgets these days. There were some scenes in this movie, like the one where they encountered he burning car/roadblock and the rushing marauders, where I was really overwhelmed by the intensity of the scene, and I was watching it on video on my 32"" screen! I can't even imagine really how intense those scenes were in the theater.<br/><br/>Cuaron really knows how to direct, he's very inventive and everything he does is just stylish enough that it feels right but not obvious enough to draw attention to itself. I can't say enough about his talent from just the few movies I've seen and particular this one; he's as good as anybody else out there right now and seems to have better taste in material than some. I happen to like directors who only cut the film when they need to. Nobody would call the direction of this movie ""old fashioned"", and Cuaron's long takes never linger on landscape portraiture -- he's just as innocent of the abuses of the long take as he is of the abuses of the short take.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the whole design of the movie -- there's a lot of detail that doesn't draw attention to itself, it feels like a real world that people could inhabit as compared to 99% of futuristic scenarios. Even the films that are more of a ""nightmare scenario"" than this one don't really convey it with as much complexity or apparent spontaneity. It seems more lived-in than any future world we've seen since ""Blade Runner."" As far as the story and the characters, I found the whole thing very compelling and constantly surprising. Clive Owen was perfect; his obvious personal magnetism is just repressed enough and just generic enough in its quality that he seems like a still-life of a fully developed animal, like a flower that was frozen in half-bloom. I enjoyed all the character performances, especially Michael Caine as Jasper, a truly admirable bohemian cat who unfortunately found himself in the middle of this movie.<br/><br/>All ""dystopian"" films portray an environmental collapse on some level or the other. This film is different because it portrays it on a more personal level instead of an epic scale. Where the film does approach the epic, especially in the big scenes involving the hotel towards the end, I think it is weakened somewhat. Like the hero, it just barely manages to limp out to the exit with its original ideals more or less intact. Which is saying quite a lot considering how ambitious this film is -- it has such a heavy message but it's not really a sentimental or exploitative treatment."

We have a technology called contraception that people need to take seriously instead of mindlessly cranking out kids while the world suffocates from human overload. We expect other animals to live in balance (lest we cull them) but the species with the worst population problem keeps encouraging it with self-righteousness, tax policies and general stupidity.<br/><br/>The chaos & violence that ensued in this film after 18 years of female sterility is happening in real life for the OPPOSITE reason. People are in constant strife over a shrinking pool of natural resources on this finite planet. Animal life is being decimated for the same reason. Wars are and will be fought over the growing scarcity of land, water, food and fossil fuels. Peak Oil alone could trigger WW-III.<br/><br/>No amount religious wishful thinking will make this planet capable of supporting more than a few billion people at modern living standards. The human footprint is said to already be 1.3 times the Earth's innate capacity, with oil and coal being the only things maintaining an illusion of plenitude. Global warming shows the finite capacity of Earth's atmosphere to absorb economic growth and human gluttony.<br/><br/>It didn't seem like this film had a particular agenda, pro or anti birth, but I hope it didn't mislead demographically-ignorant people about the root cause of today's problems. We don't need more fools claiming overpopulation is a ""myth"" despite rampant symptoms.<br/><br/>Projections of 9 BILLION people by 2050, and as many as 500 million in the United States, are depressing if one cares about quality of life over mindless quantity. Environmental problems and species extinctions are hard enough to prevent with 6.8 billion in 2010. The Dick Van Patten fantasy of a yet-to-be-born genius saving the masses is bogus logic. Wise people don't crowd themselves into a corner. They leave slack in the system.<br/><br/>I remain puzzled about the ultimate point of this movie and couldn't root for the pregnant woman as a savior. Was she a sign of a ""recovery"" (a return to the overpopulation cycle) or just a fluke? They should have made the medical aspect more clear, at least. I originally thought the title might be a serious take on ""Junior"" (1994) but in the book, men were the infertile ones, which is more plausible since pollution (worsened by overpopulation) has lowered sperm counts.<br/><br/>I gave this a 6 for its production values and acting, minus the premise that I found annoying. Even the 1972 film ""Z.P.G."" tried to create drama out of child-birthing rebellion (against the common good). Why can't everyone just accept that the planet has limits and live accordingly? If the crisis had been presented as a surplus of people I'd rank it an 8. I'd rather see films like ""Soylent Green"" that derive their drama from REAL world conditions."

","An amazing bit of social commentary, Children of Men has the 1984 approach to science fiction in which the goal is not to portray the future but to comment on the present. England in chaos: fear of immigration has been built into a frenzy of blood lust and the poor live in violent squalor while the rich hide in pleasant enclaves. The movie references the Iraq war directly and uses strong visual imagery reminiscent of Abu Ghraib and the Holocaust.<br/><br/>At the same time, Children is an tense, exciting action movie, and it is remarkable how it manages to sacrifice neither its message or its entertainment value.<br/><br/>This is a very cinematic movie. There is almost no exposition, and those who want explanations will be disappointed; the movie asks the viewer to figure out a lot themselves.<br/><br/>The weakest aspect of the film is that the reason for the road trip/chase at the heart of the movie isn't convincingly set up. Everyone in the film is making assumptions about what will happen when it is revealed that after two decades of mysterious infertility, a woman is pregnant, but none of them seem to have really thought anything through, and the ultimate goal of the trip is decidedly fuzzy; exactly what are the expecting to happen? Fortunately, that only lightly mars the movie; it's a basic MacGuffin that is dropped in as an excuse for the action but not hammered upon enough to crack it.<br/><br/>The movie is also visually compelling. In wikipedia I read that there are several single-shot sequences in the movie, but I wasn't aware of them at the time, because I was too caught up in what was happening to be aware of the film's technical aspects. The single-shot approach is used not to show off but to heighten the intensity, and it works wonderfully.<br/><br/>A must see movie."

","This is the most realistic and disturbing vision of the future I've seen in a film. There is so much attention to detail and there's so much going on in each shot that its mind blowing. This is not a relationship film, where you get to root for a couple or something. Its a survival film. Society as a whole is literally going through the motions and spinning towards the abyss. The main characters have to win for the good of humanity, in spite of all of its evil. Its packed with action, heroism, fear and paranoia. I've read review after negative review here from people who say the story went nowhere or that Clive Owen did a poor job. I want to know what these people were doing during this film, because they obviously weren't paying attention, or they have no soul. This is an incredible action film with well acted characters.

","First off, this is an exceptional movie. The direction is top notch and Clive Owen and Michael Caine were fantastic. But the thing that really sets this movie apart from others is its incredible tracking shots. These long cuts give a sense of realism to the movie, it gives it a feeling similar to a documentary, as if this is simply a glance into the future. There are two shots in particular that really stand out. First is the car scene when they are attacked by all of the people. The camera rig they constructed for the film was completely original. It allowed a 360 view of everyone and everything inside and outside of the car. This single shot is completed to stunning, emotional effect. The second shot, near the end of the film rivals the famous tracking shots in movies such as Goodfellas, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia. The shocking chase through the war torn city to save the child, and the impact the baby has on the war scene is breathtaking. All of the subtle nuances in the rich environment demand multiple viewings to fully appreciate. One of my favorite moments in the long shot is when the blood spatters on the camera lens in the bus. I believe this film has gotten a hard rap. People just need to appreciate how well made a movie this really is."

","Presenting a bleak, harrowing, and yet ultimately hopeful vision of humankind's not-too-distant future, Children of Men is a riveting cautionary tale of potential things to come. Set in the crisis-ravaged future of 2027, and based on the atypical 1993 novel by British mystery writer P.D. James, the anxiety-inducing, action-packed story is set in a dystopia England where humanity has become infertile (the last baby was born in 2009), immigration is a crime, refugees (or ""fugees"") are caged like animals, and the world has been torn apart by nuclear fallout, rampant terrorism, and political rebellion. In this seemingly hopeless landscape of hardscrabble survival, a jaded bureaucrat named Theo (Clive Owen) is drawn into a desperate struggle to deliver Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), the world's only pregnant woman, to a secret group called the Human Project that hopes to discover a cure for global infertility. As they carefully navigate between the battling forces of military police and a pro-immigration insurgency, Theo, Kee, and their secretive allies endure a death-defying ordeal of urban warfare, and director Alfonso Cuaron (with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki) capture the action with you-are-there intensity. There's just enough humor to balance the film's darker content (much of it coming from Michael Caine, as Theo's aging hippie cohort), and although Children of Men glosses over many of the specifics about its socio political worst-case scenario (which includes Julianne Moore in a brief but pivotal role), it's still an immensely satisfying, pulse-pounding vision of a future that represents a frightening extrapolation of early 21st-century history."
"AleFHaro","10","2","7","27 March 2008"," Children of Men
","In just his fourth movie directed abroad, Children of Men (USA-UK, 2006), Alfonso Cuarón establishes his great skills to take advantage of the huge technical resources and special effects of the majors, in order to use them along with an interesting and uncommon story. Although set in a futuristic scenario (seen several times before): a fascist and Orwellian society, paranoiac, xenophobic and repressive, the result is an impressive and entertaining film, formed by a great production and a superb cast.<br/><br/>In one of the most sublimes and outstanding scenes (adaptation of the P.D. James?s novel) Theo (remarkable Clive Owen), after surviving a rain of bullets and bombs in a tumbledown city (not far away from the modern Irak war images), he's holding while walking between soldiers and illegal immigrants the first baby girl born after 18 years without any new born child. A miraculous and hopeful image, announcing a promising future for mankind.<br/><br/>Cuarón is aware about the great and efficient cast he has in hands. Michael Caine (evidently he had fun performing his character) is just great as a sort of hippie of the 21th century and pacifist who fought against the war in Irak back in the 1990's and 2000's. Besides, Cuarón is able to direct with ability the action scenes and persecutions, creating outstanding digital scenarios as well (i.e. that of a huge balloon pig-shaped, taken from the cover of Pink Floyd record ""Animals""). The photography is a master-work of the Mexican cinematographer Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki, filming the entire movie with a shaky-cam style. His work is simply impressive, especially the last scenes where he imitates the style of a camera-man in a kind of battle field, following Clive Owen to every corner in the destroyed city."

","1st watched 5/20/2007 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Alfonso Cuaron): Dreary and bleak future view effectively portrayed by director Alfonso Cuaron, although it doesn't make for a fun time at the the movies, it does what it's supposed to do. The story is about a world in the year 2027 that hasn't seen a human birth in 18 years and doesn't have any answers as to why. Clive Owen is a government worker who is mourning with the rest of the world when the youngest person alive dies giving a world with little hope already, less. He is then kidnapped by a group of rebels, led briefly by Julianne Moore's character, who needs help transferring an illegal alien safely out of the country. Illegal aliens are normally captured by the U.K. government and put into refugee camps, but this one needs special treatment because she's carrying a child that could, of course, save the world as they know it. Owen & Moore just happen to be former mates who tried to have a baby 20 years ago unsuccessfully and therefore they are connected personally as well as professionally, and she knows he will be sympathetic to the cause of protecting this woman. The rest of the movie is a qwest to get this important woman to a secret organization known as the Human Project. The tone and the set design for the entire movie is very grey and war-like with very little clues that we're dealing with a future society. This is obviously by design as the director is trying to make a parallel to today's society and what might happen if we continue the direction we're going. This glum look on life is hard to make into an enjoyable movie experience but it does shed some light on reality and opens our eyes to how we can try and make this a better world -- with this Cuoran, accomplishes what he wanted."

","Although it was a good movie, I'll give it 5 out of 10 because of the way the Hollywood producers treat the ethnic problem in Romania. I saw a good deal of movies where Gypsies speak the Romanian language, consciously mistaking them(The Man Who Cried is another example, out of many). This is very harmful for Romanians, who are DIFFERENT than Gypsies. They live in our country too, but they are spread all over Europe. They have their own tradition, they respect their own laws and this is a big problem for the Romanians, being considered Gypsies and pointed out wherever they go. Can't these Hollywood producers do a film where the Gypsies speak their language (which is totally different than Romanian)? Excuse me if I can't see the loss or the disadvantages in that.<br/><br/>Another problem is that in the film, almost 50% of the immigrants (in the Bexville prison) are Romanians or Gypsies (doesn't seem to matter). I mean, England was the only country standing all over the Globe and all nations tried to escape there. Is this supposed to mean that Romanians are 50% of the global population? <br/><br/>I should mentions other intolerable facts but it will became boring. In the end it is cruel, how some people mock us, straight in the face (i bet that in P.D. James' book not all immigrants are Romanian). <br/><br/>Hoping that this will make a small difference..."

","I love science fiction. I loved Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys and Dark City. They all had believable scientific explanations for the plot, but this movie makes no attempt to explain the science behind the infertility or the poverty. After setting through the gloominess, depressing poverty and brutality I was hoping for some coherent explanation of what caused it all. So I watched all the bonus material on the DVD and found the most ridiculous explanations of what had caused the deterioration of the human race. It seems that globalization, capitalism and global warming (caused by capitalism) are the culprits. If you look at the countries with the least poverty, highest standard of living, best human rights records and the least pollution they are all democracies with capitalistic economies. This movie even blamed tsunamis on global warming! What a joke. There is a lot of fiction here but not much science. I really hate movies with such an obvious political agenda."

But somewhere in the middle of the movie, I realized that this wasn't entertaining me. <br/><br/>Fine. So does it at least have a good message, or anything thought-provoking that might make it interesting? No. You see, after I saw that it was casting hippies and left-wing activists as the heroes, I realized that it was just more Hollywood trash. The last straw was when the illegal immigrants were taken to their refugee camp and some of them were being slain Auchwitz-style, and the banner over the door read ""Homeland Security."" There were more instances that I won't get into. <br/><br/>You see, I hear enough Bush-sniping in the news and at school that I don't think that even my entertainment has to bombard me with this indirect Bush, Christians, and business are the devil baloney.

Neither of you will likely be entertained much though."
"prell68","2","2","7","28 January 2007"," What did I not get about this god-awful movie?
","I can't believe the great reviews that this movie has gotten. People must just be infatuated with Alfonso Cuaron's innovative and excellent directing. Unfortunately, it was hard for me to really appreciate the direction of a story that just didn't make ANY sense.<br/><br/>If you saw the trailer or read a review, you know one of the major components of the story going in--there has not been a human birth for 18 years because all (and just?) women on Earth have become infertile. OK, fine, hard to fathom, but certainly an interesting premise. The entire context of the rest of the story goes completely downhill from here.<br/><br/>For some reason, the infertility issue has caused a near-total collapse of most of civilization. That makes some sense. Not having any children in the world would certainly cause a pretty dramatic ripple effect on the world's economy and collective psyche. However, while the rest of the world is going to hell in hand basket, for some completely unexplained (and barely noted) reason, Great Britain is the only country that is still functioning (for the most part, at least). This means that everyone else in the world wants to move there. So, to deal with the massive influx of new immigrants, Britain reacts with draconian anti-immigration laws and refugee camps.<br/><br/>Now we are introduced to the dramatic miracle of a pregnant Kee. An immigration rights terrorist group somehow learns about her and manages to keep this pregnancy a secret (in an era where there are presumably even more cameras, media, etc. than there are in 2007, if that's even possible). Their apparent goal is to get Kee safely in the hands of a mysterious and ambiguous group called ""The Human Project,"" which is apparently a group of world-renowned doctors, scientists, and experts that are working to find an answer and cure to the infertility epidemic. Even though the rest of the world is on the verge of complete societal collapse, The Human Project is for some reason not located in the last bastion of civilization (Britain), so Kee and Theo have to get off the island. In another complete lapse of logic, she needs illegally-acquired papers to LEAVE Britain. It's never explained why the ferociously anti-immigration British government would have any problem just letting an illegal immigrant leave if he or she wanted to. (Isn't that what they want the illegals to do? Leave??) So, anyway, most of the movie is Kee and Theo trying to get her out of Britain. It's filled with compelling and gritty action sequences, and plenty of ridiculous and illogical bits of ""story."" For example, Kee has her baby before she can get off the island. As she and Theo try to escape a besieged refugee camp building, people (terrorist/rebel refugees, innocent bystanders, and the British army) hear and see the baby she holds in her arms. They stare in shock and amazement at this miracle in their midst, but as soon as Kee and Theo get out among the British soldiers, everyone goes back to fighting immediately and Kee and Theo run away. You're telling me that no one (like the senior British army officer there) would be very interested in stopping them and protecting this miracle child? They would really just let them keep going? This movie is just filled with complete lapses of logic and coherence. I spent most of the time sitting there just trying to make any sense of the story I was being presented. And despite Cuaron's expert direction, that's why you go to a movie--to see a good story. ""Children of Men"" just doesn't have one. It's an intriguing premise that never goes anywhere."

And what happens when a woman conceives after 18 years of the world experiencing human infertility? Does it change the events of the world? This is all fascinating to speculate on, to read about, to ponder. The premise sounds like it would make a fantastic movie. However, it doesn't. The movie never really gives us anything meaty to sink our teeth into. I wanted to know what people thought about what was happening. I thought of my own workplace and knew people would be talking about it constantly. Where was all of this in the film? Nowhere.

It was emotional at some points, such as when Theo and Kee are walking down the stairs with the baby, or when Julian gets killed. I really felt during those parts, and I was almost crying during the scene with the baby. The soundtrack seemed to fit quite well, as far as I could tell. One thing that stood out for me was the use of the music just prior to Julian dying. The line was, ""I'm gonna miss you"" and then the death scene happens.

Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed by the incredible surge of energy that ""Children of Men"" delivered. It was both powerful and intelligent as well as disturbing and yet moving with both humor and dread finding a way on to the screen. Our Earth is heading to h*ll in a hand basket and this show brings it all to a very vivid, amazing and tumultuous conclusion. The realism in every frame of the film was exceptional and I found myself with a racing heart, adrenalin pumping through my veins and knuckles clenched in excitement near the end of the film. It was like I could hear my own heart beat in my ears and nothing else. There were many times in the film where I found myself so immersed in the action and emotion that I almost forgot that I was actually WATCHING a film and not simply in the middle of a situation that was going horribly wrong. This really was one of the most interesting films I can remember watching. It made my heart THUMP but not because of fear... it was shear adrenalin that was making it pound and the emotional roller-coaster was part of that adrenalin rush.

Cuaron is, for my money, the most gifted of the three very talented Mexican filmmakers working prominently this holiday season. His is the most mature sensibility, the most subtle and accomplished; the ease with which he does so many things at the same time so effortlessly in this movie will take your breath away. Never clichéd, always surprising, and yet each choice is so perfect you can't imagine it having been done differently.

"andrewnerger","10","2","7","1 October 2006"," An amazing technical achievement - highly recommended!
","Children of Men was a film that I went into seeing which I had no expectations for whatsoever. It is one of those odd films which, despite the big name cast and the huge budget had limited exposure through its lack of advertising. It was only after I saw some bus posters that I sought out more information, having been familiar with Cuarón's other films. Alfonso Cuarón, whose previous two films were essentially coming of age dramas has shown that he is a also highly adept in a futuristic setting. Whilst his take on the Harry Potter franchise may have left some feeling cold in terms of what he did with 'the best book in the franchise', there is no denying that he is a highly competent director and in Children of Men his complex direction shines more than any other quality. There are scenes which literally caught me by surprise, which looked so realistic or so complex that I did not actually know how they were completed. There is a scene in a car as the protagonists encounter a vigilante group in some woods. The camera is constantly floating and is done in a first person perspective, which not only gives you a real sense of claustrophobia but also a great sense of unease - as you can only see what is happening in one direction, instead of the multiple angles of montage that are usually reserved for action films. The constant shots which also look like a one-take shot also highly intrigued me and I still am eager to find out whether they were manipulated by CGI or were actually shot that way. Either way, it makes for a unique viewing experience which acts to increase the tension. Hand-held cameras also appear to be used quite often and it makes for a gritty, almost documentary style of narrative. The next best alternative I can think of to this style is Paul Greengrass' technique in the Bourne Supremacy or United 93. Indeed it is this camera technique which together with the small touches in the mise-en-scene which creates a realistic world. For me, it is all about the small touches in film, since I believe they are what makes a good film great. Children of Men is no exception, the opening sequence alone is full of them. After Owen's character orders a coffee and makes his way on to the London street in 2026 - the viewer is suddenly overwhelmed by these small touches, the different cars, the buildings which look familiar, yet look alien at the same time, the screens in the background advertising something or relaying some news - I was certainly overwhelmed with the level of detail and would gladly choose to watch it again just to try and take in some more of the detail. One of the criticisms levelled against the film is that the idea is great, but the story is poorly executed. Others still have criticised its moving away from the original novel by P.D. James and accused it of being a vitriolic attack on the UKs policies of immigration. Both of these claims I would say have merit and to be honest, they are the only things which prevent me from giving this film a perfect score. Yet with such expert direction and technical wizardry as well as fantastic performances by all involved; Children of Men gets a high recommendation from me. It will most likely be snubbed by any major award ceremonies, but it would be nice to see the technical team get some kind of recognition for creating such a terrifying prospect of the future."

The world is in a chaotic place save for Britain, which has resorted into totalitarian methods in order to keep the desperate immigrants outside its borders. Theo (Clive Owen) is a cynical bureaucrat and a former activist whose life changes when his ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) asks his help to escort a young immigrant girl called Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) to a safer place. Soon Theo finds himself caught in a crossfire on a breathtaking journey through the ruins of England, with a sole purpose to protect Kee.<br/><br/>Children of Men paints a grim picture of a future, depicting a desperate world that has no tomorrow to look forward to. Though the scenario has a fantasy/sci-fiction feel to it, the fact that women has mysteriously stopped being able to have children, the consequences of this total loss of hope are portrayed in the most realistic way possible. This is why the movie works as a topical social commentary on some of the most heated topics of today. Beyond that, Children of Men also addresses timeless themes, telling a powerful story about humanity faced with hope and desperation.<br/><br/>I didn't expect much from this film when I first went to see it, having read a review that gave it an average rating, slating it as a ""naïve and unrealistic"" film. I ended up gaining one of the most emotional movie-related experiences in my life, and learning never to trust reviews again. I so extremely affected by the entire movie that I felt emotionally exhausted once the credits started rolling. As if the plot wasn't gripping enough, the long, perfectly choreographed, seamless shots filmed with a hand-held camera give the movie such a strikingly realistic touch that it's almost impossible not to get emotionally invested in the story, and feel as though you're dragged through the rubble and mud yourself as Theo and Kee's companion on their dangerous route from a conflict to another.<br/><br/>I didn't particularly appreciate Alfonso Cuarón before seeing this movie; now I'm a devout fan. I'm still thoroughly amazed that he wasn't up for an Oscar for this movie, and that this picture didn't receive more nominations at the Academy Awards.

","Fantastic movie!!! Children Of Men has a distinct atmosphere that some may find gives the pacing of the movie a slower feel-- this is only necessary as at most points (the slower points) the pace perfectly mirrors the atmosphere we have found ourselves in while in this dying world. The cinematography rivals oft-cited top film Apocalypse Now, and succeeds in creating a world that is both sadly disturbing and eerily beautiful. It has memorable characters, and surprising moments of touching emotion and sly humor. If not perfectly airtight, it still has an excellent and entertaining plot. One must admire the reminders of the small beauties of life, the beauty and ugliness of humanity that persists no matter the circumstances. Also, there is symbolism planted throughout this movie, both in superficial ways and underneath layers. This I consider this one of the best movies I have ever seen. The theater I was in gave a standing ovation, and I was just overwhelmed by what a well put together film this is in acting, production, and especially setting. It is a modern classic. I recommend this film to anybody!"
"mlawrence-2","6","3","14","26 October 2006"," Well made but rather pointless
","I must admit to being really surprised by the the number of people who seem to think this is a fabulous movie.<br/><br/>How much doom and gloom do you really want to sit through? The action sequences were brilliantly handled and were thoroughly convincing. In contrast to the James Bond style of action which is entertaining but never engaging this film certainly makes you feel the brutality of violence even when delivered by guns rather than fists.<br/><br/>But all through the film I was constantly hitting the brick wall of ""What is the point?"" ""Why am I sitting here?"" I have never found Clive Owen to be particularly watchable. He always reminds me of Clint Walker. Competent but rather wooden. He possesses no particular cinematic appeal.<br/><br/>I am prepared to admit that I may well be in a minority by being someone who was not particularly entertained or enthralled with this picture. Especially since I felt exactly the same about Cuaron's other well known film Y tu mama tambien which I thought was quite a yawn.<br/><br/>No doubt the director is a skilled filmmaker but honestly if you are looking for a film to take your girlfriend to on Saturday night this is not one I'd recommend. The world it depicts is not a pleasant one and after you've endured all the depression it can deliver it simply leaves you with a shudder."
"tfn65125","6","3","14","22 September 2006"," Realistic vision of the future?
","Aside from the main theme of infertility this film is interesting for the bleak vision of the future it offers. With shades of Blade Runner we see a dying world, focusing upon Britain with hints of an even bleaker world outside Britain. With references possibly to the book 'Camp of the Saints' it seems that most of the rest of the world seems to want to enter Britain as a relative safe haven leading to a never ending stream of unwanted 'illegal immigrants', the tide of which is combatted by an extreme populist New Labour style Department of Homeland Security. The resistance are portrayed as a kind of far left 'Worker's Revolutionary' underground, possibly even more brutal than the government; with militant Islam hovering ever present, ready to take over if either the government or resistance should fail - and with terrorist bombs going off all over. One of the most uncomfortable premises resulting from all this, is does it pander to current far-right fears today of uncontrolled mass immigration and what Britain might look like/ be like in the quite near future - i.e a society in chaos and at war with itself? Overall, I found the central theme a little too simplistic, but the style excellent. I would recommend you see for yourself...."

Here's what I found: All of the ""great"" reviews came from September 2006 to January 2007 and the reviews were not in order but peppered in strategically so they would blend in with the ""real"" reviews. This is deceiving and I can only wonder if IMDb didn't get paid by the executives that created this film.

","After watching Children of Men, I can say that in my opinion, it's one of the best films ever made. I know this is a bold statement, but hear me out.<br/><br/>The film was shot and directed with more care, skill and effort than I've ever seen. Alfonso Cuaron had experimented with his famous single shot sequences, as shown in CoM, in his previous movies, but here he has perfected it. There are multiple scenes spanning a few minutes each.<br/><br/>One in particular, which is one of the best action scenes ever (IMO) has explosives, special effects, shootings and a very large area to span, and it's all contained in a single shot more than 7 minutes long.<br/><br/>The entire movie was incredibly thrilling, putting recent best picture winner Argo to shame. It was very well acted too, with Clive Owen giving a powerhouse performance. I'm a huge fan of sci-fi, and CoM not only had a great plot and concept, but it came together beautifully.<br/><br/>I urge you, the next time you're looking for an action, thriller or sci-fi, pick this one up. 10/10"
"joakim-ericsson","10","2","8","7 October 2012"," Probably the most underrated film of 2006
","Simply amazing.<br/><br/>Where to start? Intense, dark, melancholic, but still with a strong sense of hope. Well done, with a realistic and naturalistic feel. Scary in its very plausible portrayal of our near future. A story along the same lines of Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's A brave new world. This movie has the kind of eerie feeling: ""Is this really gonna happen?""... ""Maybe it's already happening?"". Apparently based on a book by P.D James, which I didn't know when I saw the film. Makes me want to read other books by the same author. Children of Men might be a bit too dark for some people, but it is well worth the watch. And it is not as dark as The Road, if that is a good indicator. Intelligent and serious stuff, more than just mindless action sci-fi.<br/><br/>See it!"

","Rented this on a lark.<br/><br/>Its a nice feeling when you walk away from a film knowing that it is one of the finest you have ever experienced. That was the case with this one.<br/><br/>This movie has everything it needs in all the right amounts. Action, drama, enough lightheartedness to break up overwhelming tension. And never before do I think I've seen a story where so much hangs in the balance. Truly a cause to fight and die for. And the performances don't let you forget it. All around amazing.<br/><br/>This film also woke me up to realize the work of Alfonso Cuaron. It perfectly demonstrates what a Director SHOULD do with a brilliant script. Film it Brilliantly. So many sequences are shot in one take. Usually I consider this method a film makers parlor trick. But he does it like a true master. Everything he shows you consecutively is framed up so well you probably won't notice its all one shot unless you really pay attention.<br/><br/>One of my Top Ten Movies.<br/><br/>Disappointed I missed it in theatres."

","The projection of the most dismal future imaginable -- one where all humans are infertile so there's no reason to care for anything because the world will be empty within most people's lifetimes, and where a violently repressive society treats immigrants like animals -- is well done and horrifyingly realistic. It evokes Orwell's 1984 but is much more slimy and hopeless. A few elements mix despair and hope, but it's very hard to process either one.<br/><br/>The timing of the end was a little frustrating, and I thought to myself that it might be intended to leave room for a sequel. But on reflection, I'm not sure one would be desirable.<br/><br/>This is definitely NOT a ""date movie,"" but it needs to be seen by everyone who expects to live another two decades."
"nycritic","10","2","8","8 June 2007"," Tomorrow's Future?
","The world is falling apart thanks to us, no doubt. Society has crumbled down to its core, and to top it all, the ultimate insult -- our very own permutation, our ability to procreate -- has gown down the tubes. The last eighteen-year-old -- humanity's last hope -- has also died, leaving us to hold ourselves in horror and wonder where will We go, where did We go wrong.<br/><br/>Theo is an observer to these events and holds no illusion, so it seems. His cousin collects priceless art and also looks the other way. It's only when he is literally shocked into being due to an explosion that occurs only paces away (as a woman tries to grab her own severed arm, a nod to the Guernica that makes its appearance here) and his own kidnapping by an obscure group with even more obscure motives that his own sense of placement in this wreck called Earth comes into progressive being.<br/><br/>The nexus to this is one dark girl who holds a deadly secret: she is with child. She is, apparently, the only known woman in quite some time now who is pregnant, and successfully so. The group who has kidnapped Theo are a band of militants protecting the girl -- among them Theo's former wife Julian who informs him about the ""Human Project"", an organization which may be humankind's last chance before total annihilation. Their task is simple: escort this girl to the ""Human Project"" before others with less noble intentions will lay claim on her.<br/><br/>I've always preferred this type of science-fiction over the fairy-tale, comic-book type where worlds are at war and spaceships travel to Far, Far Away (with notable exceptions being Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and THE HITCH-HIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY). Because a story set in the future, with 'futuristic elements' needs to appeal to a reader or viewer set in the now, it has to accommodate itself to what we know, what we can feel and sense, what we see every day, the familiar. This world, the world of 2027, looks very much like today -- maybe a bit of an advance here and there -- but is virtually a carbon-copy of what we know and see as today. It could even be argued that nothing has changed because we've stopped to reproduce, so technology has also ceased. Decadence rules supreme, a world gone to pot. We've created this for ourselves and now we're wringing our hands and blowing things up because all hope is lost and the government (whatever remains of it) and renegade organizations have taken their own version of action which constricts freedom to its bare essentials. A group of people decide to stand on their own and face the possibility of self-destruction in the name of saving one person who is the One Person who can save us all. This premise makes for a compelling tale.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron avoids making Americanized heroes out of his characters. Because this is a story set in the dark, Theo is not a particularly inviting character (and Clive Owen is the perfect actor to play him with his dark looks, which hint at menace and possible betrayal). He doesn't seem to care much for anything, until he gets a glimpse of this girl in all her nakedness, and slowly realizes that within this group there are interests that may turn her into a circus freak. The time that Cuaron takes to really shape Theo is priceless, because there isn't a single person who would suddenly jump at the idea of becoming someone's savior and protector, without some serious transformations. Theo's is, needless to say, gradual, but no less potent.<br/><br/>Likewise, neither of the supporting characters feel too unbelievable: Julianne Moore's character, while being well-meaning, is not a strong person. Chiwetel Ejiofor also comes across as misguided, with deadly consequences. Michael Caine is the neo-hippie who has stopped looking at reality, and longs for That Time When. And last but not least, the one with the almost thankless role -- Claire Hope-Ashitey -- holds her own in a role which gets stronger and more determined to find her own footing despite the circumstances which grow increasingly dire."

A take that lasts ten minutes towards the end leaves you on the edge of your seat in awe with the stunning execution of its grace (did I just type that?!?). the story is incredibly plausible and it only goes to prove that us Brit's are the best at the bleak future pictures and have no problems leaving out the sugary sub-plots of romance and the Speilbergian ""cute kid"".<br/><br/>Fantastic.

"japonaliya","1","2","8","3 April 2007"," The Worst SiFi film ever made (Inc. Beast from Yucca Flats)
","Maybe I should have read the book... This was absolutely the worst SF film I have ever seen!! The movie was just a set up for the director's shove it up your ass, political agenda. Yeah, I get all the overblown allegory to the problems of today, but not only was it heavy handed, but a first year film student could have made a better film. Here are just SOME of the reasons: Even if you take everything on faith, SOME background must be given as to the WHY of everything or the viewer can't be engaged. Esp. in SiFi, the story must be somewhat plausible. In the film, we are never told what happened 18 years ago to make the world what it had become. Forget about the infertility, what happened to the US? It is a much larger and stronger democracy than Britain. Who the hell are the Fish, why do they hate the gov.? I can understand the plight of the fugitives, but how did so many foreigners get into England in the first place? It's a fucken island for god sakes! Why would England let them all in, only to put them all in deportation/detention camps? In some scenes, the Londoners go about their business like it's just another sunny day, in others its Baghdad or Belfast to the 10th power! ON a lonely back country road, the car was ambushed, but some how the authorities have PHOTOS of who was in the car! Give me a break. How did the Fish find out where Jasper lived? How did they just happen to find Theo and Kee in the most chaotic crowded of circumstances? Did they have a transponder up Theo's ass? Why does everyone want the baby? Sure, for political reasons, but at least, why would Theo and Kee be so afraid of the Brt gov.? Was Kee supposed to be a fugi? She sure seemed British to me. If it was because it was a black baby, which they said would irk the white establishment, then why were the soldiers so reverent when the baby appeared during the fighting? And could the fight scenes be a more blatant attempt to draw a parallel to the Iraq war? The BAD westerners, oppressing the poor civilians, and the heroic insurgents! I almost choked when I saw the shots of the Arabs marching down the streets with their Arabic banners and machine guns. Yeah, I GET IT. And the best of all is to throw into the mix...the most horrible thing to confront mankind...GLOBEL WARMING!!! Did Al Gore fund this film? Every real scientist knows that though there is a cyclic warming trend, however, not nearly as severe as Mr. Gore would lead you to believe, mankind is NOT the primary cause (and I don't want to get in to a debate here..If you want the truth ask the founder of GRENPEACE among scores of other non-agendized scientists) But to somehow blame global warming for only the next 20 year to virtually put civilization in to chaos????????????? I could go on and on but you get the point. It was a confusing, and purposely vague plot, devised only to get a cross another ""you have been warned"" agenda. (If you don't believe ME, listen to the commentaries and short extra material on the DVD) Yes, I know many Sifi films have a warning message for mankind, but THIS movie was SO agendized that it made me want to puke. I'd rather watch the 911 conspiracy film, or Michael Moore's trash, because at least they are up front about their beliefs and don't have to hide behind the guise of a SiFi movie!"

"Dark Raven","9","2","8","26 January 2007"," Best Film of 2006
","The best film of 2006 in my book. I just watched it again on DVD and its power has not diminished one bit. My girlfriend watched it with me and she knew nothing about the plot which in a way made the movie even more interesting for her. So if you know little about the story, don't read any reviews here on IMDb that might give it away - just watch the movie, you won't regret it. Cuarons direction and Lubezkis cinematography are a match made in heaven. The world feels so real it's scary. It doesn't take too much of a leap of the imagination to imagine things going this way. Clive Owen is just brilliant as a man without hope. He is the Deckard of a new generation. The Production Design is outstanding and has created a world grounded in realism and subtlety. The Effects are fantastic. Just reading about how they did the ""long takes"" on the IMDb links makes me realise that it's an amazing slight of hand. The effects (100s of them) are all pretty much invisible and in my book the best of 2006 also. The sound compliments the look and the music takes the risk of being almost operatic in a very subtle and gentle sort of way. There is no sweeping orchestra here. But even watching the crappy 7 minute featureete on the DVD (extras to be left for a special edition no doubt) it is very clear to see that Cuaron driving the bus. He is the guy pushing these departments for his vision and he is very much in control. I'm in awe of what he accomplished here.<br/><br/>Some people feel Cuaron was snubbed by the Oscar nominations. Yeah so what? Since when did the Oscars ever get it all right? Never. Hitchcock died never having held his own and I gave up back in the mid 90s after one of my favourite films ""Heat"" never received a single nomination.<br/><br/>Between Cuaron, Inarritu, and Greengrass I can almost feel a new wave starting to appear. Directors who inject a level of the hyper real into their movies. They don't feel or sound ""glossy"", and I think this raw realism is refreshing and exciting especially within the realms of genre."

"bk-87668","10","3","15","16 December 2007"," Excellent in every sense
","Children of Men succeeds in being a believable vision of the future, being a genuinely thrilling action movie and keeping its feet firmly in today's reality. Let's take a closer look.<br/><br/>Why the movie succeeds in portraying the future is that it realizes in a few decades nothing really happens. For an example, the TV sets are all wide screen and flat, cars look a bit futuristic but don't fly, the military still uses normal guns. There are subtle hints at how extrapolating from now to the future can produce funny things, such as an old man who listens to Aphex Twin and other music you wouldn't except older people to like. The key is the subtlety, lesser movies overdo this and make everything more fiction than future.<br/><br/>The action scenes were the most thrilling I have seen in a while. Most movie directors think fast-paced editing is the key to excitement and action, and this movie proves they are and always have been wrong. To be exciting, you need uncertainty. Most movies don't have that, you can count on the first billed actors to live so there isn't much excitement.<br/><br/>In Children of Men, the main action sequences consist of one continuous shot (sometimes faked). There is no MTV editing that only confuses and is usually used to hide how boring the action would be without it. The result is something you can admire for it's technical merit alone, not to mention how much it helps to make the viewer a part of the scene.<br/><br/>Finally, Children of Men creates its starting point by expanding on the idea of sectarian violence, bombings and other things that sadly are so everyday even now that it isn't really in the news anymore. While the premise of no children being born anymore is maybe the most unbelievable thing in the film, it works because the setting otherwise is from our time. And you can somehow expect a hellish situation like that can only bring even more uncertain things.<br/><br/>Children of Men was easily my favorite movie of 2006. It also is one of the best movies I have ever seen."
"Gasmandan","9","3","16","19 November 2007"," Enlightening Film
","There are few films among the masses that grant the viewer a long-lasting impression. Children of Men delivers a unique apocalyptic view into the future. Imagine a world where humans could no longer reproduce and the youngest man on earth is eighteen years old. Every country except your own has either collapsed or is in a violent civil war. Every human in your country is pushed to work for a future that may not even exist. Every day counts closer to the end of man. This is the vision that director Alfonso Cuarón brilliantly displays on screen. Set in the year 2027, Children of Men takes place in Britain after a full 18 years since the last baby was born. Theo Faron, Clive Owen, is trapped with a moral dilemma to continue with routine life or join an old friend in saving a woman with the key to the future. Either way Theo must face the end of man with courage to persist with habit or risk the little order remaining. Michael Caine and Julianne Moore both play excellent supporting roles and make the most of their screen time. Children of Men is full of striking emotion, cinematography, and meaning. <br/><br/>The emotion given by the characters is extraordinary. You feel that each character believes their position to the crisis in the world and will die protecting it. The actors bring out the personality of their characters whether it is humorous or stern. You feel connected to the story and pray for resolution all the way to the end. Owen's performance is in tune with the environment from start to finish. Theo is forced to run through and interact in prison camps, war-zones, and forests. Theo speaks to other characters about his concerns and worries. As you travel through the movie you develop your own feelings and attitudes towards each character praying for resolution.<br/><br/>The cinematography is astonishing from start to finish. The scenery and setting are beautiful with complete attention to detail. The viewer is completely entrapped and believes they are part of this futuristic Britain. Broken down buses, buildings, and trains all add to this. You really feel that if the world continues downhill that the cities will become bleaker and rundown. The camera captures all the emotion the characters produce through each sign of dialogue. The movie also contains two long-shots that are possibly the best camera-work I have seen in a single camera pan. One shot was possibly one of the greatest and most believable action sequences as well. The message and meaning of the movie also present a great addition to the movie's analysis. I spent a long time reflecting over the ending and the message the director is trying to convey. The entire film is full of insightful dialogue and shows the relationships we are capable to build with our friends along with our enemies. It shows the will of people in sacrificing themselves for what they believe. Most importantly it shows how man must stand together in order to create a secure future. The selfless actions that Theo Faran learns to accept show how man can change in order to protect the human race are complex and believable. It comforts you knowing I would come to the aid of others.<br/><br/>After witnessing this great film, I say it's a must watch for anyone who appreciates insightful movies. Alfonso Cuarón does an excellent job of leading you down a path towards enlightenment. After an in depth viewing of this film you will feel the need to reflect upon it for awhile and possibly watch it again. The effort put forth by the actors shows the whole cast and crew put their whole attention to creating a truly special film. Future movies will take note of the excellent camera-work and cinematography to try and recreate these brilliant shots. I am unable to stress the wonders this movie has brought to my eyes. Some may complain about straying from the novel, but as a film this is excellent."

Reluctantly, he takes on the daunting task of escorting Kee, the refugee who represents humankind's last hope for survival, out of harm's way and into the care of a mysterious organization known as The Human Project.<br/><br/>The film is a great modern science fiction as it tells a cautionary tale of what could happen in the future.Although it may seem laughable or impossible now,who knows what could be at stake in the future?

Not like some weird blue tall creatures walking around speaking in robotic voices. Last year's District 9 was interesting but this beats it by a mile! An real offbeat flick to savor. Great background score, sophisticated yet bizarre art work to show its 2027 and last but not the least, splendid cinematography. There is a war sequence towards the end which looks like an Herculan task those camera man performed with knack. I think its a long , free flowing single shot. I guess its nearly 15 minutes or more. Having said all these, on its bare bones it has a beautiful story which the director nailed it with style."

","How do you feel about euthanasia? The role of the government in a crumbling civilization? The efforts of depraved religion? Genocide? What about the extinction of the human race and the implications on our behavior if we knew the end was inevitable? In a time when the sound of a child's laughter has become a distant memory we find a society of middle-aged adults surviving in a colorless world. It's a time when the phrase, ""Get busy living or get busy dying,"" bears greater meaning than ever before.<br/><br/>When I try to think of the all the movies I've seen that have made me go, ""Wow,"" I can only name a handful: American Beauty, The Shawshank Redemption, Glory, Schindler's List... and Children of Men. Not only is the cinematography exponentially superior to anything else (keep your eyes open for the two extended scenes without any breaks in the film sequence), but it really, truly opens your mind and your heart to some outstanding questions. This is a movie to watch either by yourself so that you are immersed in the themes present throughout the plot or to sit down with a bunch of your equally philosophical college friends and then debate for hours when it's over. Really, after you've watched it once you'll feel like you have to watch it again just to try and understand the horrors of living in such a depraved time. <br/><br/>It's hard to pinpoint just what kind of movie this is: it is what you interpret it to be. I'd call it an intriguing film with the feel of a documentary and the fast-action pace of other movies featuring Clive Owen. <br/><br/>I beseech you: watch it!"

Which is easily one of the best directed films I have seen in years. Alfonso Cuarn has created an almost doc-style of filming for this film, which truly grasps you from the first scene of a bomb blast to the last.

That one can't really place but just one. But, Pam Ferris character really sums up a lot of the film with one single quote. ""As the sound of the playgrounds faded, the despair set in. Very odd, what happens in a world without children's voices."" There is one huge scene towards the end of the film, that will just leave you breathless.

","I really enjoyed this film, but I found its basic premise quite mad.<br/><br/>The story makes a compelling narrative,Clive Owen was excellent as Theo and the dystopic world a few years ahead of us was brought to the screen with wit and intelligence. The vision of a world that has fallen into endless, violent conflict, like the current Middle East writ large, was a powerful political point in itself.<br/><br/>However, the initial premise of the film seems to me totally perverse. Given that planet Earth is in fact overburdened with a global population of 6,000 million humans and that we are wrecking the environment, polluting the seas, driving other species to extinction, etc, as a result, it is a lunatic idea to posit a world where human population is in critical decline. Talk about burying one's head in the sand! The only person who could fully endorse the film's crazy premise (and the implication that we should all be as prolific as possible) is the pope! (which might explain the hero's name, Theo .. as in theological ... except that the underpopulation premise is completely illogical)."

","""The Children of Men"" by P.D. James (1992) is a good book. It is not very good nor is it medium. It is good.<br/><br/>The ""Children of Men"" is a movie directed by Alfonso Cuarón (2006) inspired by the just mentioned book. As a movie, it is neither very good or medium, it is good. There are plenty of alternatives to this movie but seeing it is not a waste of time.<br/><br/>Now, there is not much in common between the book and the movie. Character names are the same but not the characters themselves. Actually, I wonder why they used the same names for essentially different characters.<br/><br/>The basic story is the same, its background is more or less the same.<br/><br/>The book has a political appeal but it is not that political; it is more ""human"" (feelings, instincts and affections are of course also part of politics). P.D. James would probably not like to accept this, but as the book reaches its end, it communicates more and more directly to our instinct the fact that it was written by... a woman. (A man could of course describe this and that, it is not in the descriptions themselves, it is in the underlying ""how to""). The book, even though absolutely bookish, has a deliberate vocation for a movie script.<br/><br/>The film is an action, political and war movie. Not much ""human"". Indeed, not much well defined. Interesting that the suffering and miserable illegal immigrants in England are German (and also French). Interesting that the English authorities behave as German authorities did during the 3rd Reich. There is even a ghetto. Contrarily to the book, all important cities of the world, including our city, fell into anarchy and or destruction. London was the exception. Is this also interesting? The movie could go without this assumptions. Yes, they seem assumptions to me; whose assumptions are these?<br/><br/>ricemagic.blogspot.com"

Of course, there are haunts of Mad Max, but I felt there was a push to be a little more urgent about the concerns of todays world. Interestingly, my 18 year old son walked away saying 'what a bloody mess', which is a healthy reaction. This movie should rattle your emotions - there is violence, humour, shock and surprise.

"ElMaruecan82","10","1","3","23 September 2016"," An inconveniently truthful masterpiece that'll grow in significance with time...
","Eschatological fears are pillars of religious beliefs and our time isn't the most likely to appease them. Even on a personal level, if the future could be revealed, I'm not sure there'd be many candidates for curiosity. This is why dystopian sci-fi movies are essential, they force us to face the more inconveniently truthful situations. <br/><br/>And we seem to be on the right track for a scenario à la ""Children of Men"", minus the infertility plot. I'm not too far from Calais, the terminal of thousands of refugees fleeing the Syrian War, after a long journey that started in Turkey. But England shut its frontier so that no refugee could ever reach the British Fortress, and I bet the issue weighted a lot on the Brexit vote. And Calais, ever since, become known as the 'Jungle' a lawless place, with more opportunistic than Syrian immigrants.<br/><br/>These refugees are the pawns of a system beyond us all, the fall-outs of wars lead in the Middle East that destroyed despotic yet stable regimes like Libya, Iraq and now Syria, and whose tiny fanatic or terrorist minority might cause the wars of tomorrow. While not caged, the refugees are stacked like cattle and live in horrendous conditions but so are Calais' inhabitants and shopkeepers. And while left-wings group support the refugees in the name of humanity, right- wings groups support the population in the name of 'common sense'. Now, where would you side?<br/><br/>The same goes in ""Children of Men"", where everyone has reasons to fight as the harm is done anyway, and if the film was dystopian in 2006, one decade later, it feels disturbingly realistic. I'm of a Muslim background and there was a scene where Muslim refugees, carrying a corpse, were marching over London, shouting 'Allah Akbar"". For some reason, I thought it was a pretty realistic portrait of the way things could evolve, and maybe I can empathize with European people who'd rather preserve their lifestyle. But they should put the blame on their former leaders and their mistakes of devastating proportions, if anything the world owe them the frontier-less mess it has become. <br/><br/>But if ""Children of Men"" was only about that 'mess' I'm not sure it would have garnered the same critical acclaim. Indeed, a dystopian film better has an interesting story to tell to cancel out the depressing stuff. And it does, ""Children of Men"" starts in 2027 with the death of Baby Diego, the youngest person on Earth, age 18. Cuaron doesn't care for exposition, we get straight to the point that there's a huge epidemic of infertility and the human species is bound for extinction. We don't need to know why and how this happened. This is a magnificent example of a MacGuffin that doesn't raised more questions than needed, that the whole world but Britain is under chaos seems plausible. <br/><br/>""Children of Men"", adapted from P.D. Jones' novel, tackles a subject that is central to Science Fiction, the survival of human specie. And now, Earth is stricken by a disease condemning humanity, it turns out to be every man for himself. One can die if he knows he lets family behind him, but that his memory won't survive to the world is something beyond acceptation, it's like dying forever, it's the deathblow on the only thing that could make men feel immortal. And with this simple premise, ""Children of Men"" exposes us to our human condition, asking a simple question ""now, with all that context in mind, would you die for the only woman who can give birth to a child?"". <br/><br/>In the film, soldiers fight for order, Fishes, a clandestine group fights for the rights of the refugees; but there are also people dying for Kee (Clare Hope-Ashitey) the only woman who miraculous survived the epidemic. Again, the MacGuffin works, we don't need to know why she's spared, there's no time for that, the mission is to allow her to deliver in safety and make her case help to find a remedy to the disease. At first, she's introduced to Theo Caron (Clive Owen) by his former girlfriend and co-activist Julian (Julianne Moore), another Fishes' member Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is assigned to drive Kee and her midwife and watchdog Miriam (Pam Ferris) to the safest place but Theo has to come with them as the deliverer of letters of transit. By the time, he figures out the real motives of some members, the situation gets trickier. <br/><br/>Theo (Clive Owen) starts as the cynical every-man, with an office work and a pot-smoking friend played by a scene-stealing Michael Caine, he thinks his life is meaningless but then he understands that it doesn't amount to a hill of beans to the more meaningful life of Kee and her baby to born. Kee is the resurrection of hope, fittingly a woman of African descent as to remind us where we come from, and the first source of genuine smiles and laughs in a film that is rather bleak and depressing, but how would you expect a children-less world to be? In a way, the infertility cure might be the metaphor for the way we're compromising our future through our actions.<br/><br/>Although I'm tempted to get philosophical, I'd like to end the review in a more simplistic term; ""Children of Men"" is a great film in the Howard Hawks' meaning of the word: three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are absolutely no bad scene and they're three amazingly single-shot action sequences (all in long takes) in the opening, the middle and naturally the climax of the film, who uses the crowd in a documentary-like realism that immediately made me think of ""Battle of Algiers"", released 40 years earlier.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised if Cuaron's masterpiece reached a similar status in 2046 and maybe less surprised if the world looked like 2027 as the film gains in significance as time goes by."

","It's been eighteen years since the birth of the last human child and civilization is barely hanging on by a thread. Clive Owen and Julianne Moore, members of a violent resistance movement, find themselves escorting the holy grail - a miraculously pregnant woman - through the dregs of a dystopian badland. It's a great encapsulation of all the best elements of dark, future-gazing science fiction, hauntingly recognizable despite the distant timeframe. Owen is fantastic in a demanding leading role: part jaded worker-bee, part helpless victim, shattered widower, problem solver and action hero. The film moves incredibly quickly, delighting in its chances to shatter the illusion of tranquility with a jolting change of tone and fortune. One long, jaw-dropping shot in particular has stuck with me for years, even as details of the rest of the plot faded. If you've seen the film even once, you know exactly what I'm talking about. And despite that breakneck tempo, it still somehow manages to work in a wealth of world-building details and delicate character moments. The action scenes are intense and vivid, the moral quandaries deeply disturbing, and its tenor is right on the mark. Epic, powerful sci-fi that teases a post-9/11 distrust of the government without overdoing it."

It's dark and gritty, but there is when the hope and faith of a better world rises. Children of Men is not only a great technical achievement, but also a class of story telling. It don't has captivating characters or memorable performances, but it almost doesn't matter. The story itself is so fascinating and layered, full of possible meanings, that the characters seems like small players in a much larger and bigger picture that is this film's background. Highly recommended. 9.5/10<br/><br/>Worth noting: Children of Men has an all time effort on the editing. The takes seem much longer than they really are thankfully to the perfect image transition done by Cuarón's team.

Clive Owen does a great job in it, but I guess I'm just a big fan of his and he hasn't really let me down yet. The camera work was spectacular, the special effects and the setting was also very good.

","This was a good, fast-paced ""on-the-run""-type movie. If you're looking for strong sci-fi cinema aspects like special effects, exotic sceneries, etc., you won't really get it here - but that's OK as long as you know that up front.<br/><br/>The movie: we are basically given a small group of people on the run. They are trying to get to a certain destination for a particular reason. - and that is the core of the movie.<br/><br/>If that sounds a bit dry, the movie does have its perks. First, the characters are ethnically diverse and well acted. It's interesting to see such ethnic diversity on screen at once - it's kind of unusual given movies up to this point. As far as performances, Clive Owen turns in his usual intense performance and is extremely watchable. The other central characters seem to fade in the background when compared to Owen. Still, they do a pretty good job.<br/><br/>Action? This movie is all about action - the main group is always on the move and the enemy and explosions aren't far behind. There's not a whole lot of intelligence behind all the chasing and running, but the sequences are well-paced, energetic, and often punch out a few good surprises.<br/><br/>This movie felt most like a war movie that takes place in a third-world country. Most of the movie was set to hippie-acid rock music which can be a bit annoying if that style doesn't appeal to you. Also, unless you knew the premise, you'd never guess it was sci-fi.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good chase flick with a war-like setting - this movie is for you.

","This is a very good film... not as good as the reviews would lead one to believe, but nevertheless, much better than a great deal of major studio releases and far better then most major studio science-fiction offerings. The attack in the woods, the escape from the farmhouse and the battle scene at the end have got to be three of the best film scenes of the year, by far. My major qualm however is with the CGI atrocity the filmmakers have decided to use in lieu of an actual human baby. I understand the difficulties (and possible illegalities) of using a baby during violent action scenes with squibs and pyrotechnics flying. I also understand the scene where the baby is born could not be shown as is with a live baby. But there are plenty of other ways around these problems without resorting to a grotesque abomination masquerading as a child. Whenever the infant was on screen, I found myself mesmerized in a sort of repulsed and nauseated trance. And when the old ""foogie"" lady at the end is reaching for it's foot... *ugh*, the baby's foot looks like a stillborn baby Hobbit foot, gray, and lumpily malformed..."

","I left the theater initially just arguing with my dad that the tale isn't so hopeless as he thought. We talked for a little while, and then shortly after we got home, I turned to him and had to give him a hug. The vision in this film is very disturbing, I suspect, because we live in wartime.<br/><br/>Our country is in the midst of a war that we are not certain how to stop, and there are other conflicts in the world around us that we haven't committed to ending. Israel and Palestine, Lebanon, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia-there are many cases right now of desperate armed conflict much like what we see in this film.<br/><br/>It is my sincere hope that HOPE can be revived in these regions: there are relief workers in all of these areas and peace workers fighting for it. Brave groups like Medicines Sans Frontieres, the UN, other NGOs, and parts of our government that are trying to instill hope and foster peaceful solutions. I don't know what can be done in the Sudan, but thinking of people like Don Cheadle's character in Hotel Rwanda, one start is trying to just save lives and say ""Enough bloodshed.""<br/><br/>Even where I live here in New York, we have youth that are used to violence in their lives, along with drugs and teenage pregnancy. However at the same time, in the school where I work, they find hope to go to college, get out of the neighborhood, and/or maybe even change it for the better. I don't think we can call ghettoes and slums lost causes, because once we do all that is left is to cut ourselves off from them like severing limbs.<br/><br/>If we do cut ourselves off from our local and international war zones and conflicts, we will end up creating the kind of apartheidist society envisioned in Children of Men where force is the only answer anyone has anymore. The infertility problem in Children of Men is more of a symbol than a science-fiction creation: it stands to me for a lack of hope, a resignation: King spoke of that death of the spirit that comes when we stop fighting for what we believe in, and to King, that meant NONVIOLENT action against all oppression.<br/><br/>If this film serves as a wake-up call, it will do some good. At the very least, it is a potent well-acted suspenseful allegory. SPOILER: It is enough that watching this film, you honestly believe that gunmen could hush in awe at the sound of a baby's cry. <br/><br/>Let us heal the broken parts of our world."

There were moments of humor, and moments of mind-boggling confusion, and of course, lots of explosions to keep your heart pounding.<br/><br/>'Children of Men' follows the story of a world thrown into chaos by 18 years of world-wide infertility.

","I mean, it is a sci-fi film, but to me it feels eerily and painfully close to our present world. Like a snapshot of our not-so-distant future. I hope I'm wrong about this. <br/><br/>I think Cuarón is one of the most powerful directors we have today. I love the way he handles actors and scenes, making it all seem very realistic, spontaneous, far from contrived, unlike most present-day Hollywood films. The action scenes are breathtaking, but not just because of the masterful way in which they are filmed (with very few cuts or no cuts at all), but because of what we know is at stake for the characters, whom we learn to care for. This may sound clichéd, but in many scenes you actually get the feeling of being there with them. <br/><br/>Apart from a scene near the end which quite shattered my suspension of disbelief for a minute, I think this is an excellent work, with great performances (Michael Caine is brilliant and moving, as usual) and a message about the terrible future (and no,I'm not talking about infertility) that possibly awaits us just around the corner."

The Homeland Security sign over the refugee internment camp told me exactly what was behind this.

","Humanity only survives on hope. Children of Men explores a near future where no children have been born in over 18 years. As anxiety turns to fear and fear crashes into chaos, a single pregnant woman emerges. Theo, a british citizen and cynic, takes charge of delivering the immigrant mother and her unborn child to safety. As a whole, the movie feels strangely hollow. There lacks proper execution on moments that could have been cathartic.<br/><br/>Clive Owen's acting is above average. He becomes his character, but the audience doesn't identify with him. From a cinematographic perspective, the camera work is purposeful and even experimental. Children of Men prefers tracking shots and hand held over gimbals and tripods. There are moments that linger too long and others that leave too quickly.<br/><br/>City of Men is sonically deep. Ever shot contains at least three layers of audio that interplay to the ears delight: dialogue, music/score, and background noise. Small inclusions like the barking of dogs and dredging of mud add an authentic note to bleak dystopian England. The only shortfall is control. Many of the extras' lines appear too crisp and loud. Lines that should be dulled and deafened by gunfire are easily heard. The sound is also overly dynamic. I had to constantly reach for the remote so I could turn up the volume during dialogue and then instantly turn it down when a car chase started. General consistency is key.<br/><br/>Overall, Children of Men proves itself enjoyable. There lies within a moral that should make us ponder about how we treat people."

","This has been a rough decade for film, no doubt. Sequels and remakes ran amok, and works of true originality, artistry, and narrative force are a rarity to be cherished. No film this decade has moved me quite like Children of Men. It's an incredible work of art, a cautionary tale, even a thriller. It incorporates all these elements and pulls them off brilliantly.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron is an exhilarating director. This film is his magnum opus. He commands scenes with incredible power, brilliantly using long tracking shots to create tension as opposed to being self indulgent. He and his writers pulled together a story that wastes nothing, never showing a lack of pulse.<br/><br/>And then, there are those moments of incredible emotional power, scenes that are the payoff of the intricate construction of the film's world and plot.

Owen plays a character thrown into a plan to save mankind by helping the first pregnant woman on Earth in 18 years.

"Robert_duder","8","2","10","11 January 2008"," A brilliant and disturbing vision of the future but lacking a few key story elements
","Children of Men is very close to being one amazing film...a mind blowing experience. The cinematography is as brilliant as they say and as the Academy Awards bestowed on them. The characters are well done and the world they create is perhaps one of the very best in sci-fi movie history. I don't consider myself a dummy by any means especially when it comes to movies but the flaw with Children of Men was some explanation to the main story. I don't understand WHY Julian's people killed her and were trying to take the baby? I don't understand WHY they just didn't go to the police, soldiers or government? Why would anyone want to stop this baby? They don't explain why the human project are the only people they trust with this baby. Without these key questions being answered their entire focus and thus the entire point of the film is somehow lost. You're watching these daring escapes, and nail biting chases and battles and you just keep thinking...why don't they just bring the baby to the authorities because this is a good, life saving, mankind changing event? They just don't explain it and I think it's a huge misstep for the creators of the film and stopped it from being a 10/10 for me.<br/><br/>Clive Owen puts his brooding demeanor to perfect use as the disenchanted, former protester Theo Faron. Faron's back story and his reason why he ends up where he does unfolds throughout the film and he's an intense well written character and Owen definitely embodies the character and really makes it his own. He's the perfect anti-hero for a film of this type. Michael Caine is superb as Faron's best friend (perhaps relative of some kind.) Caine's character is the exact definition of what a hippie would be to us today and he's terrific. Clearly smart, trying to make something better of the world around him and dealing with his acoma'd partner/wife/sister? Many questions not answered. Julianne Moore is decent in a small part as the head of a rebel organization and Owen's ex-wife.<br/><br/>The real magic of the film is not just one performance or one character but the combination of the film making and the brilliant cinematography that I mentioned before. This is a world unlike anything I've ever seen on screen because it looks so real and feels so dark and gritty and believable and the people you see in cages ""Illegal immigrants"" look scared, hungry, volatile and it just sucks you into this world and you have so many questions and unfortunately very few of them get answered. Perhaps by watching the film numerous times and picking apart some of the stories people tell you could fabricate some history but I wanted the film to explain more to me and it doesn't. There is so much detail to the posters in the background, or something on Television that it is the type of film you could watch again and again and take something different from it every time. The battle scenes are just brilliant and so well done and they are no holds barred without any censoring or holding back. For a sci-fi fan you might find this almost too serious and thought provoking and, like me, you might want more out of it. But for those looking for something off beat, and different and diversely intelligent with a very honest look at society then Children of Men will likely blow you away. No matter how you look at it, you'll be stunned at it's depth and honesty. 8/10"

","This is an excellent science fiction film. I don't mean that in terms of the technical film-making, but rather in the way it avoids the conventions of creating an overly futuristic world. You won't see flying cars or a vastly restructured cityscape or all kinds of crazy weapons. Instead you'll see a completely plausible extension of our current landscape and culture which is certainly not expected from the audience. It may not stretch the limits of your imagination, but it will certainly still make you think.<br/><br/>In 2027, the youngest person in the world dies at eighteen years old. For some unknown reason, women no longer have the ability to procreate. Yet despite what seems to be a slow, but inevitable extinction for the human race, they compound their problems by continuing to war with each other in increasing numbers. But there just may be a glimmer of hope. Theo (Owen) a former political activist has been chosen to escort a very special young woman to one of the few safe havens left in the world. It will be a tough, dangerous journey, but the trek is necessary, because she just may be the key to saving mankind.<br/><br/>Nearly everything is handled so perfectly in this movie. From Clive Owen's excellent portrayal of a disillusioned everyman rising to a higher calling to director Alfonso Cuarón's gritty orchestration of a refugee camp uprising, ""Children of Men"" is the rare drama that's both cerebral and action-packed.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" is easily one of the best films of the year of 2006, and not one that can be reproduced anytime soon. 8/10"

So the movie is in its first act light at heart, a strange hippie-dystopian future.<br/><br/>The emotional tone changes with the appearance of the main character's ex-wife (or girlfriend, Moore).

","Frightening movies tend to be scariest when they make us consider the possibility that the movie's fictional story might one day become reality. That's the kind of fear factor we have to confront in this masterpiece called ""Children of Men."" Because it is set some 20 years in the future, the movie has to be categorized as science fiction or possibly prophetic fiction. But the most science fictional element it contains is its well-known premise that the last child is born in 2009 and we human beings find ourselves approaching almost certain extinction until a miraculous pregnancy occurs in 2027. Everything else in the movie is too plausible for comfort.<br/><br/>Although the P.D. James novel on which this film is based was first published in 1992, it could just as easily have been penned last year to provoke discussions on the current state, and possible fate, of the world as we know it in 2008. Issues such as conflicts over illegal immigration, nuclear war, public anarchy, and overwhelming personal angst dominate this film. Depending on which side of the political and nationalist fence one stands on, these elements may or may not appear to be exaggerated.<br/><br/>Clive Owens as Theo Faron, Claire-Hope Ashitey as Kee, Michael Caine as Jasper, and Julianne Moore as Julian Taylor each portray characters that history seems at first to have tossed aside. Theo, Jasper, and Julian have all seen stronger days as youthful rebels but it is the innocent-yet-not-so-innocent Kee who revitalizes their lives and the world's hope with her phenomenal pregnancy. The term ""immaculate"" does not apply here. As they struggle and sometimes die to literally keep hope alive, history turns them into incredibly flawed, wounded, and mesmerizing heroes.<br/><br/>Dystopian in its visionary outlook, ""Children of Men"" contains scenes that are agonizingly ugly followed by scenes that are intoxicatingly beautiful. Those who have read James' novel know that director Alfonso Cuaron took creative liberties with its adaptation to the big screen. Most agree that the liberties taken did the book justice. There are several excellent commentaries on the DVD--one comes from philosopher and social critic Slavoj Zizek, who states: ""Only films like this will guarantee that cinema as art will really survive."" That's of course if films like this remain fiction and real-life artists like Cuaron survive the chaos of modern times well enough to continue making them.<br/><br/>by Aberjhani, author of ""The Bridge of Silver Wings"""
"rjal","6","2","11","30 July 2007"," Not great but definitely makes you think
","It amuses me when reading the reviews for this movie  most of which appear to suffer from a bi-polarity disorder, i.e. they're either of the class 'brilliant, smashing, excellent, ' and other superlatives, or of the sort of 'appalling, bad, waste of time', etc. There are roughly three ways to assess a movie of the kind of CoM  that is either from an artistic point of view or from an intellectual point of view, or anything in between these extremes for that matter. Artistically inclined people will usually rely on what 'gut' feeling or 'impression' the movie gives them, whilst logically or intellectually inclined people will look for the 'great' message and will want to have an explanation for everything that happens. CoM is inclined not to provide either of those, or equally both, depending on your impressions and how much of the plot you wish to be explained or alternatively to be left for personal interpretation. My 'gut' feeling was that the scenery and atmosphere hit the target, in particular, the urban warfare scenes seemed pretty realistic (not that I have  thankfully - ever been in one). Special effects were brilliant in the reverse car chase (also explained in the additional features on DVD) but on the contrary, the escape scene with the car not starting is absolutely amateurish (e.g. Theo pushing a heavy car as if it is a pushchair - which after rolling off a hill, gets stuck in the mud and the next bit looking very much uphill; not to talk about sabotaging the other cars in a minute or so without drawing the attention of the terrorist guards). The terrorists are not always believable, and actually not because of 'why do they want the baby?' to which the answer is blatantly obvious, but because of their behaviour. E.g. why does Luke, who drives the car, seems like a nice guy, then kills two cops in cold blood, and later in the movie it seems that he also knew about the plot of killing Julian, hence he was very much aware that Rado was on the motorcycle. On the other hand, do we need answers to everything? I personally, don't. Thus  I enjoyed the movie because it made me think about how current societal problems could indeed develop into what this movie portrays. Of course there are a million other possible scenarios, and no single director will ever be able to cover them all. In summary, decent movie, not great; but did leave me with that 'gut' feeling ;-)"

I haven't seen other of Cuarón's works, though it has not been for a lack of desire to. This is what I consider to qualify as ""the good type of science fiction""; taking a concept that we can imagine might come true, based on what we have in today's society, and using it for social commentary and exploration of, in this case, humanity. It is also a smart thriller, made for those of us who care about plot twists making sense and holding up. The battles are intense, involving and keep you on the edge of your seat, and the action is not the point, and it is never allowed so much attention that the audience forgets what it's actually about. This can get you to relax then promptly pull the carpet out from under you. It is surprising and dramatic. The effects are completely convincing, throughout. This is set in the not too distant future(with impeccable, subtle inclusion of technology that doesn't feel overly far away from what we have today, which is all credible and doesn't distract), where women have become infertile. Hope is difficult to come by, and chaos is omnipresent. The realism is high, and the documentary-like style is perfect for this, and the long takes are simply breathtaking. Acting is flawless for every single performance, Owen and Caine are marvelous as always. The characters are consistent and nicely fleshed out. This is immensely engaging. The humor is of an appropriate tone and amount, neither making this an overly light experience nor letting it get excessively bleak. There is moderately frequent strong language, some bloody violence and disturbing content, and brief nudity. I recommend this to, well, everyone, really.

There is a documentary condemning Globalization & Capitalism on this DVD titled The Possibility of Hope.<br/><br/>What this film successfully does is it takes our world and freezes it in 2010, but moves forward to 2027 and shows the chaos that is coming with Globalization. The Acronym used here in the US for Globalization is Free Trade. The old saying is that nothing in life is free. This film (and the authors book) attempt to explain that cost and how they see it effecting the earth. Alfonso Cuaron directing is very capable.<br/><br/>Michael Caine proves his acting skills yet again playing an overage hippie in this one. A far stretch from Alfred on the Batman movies, but very well done. The theater sound is nice to have as the movie uses several Rolling Stones compositions to set the mood in this film. They are new recordings by different artists but the songs they use are chosen very well and fit in brilliantly.<br/><br/>Clive Owen as the main character, trying to protect the only pregnant woman on earth is brilliant and Julianne Moore is good too. The cast excels in their roles despite all the technical stuff thrown in. This is the last days of the human race done in high style & concept.<br/><br/>The film is well done & to me a unique & all too rare verdict on the cost of the globalization of the planet. It is done without preaching & paints a world in chaos in a subdued tone. Brilliantly done is the hyperbole, but this film lives up to that premise.<br/><br/>The sound track while subtle correctly sets the tone of this movie which depicts a dreary future for man. If there is a drawback, you need to see the extras on the DVD in order to completed understand what the film makers are doing."

","Almost everything in this film was brilliantly executed. From the acting to the sets, to the story. I have read the book and it is no where near the movie. Alphonso Cuaron needs to consider bringing in more novels to the big screen. Because he knows exactly how to do it. I want to be a film maker when I'm older (I'm 17 now) and this guy is an amazing directer (other than David Fincher and Danny Boyle) and I can say he is an influence on me.

","We have entered the era when a five- (or ten-) minute single take action scene can be faked digitally and everyone knows it - which means that the jaw-dropping power of these ones is no longer a matter of 'how did they DO that?' Instead, it's a matter of conceptual force and directorial control: each of these shots embodies the movie's vertiginous ride through a familiar world utterly transformed and rendered in gripping detail. The way it grafts Big Brother resonances onto an immigrant-persecution narrative is very satisfying, even if the politics are then undermined by yet another gang of meet-the-new-boss revolutionaries. Sure they're saddled with the master's tools, but ultimately they look to me like straw men, to be rejected in favour of the miracle-of-childbirth fantasia. When the world's last pregnant woman is rescued from her fogged-in dinghy by a renegade cruiser called 'Tomorrow,' it doesn't just feel like disruptive irony; it feels like, just maybe, Cuaron's political program is to wish the world would go away. But then again, wouldn't you? And anyway these are basically plot issues; the texture in the characterization, the feeling for distant continuities with the present, and the many mysteries barely glanced on the margins (like, exactly how old are those hoodie-urchins who throw stuff at the train?) make this movie a pleasure and a thrill, and how nice to see Michael Caine in such a beautiful little persona-twister as this."

","This feels like a missed opportunity. I suspect that there was enough in the story and, quite possibly, enough material left in the edit suite, to make this a really top class film. Unfortunately, the director opted for a heavy handed message (hey kids  war's bad, OK?) and a basic chase movie with a few interesting ideas chucked in, instead of a lot of interesting ideas and thoughts with some chases and explosions thrown in.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it is actually a good film, which looks great and has well-judged performances, particularly from Clive Owen. I'd absolutely say it was worth watching. It is just disappointing that it could not exploit the full potential of the premise, so you tend to focus on what the movie doesn't do rather than what it does."

For one, this movie nails all fronts thoroughly. ""Real"" Acting, powerful cinematography, expert directing, and a moving soundtrack all encapsulate this sci-fi venture and catapult these characteristics into sheer cinematic brilliance.

"jmmrvrs","10","1","4","8 January 2014"," One of the Best Ever
","In a world, where could be our very future just around the corner, no one can have any new children. No one knows why nor how it started. In result, the world turns on each other making only England as the only strong nation left that's not in rumble. This now makes immigration even more of a problem as people of all cultures try to sneak into the country, only to be hunted down like dogs and sent to refugee camps around the UK. <br/><br/>Now this is where Clive Owens comes in as he is a selfish, rough man who sees the world as a crumbling cookie getting crushed under our feet as he sees no purpose in the decline of babies or how F***ed up the world as he used to know it is. He then gets offered something that is way bigger than anything that mankind will face s he will serve a protector to a young girl with a world changing secret. <br/><br/>This movie captures a realism of how the world could easily end up if we don't see the evil in our actions or the consequences that will follow as the stoppage of babies is somewhat of a sign from God and his anger with the world and how it looks like he gave up all hope in mankind and left them to kill and tear each other apart instead of bringing the end of the world. The sci-fi traits are there but they are the focus nor even included into the story as the movie mixes future and current day life. The performances sell the intense ""OMG"" moments and believe me there are a lot and they keep you invested into the movie and almost bring you to your knees and have to pray that they survive through the broken world. <br/><br/>Overall without giving anything away, I would like to say I was one who thought this wasn't all that but ended up surprising me like the film's director, who also did my next favorite movie ""Gravity"", is very good at and makes stay with him till the film goes to black and the credits start rolling up. This will be a classic for many years to come for how real and yet not so real atmosphere it creates. Its worth checking out and buying to own forever as part of anyone's movie collection."
"ketgup83","9","1","4","17 November 2013"," Children of Men is one the best apocalyptic films with its brilliant direction and powerful script along with stupendous performances.
","There are movies which you would want to see because of the director's previous work. In this case , I got the opportunity to see Alfonso Cuarón's Children Of Men(2006) after watching his eventful Gravity(2013) and I felt good with astonishing and mind blowing movie.<br/><br/>The year is 2027 and there is only one pregnant women left in the entire world. Former activist Theo(Clive Owen) agrees to help her to transfer her across the border into the safe hands.<br/><br/>The most interesting to watch this film was its unique and attractive story. As you go into the post-apocalyptic world, disturbing images of bomb-explosion, gun shots and innocent killings will haunt you for sometime. However, the film will give a ray of hope when Theo agrees to shift the pregnant lady to a better place. From here onwards, there is no turning back and film will take you to the journey of hardship, struggle and hope to survive. Hats off to Alfonso Cuarón for creating a perfect scenario of post-apocalyptic world and keeping the attention till the end. Script is the hero of the film. Dialogues are punching. Art direction is astounding along with one of best camera-work I have seen in the recent films. The movie completely belongs to Clive Owen and the actor keeps no stone unturned with brave and powerful performance. Watch for him as he traverses between different building in search of Kee. <br/><br/>Children of Men is one the best apocalyptic films with its brilliant direction and powerful script along with stupendous performances. Excellent 4.5/5"
"knowinglygotebola","10","1","4","29 August 2013"," Absolutely Fantastic
","There is no praise too lofty for this masterpiece from Alfonso Cuarón. Every aspect of this movie is flawless and absorbing. I can't say a single negative thing about this movie - it is perfect and brilliant.<br/><br/>The atmosphere and tension of the world Cuarón creates is captivating. Every setting is carefully adorned with hints at the past of the world and realistically given a feel of wear and age. From the chaotic battlefield city to Jasper's house, every set is painstakingly crafted. This believability is compounded by the long takes (spliced, yes, I know. They are nonetheless amazing to watch), which make the tension and horror of the events palpable and visceral. Every ping of a bullet, cry of a dying soldier, bark of a dog is perfectly mixed to create a thorough and captivating atmosphere.<br/><br/>The acting and characterization are wonderful. Michael Cane (once you get past the fact that it is Michael Caine) is fantastic as the Zen- loving, pot-smoking jokester Jasper. Clive Owen is also wonderful. The rest of the cast are all great, playing multifaceted and realistic characters.<br/><br/>The story is heavily changed from the original novel, which I have not read. Cuarón's version is not uplifting, or not overtly so, and is not typical of most movies. But this to me, is a very good thing. To finally get a dose of the world as it usually is, a world that is entropic and cruel, is refreshing and is all the more captivating as it reflects the world we live in. This plot is not the synthetic, traditional, too-good- to-be-true plot so typical of Hollywood movies, particularly sci-fis. It makes fascinating references to the Nativity Story without being overtly devoted to Biblical events, it provokes thought on war, motherhood, immigration, government, and heroism. Some complain about how it is depressing, but this is because it is drawing attention to some of the more terrible aspects of human nature and history. It references the Holocaust, the time of the Black Plague, terrorism, and war that is not unlike the recent wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a thrilling and thoughtful adventure. It is harsh and dark, but captivating and wonderfully rendered. 10/10, one of the best films ever made."
"CUDIU","8","1","4","28 November 2011"," Slightly flawed yet thrilling action dystopia
","What I liked:<br/><br/><ul><li>The directing and editing: amazing job by Cuarón. This is an outstanding directorial and editing achievement. There is mastery in every scene. This, together with the superb production design, totally succeeds. The dystopian 2027 England that comes out of the picture is just frightening. It made me think of Boyle's ""28 Days Later"", a movie that is similar to ""Children"" in many respects. However ""Children"" is superior to ""28"" in almost all regards and certainly Cuarón achieved finer directing than Boyle. Take e.g. some amazing scenes. Those with the Fishes ambushing the car and the escape from the Fishes' country house with Theo pushing the car etc., what astounding pieces of action film! Surprise, rhythm, camera perspective from Theo's point of view, with the attackers close, then far, then close again, then gone: perfect! And of course, a lectio magistralis in long takes: the scene at Bexhill with Theo escaping from certain death into the besieged building to retrieve the baby: hats off, again! (Although Cuaron here is too self-assured in showing how good he is and ends up getting the obvious wrong: I was distracted at the silliness of Ejiofor talking of how nice is to hear a baby's voice while bullets are hitting the wall one inch from his head). And of course the emotional moment of the three fugitives walking through the suddenly silent and astonished guerrilla.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The sheer level of detail that is put in every scene. Tens and tens of small clues or secondary dramatic elements lurk in every shot and enrich it. Far from creating useless distraction, they add flavour and meaning to the movie. See e.g. all these animals that appear and disappear, like dogs and sheep. Same goes for the graffiti, the newspaper clippings, the props, the furniture.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Clive Owen: I am not a big fan of Owen's but this time he got it right. He is convincing in the action scenes, where he does a good physical job but manages to understate the action and thus gives it credibility, as his character is not a super-hero type. He also gets it right in the dialogue scenes and builds nicely on the relationships with Caine, Moore and Ashitey.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The London 2012 jumper: sublime touch. It was the future, it will soon be the present, in the movie the Games are far past, no more than a reason to keep memorabilia in the wardrobe. Plus, how chilling to think that in fictive 2012 the sterility epidemics was already widespread. What could have been the resulting climate during an event that is supposed to celebrate peace among the peoples and the dignity of the human being?</li></ul><br/><br/>What I did not like:<br/><br/><ul><li>The implausibility of the plot: a major problem here. I just can't get it. So, for reasons unknown, Kee is pregnant and is going to give birth. In the first place, it is never explained why she does not go public and tells the authorities. OK, it is an evil dystopian society, but I am sure she would have got safer by doing so rather than escaping under the menace of being shot down. Ah, because she is an immigrant. I still don't get it (Theo states something about this in the movie but to no avail: why?). And then, why this conflict among Fishes and Theodore? He wants to bring the baby to the boat, because this was Julian's wish. But again, why would Kee accept to do it, if she runs the risk to die together with her baby? The promise of the boat and the ""Human Project"" seems too vague and unconvincing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending: just adds up to more implausibility. A meeting with a fishing boat at a buoy off a Channel harbour... I am sorry, but this is not credible! How could the fugitives be there on schedule? A boat approaching a buoy in the mist is not like the 2pm train to Clapham... So they get there, just in time for Theo to die and, like one minute later, the boat to show up. Of course Theo manages to steer a small rowboat right to the buoy in the thick fog. (Although I guess that the choice of having this meeting at sea and having the small rowboat in it does have some figurative, poetical reasons).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ashitey/Kee: especially in her early scenes, her acting is poor and she spoils them (""Wicked!"").</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The music: most of the '70s music just does not fit. I do not understand why Cuarón would choose this, instead of a solid, original score. Or just more silence, maybe it would have helped as well.</li></ul><br/><br/>What I don't know whether I liked:<br/><br/><ul><li>Michael Caine. I love him, but does he get it right here? I am note sure, maybe they should not have had him wearing that silly wig in the first place. Yes, long hair tells us straight away that he is a hippie, but there were a lot of other clues to it. So we have this silly old good man jumping around Owen and saying things about faith and destiny, but I am still not sure to what purpose. And yet... and yet Caine is Caine, he is likable even with the stupid wig.</li></ul><br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a consistent, brilliant, raw yet understated piece of action-packed dystopia with a depressingly convincing depiction of the very close future and some interesting, if hardly noticeable, takes on the world of our days, including mass immigration, the role of nations, the clash of civilizations, the meaning of (bearing) life and, ultimately, the sense that the human species gives to the universe."

From scene one the use of terms like ""Homeland Security"" are aimed directly at the current US position in the Middle East, as are the scenes of ""prison camps"" and brutality against journalist etc. And, of course, there is the Green rant about the environment and it's supposed connection to worldwide infertility. The story was enjoyable as long as I divorced the obvious politically correct message from an otherwise rather good piece of Science Fiction entertainment.<br/><br/>I guess lots of people like to feed their egos at the cinema and I am sure this one was a self congratulatory pat on the back for all the extremist out there.

Clive Owen was amazingly brilliant and along with stellar performances by the supporting cast, this film takes the viewer along for a meaningful look at what our world could easily become. From script, acting, directing, location, and cinematography, this film will not leave you bored, but leave you wanting to know more about the future of mankind. Michael Caine captures the essence of ""an old hippie"" with such heart, he's easily the most lovable character of this film.

"rgunthersara","Null","1","4","28 April 2007"," A brilliant thriller
","Alfonso Cuaron has created a clever and moving rendition of a very British P.D. James novel about a dystopic not-so-future world. Famous for her intelligent police procedural novels, James devised a story set only 20 years into the future in which for unknown reasons all the women on earth have become infertile. As the world turns to violence and chaos, the British settle under an oppressive dictatorship while awaiting extinction.<br/><br/>The casting is near perfect. Clive Owen as Theo turns from a world-weary bureaucrat into a hunted man and maybe the first true 21st century protagonist embodying both the pathos and passive aggression of a modern culture built on office politics and water cooler intrigue. The characters he meets along the way  his ex-wife, the rebel ""fish,"" the refugees who come to his aid, and an old friend and aging hippie (played by an unrivaled Michael Caine, who is only growing better with age) are all succinctly and ingeniously realized.<br/><br/>The film successfully demonstrates the fragility of humanity in the face of a tyrannical protectorate, who often do more to create than oppose violence. Without extending its reach into the realm of agenda film-making, its themes feel alarmingly topical and raw, from subtle commentary about immigration to homeland security. The film never makes a statement at the expense of the story or becomes ""about"" political meaning. It's voice remains uniquely centered on humanity and the emotional truth of the characters.<br/><br/>Cuaron has turned a fairly rare novel into a modern screen gem without polluting the original concept. If anything, he adds an immediacy and intense realism to the source material. He is a very smart and intensely interesting filmmaker and I'm sure we will be seeing even greater works from him in the future, which may not be so far away after all."
"kent-104","9","1","4","27 April 2007"," Brilliant movie-making
","Alfonso Cuarón has created a movie which transports you 20 years into the future and blows your mind away with incredible cinematography, exceptional acting and action, and long, complex film takes which seem almost impossible to accomplish.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Clive Owen plays Theo, a depressed alcoholic who, like most of the planet, has lost hope for the world as women worldwide have suddenly lost the ability to bear children. He becomes embroiled in a plot to transport a pregnant woman to a project intended to solve the infertility crisis. The world's governments have become more of a police state, and Theo walks through life with a keen sense of depressed normalcy.<br/><br/>The movie makes indirect points about government and military use of power, terrorism, what we take for granted, living in a war zone, minority and immigrant rights, and how one would act in a crisis.<br/><br/>The movie was gripping and poignant, and I re-watched many of the scenes again on the DVD to try and figure out how they made such an incredible world.<br/><br/>Obviously, not for all; I have read many of the negative comments about people finding the plot and character development to be poor, the storyline to vague, and all of the ""unanswered questions"" that were never answered, as well as the ""I must be crazy but this movie sucked."" To the detractors: IT'S A MOVIE. You have 1:40 or so to get a story across. It's not a book where you have 300+ pages to go into intricate detail. You can't explain everything, and in many ways, not explaining everything stimulates your imagination which I assume those who couldn't figure out ""why"" the world went to hell. Much is explained about Theo, Jasper, and even Julian to give you a rather good idea about their past and what motivates them.<br/><br/>All in all, go see this film on DVD, it's a great political action movie."
"hugo_goedel","5","1","4","21 April 2007"," Two contradictory visions of the future packed into one film
","The film depicts a not too distant dark future in which natural resources like drinking water have apparently become so scarce that most societies have fallen apart among fights over their distribution and instead turmoil and chaos are ruling. Britain has kept its status as a nation at the price of becoming a brutal police state that doesn't respect human rights any longer in its fight against rebels and refugees from other parts of the world. (The latter of whom are kept and treated like animals while getting deported into refugee camps.) The other vision which the film presents is that of the infertility of mankind for unknown reasons so that 18 years have passed already since the last birth of a human being.<br/><br/>This is the background on which the story is developed. However, the problem I have with this is that both of these visions don't fit together very well. Many of the environmental problems we are facing today and will be facing in the future are more difficult to solve due to over-population and would rather be relieved if mankind would diminish every day. Also the fights over natural resources should decrease and not increase if all humans knew that the days of mankind are counted and that day by day there are fewer people among whom they have to be shared. So for me the different aspects of the film simply don't add up to a plausible whole.<br/><br/>The story which evolves on that background is not very plausible either. There are different sorts of rebels (""fishes"", ""fugees"") fighting against the government and also having their own inner fights. A young refugee woman has become pregnant against all odds and for some reason is now trying to get to some mysterious ""Human Project"" with the help of some untrustworthy rebels who apparently have their own hidden agenda.<br/><br/>Since from today's perspective the worsening of the environmental problems is by far more likely than global human infertility, the film would have made a good comment on our problems without the latter point. Perhaps the authors were just uncomfortable with the message that would have come across then: Namely that less humans would actually be a good thing and not something to be dreaded. With the combination of those aspects the message is mixed if not to say contradictory: Humans can not peacefully coexist with limited natural resources and yet their diminishing would be a catastrophe.<br/><br/>The film deserves some credit however for its strong and impressive imagery."

"dee.reid","10","1","4","27 March 2007"," Where have all the children gone?
","In Britain 2027, it has been 18 years since the last recorded birth of a child. No explanation is given in ""Children of Men"" as to why there has been worldwide infertility. (What's the matter, us guys can't get it up in the year 2027? Are all the ladies of the future on the pill?) OK, so I'm a little bit crude, but still it's scary to think that in ""Children of Men"" humankind is on the verge of extinction simply because we can't procreate. Based on the 1993 book ""The Children of Men"" by British mystery author P.D. James, ""Children of Men"" envisions a future world where the last child, an 18-year-old boy, was the victim of an assassination, and now it appears that humanity has lost all hope. Alas, a miracle echoing the Virgin Mary Herself is discovered: a young woman, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), is pregnant, and it is up to government bureaucrat Theo Faron (Clive Owen) to safely deliver her to a promised ""sanctuary"" far away. Of course, the task is easier said than done, as Theo, Kee, and several others (including Julianne Moore, in a 30-minute cameo as Theo's revolutionary ex Julian, Michael Caine as the humorous and senile Jasper, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as the rebel Luke) have to fight through political unrest and warring factions to get to the safe haven. The director behind this project is Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron, whose subject matter takes a look at today's world and transposes to a time that is not all that far-fetched. This is where the film's key brilliance shines. It is also why I've ranked this within my top-10 greatest sci-fi movies. The sci-fi genre is known for some brilliant movies (1982's ""Blade Runner,"" which ""Children of Men"" has been called the 21st-century equivalent of), and many bad ones (that are too numerous to mention). ""Children of Men"" envisions a world of vast political turmoil and upheaval that is not too far off from the way things are looking now. Cuaron's oft-hand-held camera is with us all the way of Theo's journey, many times capturing with up-close authenticity the war zones of the future, and this incredible camera-work rightfully earned Oscar recognition for cinematography and editing. I only anticipate this picture gaining greater appreciation in the years to come.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I had great hope when I first saw the reviews. really should have known better. Hadn't seen such juvenile SF fluff since the glory days of my youth. Eerily reminiscent of junk like ""ZPG"", but possibly even more empty, and pointless. I just watched the DVD an hour ago, and really, all I can call to mind is Michael Caine smoking a joint of his ""Strawberry Cough"" marijuana. good laugh, Michael...<br/><br/>Junk SF doesn't die, it just waits 20-30 years, until we forget how stupid, and boring it was, and tries again. This was all bluster, with the most pedestrian ""Action"" scenes I've ever seen. I always enjoy Michael Caine, but his part in this was brief, and rather minimal. (he's much better as ""Alfred"" in ""Batman Begins""). It tries to present a true Dystopian vision, but it's absolutely nothing we haven't seen done better, before."
"trixie1127","6","1","4","24 February 2007"," A thinking person's thriller? Thinking about what?
","The cinematography is stunning. That's about it. Somebody called their review ""A thinking person's thriller"" - thinking about what? I don't have a problem with a ""what if"" factor, it's an integral part of fiction: what if (due to pollution, hormones and/or preservatives in food, or whatever) we did stop breeding? It's a fine premise for a dystopia. What stumped me is the confusion around the political points the writers were trying to make about illegal immigration and didn't quite succeed. If the UK is the only country left standing, *should* it let everybody in and make room for them? Why? Then again, considering the march of young Muslim men waving rifles in the refugee camp and chanting ""Allah Akbar,"" maybe they *shouldn't* let everyone just run loose? Maybe not. Maybe the walls around the refugee camp aren't thick enough. But maybe they also shouldn't beat the refugees and push them around and yell at them. They probably shouldn't. But being the only country left standing, a country the size of a handkerchief, the one everybody wants to get in, maybe they're a little stressed out? Unfortunately, the filmmakers spent a ton of screen time on creating this pseudo-political confusion, at the expense of creating their main character. Who is this dude Theo and why does he do the things he does? He just wanders around in a daze without any apparent motivation other than the memory of his dead son, which is an unbearably lame cliché and explains nothing. Until the end, we never get to know him as a real person. It helps that Clive Owen is so easy on the eye, but if the main character never comes alive as a person, the story isn't worth following, and what happens to him doesn't matter all that much. The other characters are just as one-dimensional and archetypical, and that hampers the acting, even from such favorites as Michael Caine, even though he knocks himself out to give his character an extra dimension, which brings it to a whopping two. And that's a shame, because it could have been a good story if the writers (I mean the screenwriters; I haven't read the original James novel) focused more on the human beings at the center of it than on the difficult and complex politics of illegal immigration, about which they don't seem to know much.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's worth repeating: the cinematography, the whole look, is excellent."

","""Children of men"" is one of those politically engaged well-thought movies that seem to be quite numerous lately. Pretty much every ""hot potato"" is discussed in this movie from environmental issues to immigration. For an unknown reason, women worldwide started losing their fertility. In a totalitarian England of 2027, a handful of activists are challenging the government's abusive responses to increased illegal immigration. Theo (Clive Owen) was one of the early members of the resistance but turned cynic along the way. His long lost love asks for his help and as he discovers what seems to be a miracle. The cast was pretty good, and an amazing soundtrack made watching this piece a great experience. The level of realism was top-notch throughout the whole movie. However, it seems to be propagating the myth that Arabs/Muslims are inherently violent. Every time there's a terrorism act, the main character (Theo) assumes it's Islamists. In a ghetto (Bexhill) turned into a conflict zone, an angry mob of Arabs, most of them wearing masks, carry machine guns and chant ""Allah is great"" in Arabic. Grafittis on the wall read ""Uprising"" written both in English an Arabic (Intifada) that is reminiscent of Palestine. The ""Intifada"" was a response to half a century of oppression and destitution and using the imagery in the movie only accentuates the cleavage between the enlightened few and the majority that relies on mainstream media for information. Nonetheless, the movie was very enjoyable and if you're looking for entertainment I would highly recommend it."
"movie_maestro1","6","1","4","8 February 2007"," Hope for Man, Hope For Film
","Britain, 2027. Women are infertile. Society is collapsing. No more children are being born and the end of the world is nigh (""the last one to die, please turn out the light""). Theo (Clive Owen) joins a resistance group who have discovered that one of their members is pregnant. He now must go on a dangerous journey to the coast, so that the mother and the unborn child that hold the only hope for mankind can escape to a secret colony, dedicated to preserving the future of humanity.<br/><br/>With such an intriguing premise, this film at the very least cannot fail to be morally interesting. Although it never fully explains why women have become infertile, it is evident that it is the result of large-scale ecological factors, such as global warming and pollution of the rain forests. Although not a fast-paced film, the narrative holds together extremely well and rarely leaves time for boredom. It is also often very violent but always remains true to the realism of a British dystopia. I think this is predominantly due to Cuarón's outstandingly claustrophobic direction that makes the viewer utterly emphasise with Theo and follow his journey almost through his eyes. The acting is incredible from all parties, particularly a fun loving, yet serious portrayal from the great Michael Caine.<br/><br/>This film is superbly acted and displays an absorbing and extremely thought-provoking plot. This, coupled with the top-notch direction, makes this film a must-see for all serious film-goers. Although often an uncomfortable viewing, its bittersweet ending round things off to a tee and leaves the viewer with a poignant but thoroughly satisfied feeling."
"jpschapira","6","1","4","5 February 2007"," I wanted to...
","There's another reality presented to the viewer in ""Children of Men"", but a reality not very far from ours now. In 2027, televisions are not something from other world, neither are cars or coffee shop. In the latter one, Theo (Clive Owen) is drinking a black coffee soon before everyone in the store is blown out after he leaves.<br/><br/>The planet is falling, everyone is at war but Britain resists. Every immigrant is deported as illegal and locked up in prison; people construct safe houses in the middle of the forest. The youngest person in the world has died with 18 years old; everyone is cryingThere hasn't been a new-born in almost two decades, there is terrorism and revolution.<br/><br/>These and many other things are what the complex screenplay written by Alfonso Cuarón and four other people based on a novel by P.D. James presents. In lots of ways, ""Children of Men"" reminds the viewer of ""The Constant Gardener""A man in search of a truth; defending the dream of someone else. However, it is something different too: because of the characters and the lack of insight.<br/><br/>I wanted to like the film and I wanted it to be good; it has many good things. For starters, Emmanuel Lubezki's beautiful cinematography and his exceptional use of the light. Jim Clay and Geoffrey Kirkland's production design; empty but full. Finally, Cuarón's unique and truly stylish use of camera. And I mean not constant and confusing movement in the signature of Tony Scott; I mean accurate movement and a camera shooting with blood all over it to maintain the reality of the environment.<br/><br/>And a dark environment it is. Sad and dark indeed. Between all this darkness and sadness, Cuaron's seeks for a little light, while telling a tale of sacrifice. As I said, we want the light to shineClive Owen does his best in another regular film of his, where, when all of his characters are different, he generates one thing in common of them: they are unconventional heroes; and he is the only one who plays them with all the necessary elements.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore, a terrific actress, is presented as a main part of the ensemble but does a very inspiring little appearance. So does a very relaxed Danny Huston. Michael Caine gives a little less effort after his big part in ""The Prestige"", and Chiwetel Ejiofor and Claire-Hope Ashitey are true acting revelations in their roles.<br/><br/>Cuarón, a director I admire very much, craftsman behind ""A Little Princess"" and ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", a master at finding light in the dark; fell a little short in this occasion. Anyway, don't miss this one: a fine demonstration of cinematographic quality in general."
"sjl004","7","1","4","5 February 2007"," Great action but VERY weak storyline
","Yes its realistic and yes there is great action ala Frankenheimer, yes great cinematography ala Kubrick and suspense and thrillers ala Hitchcock but the plot just seems a little lame and like A for Andromeda, a British film that was a little amateur and soppy.<br/><br/>Little music (thought this would add to realism but I guess not).<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad, Peter Mullan and Chiwetel Ejiofor stood out for me and have always enjoyed their performances and welcomed Julianne Moore and Michael Caine as always. Clive Owen is in the film in every scene and his acting, despite his tone and wooden speech is a joy to watch. The fact that the one sentence plot is taken in this direction just seems a little tedious. I enjoyed it and the plot (computer game style scenario encountering numerous obstacles on the way) but I guess a subplot may have helped."

","I wasn't going to write a review until I read some of the negative reviews for this movie. What the hell Strawberry Cough are you fools smoking that think this movie is bad? In an era where 90% of movies are watered down tripe designed to satisfy the 10 second attention span populace that normally goes to movies, this is a bright star in a dark galaxy.<br/><br/>Cinematography is great. I could see how some people could quibble with hand held cameras, but I like it here. The concept is great. I think the small touches throughout the movie are fabulous like the signs, and billboards and whatnot.<br/><br/>Rarely are movies done about the future where I say to myself ""you know, I could see the future being like that"". It's a complex and difficult thing to predict the future in a movie. Will it be completely technologically advanced, will there still be combustion engines, what about weapons, etc. This movie seems to get all of those aspects right.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is really what shines the brightest though. The beginning and middle are certainly solid, but the end is just magnificent. If you watch this movie and you don't at least have some emotion towards the end you are a soulless scum sucking waste. I'm a hardened movie vet and I had to check myself because I think I got something in my eye at the end of the movie (if you get my drift). Watch this movie with your lady and she will be bawling and happy at the end. A rare combination.<br/><br/>Can you somewhat predict the end once you put together the pieces about 1/3 of the way through the movie? Yes. But you know what, it still doesn't matter. The execution of the final scene is incredible.<br/><br/>As another reviewer said, go see this film, support intelligent cinema, there isn't much left anymore."

The acting was good, particularly relative newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey in the role of the pregnant Kee. The scenery was gritty and convincing. And there were a lot of pieces in the lives of the characters that should have made be believe these people cared about each other and made me care about them. But it never quite got there. Part of the problem I felt was the lack of connectivity with the background. I kept asking how the chaos in the streets and cruel xenophobia connected with failure of humanity to procreate? It was never explained. It was just there. An interesting disappointment, but a disappointment just the same."
"cypher184-1","4","1","4","25 January 2007"," A fantastic story ruined by an overtly political director and poor screen writing.
","I saw this film last night, and was sorely disappointed. After reading the reviews here on IMDb and elsewhere, I was expecting an engaging thought provoking film. What I got was anything but...<br/><br/>While I did find ""Children of Men"" to be masterfully shot, and wonderfully acted, the film itself was a severe disappointment. One is nearly beaten over the head with Director, Alfonso Cuarón's anti-Bush and Anti-Iraq war statements throughout the movie in overtly obvious and uncreative ways.<br/><br/>Early in the movie the assault begins, when during an interior shot of the country retreat of Jasper Palmer, wonderfully played by Michael Caine, one is force fed pictures of Anti-Iraq war protesters which supposedly happened twenty years before the events of this film are to have taken place.<br/><br/>Later, when the characters reach the ""Fugie"" refugee camp, the background is filled with reenactments of the Abu-Ghraib photographs. At one point an panning shot shows an man in the olive drab poncho and black hood, standing on top of a box with his arms outstretched in an exact replica of the world famous Abu-Ghraib ""torture"" photo. Next to him is a cluster of men in their underwear cowering back from a guard and his snarling, barking dog.<br/><br/>It is these types of overly political statements that abound in this movie, that show that Alfonso Cuarón was more interested in the making a statement with the film than telling a good story. The real crime, is that those overly overt images were not needed to make the film's viewers consider such deep and meaningful questions. The book's subject matter already invited thought on the subjects of politics and immigration. Mr. Cuaron merely cheapened that internal dialogue, and dated the film with his horrible screenplay.<br/><br/>I would recommend that potential viewers wait until this comes to cable, as it is definitely NOT worth paying movie house prices to see. Spend the money on the book, and watch the movie for free once it shows up on HBO or Cinemax."

The movie starts well, you get a little lost in the middle, and the end, was surprisingly disappointing. I actually thought the movie broke while watching the end, the movie title just pops up. I though it gave a great feeling of, we ran over budget or something. I gave it a 5 out of a 10. I want to stress the story idea, and acting was AMAZING, the movie itself was disappointing.

All in all I feel like I wasted my money and my time seeing this movie. I wished I was better prepared or had possibly understood the story a little better. Some of the back story was very vague at best and possibly not explained at all. That all being said, the acting was decent and I felt connected at parts."
"sarastro7","9","1","4","14 January 2007"," Another art movie
","If you try to watch Children of Men as a straight story, it has many shortcomings, against which many criticisms can be leveled. Too many questions, too few answers. But it was an art movie, making a statement about the apathy infesting our own current world. People have lost the ability to love. Children, of course, represent love. But people are crashing emotionally, becoming increasingly isolated as the old networks of mutual support are collapsing due to the heartlessness of the modern, money-grubbing lifestyle. So things are looking pretty grim.<br/><br/>Fortunately, somewhere, there are still a few people left who can sustain the high spirits that have died in most people. This movie is about their against-the-odds struggle to keep that fire burning, and hopefully one day transfer it to the rest of humanity. This is all the movie is about, and it is minimalistically structured accordingly. Nothing extraneous is included; not even the kind of details that would have made this a wholesome story with a clear internal point. Such things would have detracted from the real message, which is that we are becoming too cold, and we better start rekindling some passion, or we'll eventually destroy ourselves.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

","...not even the fantastic Clive Owen and superb Michael Caine can make this movie work to the level that I'm guessing the Producers initially envisioned. The concept and storyline is great but - the finished movie does not work - it lacks ""flow"". I know this sounds harsh but my sense is that the director did not give the actors sufficient attention and was probably more preoccupied with technical aspects of explosions and logistics. The ""extras"" in the crowd scenes were all ""over-emoting and over-acting"" and in the face of having to work with poorly directed actors, I don't know how Clive Owen kept a straight face at times. The movie suffers as a result as although I am a huge fan of the main actors, I was very disappointed with this movie. The choice of music throughout (except for the rock music which was great) was completely wrong for this film - it did not connect with the visuals at all. Normally I NEVER talk through a movie and save my comments for afterward with friends, but we were all fidgeting and muttering comments throughout because there were parts which just did not even fit together. Poor direction and perhaps poor editing, not sure, as an editor can only edit what's there. And the key scenes are all very unconvincing. The locations were pretty good and captured the cold, wet English environment. Don't want to be more specific as it will spoil the action etc. Good news: for me it was worth sitting through it just to see another incredible performance by Clive Owen and an equally amazing performance by Michael Caine."

","I remember watching Alfonso Cuarón's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which was for me the first movie I saw by him. Great film well executed, but there's not much to add to a movie thats got its whole story and visual style laid out about.<br/><br/>So to see Children of Men, I came into the movie with very little knowledge about everything about this movie and I have to say the story was spectacular and provocative but once the movie started going, the whole story kinda too a back seat to what was really happening in the movie which was very simply an action-movie about one character guiding around the pregnant girl all movie. I feel like I didn't get enough time to tune in and feel anything about the immigrants, if they were even spose to be part of the main story or much else that was going on outside the main journey involving Faron and Kee. Cinematically, it was absolutely breath-taking, and all the shots were just so well executed and performed. But beyond that I think it lost some of what it first brought to the dinner table."
"TheMovieCritique","8","1","4","7 January 2007"," Grit. Power. And human psyche. It's all there.
","This one was an truly a pleasant surprise I must admit.<br/><br/>I walked in to the hall vaguely knowing that this was supposed to be a futuristic thriller. I expected to see something on the lines of End-of-the-world-is-coming and there's an average man amongst us who incidentally turns into your run of the mill Rambo/G.I.Joe to, oh well you know, save the world.<br/><br/>I was wrong. By a long shot. This movie seems to be real in so many different ways.<br/><br/>First, the setting - a not so future world of 2027, devastated by nuclear war, where the most essential expression of human existence a.k.a ""procreation"" ceases to ""create"" any longer. An unexplained phenomenon of falling sperm count has rendered the human race unable to create any children. What might happen if something of this magnitude is thrust upon us? The movie tries to answer these questions in many dimensions - politics, religion and in all how society reacts to this calamity.<br/><br/>There are so many snippets in the movie that hit you hard about how humans might react. Like the religious zealots who have polarized a section of society to believe god will deliver the human race from this calamity. Like the regular violence by different terrorist groups, pushing their own agenda, that has been imbibed into human lives as an everyday affair. Like war savaged countries not being able to control their populace. How in a world where survival is a miracle, the few who have power live in opulence and the rest equate to less than animals. How democracy turns into a police state in the name of Homeland Security. How refugees are persecuted to keep the ""nation"" safe. In short, as the chief protagonist in the movie states - ""The world went to sh*t"".<br/><br/>Theo (Clive Owen in a befitting role) is government employee in the last seemingly functioning government on the planet - The British. A proposition with a rebel group to transport a girl across the border gets Theo involved with a girl who, after a gap of over 18 years in human world, is pregnant. This ""miracle baby"" is sought out by different groups pushing their own interests. The adventure tells the, very gritty squeamish and hard hitting, tale of their journey. And thankfully, without resorting to too many Hollywood antics.<br/><br/>Special mention must be made of Micheal Caine in the role of the hippie Jasper. He makes those future hippies look good already! The final action sequence is so real that for a minute I was confused if I was seeing real footage of the conflict in Serbia/Bosnia.<br/><br/>It makes you wonder, if there are no more humans being born, wouldn't we work harder to preserve what's left of our species instead of killing each other more vehemently than ever? But then looking around the world, the reflection of reality is that ""fear"" and ""violence"" seem to the more powerful forms of human expression. As shown in the final sequence of the movie, even a ""miracle"" just stops this form of human expression for a little over thirty seconds.<br/><br/>And if a movie makes you wonder about stuff like that. Then, by Jove, it's a pretty darned good movie. It sure is."

Shots of ruins, stories of lives shattered, and a ending so surreal that had everyone in our theatre saying ""what if?"" In short, there is nothing anyone can say that would do the film any justice.

The infertility was just a great idea to make this movie stand out! This movie is the kind of movie that will have a sequel, but instead of a progression of the story it should show the same time line from a different perspective.

There have been many reviews criticizing the unanswered questions about the siege of Seattle, why everyone wants to go to England, why women are infertile, and more. However, the answers are certainly in our imaginations living in the world we do today. The plot could certainly have been fleshed out more to include these answers, but the movie would have had to be three hours long instead of an hour and 45 minutes. <br/><br/>I was left feeling very hopeful with this film. This says a lot considering the entire film is about as full of despair as any film could be. I preferred not having every little detail explained and the gritty way it was filmed.

"aharmas","10","1","4","7 January 2007"," Cuaron and his portrayal of hell on Earth
","It is seldom when you see a movie and call it a classic the first time out. This remark is not necessarily referring to something innovative and original, but it is a clear appreciation of how seldom we see a master at work, and here is Mr. Cuaron giving us another example of his remarkable directing abilities. He has already given us ""A Little Princess"", ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", and one of the better Harry Potter entries, and this time he turns visionary and presents us with a visionary masterwork to make us think about the consequences of our actions.<br/><br/>The film is not preachy and overacted, and it certainly works beautifully because of Cuaron's command of the camera and his reliable cast. In truth, the cast does very well under his direction, but one can almost sense any other good actor would have been if guided by Cuaron. Cuaron's film moves quickly, never faltering and calling too much attention to a particular aspect. It just depicts a horrible, not too distant future, and it benefits from having technology that allows Cuaron to fully express his vision.<br/><br/>The entire film is bleak, and most people will be captivated and might be repulsed by the images, but it is never average. It delivers what it is supposed its themes and images. The last third of the film will envelop you with its sounds and capture your spirit, as it shows that hell is something we are fully capable of creating.<br/><br/>The film ends abruptly and this might upset a few. It is sort of an ambiguous ending, and we can only rely on the power of optimism and faith to put the rest of it together. It is a tribute to Cuaron that we don't feel critical, only thankful we have gotten this far, and we are still hungry for more."
"DonFishies","8","1","4","6 January 2007"," Visually astounding, but the storyline lacks depth
","I am not sure why, but Children of Men never stuck with me as one of the must-see movies of the latter half of 2006. It looked interesting yes, but never seemed to be anything more. But curiosity got the better of me, and despite being disappointed by the film, I can still honestly say I was visually astounded.<br/><br/>The film takes place in Britain in late 2027. War has plagued and destroyed many of the world's nations, and Britain, albeit in ruins, is the only real nation left standing. Activists are continually trying to undermine the government. At some point, women became infertile, and thus, no children have been reproduced for almost twenty years. The film opens on a television broadcast announcing that the youngest person alive had been murdered, and thus, has left many people in tears.<br/><br/>Theo (Clive Owen), a public servant and former activist, seems very numb to this depraved act, and just tries to continue living his borderline alcoholic lifestyle. Soon after, he is picked up by a group called The Fishes, who just happen to be lead by his ex-girlfriend Julian (Julianne Moore). She wants him to get the necessary papers to allow a woman in their care to get to an unseen group called ""The Human Project"", who are championing the human cause and trying to discover a cure for infertility. He gets the papers, and has to escort the woman, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to this sanctuary, only to find out later that she has somehow become pregnant.<br/><br/>What follows is a slow-moving, thrilling spectacle that just has one key problem inherent within it: it is far too straightforward. The movie sets itself up within its first thirty minutes, and then does not waver at all afterwards. It just becomes a race to see if Kee can be saved after all, and very little by way of surprises or subplots occur. The characters are all transfixed on that one goal, and thus, never develop completely. Theo develops within the first act when he decides to take on the mission, and then just stays the same throughout the rest of the film. And this becomes really disheartening because it was all shown in the trailer. Despite being well written and darkly humorous, the film just becomes a tad too predictable, and really falters as a result. This could potentially be blamed on the source material (a novel written in the early 1990's by P.D. James), but you would think the filmmakers would have changed it up a bit to make it more of an appealing storyline to follow, and not just get exhausted with.<br/><br/>Although there is little to no development of the characters, the acting is all very well done. Owen is wonderful as the protagonist, and brings a great emotion to his character that would undeniably be missing had another actor taken on the role. Relative newcomer Ashitey also does a great job as Kee. She has just the right amount of believability and pain to full this character off. She breathes life into Kee, and we get to reap the benefits as the audience. Supporting turns from Moore, Michael Caine, and Pam Ferris are all well done. I was a little disappointed with Chiwetel Ejiofor, only for the fact that he is such a great actor, and his role had less than enough scenery for him to chew through.<br/><br/>But while the story and characters are plagued by a few problems, the visuals are where this movie really shines and is reason enough to see the film. Writer/director Alfonso Cuarón and his crew have created a disgustingly vibrant dystopia that ranks as one of the best depictions I have ever seen in the film medium. Settings and backgrounds are dark and dirty. It stinks of having been defiled by all the citizens who once lived and loved the land, but have now destroyed it. This is a place no one wants to live, and is the stuff of people's worst nightmares. A totalitarian and fascist Britain was already shown this year quite excellently in V for Vendetta, and Children of Men succeeds in trumping that film (by visual means only). It is so simplistic yet so complicated. Just the sheer idea of trying to bring some of these visuals to screen really boggles my mind, and shows just how much enthusiasm these people had for the work.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing are just outstanding. Everything is stark, and to the point (much like the film to my dismay). It really becomes a blessing and a curse with much of how the various shots were filmed. At some points, they are clever and well framed. And at others, they are done through the use of a handy-cam, and the audience feels as if they are a character alongside Theo and everyone else. The screen shakes frequently, and it gives it a hint of authenticity. This dystopia is all the more real and frightening. It dazzles with how much detail is put into some of this work, and really becomes outstanding during some of the unedited long shots that take place over many minutes of screen time. One battle sequence goes on for at least five minutes, and it is just the cameraman running behind Owen as he dodges certain death. It amazes and it terrifies all at once. Unfortunately, the effect of these hand-held shots is lost in the fact that it becomes annoying after so many straight intervals and just becomes dizzying.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is a bit of a mixture of good and bad. On one hand, the story is interesting, but just stays too straight and narrow to make it anything more. On the other, the visuals are absolutely stunning and have obliviously had a lot of time spent on them. This film is a terrifyingly real experience as a result, and really stands out as a result.<br/><br/>8/10."

","Powerful, gripping, intense, moving; all of these words describe ""Children of Men.""

So rarely do I say that, but ""Children of Men"" is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. The director creates an atmosphere that pulls you in and never lets you out. This beautifully crafted atmosphere sets a stage for some spectacular performances by Michael Caine and Clive Owen. All of the acting is great in this movie, but Caine and Owen steal the show. Do yourself a favor, and see this movie. It's one of the year's best."

","I haven't written a review on IMDb in quite some time, mostly because nothing I've seen has moved me to do so. But I am into dystopian sci-fi and I was familiar with the work of PD James -- coupled with the fact that the director had directed arguably the darkest of the Harry Potter films, and, well, I knew I had to see CHILDREN OF MEN.<br/><br/>I walked out of the theater exhilarated, shocked, and somewhat depressed thinking about the story's implications.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed 28 DAYS LATER, you'll probably like this...but this is the superior film IMHO, as this one has more heart and makes you think. 28 DAYS LATER is basically a survival film, where as CHILDREN OF MEN works on many levels.<br/><br/>The picture the director and his crew created is very plausible -- and that's what makes this unsettling. Even though it's set in the UK, as an American I found it easy to imagine a similar situation here. There are scenes in this movie that really upset me and I couldn't help but think, ""please, this can't happen!"" -- namely the ""refugee"" detention area scene with the visual homage to the lone hooded figure from Abu Ghraib.<br/><br/>And yet I couldn't help but think there are narrow-minded, redneck jerks in the U.S. who would love to have such border check points and shuttle off ""law breakers"" (read: anyone who's not their brand of Christian, white and doesn't speak English) to refugee cities on the coast as depicted here in CHILDREN OF MEN.<br/><br/>This is where we could be in 10 or 15 years if certain people have their way with the ""law"" as they see it and if we let the environment deteriorate past the point of no return. Get your red-orange-yellow-green terror alert machines out folks, 'cause we're going to need them to give us some vague sense of safety when everything else has gone to hell! Action scenes: astounding, you-are-there. The bluntness of the violence will be off-putting to many, but this is not escapist DIE HARD-like action fare where when the bad guys get shot they just magically disappear...and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>When we live in a time when the average citizen knows more about Tom-Kat and other celebs to the point that they're so out of touch with reality, it's refreshing to know that a mainstream movie studio like Universal will still release thought-provoking work like CHILDREN OF MEN.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and skip everything else at the multiplex and start your cinema-going year right and see this!"

","Birth rates have dropped dramatically, terrorism is a constant phenomenon, the government's increasingly totalitarian, immigration laws are non-existent and urban warfare presents itself on a daily basis. I'm not commenting on contemporary issues, I'm discussing the futuristic drama Children of Men, a film that threw all of these topics at my face and forced me to reexamine the world of today.<br/><br/>I can't mention this movie without relating director Alphonso Cuaron's technical prowess of the cinematic medium. Children of Men is full of brilliant single tracking shots that left me sometimes dumbfounded as to how it was accomplished. One impressive scene in particular involved a reverse car chase involving two motorcyclists shooting at a car's occupants. The camera stays in the interior of the car at all times, not cutting away, from the casual conversation to the incident of attack to the scene's end. There are at least two other scenes similar to the one I've described.<br/><br/>The acting is consistently good all around. Julianne Moore, Michael Cane and the rest of the supporting cast put in believable portrayals in no small part to Cuaron's excellent direction. Special credit must go to Clive Owen, the star of the film. This movie would have sunk if his performance was less than adequate. Owen manages to burden this responsibility and is able to carry the film to its bittersweet conclusion.<br/><br/>One of the best movies of the year, Children of Men is an excellent metaphor about humanity's possible slow strangulation of itself."

","My husband and I drove to Atlanta from our home in Western NC to see this movie because of an advance review that we read in the Washington Post as well as a trailer that we saw in October. The movie was definitely worth the drive. Clive Owen portrays an ordinary man with an extraordinary commitment to a person he'd never met before. One of the things that struck us was the lack of Hollywood clichés. There was enough humor to balance the horror and enough beauty to counter the bleakness. Michael Caine was simply great. At the end of the film we stayed for the credits and to give ourselves a chance to be quiet for a few minutes. We noticed that a lot of others did the same. Today we watched the movie for a second and final time with our 17-year old son. He had the same reaction that we did - silence and reflection. This is a great movie..."
"IRateFilms","9","1","4","6 January 2007"," Children of Men Review
","The greatly anticipated release by Alfonso Cuaron, Children of Men is just another trophy on his wall, cementing Cuaron's status as a greatly talented filmmaker with great aesthetic sense. Set in the near future, this science-fiction drama spells out a dark grey, post-apocalyptic world, set in Great Britain, giving us the impression that this is the only country holding itself in some sort of orderly governmental control.<br/><br/>Cuaron manages to ignite sparks of color in the action within this medieval world, as the film quickly spools into a chase epic. The parallel to the nativity story, focusing on the one child's birth that will change the fate of humanity all together, is drawn quite vividly as this ode to salvation pulls us into its world of infertility, illegal immigration and concentration camps. One of the most interesting aspects of the story is its lack of focus on the reason behind the world's sudden inability to reproduce and which gender is at fault. Instead Children of Men draws more from a creative well, and provokes challenging questions about reproduction, and elaborates on its importance through its narrative.<br/><br/>If this were to happen or not, would mankind be satisfied with what they have accomplished thus far, and be ready to be annihilated from the earth? Does God punish those who are selfish, and draw their power from the suffering of others? Although Children of Men leaves many unanswered questions, and leaves us with a bleak look into the future of mankind, it manages to be uplifting and emotionally stirring. Despite its dark and depressing look into a self-destructive universe, Children of Men provokes much delight with dashes of humor, lightness, and a bit of hope to even things out.<br/><br/>The brilliantly assembled cast, including the always magnificent Michael Cane, and Clive Owen ignite the fire of this cinematic glory, while helping to distract from the naïve and prejudice society the rest of the world has become. Caine and Owen have great chemistry when together, but Caine easily steals every scene with his spot-on acting and endearingly playful behavior.<br/><br/>Cuaron makes great use of the same steadi-cam he used in Y Tu Mama Tambien, but instead of bringing us closer to the characters problems, this time we are brought closer to the action. Cuaron uses a jerkier steadi-cam, unlike other directors such as Martin Scorsese, giving us a more uneasy feeling through much of the action sequences, like we are strapped into a virtual reality. Much of the shooting and explosions feel like an extremely sophisticated first person shooter, even spraying blood onto the camera lens at times. Children of Men never runs out of steam, and left me with one of the best cinematic experiences of the year."

","I was really looking forward to see this film. The plot sounded like one of the most interesting in a long time and Cuaróns ""Y tu mamá también"" is one of my favourite movies. I'm kind of sorry to admit that the film itself didn't work out as well as I expected. ""Children of Men"" is great as a cinematic experience. It's beautifully shot in depressing colors, painting a future that has maybe already begun. Even if there might be one ""Report Illegal Immigrants"" sign too many, this future vision works as a thinking experiment and lets us all reflect about the time we are living in.<br/><br/>What did not work for me is the story itself. I can't help myself, but this whole birth/pregnancy/baby protecting/hunting thing could just never compete with the look and the setting of the movie. Even if all the actors do a great job (especially Clive Owen), the story just lacks credibility within Cuaróns 2029 world.

From the opening scene to the final conclusion the imagery and long camera shots brought the movie into focus even more than the actors did. Thats not to say that the actors didn't do a great job themselves. Clive Owen once again proves his brilliance as an actor, even saving Julianne Moore's rather mediocre performance.

","Dystopian futures never looked more blissfully bleak than they do in Alfonso Cuarón's anti-futuristic masterpiece, Children of Men. The year is 2027, and humans have lost the ability to procreate. With the death of the world's youngest citizen, people are coming to grips with the fact that their slowly aging population will one day become extinct. The city of London is embroiled in anarchy, with pillagers and terrorists taking the best opportunity from the surrounding chaos. Technology has indeed caught up with the times, but it's a far cry from the ultra-slick future envisaged by other movies in the genre. Amidst this paranoia-stricken populace, an ex-political activist (Clive Owen) unwittingly becomes in charge of protecting and transporting a mysteriously pregnant woman to the seaside sanctuary of a human research facility. Cuarón eschews the potential mawkishness of the story (glimmer of hope, anyone?), opting instead for gritty realism and a restrained background score. The film is also more rife with special effects than it lets on, with several sequences leaving you in complete awe. One particular motorcycle chase leaves you wondering about the logistics of filming it, with the camera playing tricks you haven't quite seen before. Ultimately, where the film fails is in its failure to bring any fresh insight into this oft-repeated premise. The film ostensibly traces its influences to the Orwellian landscape of 1984, but through dazzling cinematography and compelling direction, manages to leave an indelible mark of its own."

It is the type of movie that gets overlooked during its release in a crowded season, but 10 years later is hailed as a masterpiece that only got better with age. Only one other movie, ""The Fountain"", I predict will be bestowed with that honor.<br/><br/>You probably know the plot, and have heard about the incredible cinematography and ""one-shot"" action sequences. They are amazing and miles better than any so-called ""action movie"" released recently that has an average cut rate of .6 seconds. The lack of cuts make the action sequences intensely realistic and just have an underlying urgency of making it to safety; something that heartless Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer movies do not have.<br/><br/>The script, acting, directing, music set design, sound, overall tone of the movie and pretty much everything else are top notch. When I think of the movie, I hear the beautiful vocals in the haunting score, every actor's brilliant performance (especially Michael Caine's outstanding supporting turn), the level of detail just bursting in every scene, and many other things I won't say due to spoilers. Just be prepared to bring tissues and to feel drained after watching a rare motion picture that invigorates, angers, saddens, makes you laugh and feel tense.

Clive Owen is the perfect post-Bogart noir hero of the postmodernist sci-fi and Michael Caine does a tender composition a la RAW (Robert Anton Wilson, the lisergic conspiracy-author) of a unforgettable character. Cuaron has a powerful hiperrealistic style and moves the chamera like if he has being playing the Call Of Duty all his life. The book beats up the poor book of the mediocrity lady PD James, and it converses in something more interesting, a dystopia."
"rhinocerosfive-1","9","2","14","2 December 2007"," Apparently, the pleasure's all mine.
","This excellent action movie reminds us that the word ""desperate"" is derived from ""despair."" Each moment is a last chance. Every choice is a final option. <br/><br/>It's a quiet, clear-cut story told very loud, fleshed with nuance and with relentless violence. The relationships are desperately intense - the love is real; the hate is palpable; the ambivalence is overwhelming. The fairy tale of Theo's redemption from faithlessness is the more welcome because it is somehow credible. The weave of fantasy and cultural references lays like an organic fabric, though painted as bright and pale as dawn in Dover. <br/><br/>The scenes of action are more satisfying than in your garden variety shoot-em-up, because these all have consequences. They are each of them important to the story, each a do-or-die, each executed with conviction and competence. Best use of a car battery in a fight; best motorcycle wreck since ROAD WARRIOR. The visual imagination is pretty hot: David with a steel tibia, an album cover out the window, the blasted countryside of charnel pits a disturbingly welcome relief from the screaming blight of the urban streets. <br/><br/>But it's the heart that really thrills me. If you don't cry during the cease-fire, when that baby goes down the steps, go see SCHINDLER'S LIST. That's probably more your speed. CHILDREN OF MEN is about the only apocalyptic refugee movie I can stand, because there's more than the standard family-behind-a-fence; I can smell the cages, I can feel the cold coming up from the pavement, and I am in their predicament. I care about these people because I'm involved in the action as I never was in Spielberg's Poland, where I was at best a tourist. Here I am an inmate.<br/><br/>The London in this picture is probably twice or three times as scabrous as any big city in the West today, but no more awful than, say, Baghdad or Freetown any Tuesday. The modern age is all about perspective, isn't it?"
"Thunderbuck","9","2","14","23 November 2007"," Enthralling craftsmanship
","While I'd heard good buzz about this film, I managed to miss it until recently. My loss.<br/><br/>CHILDREN OF MEN actually manages to re-validate science fiction, a genre I would have sworn was dying. The story and the messages here are grim and entirely believable.<br/><br/>I suspect Universal had a hard time marketing this movie; its visual brilliance comes from the world created in the story, and few of the visuals would look like much taken out of context for a trailer or a clip on a late-night talk show. This world is amazingly--and VERY convincingly--rendered.<br/><br/>There is a great deal to like about this movie. The premise is dead-simple, but chilling: what if for some reason all humanity became infertile? And, given our abuse of ourselves and our environment, how implausible is that premise, anyway? That this crisis triggers xenophobia on a massive scale is no great surprise.<br/><br/>One point I found intriguing is the complete lack of ""sides""; the rebels and the government both behave abhorrently. The story is thoughtful, and quite moving. This is a story that compares to sci-fi classics like ""1984"" and ""Farenheit 451"".<br/><br/>Performances are all very good. Michael Caine actually immerses himself in a character, for once, instead of wrestling it to the ground. I hadn't much liked Clive Owen in the other movies I'd seen him (he was badly miscast in SIN CITY), but he is fantastic here."
"mOVIemAN56","10","2","14","23 October 2007"," A brilliant sci-fi thriller that doesn't need all the special effects to make it work
","Children of Men is set in the year 2027. The world has become sterile and the youngest humans are in their 20's. Chaos reigns across the Earth. The United States is in a civil war, France is on fire, and Britain is deteriorating. Theo (Clive Owen) is a man who simply doesn't care about most of it until he is asked by his ex-wife to escort a woman to the coast for safety. A woman who may be the first mother in 20 years. It won't be an easy task for Theo though as the military begins to round up illegal immigrants and force them into camps and the Fishes (the illegal immigrants resistance movement) who are attempting to use the new born child as a political tool.<br/><br/>Clive Owen stars in the lead as Theo. Owen put a lot of work into this film as he personally looked over every scene he was in to make sure his character never became too much of a hero. Theo is the classic un-wanting hero. He gets forced into the situation and must deal with it and Owen never strays from this presentation. He gives his best performance since Sin City and really shows that no matter who you are you can always be a hero to someone, in the movie it is Kee, the pregnant girl.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore is only in the movie for about 10 minutes so she really doesn't have time to show off her character in too much detail. The legend Sir Michael Caine gives an off-the-wall performance as a former political cartoonist/ex-hippie who helps Theo and his company get Kee to safety. Caine is only in the film for about 20 minutes but gives a great performance. And to round off the supporting cast there is Claire-Hope Ashitey as Kee. This is only her second or third film but she is wonderful. The connection she makes with Owen in many scenes are great and her acting is top notch for such a new star.<br/><br/>The film will be known for its cinematography more than anything. Several single shots exceeding five minutes in length are present within the film. If you are unfamiliar with this then it means the same shot is being taken the whole time without a switch to another shot or perspective. This is really cool cause the whole time your watching one long cut thinking ""Holy sh*t, how did they do this?"" The cinematography sets the mood and makes the film even better then it already is because it gives a sense of artsy look to the film.<br/><br/>Cauron sets the mood early and never strays from the feeling of destruction one feels the entire movie. This isn't a post-apocalyptic setting, it is set during it in a way. The film is not without scenes that brings hope to the audience. The last 20 minutes are truly moving as it shows Theo's sacrifices to save Kee and her baby from harm. Cauron holds nothing back in the film. It has its violent moments, its course language and its nudity but it is all needed to set the mood of the film.<br/><br/>The film is set in the future and therefore would be considered sci-fi. Instead of showing a world with hovercrafts and aliens we are presented to a world destroying itself. The films cinematography and setting makes us feel as if we are right in the middle of this hopeless world. The film also shows that lasers, aliens, and outer space are needed to create a great sci-fi film. On the contrary I think the film as better for not having any of these present. Truly a modern day classic that won't be forgotten, make sure to see this amazing picture.<br/><br/>5/5 stars"

","CHILDREN OF MEN is a good Saturday night picture, but it's not the masterpiece many are claiming. The big reason is that it sets up a credible future dystopia and then does nothing more than set a chase in it. Oh, they may stop now and then for a chat, but it feels like window dressing: this is about riots and explosions and dodging bullets. It feels almost like a dry run for Owen's next movie, SHOOT 'EM UP, only taking itself more seriously.<br/><br/>It starts off well. Even Owen, probably the worst British leading man alive today for once fits his role as a boring, unmotivated drone. For two-thirds you can even mistake it for acting. The trouble is that just like the film his performance goes nowhere. He isn't changed by his journey, he stays just as boring as he starts the film. The supporting cast do better - Peter Mullan, Eijofor and the girl all outshine the leads. The trouble is you come away feeling like you've watched a film that wants to be V FOR VENDETTA but is even less daring or edgy. This is really only a classic if you mistake set design for ideas. But it is a pretty good chase movie and the big army camp chase is almost worth the price of the ticket."

","During its release I think I may have seen one or two short clips and I definitely saw the poster, and I thought it was certainly something I wanted to try in the near future, I'm really glad I eventually did, from director Alfonso Cuarón (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban). Basically in London, England, 2027, no children have been born anywhere in the world for eighteen years since all women have become infertile, and the youngest person in the world, Baby Diego (Juan Gabriel Yacuzzi) from Argentina, has been killed, leaving everyone devastated. The other big issues are the government almost collapsing, Britain becoming a militarised police state, and the big issue is the increase in illegal immigrants, it has become against the law for pretty much everyone foreign to be living in the country. Living in amongst all the devastation is former activist turned apathetic bureaucrat Theodore Faron (Clive Owen), who often visits his friend, ageing hippie, former cartoonist and marijuana grower/smoker Jasper (Sir Michael Caine). One day Theo gets kidnapped by the underground gang called The Fishes, who are against everything wrong in the world at the moment, he is surprised to learn that his wife Julian (Julianne Moore), who left after the death of their son in 2008 from flu, is their leader. She is offering him money to get a travel permit for young refugee Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), which he manages to obtain from his government minister cousin Nigel (Danny Huston), but he has to escort her for more money. While travelling towards the boat to get on, Julian is fatally shot by an ambush group of armed people, making fellow Fishes member Luke (Love Actually's Chiwetel Ejiofor) the new leader. After getting away, Kee reveals the true reason why she needs to get away from everything, she is pregnant, and Julian intended to hand her over to the protection of The Human Project. Theo suggest that they should think about going public about the pregnancy, but the Fishes argue that the government would only take and use the baby when it is born. At night he overhears Luke and an accomplice or two saying that it was actually some of the Fishes themselves that orchestrated the death of Julian to gain revolution support, so he takes Kee and midwife Miriam (Matilda's Pam Ferris) to escape and go to Jasper. After the Fishes find out his hideout and kill him, Theo, Kee and Miriam manage to get away and meet up with Jasper's friend, camp guard Syd (Peter Mullan), who transports them as fake prisoners to Bexhill. It is there tat Kee starts having her contractions and needs somewhere to give birth, so they find an abandoned room provided by Marichka (Oana Pellea), the baby born is a girl. The next day Kee and Theo are caught in the middle of a full scale uprising of refugees, The Fishes have broken into Bexhill, and the army have mobilised, there is a point when they are taken apart, but they get back together and hide. They are slowly allowed out of the building when everyone is shocked to see a newborn baby, but the attacks start again and Maricka leads them to the sewer boat and they row out to the point where the ship Tomorrow will pick them up, but Theo dies and Kee is alone with the baby. The film is full of very poignant subjects, the cast is very impressive, the shaky camera movement, including one or two long takes not cutting away (even with spots of blood on the camera), is very effective, all in all, it is a brilliant futuristic thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects.

The camera is always with him as he goes through a couple of turbulent days and he never fails to impress. I didn't see an actor on a sound stage in front of a crew; I saw a person struggling to deal with the cards he was dealt, or Theo. Julianne Moore was also great in this movie. She helped to elevate the parts of the movie that she was in. Her chemistry with Clive Owen made their relationship believable and not forced in any way. Michael Caine did exceptionally as a hippie, which I wasn't really sure if he could pull it off. Chiwetel Ejiofor also managed to pull off his role as a very complex character in his limited screen time. Even Clare-Hope Ashitey really embodied her character; as someone who was in a place she didn't belong with something that didn't belong The whole cast meshed well and made this feel like an actual place instead of some far-reaching idea.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is unique except it still seems very realistic. Throughout this movie I found myself asking if this could possibly happen in the future. The answer is yes. This movie seems like it could happen down the road in 20 years and all the things that happen with infertility make sense. All the decisions by the characters are logical and don't seem forced or stupid. Yet it still makes you wonder what is going to happen next as that unpredictability drives the movie forward. This isn't a movie where halfway through you can tell how it is going to end. You don't know who is going to die and who is going to live. Its structure is complex enough you fully enthralled with it but it doesn't lose you.<br/><br/>The script of this movie is phenomenal. The dialogue seems lifelike and not wooden. Some of the things that are said are things I would say and the things that I wouldn't say are things that I want to say in the future. It really makes the characters more believable as actual human beings. The writers knew when to insert certain parts of light-heartedness to really tie the plot together or help with a big event. Nothing in this movie was left untouched, as everything tied together.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best looking films I have ever seen. There are at least three shots that are continuous takes of 3 minutes or more. The camera is an actor in this movie, and it would win an Academy Award for it. At4 points in this movie I had to stop and think to myself about how great this movie looked. The way the camera effortlessly follows the actors makes you a part of this world. It has one of the best car chase scenes I have ever seen and some of the most wonderful scenes of all time.<br/><br/>The direction was astounding. Everything was precisely planned and everything made sense. It was like watching Picasso paint a picture. The way Cuaron was able to weave this movie together is inspiring. He made this movie real.<br/><br/>You may think that I am over hyping this movie. I am not. I really cannot put into words how beautiful and wonderful every aspect of this movie is. I had absolutely zero complaints. This is one of the few that exceeds already high expectations and really helps you understand the concept of how great a film can be.<br/><br/>100/100 A+"
"ajlara79","10","1","5","5 September 2011"," Shocking
","I've seen this movie a couple of times. It always shocks me. Not only is it based on an intense, vigorous plot but the acting is impeccable, the scenario makes it all look so realistic. The film clearly depicts the desperation and anarchy that would plague the world in an event of epic proportions such as a worldly disease, only that in this case, the malaise is infertility. People are getting older and the human race is less than a century away from extinction. It is no doubt a very crude, violent film. World economy collapses due to the disease and immigrants swamp the UK. In response, the army and police forces round them up in Gestapo fashion to be thrown into a slum-like ghetto next to the cost. A violent terrorist group attacks the government and civilians for no particular reason other than augmenting the present state of chaos. In this hostile, decaying environment, a solitary pregnant woman seeks help to flee from chaos into the hands of scientists who are struggling to find a cure for infertility."

","Alfonso Cuarón directs an exhilarating film set in the not too distant future where ... (spoiler)... Admittedly I have not red the book but as a standalone, this one is superb. The film is exceptionally well crafted. Cuarón's detail to atmosphere is intriguing. His use of lighting, sets and props successfully create that atmosphere of gloominess and complete isolation.<br/><br/>The film is also storydriven and it grabs the viewer's attention from the very beginning. Cuarón starts with portraying the differences between this future and the current present. Much of the subthemes (particularly that of xenophobia) are a reflection of what's happening today, especially in Europe.<br/><br/>When the action starts, the story moves at a steady pace. The action sequences are excellently executed (with first-rate sound) and Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is wonderful, especially the tricky single shots that couldn't have been easy to carry out. The effective soundtrack is another huge plus and just wait till the end credits to listen to the last song that funnily rounds it up.<br/><br/>The energy and level of tension is very well maintained. The funnier moments provide some great comic relief (especially the sequences with Michael Caine). The dialogues are very well written mixed with irony and witticism.<br/><br/>Clive Owen does a fine job. This is perhaps among his best performances. Clare-Hope Ashitey and Pam Ferris are brilliant. Chiwetel Ejiofor is adequate. Julianne Moore is marvelous and Michael Caine is splendid. I was a tad disappointed that Caine and Moore had so little screen time but then again, they had to keep the story moving. The rest of the cast do well.<br/><br/>It's best to watch it without having any expectation and knowing as little as possible about the plot, letting the film unfold itself. Dark, suspenseful, gripping and emotionally engaging, 'Children of Men' is a remarkable film."
"celervic","8","1","5","14 August 2011"," In a future without children, Theo Faron has a chance to save humankind.
","As with most Sci-fi films, this one starts with a short introduction that immerses the viewer into the world of Children of Men. The premise of the story is that in 2009 the world's men have become infertile, and thus the population goes in a downward spiral without recovery.<br/><br/>The introduction sequence really makes you believe that everything happening in this dystopian future will truly happen. The next few scenes introduces you to the main character and throughout the whole film details concerning his life prior to the events taking place in the film are given. <br/><br/>A large portion of the film is used to highlight the cruelty of the government in times of great need and depicts some form of martial law put into place. Also, the main theme throughout is basically to show a world without innocence (children) and a future, as well as how the world acts to this realisation.<br/><br/>Clive Owen's performance in this film depicts the frailty and goodness in humanity well and is a fresh change from his usual ultra-suave and cool characters. Julianne Moore's performance is as all her performances are, convincing and personal. Clare-Hope Ashitey's performance convincingly depicts a youth in turbulent times. One that curses frequently without reserve, but still retains the innocence of a pre- infertile youth. All in all a good and solid performance from the actors and actresses in this film.<br/><br/>The film ends with a bit of a surprise, but the way the events are shown is evidence that a sturdy editing process took place. If you're a fan of dystopian future type films, then this one is a must."
"nti10099","Null","1","5","19 September 2008"," Movie Review: Children of Men
","With cinema's seemingly unwritten rule that any movie set sometime in the future must be filled with both anarchy and desolation, it's hard to imagine what an optimistic view of our world's fate might look like.<br/><br/>But with great films like director Alfonso Cuarón's ""Children of Men"" presenting a brilliantly harrowing portrait of humankind on the brink of extinction, is there any rush for optimism right now? Set in a dingy, chaotic England in 2027, ""Children of Men"" chronicles a world in which humansfor reasons unknownhave lost the ability to reproduce. Filled with hopelessness and futility due to the bleak prospect that everyone will be dead within the next 85 years, society's infrastructure has completely collapsed. In London, terrorist bombings rip through buildings, mass protests fill the streets, and cages are jammed with illegal immigrants awaiting their deportation. A commercial aired by England's totalitarian government shows that the rest of the world is in ruinsNew York, for example, appears to have been the victim of a nuclear explosionwith the simple reminder that ""Britain soldiers on."" Theo Faron (Clive Owen) lives each moment with a whiskey bottle in his hand. A former activist, Theo now drones for the government, with the only bright spots in his life occurring when he visits the secluded home of his old friend Jasper (Michael Caine), a retired once-successful political cartoonist who now tends to his invalid wife along with fields of his own private crop of marijuana.<br/><br/>The film begins as the shocking and devastating news of the death of Baby Diego, the world's youngest person at age 18, spreads through London. Soon, Theo finds himself at the center of an ongoing struggle between the government and an extremist group known as the Fishes, led by his estranged lover Julian (Julianne Moore). The group needs his help in transporting the teenage Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) a Fiji, out of the country. He soon learns that somehow Kee is pregnant, and as a result of a number of intense plot twists, her safety is solely in his hands.<br/><br/>""Children of Men"" does an exceptional job of showing how humankind has handled the prospect of their imminent extinction, rather than focusing instead on the reasons why they have been ravaged by infertility. With this film, Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"") has easily solidified himself as one of the best storytellers working today, creating an imposing atmosphere of mayhem, grime, and uncertainty, all the while keeping the film's tension ratcheted up to white-knuckler status in its second half. Not only has Cuarón fashioned an excellent chase film, but the movie's underlying commentary on our present society as a cautionary tale will be hard for many viewers to forget.<br/><br/>The film's action sequences are jaw-dropping. Two, in particular, are shot as if the audience is smack dab in the middle of the chaos, a great testament to the camera-work of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. A battle scene near the end of the film in a war torn city was shot with a single hand-held camera lasting for at least five minutes without using a cut. The sequence is remarkable in its realism, intensity, and mayhem, only to be capped by a rare moment of silence which itself possesses more gravity than any other scene in the entire film.<br/><br/>The acting across the board is incredibly solid. Owen proves yet again after his great villainous turn in last spring's ""Inside Man"" that he is an amazing actor, with a rather low-key but heartfelt and heroic performance. Caine provides some great comic relief in a small role, while Moore and Chiwetel Ejiofor are also very good in supporting roles.<br/><br/>Ashitey, in her first big performance, portrays the young pregnant woman with a great sense of expression and humor despite the increasingly dangerous situations she must overcome. The rest of the cast is extremely effective in characterizing a civilization teetering on the verge of self-destruction.<br/><br/>Despite the film's weighty themes and dark tone, in addition to a great deal of unexpected and bloody violence, the script allows for a great deal of humor and an ending that suggests a much needed glimmer of hope. It's a powerful, thought provoking film that is easily one of the three best releases of 2006. Those in the mood for a film with great action and tension set in an uncompromising near-future that in many ways mirrors our own society should look no further.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"
"netmedia-1","10","1","5","19 September 2008"," I hoped that it will never end.
","The best thing to say in the start, that this movie is quiet under rated. This is one of the best pieces that i have ever put my eyes on, and honestly, i have never expected it to be from Alfonso Cuaron, but it looks like the real talents are hidden there where we do not expect them. The acting is state-of-art, brilliant performance by Owen, Moore and Cane. At the beginning i was thinking that the entire movie will be a pure social drama, but somehow it isn't, but also somehow it is. Cuaron has achieved that even some kind of scenes that sound like a cliché when you talk about them are putting you out of your chair. If you think that a typical chasing scene is the kind of scene that can never be exciting, well, you are wrong. And that is only a fragment. You got to watch this."

","Children of Men is a simple enough idea: what would happen if humans were unable to procreate? Yet from this idea, Alfonso Cuaron builds a world dominated by potentially real crisis. No other science fiction film I has done so in such convincing fashion. It's less science than it is fiction and that's where the beauty comes. This is not a science fiction movie of flying spaceships or laser beams. This is a science fiction movie about ideas, and ideas are always the most powerful.<br/><br/>The set designs are superb because they look like the landscapes we inhabit today, just more decrepit to reflect the decline of the society around them. Think World War II, but modern day. <br/><br/>The editing is brilliant because it is so patient. There are two long takes that will make you smile. Also, pay attention to some nifty camera-work in a few scenes.<br/><br/>On top of that, this movie has a great story. The relationships, the ideas, the social commentary; they're all there. Everything you could want from a great story."

"KoscheiTheDeathless","7","1","5","5 April 2008"," A strong statement, but not the one you think...
","Much has been said about Children of Men's statement regarding the debate on immigration. From what the professional critics have said, the movie is a resounding condemnation of the anti-immigration mindset. I saw something very different.<br/><br/>For the sake of simplicity, let's take the Fishes, a paramilitary group fighting the British gov't in an effort to give immigrants equal rights with citizens. So the world is in economic collapse and everyone on the planet is trying to get into England. Why? Because they know that in England is order, security, and prosperity, which are the dividends of White Western nations. The Fishes, like today's open-borderites, want to let everyone in who wants in. The only problem is that prosperity does not reside in the soil of the West, nor is it in the air, nor in the water. It resides in the people. Since immigrants do not leave their culture at the door, but rather bring it with them, they would in very short order make England look exactly like the cesspools they'd fled from. So the net result would be the very same refugees with nowhere else to flee, after the annihilation of a sovereign country.<br/><br/>Children's England is a reaction to this, the reaction of a country brought very close to destruction. Viewed in this light, what is remarkable is not the brutality of the regime but the restraint of it. Refugees are deported, not summarily executed. They are not hidden but are kept outside where all can see them, probably to remind the Britons just how close the end was. The people in the refugee camps are obviously well fed, otherwise there wouldn't be any dogs (and certainly not a horse, of all things). Christian soldiers stop firing and kneel in reverence when a woman and child walk by (some fascists!). And the chanting during the uprising of ""Allahu Akbar!"", far from engendering sympathy, reminds us yet again that Moslems are at war with the entire planet, and the settling of a significant number of them in any non-Moslem country is planting the seed of destruction, whether through active jihad or demographic shift. In the end Children did not show an evil and xenophobic regime, but rather open-borders taken to its logical conclusion.<br/><br/>Add to this spectacular single-shot scenes, and perhaps the finest depiction of urban combat yet created, and you have a movie well worth seeing. If the story line had been at all engaging, I would have rated it as a 9, but as it is I didn't care a bit about any of the characters or whether the baby survived or not. The anti-immigration statement was enough for me."
"RJBurke1942","8","1","5","21 May 2007"," In a world with no future, who can save the world?
","From the mind of P.D. James  a well-known writer of dramas and thrillers  comes a scifi thriller set in the 2027. I haven't read the book (written in 1992) and I understand that the producers of this film have taken some liberties with the narrative; nevertheless, it's a credible picture of a future scenario that is possible, given the current worldwide reduction in male fertility and the now global negative rate of natural increase in births.<br/><br/>The story, however, takes those facts to a logical conclusion: fertility, in 2027, is all but dead as the story opens, with an announcement that the youngest person in the world had just died at the age of eighteen. From that point, the story follows Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a public servant, who  against his will initially  must assist a young pregnant woman across England to meet up with The Human Project, a ship-borne scientific group that is desperately seeking an answer to the fertility problem. The pregnant girl, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) is thus more valuable than life itself as she is seen as the savior of humanity  maybe.<br/><br/>The story is episodic, as Theo fights his way, with Kee, to the coast where he finally manages to get her onto the Tomorrow, the ship operated by the mobile Human Project; but, only after many have died, and he and Kee have endured almost insuperable hardship. To relate too much more would detract from the excitement, suspense and surprises the viewer experiences along the journey.<br/><br/>As Theo, Owens gives his best performance I've seen yet (and proves again that he's got better five o'clock shadow than Bruce Willis any day); Julianne Moore as his ex-girl friend, Julian Taylor, is powerful and dominant; Michael Caine as his old buddy, Jasper Palmer, hams it up a bit, but never goes over the top; the rest of the cast is solid. Frankly, however, with such a fast-paced story, it's difficult to keep up with the constant change in characters as Theo continues his quest.<br/><br/>Two particular scenes are memorable: the desperate escape by Theo, Kee and others in a car that won't start as it rumbles down a hill with killers in hot pursuit; and the final battle scene in which Theo and Kee find themselves enmeshed. As I watched, spellbound, at the latter, I couldn't help thinking that it looked every bit as real as current news footage from Baghdad, Gaza City, Mogadishu or some other equally dangerous place of despair. Truly, this is how some  but not all  humans react to perilous times when survival is at stake every minute of the day. Not a pretty sight; and one that was captured so well, the film deservedly won many awards for best cinematography.<br/><br/>Arguably, from a narrative perspective, there is a very obvious religious metaphor in the form of Kee with the new child  this century's Madonna and Savior, with Theo as a surrogate Joseph, protector of the 'family'. I'll leave you to decide that for yourself...<br/><br/>Recommended for adults and young adults too: the latter should know, now, what the future could be like if things start to go wrong genetically  as, indeed, they appear to be, already."
"c-kelsall","9","1","5","8 May 2007"," What happens to society if the human race becomes infertile?
","That is the primary question raised in this film. Male and female fertility problems are steadily on the increase, and while it may be difficult to reconcile the sudden and total loss of fertility in Children of Men with real trends, nonetheless it is a condition that has real potential, and the possibility haunts us all. The scene is 2027, and global civilisation has collapsed after 18 years of human infertility; at least, that is what has happened if the British government are to be believed. They preside over a nation held in the grip of totalitarianism, a police state obsessed with the detrimental effects a wave of immigrant humanity will bring to the ""last bastion of civilisation"". Against this regime are a small but committed group of terrorist revolutionaries who hold a secret that will tear apart the fabric of this fragile society. Children of Men is an excellent example of a neo-futuristic apocalypse. The notion of human infertility has been explored before in The Handmaid's Tale, but the focus in that story was the oppression and ""slavery"" of the few women who remained fertile. Children of Men explores the breakdown of society that ensues as its primary subject. It is beautifully shot, the director (Alfonso Cuaron) choosing his shots with precision in almost every scene. The actors all deliver good performances, the script is tight and the scenario in which the people find themselves is utterly believable. Finally, set in 2027, the futurism is pitched to perfection; not so far into the future as to demand huge technological leaps forward, it is restricted to huge advert displays on the sides of buildings, moving image adverts on the sides of buses, and a virtual holocube computer game controlled with finger styluses, the sort of technology that one imagines would be freely available in spite of the obvious collapse of societal infrastructure. These are peripheral things that never interfere with the story. The only flaw that I could level at the film, a common one in films these days, is that there was a discrepancy between the sound levels for the dialogue and the background noise/effects sounds, such that the dialogue sounds muffled and difficult to make out in places. I saw this film on DVD, so it may be that the sound was pitched more evenly at the cinema, but this remains one of the most irritating aspects of home cinema."

Not the regular kind of movie, which makes it even more worth seeing. Excellent filming puts you in the mood, and leaves you thinking in the end. An extreme comment to where we could be heading, extrapolating the trends, and compressing the time-line. And, I might add, not adding any optimism an hope to the future.

I rented the film out because I had heard so many fantastic reviews about it all saying it was a must-see, don't believe the hype! This filmed seemed more of an Action film rather than a Sci-Fi movie, lots of shooting and guns which bored me a little bit, but was very effective! Also, the ending was very sudden and thought it could have shown more!

Yet, beyond all of that lies a formulaic movie: the chronicling of a sort of dystopia that is gracious enough to leave the viewer with a glimmer of hope at the end. We've seen it all before.<br/><br/>Children of Men tells the story of a world in which all women have become infertile due to some unnamed factor. Then, we learn that a woman is pregnant with the only baby left on the planet. The majority of the movie is a suspenseful, tumultuous mission to save her in order to ensure the rebirth of society. While I was engrossed for most of the movie, it stayed the cookie-cutter course so stubbornly that toward the end I could not take it seriously anymore."
"spencerstilwell","7","1","5","16 January 2007"," My review that a lot might not like...
","To all of the people who read this and loved this movie; I'm sorry: The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because of the screenplay and direction style, the action sequences, the feel of realism, especially, when your watching, acting, and other small things were great. If not for some details with making the movie it would be close to 1 star. This movie was set up to be great. It had a great story idea that it could build on, but it ended up giving us a big piece of crap ending with no idea of the what we, or maybe just I and the other I saw this with, really wanted to know in the movie...and that is, ""What is The Human Project?""...They give us interesting information about getting to a boat to go to The Human Project. But we never get to see it or find out any details of the science side of things. It lacked having some kind of ""layers"" to it, but instead the story is just said to be, right at the beginning, ""...get this pregnant girl to the coast."" The main reason why I wanted to see this movie so badly is 1. I wanted to see what the world would possibly be like if there were no babies being born. 2. Why are those babies not being born? They give us #1, but we get nothing close to #2. They had everything going right with the movie, but if they just made it like 40 minutes longer to get us to #2 then this is one of the best movies of the year. Someone's review said, ""The ending seems a little abrupt, and leaves something to be desired."" That is a perfect way to describe it, but a lot of people say that the ending is holding it back from 10 stars. And then they give it 9. For myself, on the other hand, I want a good ending to tie the movie all together, and this ending just did not cut it for me. This movie could have been monumental and could have ended 2006 with a BIG bang if they just kept giving more to the story. To me, this is one of the biggest disappointment of 2006."

Again, I do like the idea of the man who spoke in ""thrid"" person is only giving with a gun in his hand. Yet on the other hand the films mind set of the villain is in poor taste if you are not Christian. I am not saying any which way you believe is good or not good and I knew walking into the doorway which had the tittle Children of Men could turn out the way it did. I just had more faith in an open minded view point. I guess the ad which connected this movie with Bladerunner scrambled my hopes. Christ, I hate to make this film sound bad because on the holy whole the cinematography is very good, but if your are not into the spirit of the film it might be better to read a ""good book""."

","This film is fantastic. No, a better description is 'mesmerizing'.<br/><br/>The story takes place in the tragically grim world of the year 2027, when the societies of man have broken down, and the idea of homeland security has achieved its inevitable goal of being a boot stamping police state, with Britain being the last bastion of civilization, no less, and due to unknown environmental reasons, all women are infertile and no child has been born in the past 18 years. The world is dying. There are no children.<br/><br/>Within this framework, a man is tasked with helping a special refugee to safety: a young Fuji woman pregnant with child. They feel compelled to avoid government involvement, and are driven to connect with the somewhat mythical Human Project, whose goal seems to be salvation of the Earth.<br/><br/>The film is remarkable in that it draws you in and gives you a completely realistic portrayal of this darkly apocalyptic future. Utterly believable and absolutely frightening. There was, however, one sequence that drew me out of my movie going experience by its sheer technical brilliance: an 8 or 9 minute one-take of a scramble through a battle zone in a refugee camp that was astonishing.<br/><br/>I keep thinking about this movie.

","SPOILERS Jean Paul Sartre said that ""Hell Is Other People"". Taking the phrase out of context, let's ponder the annoying fact of life that children are there to annoy. So what happens in the world when there aren't any children? In Alfonso Cuaron's (Y tu mama tambien) latest film, unknown causes have lead to infertility across the world. With the increasingly popular basic camera style, ""Children of Men"" embraces the minimalistic approach. A beautifully filmed piece, the film is also well acted and superbly scripted. There are brief moments of infuriation, mainly in the middle part when the film drags briefly, but for the most part, ""Children of Men"" is a magnificent film.<br/><br/>Set twenty years in the future, we are introduced to the alcoholic, misery Theo Faron (Clive Owen). Living his life with a pinch of Jack Daniels in the middle of London, Faron is a character we associate with, before we even learn his reasons for his depression. When his ex-wife (Julianne Moore) kidnaps him with the aim of recruiting him to a terrorist cause, Faron suddenly finds himself enrolled in a mission for the fate of humanity itself.<br/><br/>Led by a suitably miserable Owen, ""Children of Men"" is a Dystopian story with a difference. Unlike recent additions to the genre, this is one film worthy of your time. If not simply for the beauty which is Michael Caine's performance. A rare gem, this is Caine's best performance in years. Playing a magnifically eccentric hippy, Caine's performance has depth and character of a quality often considered to be out of his reach.<br/><br/>Praise should also be reserved for débutant Claire-Hope Ashitey whose depth and character is vastly superior to the wooden performance by Julianne Moore. Her character is incredibly important, however Moore is so weak, we are relieved when she disappears.<br/><br/>When examining the film as a whole though, nobody is more important to the director and script writer, and in both cases Alfonso Cuaron deserves credit. A beautifully written script combined with sublime cinematography, this is Cuaron's movie. The gritty realism of the shot, the way we are forced to embrace the dirt and filth of the content, it is perfect. A similar style to ""28 Days Later"" and equally beautiful, this is a film the British can be proud of.<br/><br/>There are few films which have or will be released this decade which truly capture the fears for the future quite as well as this one. With magnificent direction, writing, and for the most part acting, this is a film I'd recommend to anyone. Well worth catching."
"Hayfax_Jo","9","1","5","29 September 2006"," Thrilling
","I didn't really have much knowledge regarding this film prior to seeing it, although I was distantly aware of the raves that Michael Caine had been getting for his performance, so the missus and I went into this film without too many preconceptions. I have to say that it is genuinely one of the most thrilling films I have ever seen at the cinema; I had more shivers running up and down my back than during any other film I remember viewing and I don't think that's purely because the cinema had turned the air conditioning up.<br/><br/>Now, it's by no means a perfect film; there are some plot holes you could drive a bus through (for example the recklessness of discussing a certain assassination during the dead of night and the early part of the main protagonists escape from the farm) and there are some other rather cliché motifs (the middle section of the film was especially guilty of this and the moment just before the boat arrived at the end was pretty horrible), but the film's strengths were such that these occasional contrivances are easy to overlook; most people here have already mentioned the two long-take action set pieces, and rightly so - they are genuinely awe-inspiring in their construction and execution as to be worth the price of admission alone. The production design was also first class - it was an enormously plausible future Britain and the attention to detail was second to none. Plus the use of humour in some of the most dramatic moments was incredibly effective, I thought, and served only to highlight the brutality of the surrounding action. Likewise the moments where it led you to feel one emotion but didn't let you dwell on it for too long; its ability to manipulate you like that was superb. The acting was generally excellent, although I actually found Clive Owen to be the weak link, despite his performance being actually pretty good.<br/><br/>Now I, like many others, am kind of glad that some of the background wasn't really explained; when it comes to issues of the day, most of us live our lives in various states of ignorance, and this film kind of reflected that. I also enjoyed some of the subtle and not so subtle metaphor (Theo = God = Noah = deliverance blah blah blah) and generally I had a wonderfully ambivalent time. And even the missus quite liked it, which was an added bonus.<br/><br/>It's a real roller-coaster and I'd like to see it again. I recommend it."
"EddieVilliers","9","2","16","4 January 2008"," Best dystopia movie ever...
","This is the best dystopia movie ever. I haven't seen the movie version of 'Nineteen Eighty Four', though the images from this movie seem to jump from the pages of George Orwell's book. That said, seeing images from probably the most graphic and depressing dystopia book ever that you painted only mentally is not a comfort. There were movements in the narrative where I was literally wincing and flinching. To put things in perspective, I was merely shocked while watching horror masterpieces like 'The Shining' and 'The Exorist' (good movies, just a different reaction). As always, I only comment on movies that have a script that drives the movie machine and direction and acting that supports the script (Hitchcock-ian outlook towards movies, I am afraid) and 'Children of Men' is no exception.<br/><br/>As far the basic plot line goes, the world as we know it has been turned over its head. The world has gone to hell in a hand basket, with only Britain managing to show a semblance of order (not necessarily law). It has managed to do so by becoming a police state that is treating citizens as possible terrorists and immigrants as rats carrying plague. The proletariat lives in squalor, filth, poverty and depression. Gone is the problem of over-population and increasing and/or high birth rates and low mortality rates. By 2027, the year the story is set in; entire human population has become sterile and pets are treated like surrogate children. The movie starts with the youngest person in the world, who is 18 and has a rock star popularity, being tragically killed in a senseless brawl.<br/><br/>The protagonist, Theo (Owen), gives the overly sentimental news coverage of this tragedy a baleful look. In fact he reserves this baleful look for all existence. One fine day he is kidnapped (in a world with no kids, the term is ironical) by a terrorist group led by none other than his ex (Moore) and more significantly the mother of his child. The child died twelve years prior and the two find different ways of coping with the pain and go their separate ways. She entrusts him with procuring for her a set of transit papers for a girl, Kee (Ashitey), who is miraculously pregnant and has to be transported to 'The Human Project' off-Britain shore, a supposedly humanistic group and beacon of hope for mankind. The rest of the story deals with how she is transported to 'safety'.<br/><br/>The direction is superb  notice the body language of characters to the bullets flying and grenade explosions. They are scared and cowering away from the violence and at the same time looking for a way out the muck they are in  the human survival instinct. There is a street fighttype of realism to the violence, without it being too graphic either. They have a sense of humor too that no amount of oppression and depression has been able to suppress. If there is any respite in this political atmosphere, it is that the police state is a bully and brute not an intelligent sadist. The government is not the Orwellian Big Brother that has successfully managed to make every pleasurable activity into a sin and is trying to control every aspect of lives of its own citizens. It is merely a fascist government trying to rid of all elements of society they think harmful.<br/><br/>The message of the movie is nuanced. Paranoia has set into the society hence the police state has come in existence in the first place. Where did it start? Who induced itthe classes or the masses? By the time the events depicted in the picture have begun the world is in perpetual and vicious cycle of violence. The movie does not provide reasons why the world went sterile, whether there is any cure, if the 'The Human Project' is real or not, and if it indeed is real is it genuinely benevolent? None of these riddles are really answered and it up to the viewers to make up their minds. The movie was not really about the world going sterile  it was merely a plot device; it is more about how it reacts to adversity  constructively and destructively.<br/><br/>A solid 9/10 and most deservingly in the Top250 IMDb movie list."

","Beautiful. In a world where there is no babies or children, mass violence, flagrant racism, alcholism, and no hope at all; Children of Men is still beautiful. The camera work, the acting, and the fragility of hope is all orchestrated so masterfully in the film. If you aren't a Clive Owen fan, see this and I guarantee you he will be one of your top actors to look for. I didn't give this film a ten because I felt Moore didn't stun anyone with her role, a better actress might have really put this film into more consideration for prominent Oscars. That said, I haven't seen the fertile actress since this film was released or before but I thought she did a great job in her supporting role. Th ending was great as you knew she and the baby would be alright but still had an Erie feeling if the ""human project"" was going to be able to turn the fate of the future around."

","Dark, gloomy, sad and virtually hopeless. That's the image 'Children of Men' presents as the future in 2027. The world has become a battleground after women became infertile and the only place that managed to survive as a colony was London. The story follows government official Theo (Clive Owen) who is contacted by his estranged wife Julian (Julianne Moore), a terrorist organization leader who fights for freedom, to help a young woman (Claire-Hope Ashitey) gain safe passage out of London to the Human Project (an organization that can help her). That's about all I will tell you about the plot without giving away any of the several spoilers. I believe the best way to describe Cuaron's 'Children of Men' is a film with endless potential that aims high but misses the mark significantly. 'Children of Men' isn't a bad film, it's actually a very good film, it just could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Without question, the two best aspects about the film are the acting and the way it was filmed. Cuaron does an excellent job creating this filthy and depressing futuristic London, even if he does borrow a little bit from other films like Blade Runner. This is different territory for Cuaron having previously directed the powerful Mexican sexual exploration piece 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' and after that taking on the best of the Harry Potter movies, and Cuaron handles it nicely. The cast is led by yet another masterful and seemingly flawless performance by Clive Owen. Owen doesn't provide Oscar worthy work, but he does his best to keep the film rolling along during some of slow parts. Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and the unjustly underrated Chitwel Ejofor provide solid performances, and newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey is not half bad but certainly not terrific. There is also cameo parts played by The Constant Gardener's Danny Huston as Theo's wealthy friend and Peter Mullan in a showy but small role as the wacky fascist police officer. You definitely don't remember Mullan's riveting performance in 'My Name is Joe' because nobody f_cking saw that movie! The problems with 'Children of Men' stem with the writing and editing. The editing seems very choppy and there are scenes in the film that could have been cut out to save more time. The screenplay is solid in it's dialogue, but lacks necessary explanations in order to understand the film. There are so many things I wish they (the filmmakers) would have elaborated on or explained so I could enjoy the film more. It's never fully understood how the battlefield society came to be this way, and the assumption that a mere 18 years of women being infertile would cause the entire world to collapse doesn't seem very plausible in my mind.<br/><br/>Overall, besides borrowing a little from other futuristic movies and not being entirely coherent, 'Children of Men' is an enjoyable movie going experience where the good far then outweighs the bad. Out of all the sh_tty Sci-Fi movies that have been made, 'Children of Men' is probably in the ranks of the better ones like 'Brazil' and '28 Days Later...'. Grade: B+"

"compi24","8","1","6","17 July 2011"," Review for ""Children Of Men""
","Alfonso Cuaron's ""Children Of Men"" takes place in the not-too-distant-future where every woman is infertile and world order is on the brink of collapse. Theo Faron (Owen), a conflicted diplomat, is kidnapped by his ex-wife and revolutionary (Moore) to escort a refugee to freedom. However, what Theo doesn't know is that this refugee is in fact a pregnant woman. Thus, a epic and provocative quest ensues. In this world nearly every country's government has fallen. Therefore, as the only nation left standing, the U.K. must deal with millions of illegal immigrants trying to take refuge within their country. This prompts the U.K. drop into a militarized police state where violence and death are commonplace. Interesting enough, what I enjoyed most about this movie was the atmosphere. The world in ""Children Of Men"" is so disquieting, and so scary. You can tell that the art directors really took an extensive amount of time to make this setting look as dreary as it's supposed to be. The setting's bleakness is accentuated with really appropriate lighting. However, the cinematography also offers some really beautiful shots of the ravaged U.K. The screenplay is really well written, and it is performed equally as well. Clive Owen really shines in this roles, and Michael Caine plays a character that has a bundle of hilarious lines. Another aspect of this film that I admired is the fact that Cuaron utilized single-shot. This means that when the crap hits the fan for Clive Owen and Co. the cameras never stop rolling and the whole sequence is filmed in one single take. Which brings me to another aspect of ""Children Of Men"" that I enjoyed - the final sequence of the film. This film's final sequence used the aforementioned action scene technique and it also features a really interesting yet spoilerish dynamic that I can't share. You'll just have to watch it yourself. Overall I felt that ""Children Of Men"" was an awesome piece of speculative fiction that effectively serves as a cautionary tale for everyone to take seriously."
"suvopyne49","Null","1","6","14 July 2011"," Great story shown in a crafty camera-work.
","I first watched Alfonso Cuaron's direction in the third movie of Harry Potter, Prisoner of Azkaban. I was deeply impressed by his direction skills. This movie reflects the brilliance in him. Set upon a futuristic world of 2027, where the fertility of human is under question and no human baby had born for the past decades or some, the movie shows a person's grit to escort the last hope of mankind, a pregnant teenager to a safe place known as 'Human Project'. The movie and the events portrayed in it revolves around a futuristic England where fascism has cropped up and expanding it's roots. <br/><br/>Clive Owen is very good as a former activist, having trouble in his personal life and then bestowed with the job of saving the pregnant girl from people who would have used her as some political bait; and Michael Caine can never cease to amaze us.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie is its cinematography and the camera work. Not for once one can dare to look elsewhere, such is the quality of the cinematography in this movie. The bewilderment of why they chose David Yates to direct HP series over Cuaron keeps increasing."

","I loved ""28 days later"", so naturally I was hoping, though not expecting, (one has his fair share of near and full misses believing biased reviews in newspapers), something on the lines of a realistic, do-it-yourself McGyver sort of action movie, and while it was not all that bad, the first half almost killed the second one.<br/><br/>The problem of this movie is that, unlike in ""28 days"", here the spectator needs to wait and wait to really start getting into the pace of the movie, and is not like the plot takes to unfold (the trailer tells you everything you need to know) but that you could easily snooze the first 30 minutes and then wake up to see what this movie is really all about.<br/><br/>If you manage to wait without dying of boredom, you will eventually find yourself in a movie with a good level of thought-provocative questions about immigration and political agendas, but don't let my words scare you; these questions are there only if you want to think about them. Otherwise the movie keeps you entertained just fine.<br/><br/>The one thing I did like about the movie is that most characters have a two-side personalityand you will see what I mean if you watch the movie.<br/><br/>Key phrase: Waitso this one was the good guy, and that one wasn't?"

","Children of Men, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, is set in England in 2027, where the human race has become no longer able to reproduce. England is also in the middle of complete chaos and internal war, due to the overpowering of a fascist government. Clive Owen plays Theo, a man who teams up with a rebel group called The Fishes, to help save a young woman who he finds out is pregnant. Since the young woman is the first to give birth in over 18 years, Theo, Julian, played by Julian Moore, and the group must fight to save her from stray bullets and the English police who will get rid of anyone in their path.<br/><br/>The movie reflects the theme of a threat to the existence of humankind. Being that no one in the film was able to conceive in over 18 years, the future of the human race was being questioned. In the beginning of the film, Theo seemed to have become comfortable with the situations happening around him and was just living his life. But when Julian, who is also his ex-wife, approaches him for help with her cause, he starts to show personal concern with getting the girl and the baby to safety. With the help of his good friend, Jasper, played by Michael Caine, Theo soon believed that the world could in fact be saved from total extinction.<br/><br/>Another film that relates to the same theme is 28 Days Later. 28 Days Later also tells of how humankind is in danger of being lost forever. In this particular film, contaminated chimpanzees threaten the lives of humans after a vicious attack on them. Both films present characters that have to fight for their own lives as well as the lives of others in order for humans to have a future on earth.<br/><br/>I thought this film was great. Was very entertaining and presented a story line that kept me interested. Clive Owen and Julianne Moore also added significant acting abilities to the film as well."

","The theme of Children of Men is hope, and in Alfonso Cuaron's film, it has to overcome the most daunting of odds. Clive Owen plays Theo, a man living in London during a time when women are no longer capable of giving birth, and the extinction of the human race is not only certainly at end, it has been accepted by the people themselves. London is in a militarized state, and suicide is not only common, but encouraged by the government as an alternative to the violence taking place.<br/><br/>As expected by the mood of the plot, and Cuaron's past films, such as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men is a dark film. After all, the human race is coming to an end. The lighting is dark and the environs are dirty, which draws comparisons to Azkaban, which was by far the darkest of the Harry Potter series. Even the scenes filmed during the day are dark, which is just a further reinforcement of the message that we don't want to live in a world where hope is this far gone.<br/><br/>There is a hope, and it lies in one woman, Kee, played by Clare-Hope Ashitey, who is the last pregnant woman alive. Theo is quickly drawn into the mix and must protect Kee at all costs, and ensure that the baby and mother are delivered to safety, in both senses of the word. There are supporting characters that lend to his quest, such as Jasper, played by Michael Caine, Theo's old activist buddy, and Julianne Moore as Julian, Theo's ex-wife. Jasper is a burnout that is the noblest of men when he is challenged, and Moore's character provides an inspiring side story of her and Theo regaining trust for each other.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a masterful display of the long shot. Large battle sequences and escape scenes are filmed in one long shot, which helps the audience feel as if they are in the thick of the action. Blood splatters, dirt and shaky camera's give some scenes the feeling of a documentary, as if the audience is watching true events unfold. Children of Men is a film that puts fear and hope against one another, in the most dire of circumstances, with the human race in control of the outcome, and with the most stakes involved. Even at its calmest moments, Children of Men is full of suspense and drama."

The film made me think about helping others and how there are people who will do the same thinking he might have done. The thinking that jumped out was when the had people from different county in a cage asking for there freedom. The movie is interesting how people in the would could not have kids but one lady named Clare-Hope Ashitey who played Kee she was the one that gave people hope. Theo Faron was the person who gave them hope. He helped people he didn't even know.

D. James' novel, Children of Men is a controversial drama that is as enthralling as it is positive of humanity's own demise, a film worth watching for the x factor of drama, the inappropriateness of glorifying teenage pregnancy for the possibility of saving humanity.<br/><br/>The prejudice and storm this film and the book have generated divides many, as does Combo in This is England, and with both dramas, both have a strong point on nationalism and our future.<br/><br/>The opening to this Oscar nominated picture is a silent shock to the system. As Clive Owen's Theo exits a shop to the news of the world's youngest person (18 years) dying a bomb detonates and he is left with a ringing in his ears and a startling reminder of what is happening to Britain. As the plot gathers pace into its discussion of its current time we learn from a long haired Michael Caine and a secretive Julianne Moore how the world is shaping up and how a miracle is needed to revive the world from slavery and control, and along comes a mission for the unexpected hero. Theo must attempt to take Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) to a place where scientists may have a chance to perform experiements in the hope of finding a cure for infertility.<br/><br/>Set in 2027 the scary nature of this probability is showcased through a touching story involving Theo's deceased child, the dull cages packed with immigrants and the lack of romance left in the world. The drama of these troublesome issues is never far away from our attention. The screenplay, dramatically scripted, dives deep into the world's issues.<br/><br/>The constant discussion over the miraculous pregnancy, the implemented armed forces are showcased through a tremendously staged mini war, and the fact the plot doesn't shy away from killing anyone who it signifies will improve the ideology of the future.<br/><br/>Already set almost 30 years into our future the idea our economy, we Britons could sink so low made me personally nauseous when seeing any slavery scene, and this is all for the greater good, to showcase how ignorance and power can subject us to the worse of ourselves and others, and this clever motive is all done through some unashamedly brutal stylistic direction.<br/><br/>If I'm honest I wasn't a huge fan of the man who made Harry Potter 3, unsure about his face cutting and hyperbole use of standard settings. However here it all feels relative to convey the moment and issues. The boat scene is well shot whilst the terrible scene in the car is terrifically handled, as is the powerful long cut building rescue.<br/><br/>Problems with this film included its long winded approach, its neglect over tricky moments, such as bypassing security and easy rescue venues.<br/><br/>Nevertheless this feels an important message that should help us derive away from a terrible future."

","Its 2027. It's been eighteen years since the last human birth, and the youngest person alive is a celebrity. However the world has fallen into decline with England barely above the heap, or as Jarvis Cocker points out in his closing credits song Running The World, s*t floats. It's a police state with a strict policy of no immigrants. Terrorism is rife but for Theo (Clive Owen), he has left his idealist days far behind. He simply wants to get on with living, but his past isn't through with him just yet. The underground movement has a task for him, which has ramifications for the entire world. <br/><br/>Alfonso Cuarón, (And Your Mother Too, Harry Potter 3) paints a very bleak view, it's always overcast and wet, but that's part of the canvas he's working with. It's a polluted world, a world where train stations are guarded by soldiers and suspected immigrants herded off into camps, (not far removed from now really). The film has a lot to say about immigration, government policy, overpopulation, ambition, the chasm between the classes, but as all good films should, it shows us rather than telling us. <br/><br/>Cuarón uses his hand-held cameras to set us alongside Theo; we don't see anything unless he does, as he caught up in a situation where he has no control. He's just trying to survive from one moment to the next. Cuarón uses extended takes to place us within the scenes themselves, particularly in two remarkable set pieces. There were times when I was reminded of Act II from Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and the comparison is not without justification. This is a director dominant behind the wheel. There is a lot to admire in Timothy Sexton's screenplay, based on P.D. James' novel, who understands the film language that less is more. <br/><br/>The cast is superb, with Julianne Moore and Michael Caine (still one of the busiest actors around) getting all the best lines. However it's the supporting cast that really shine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Pam Ferris and Peter Mullan as Syd who almost steals the show.<br/><br/>This is a future easily imagined, a post terrorist world where the small percentage of the population with wealth cling to it with disregard to those with nothing. This film works as a taut thriller, but also acts as a warning. For too long we have sat idly by enjoying the fruits of our development without thought to where we are going. This year, 2006, has put up a stop sign with a glimpse to that future if we do not begin to act; global warming, overpopulation, dying resources, the majority who have nothing and the threat of a pandemic. <br/><br/>Next to An Inconvenient Truth, this is the most important film of the year. Even as a piece of entertainment, it still ranks of one of the best."
"johnnyboyz","8","1","6","16 March 2009"," Buckets of both style and substance combining to deliver something quite remarkable.
","Children of Men is, at very separate and reasonably spaced intervals, terrifying; awe-inspiring; tragic; humbling; visually stunning and just generally all out incredible. It tells a very simple story of an everyday and unspectacular man but doing spectacular and extraordinary things for the survival of the human race set amidst a spectacular and extraordinary backdrop. The film is a neo-noir of sorts as well as a science fiction, a war film and at times a horror film when you genuinely feel that 'pinch' on occasion the protagonists are under genuine threat; not from an uncanny enemy but from an uncanny situation. It is all played out with an underlying theme of the social commentary as Britain, indeed the world, is either on the brink of, or has already, fallen apart from within.<br/><br/>Indeed, the year is 2027 and the United Kingdom lies on the brink of some sort of society-led disaster following a mass influx of foreign people given the state the world has managed to get itself into. The reason for this is that the human race is drying up; no woman has given birth for almost twenty years  science cannot provide the answer and everyone eventually puts it down to the fact it is some sort of worldwide pandemic invoking infertility. Within London lives Leo Faron (Owen), a former activist turned bureaucrat who will, by the end of the film, have gone on a harrowing journey through grit, grime, war-zones and some situations in the middle of nowhere in which his life and what he feels is his duty are put at immense risk.<br/><br/>At its core, Children of Men is a neo-noir of a lonely and disgruntled male lead who, like everyone else in the world it would seem, is very much down on his luck. But the feeling is mutual throughout England and in the classic sense of the term, Leo is given a 'job' or a 'task' by someone that begins relatively easily or seems straight forward on the surface but will entangle and involve him deeper than he would've liked, pushing him to the front-line and back again. Leo can obtain the necessary paperwork ex-flame Julian (Moore) wants in order to transport a yet unseen woman called Kee (Ashitey) from wherever she is to a group known as the Human Project, a task-force dedicating to curing infertility. While the manipulation of time and space is limited only to the fact the film takes place in the future, there are several scenes set amongst a rural backdrop that sees our lead struggle in terms of survival when it becomes apparent that hanging around would be a very bad idea.<br/><br/>Life in London sees people hang British flags and cricket bats on the walls of their offices, but rather than act as petty pieces of iconography like they would do in so many other, more inferior films to enforce that 'Yes, these people are English  you can tell because they've got a cricket bat on the wall(!)', Children of Men sees these people as the sorts living in such desperate times that the props on the wall are a clinging on to whatever items that remind them what it's like to be British amidst all this mass-immigration, violence and hatred going on around them. Additionally, it is desperation that sees Leo take the job; there is a sense he is in financial turmoil when he rather feebly accepts the 'busfare' that Julian and her small group toss for him in the middle of the road following an apprehension and a van journey.<br/><br/>To say why it is that this young woman named Kee attracts all the attention is almost an unnecessary spoiler in itself but the revelation as to why she is acts as the ending of the setting up of events and the beginning of the journey itself when it becomes apparent to Leo how important she really is and that his job to escort her just took on a little more weight. I also liked the sly labelling of the character, foreshadowing what it is to come in the sense she really is 'key', referring to importance more than anything. Following on from this, and adding to that constant feeling of the presence of noir, Leo blurs the boundaries between right and wrong as he goes against police wishes and even lies his way into a particular secluded zone made specifically for immigrants when he uses a policeman named Syd (Mullen) to take him into the said area.<br/><br/>But no one watching can go against Leo and actually want him to fail in his mission. The film, visually, is constructed around the use of several long takes of immense and quite disturbing action in a sequence of scenes not done as impressively as this since Spielberg produced the final twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan. Leo dons a withered Olympic themed top with London 2012 on it, echoing the cricket bats on the wall from earlier  it's a clinging on to what we were. However, with an extra 'e' on the end to produce 'London-e' and you have the past participant of 'to do' making it sound like something that has been 'done'; dismissed or has withered away and is now in the past tense in an ominous fashion, such is the apocalyptic world in which Children of Men brings to life and such is the manner in which the film works on so many levels."

","This film has gotten very praising response from the critics and the community alike and I had to check it out. I did see Prisoner of Azkaban but didn't think it was anything mind blowing but I notice now how great Alfonso is as a director and he certainly have a very bright future.<br/><br/>The plot follows Theo, a depressing drunk who only see the decay in the world. His bitter and pessimistic outlook on life is caused by his child's death and the breakup with his wife. Similarly the world is in chaos. Most organized government has fallen and Britain has one of the last standing government which leads to high amounts of refugees seeking asylum. Finally the world has not had a childbirth in 18 years. Theo, contacted by his former wife, is asked to lead a pregnant refugee out of the country to ensure the baby's safety.<br/><br/>The acting is very well done. Especially with Julianne Moore, Clive Owen and Michael Caine. Despite the continuously bleak setup of the film, they show a healthy sense of humor. At the same time, when the situation turns for the worse, they can show true raw emotions.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film comes from its breathtaking cinematography. The highlights are the extendedly long single shots that occur many times during the film. The action scenes usually incorporate this and it is extremely well done. The cinematography leads to the gripping sense of realism in this film. Parts of the film is shot in a documentary sort of way and adds a sense of believability to the film. The film presents allusions to past events and other social issues as well. At the same time the film is very emotional and leads to very heartbreaking scenes.<br/><br/>The minor issue with this film is the action scenes. If you're prone to motion sickness, it can get you a little bit dizzy which are even further pushed by the cacophony of gunfire and explosions. Also the film is rather slow for the first half and the plot can get a little confusing.<br/><br/>The film has a rather ambiguous hopeful ending that is very well shot. Overall, the reason behind why this film didn't receive any Oscars is a mystery. However this is a very smart film that also points out many social and political issues that are going on today. Highly recommended."

With Children of Men I now have another fine film to add to not only my list of fave dystopic sci-fi films but films in general. It is no exaggeration for me to say that I can think of few things that don't work in this film. The cinematography is top notch. Its long takes and hand held camera work lend a sense of credibility to the piece. Also notable is the films lack of silly science trying to explain the crux of the plot (people cant have kids). The expositionary dialog is handled well...something many films struggle with. Clive Owen will be your anti-hero for the evening and he does quite a good job as does the impeccable Michael Caine as his scruffy pot head friend. The first bit of word of mouth I herd on CoM was that is was ""the next Blade Runner"" which is nothing short of heresy to me.

This hopelessness is what makes the film great-the film portrays a world where all of humanity has simply given up-accepted its imminent extinction. This is by no means a film for snobs. The opening is so frightening and engaging I shook in my seats. The action sequences are spectacular, especially the climactic battle, which is filmed in one shot.

"Coventry","7","1","6","10 April 2008"," Sweet Child in Time . Will You See the Light?
","Various highly acclaimed and respected sources of criticism refer to ""Children of Men"" as the absolute greatest Sci-Fi movie since ""Blade Runner"". I can't really disagree with that, since I never was a big supporter of this particular classic, but still ""Children of Men"" isn't the unhinged new masterpiece everyone claims it to be. The grim atmosphere is great, the sets are greatly depressing, some details in the script are truly extraordinary, the abrupt plot twists are shocking and the acting performances are overall stunning. Yet, somehow, the wholesome simply doesn't feel as astounding and refreshingly original as it should. It's a good film, but in case you're familiar with obscure, often low-budgeted and apocalyptic themed B-movies of the late 70's/early 80's, Alfonso Cuarón's script has surprisingly little new stuff to offer you. Several of the main story lines in ""Children of Men"", like the infertility of the human race or Britain being the last remaining place of civilization (although), are often just smaller footnotes in Sci-Fi flicks of the old days. The first 30 or so minutes of the film are the absolute greatest. Chaotic images of several of the largest and most prominent cities of the world burning down, fascist soldiers aggressively preventing immigrants from entering the UK and a  downright brilliant  sub plot about the last born human being bombarded to a media figure and he himself, 19 years old, not able to cope with the unwanted attention. The real plot kicks off when Theo Feron, a totally antipathetic loner, is requested  commanded actually  by his ex girlfriend to escort a very special girl to safety because she carries in her womb the fetus that could represent mankind's final little string of hope for survival. Their journey together is long, full of lethal obstacles and literally no one can be trusted. At least as far as I'm concerned, ""Children of Men"" is definitely a showcase of style over substance. What distinguishes this film from the rest is Cuarón's extremely raw and uncompromising filming style. The cinematography is everything but fancy, with shaky camera movements and disturbing visuals, the characters are uncanny and behave utterly nihilistic and the action is merciless. Clive Owen, definitely one of the coolest and most talented breakthrough actors since the new Millennium, gives another stellar performance. Personally, I wouldn't rank this amongst the 250 greatest movies ever made, like the votes and ratings around here indicate, but it's certainly a film worth checking out for mature audiences."
"stevewest-1","Null","1","6","18 February 2008"," Visually appealing dystopian fiction
","I don't normally review a film right after seeing it, but the hodgepodge of reviews and ""helpful"" votes seemed to warrant my two cents. Children of Men has a few big-name actors, with the solid Clive Owen, Michael Caine playing a hippie (testament to his acting ability that he is convincing) and Julianne Moore (I guess this had American funding so they couldn't have an all-British cast).<br/><br/>The cinematography is good throughout, and British nature and urban environments make for a good backdrop (in my opinion). However a lot of the time I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching staged set pieces, I wasn't sucked into the the film. The directing in general seemed a bit ham-fisted, like it was someone directing their first feature. The premise is interesting but I'm not sure if much was done with the concept (I guess we can attribute this to the writer of the novel the movie was based on). I'm not sure what the story is supposed to be about really, the plot seemed to be a way to highlight various aspects of this dystopian society. Again, the dramatic sequences lacked that ""real"" feeling, like seeing a film set filmed through a home movie camera for behind the scenes featurettes. <br/><br/>I think the film has a lot to offer and would be worth a repeat viewing (most films I cannot say the same for). It may be slightly overrated on IMDb, but then again Finding Nemo didn't grab me and that's still in the top 150."
"dslockhart-1","8","1","6","30 April 2007"," Good Movie
","I liked this movie; I believe its main criticism is directed at modernity and its blind faith in rationality and science. It reveals the consequences when groups and individuals make rational logical decisions over morality and human dignity. The government in trying to keep order treats the illegal immigrants and opposition groups horribly. Not unlike how the USA and other liberal democratic nations treat suspected terrorists today. However it also shows the fugges as committing the same error exemplified best by the murder of Julian Moore and Michael Caine. This is reminiscent of the current question among socialist thinkers, of whether a revolution should suspend individual democratic rights in order to facilitate its ultimate goals. History has shown however that a temporary rule of the proletariat leads to a dictatorship over the proletariat. I like how the film makes note that science does not have an answer to why the women of the world have become infertile. I am reminded here of recent writers who criticize that scientism (the belief that science will solve all social problems) plagues modern societies and is founded on myth. However Caine's speech alludes that the problem is most likely a result of modern societies disregard and domination of Mother Nature. Overall a good movie as it grapples with ideas and problems that societies will have to face in the coming years."
"oneloveall","7","1","6","28 March 2007"," Spledidly visceral but surprisingly shallow for it's content
","Provocative drama-action premise, taking place in the not-too-distant future of England, doesn't quite fulfill it's amazing cinematic potential but offers plenty of worthwhile attempts at being swept up into the compelling atmosphere. In adapting this dystopian tale for film, Alfonso Cuarón brings a tremendous urgency to the pace, shooting all action with an astounding clarity that elevates this drama to a believable nightmare of immersion. <br/><br/>Sadly I feel the script, written by five people no less, is not able to keep up with the near-visionary production intellectually, emotionally, philosophically, or otherwise. It would seem that with a plot as horrifyingly profound as the one we are dealt here, more relevance would have been put into the dialog and motivations surrounding our protagonist, though here against the apocalyptic setting everything just sort of breezes by neatly along it's designated plot-arc, sometimes feeling entirely too mechanical for it's own good. While there is always a rousing spontaneity through the lens of Cuarón's perceptive direction and Emmanuel Lubezki's tremendous action cinematography, too often Children of Men's actual story feels preordained, as if we are just watching a serviceable Clive Owen running through steps 1-10 without having the slightest interest or indication why we should care. There are times, though they are few and far between, where you can tell the cast and crew misread a particular scene, offering unintentional humor instead of the tragedy the moment would imply. As second-billed, Julianne Moore fans should beware, her role is short and small, absolutely not the lead role performance it is being touted as.<br/><br/>Eventually it becomes clear that Cuarón was more interested in this project for aesthetic reasons then underscoring thematic intent, which will still leave viewers quite an explosive piece of science fiction with a little bit of relevance thrown in. Try not nit picking that much on plot-points though, and you will instead be rewarded with last year's most impressively executed action sequences....anything else taken from the entertaining and thoughtful piece of Hollywood movie-making, one can write off as a bonus."
"nick rostov","5","1","6","4 February 2007"," One Big Question
","Okay there's a big spoiler coming so if you don't want to know what happens stop right here.<br/><br/>I just have one question for the brilliant but sometimes muddled artists who made this movie: Why didn't Kee nurse the baby? What mother, no matter how unschooled in mothering, wouldn't put the baby to her breast? Wouldn't the earth-mother gypsy lady have told her to do that? Wouldn't Theo, who had a child of his own 20 years ago, have told her to do that? First of all, nursing would have quieted the baby's cries. Second of all, without nourishment that baby would have been very sick--or even dead--from dehydration and lack of nourishment well before the story ended. Third of all, the mother's breasts would have been so painful from the pressure of the milk--I think it's called engorgement--that she would have been screaming herself. To me, this highlights the problem with the movie, which is the victory of concept and idea over actual living moments. Which is not to say I won't keep going to see every movie Alfonso Cuaron ever directs.<br/><br/>But just tell me, Alfonso: did it not once cross your mind to have her nurse the baby?"
"235SCOPE","6","1","6","21 January 2007"," Fantastic execution of a mediocre script from a so-so idea.
","OK, so Alfonso Cuaron is a great filmmaker and this movie is worth watching if only for the stunning camera-work and the action choreography which sometimes goes on for blocks and blocks. There are a couple of set pieces which I won't spoil here that are right up there with the best of Spielberg and Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. As someone said before, why not try cloning? And why can dogs and chickens procreate, but not people? And on and on it goes. The story is also kind of too simplistic -- ""The revolution has started!"" I mean, isn't that what the Marxists were saying about the revolution 70 years ago? Also, I personally detest dirty movies, that is, movies where everyone is filthy from beginning to end, the sets are completely polluted from beginning to end, everything seems to reek of smoke, booze, bombs, urine and feces,and where there isn't a trace of humor. Movies about the future like this one make me long for the ""shopping malls"" of Logan's Run (well, not really, but almost). The relentless grit made me itch from about 10 minutes on.<br/><br/>I give it a 6 and say, wait to see it on DVD. I hope that a great filmmaker like Alfonso Cuaron will find a better script next time."

"silver808","10","1","7","28 June 2013"," The Greatest Depiction on film of a seeming ever more imminent dystopia
","Children of Men is a very special movie, a rare movie. Most of the films that have been made about a future dystopian /science fiction world, are without doubt always lacking in a palpable sense of vital realism. They are all unbelievable, no matter how good the story or visuals are, however much they deserve acclaim for entertaining generations of film goers, they all look fake in one respect or another. This applies to even those films made after the onset of the digital revolution in film, that affords the opportunity to use digital fx, they all , no matter how good they are look fake. Children of Men is different, it looks real, and is one of the most accomplished use of the modern cinema camera, it is breathtaking how good it looks, how the shots are staged, and how the story, characters and action develops. It is like a modern fable, a fable for our time, set in a world that looks so real you can touch and smell it, it engages your senses , envelops you in it's plight,it fully engages your imagination in a way science fiction and fantasy never does. It is because of the great achievement a landmark of modern film in it's cinematography, that Children of Men is a true classic of cinema, only years after it's release. The cinematography in Children of Men is the standard that modern filmmakers who use digital cinema cameras, have so far failed to equal, and failed so appallingly, it is a embarrassment to the whole of the film industry. The reliance on such utter abortions of the likes of Avatar to wave the flag of modern cinematic achievement, at the expense of actual filmmaking using modern digital cameras in real environment and not in a green room studio, as is the case of Children of Men which actually uses planet earth as it's studio, is an utter indicment against the complacency of the modern film industry."

"Stoh80","10","1","7","11 October 2011"," A beautifully grim future
","Based on a 1992 dystopian novel, Children of Men is one of the most well made science fiction film of the 2000s, if not one of the most well made films period. Clive Owen plays Theo, a government bureaucrat who, through happenstance, finds himself the reluctant hero to what could very well be humankind's last hope. With an all-star cast of Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine, the acting in this movie does not disappoint.<br/><br/>The idea of this movie is so seemingly simple and far-fetched—""What if humankind became infertile""— and yet Alfonso Cuarón does such a good job of making this nightmarish world a reality. It takes place in the year 2027, but unlike other futuristic films, Children of Men depicts the technology of the future as not too different from ours. This is often my complaint of movies that take place in the near future: the technology is ridiculously over advanced. This movie focuses more on social changes, such as societal collapse and role of the government, while having enough small technological differences to keep reminding the viewer that it is a future that could be just right around the corner.<br/><br/>And, of course, the cinematography of this film. If not known for anything else, Children of Men was praised for its several uses of single-shot sequences, the longest of which was a seven-minute battle scene. The effects and overall style of the world in Children of Men are excellent, and the camera always makes sure it is in the right place to make the audience feel as engrossed in the movie as they possible can. The unrelenting poverty and urban decay adds as a constant reminder that humankind is on its last breath. The visuals are stunning, and the soundtrack of the movie fits perfectly.<br/><br/>This film has several religious and cultural themes to it, but I feel that some viewers can never be aware of them and still enjoy it. The action, drama, and strangely enough comedy should be enough for any moviegoer, casual or otherwise. Cuarón does an exceptional job bringing this depressing but beautiful interpretation of the future to life, and I recommend it as one of the best films of the 2000s."
"jusco15","10","1","7","24 December 2010"," jusco's review: Children of Men
","This is a powerful film. It is not a film to be watched lightly; in fact, you can consider it as disturbing as George Orwell's 1984 or Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. The commonality between the three works? All portray a futuristic dystopian society that though may initially seem unrealistic, eventually causes you to think twice: ""Hey, this isn't all that far-fetched. In fact, this is really scary."" Where to begin? Children of Men, directed by Alfonso Cuarón (also known for directing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and Y tu mamá también), is set in 2027's London. The premise: global human infertility. A baby has not been born in 18 years, implying the upcoming extinction of the human race. And what do people usually do in times of distress or trouble? Create even more problems for themselves, thus leading to collapses and breakdowns, destruction and terrorism. In addition, UK is the only nation still maintaining an actual functioning government, attracting people from around the world. And conveniently, UK's slogan is this: ""Illegal immigration is a crime."" And the list goes on.<br/><br/>In the midst of this rather bleak environment (bombs exploding, people dying), there is a disillusioned man by the name of Theo, played by Clive Owen, who is tasked to help protect and safely escort an African refugee named Kee out of the UK before she is arrested as an illegal immigrant. Just what is so important about Kee? Well, nothing much, except for the fact that she's pregnant and possibly holding the key to salvation of the entire homo sapien race.<br/><br/>This is an amazing film on so many levels. I'll briefly touch on the points. First, the acting. Clive Owen gives a superb performance as Theo, who attempts to act tough and apathetic, but who really has a caring heart and a strong sense of responsibility, duty. And of course, Michael Caine never fails to impress; in this, he provides the much-needed humour by acting as Theo's rather eccentric friend, Jasper. His hobby? Smoking weed, naturally. The rest of the cast is just as solid.<br/><br/>Second, the cinematography is to be highly commended. The camera work is quite possibly one of the best I've seen in any film. It contains several single-shot sequences that are just mind-blowing. You can easily get sucked into the scene, as if you were really there on the grounds, especially during the intense battle scenes. The advantage of such continuous and fluid shots is the ability to engross the audience completely, never giving them time to take a breather.<br/><br/>Third, the soundtrack works ever so efficiently. It was unique enough for me to notice but not so overpowering as to distract you from the film itself. It creates an original and innovative feel by combining multiple genres of music, drawing the right emotion out at the right time.<br/><br/>But ultimately, Children of Men makes you think, and it makes you think hard. In the beginning, I was hesitant. Mass infertility? It all sounded a bit implausible. Yet, the genius of it is how it handles effectively other matters to provide the necessary realism to construct the futuristic and broken London. It is not a film that thrives on the plot of Theo protecting Kee and her baby, but rather on the intensive reflections on life itself.<br/><br/>This is essentially a study and analysis of human behaviour, of human emotions and of the effect of disheartened desperation. It leads to the cruelty that unfortunately resides in many of us. It leads to the apathy, the despondent feeling of giving up because life is just not working out. It leads to the death of faith. Jasper points out (in reference to Theo's deceased son): ""And then, by chance, he was gone. You see, Theo's faith lost out to chance. So, why bother if life's going to make its own choices?"" But the beauty of this film is the faint hope that weaves itself in and out. Let me tell you, it is a roller coaster ride. Things happen so shockingly fast, all you can do is just sit and stare in disbelief. It's tough to watch at times. But this is also a film of self-awareness, of maturity, of growth. Theo goes through that transformation and journey, of discovering the need to grasp tightly to that hope, despite the widespread misery (and he certainly goes through some unimaginable hardships). It's what keeps him going, it's what keeps the audience watching.<br/><br/>It's interesting then, when comparisons to Christianity are made. And these are not worthless comparisons. There are many things to be learnt from this film, and even more to meditate on. Issues of politics, racism and human relations are introduced, and of course that faith, that possibility. If only we can implement this hope in our very lives!"

I appreciated it for its action, and metaphor on humanity coming to a close. But other than that this movie had no effect on me. Only when I started to study existentialism, absurdism, and themes in global issues did I start to open my perception on REAL evils in the world. And, no, humankind ending is NOT the greatest evil...<br/><br/>If you can grasp that, then you already understand this movie. The trailer promotes it as a futuristic sci-fi with intense scenes and renowned actors. Yet the experience of Children of Men takes the viewers on a wholly different level of politics, literature, poetry, and spirituality. I will not waste your time putting this film on a pedestal (although it deserves much more) I will take the liberty of this review to describe the film through a few exemplary scenes which stand out most:<br/><br/>We are introduced to a (not so improbable) country run by a wealthy minority who controls all aspects of life. Some aspects that struck me most were the use of Quietus (a government funded suicide kit to ""help"" people out of their misery); Theo's affluent cousin who keeps his son (who, from the looks of the tattoos on his neck, looks like he was a former rebel without a cause, so to speak) sedated, lives in the most extreme case of self-centeredness; and one particular sign that orders citizens to turn in those who do not take fertility tests; the burning crop and farming fields; just to pick a few from many. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the responsibility that we, the viewers, have is to take the important lesson from the film: to never give up hope, and keep fighting for it with all the faith you can muster. <br/><br/>Not only is this film greatly shot and edited but is one of the most important forms of theatre I've had the good fortune to come across."

","After I watched the movie Children of Men, I became a fan of it. The movie was so good and while watching it, I felt mixed emotions. I feel so sad and quite happy. The major impression that the movie had on me was how amazing it is. The movie was so intense that I crumpled the paper that I was working on my class. The background of the movie was great, it symbolizes hope, chaos, faith etc; Every angle of the movie has some deep meaning out of it and how the actors or actresses carries their roles for more than 10 minutes without cutting it and just continuously shooting the film. This movie is so professional.<br/><br/>The movie is really interesting. The major characters are Theo, d journalist; Julian, Theo's ex-wife; and Kee, a young black woman who turns out to be pregnant. Every characters/actors in this movie gave out their best performances to turn this movie out so good and real.<br/><br/>Children of Men is about how the world collapse and only Great Britain stood still, how immigrants suffer consequences from migrating illegally, and about how people suffer from an epidemic of infertility; which means they are the last human specie in the entire universe but after all of these stuff that is happening there is still hope in everyone's mind and heart that one day everything will be alright. The background of the movie and the way that its characters interacts with it conveys the film's main idea. Not losing hope and still having faith to God.<br/><br/>The film has some visually interesting thing too. One background scene of the film said something about uprising, and you can see the people on the same scene background revolting and fighting against the army of Great Britain. The tracking shots of this film are very well done. Everything looks very well polished and interesting. The actors are great too, they did took their job very seriously and did a great performance in this movie. As the movie rolls you can never tell what's the most noticeable or lacking part of it. Every angle was clear and you just can't foreshadow what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>This movie is fantastic. An epic. One of the best movie of all time. From the cinematography to how the story goes. It is very well done. I would recommend this movie to my friend or family because this movie has a message and would make them think about these kind of situation."
"emmyem38","10","1","7","24 March 2009"," A technical and artistic masterpiece
","I've been a fan of Alfonso Cuaron ever since 'Y Tu Mama Tambien', and I particularly like his use of long takes - I find they give a brilliant sense of urgency and environment. However, with 'Children of Men' he's raised the bar not just for long takes but for political sci-fi cinema.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, but apparently a lot of creative license was taken with this adaptation. Either way, the end result is very successful. Clive Owen (who I'm usually not to keen on) is great as the apathetic slob Theo, crow-barred into escorting the first pregnant woman in 20 years to a rumoured haven of scientists, and it's great to see a hero in a film who is clumsy, tired and a bit of a jerk sometimes.<br/><br/>I also love the fact that this isn't an 'issue movie' - this could easily have been an abortion fable or enviro-porn, but instead it's just a tale about hope. Pure and simple. Another director might have shown what happens to Kee at the Human Project - that doesn't matter. What's great about the story is it shows how Theo (the most apathetic guy possible) does everything he can to preserve humanity's last hope, and I think that's beautiful.<br/><br/>The long takes - oh my God. They are just incredible. For my money, this film has three of the best long takes ever committed to film - the opening bombing (a wonderful bit of scene-setting), the car journey (techincally several shots edited together, but the effects are so seamless it doesn't matter) and the infamous 7 minute long siege scene (a masterpiece of choreographed mayhem).<br/><br/>I don't know how Alfonso is going to top this (I for one would love him to return to Hogwarts again for The Deathly Hallows), but I hear he's doing a remake of The Witches - that should be brilliant."

","Since there is no 1/2 point system, I'll go 8--but, more like a 7.5.<br/><br/>Having not read the novel on which it was based, ""Children of Men"" came to me as story that--like most before it, and countless yet to come--probably didn't succeed in the transfer to celluloid with much satisfaction to those who loved the book. But, as a film, with no prejudice on my part, I was sucked in--but, it wasn't instantaneous, and I did leave with as many unanswered questions.<br/><br/>This is the type of film that you've really got to stick with. I can remember saying out loud to those watching it with me, ""I have no clue where this is going,"" but, with the words still in the air, it took shape.<br/><br/>Theo, the ""hero,"" is sucked in to a radical group formed from England's decision to deport all non-Brits. Society on a pandemic scale has broken down, and jolly old England is the only ""civilized"" country left on earth. In order to preserve their empire, all immigrants out. Add into the equation that no child has been born in 20 years, and you've got the kind of chaos built for the year 2027. Kee, whom I gather was a black prostitute, has surfaced to the rebels as the lone fertile woman left on earth and she's great with child. They think the birth of her child will add to their cause. She wants none of it, so she and Theo with midwife Miriam in tow, set out to find the Human Project, and their ship ""Tomorrow"" to take them away from all this.<br/><br/>It was an exciting film that really heated up in the last third. Parallels are drawn to the concentration camps and genocide of wars in our history, current and past.<br/><br/>Like many here on this board, I, too was sort of curious as to what was the cause of the sterility, and exactly who was this Human Project--but, through the writing, I got the sense that the characters in the story didn't know themselves, so I figured, ""Such is life. I don't have all the answers, neither do they. Typical."" If you're a purist to the novel, odds are, like every other screen adaptation, you're probably going to scream, ""Blaspahmy!"" If you just want a thinking film where you leave with questions that lead to discussions, you'll probably like it. I did."

The moment when the guy rides in a limo to meet some government acquaintance. At this moment, we hear a short piece of King Crimson's ""In the Court of the Crimson King"". This song is old, dated 1969, and yet it sounds very fresh. For some reason King Crimson's music is never used in movies, although it sounds as great as Heaven. This was the moment when I loved this movie. On all the other accounts this is a quality one, definitely worth watching. Another good thing about it is that the ending is somewhat ambiguous."

It really enlightens us with one of the terrible nightmares of mankind - infertility. And its adaption falls no short.<br/><br/>Wonderfully written, directed and conceived by Alfonso Cauron, the film displays 2027 as a complete chaos - Several governments of different countries collapsing, refugees from different countries seeking safe shelters in Britain, and British Government, trying to clean off the fugees like pests. Declared as police state, England has become a place of civil assaults, uncontrolled oppositions and several fugee groups like 'Fishes'. And our hero, Theo gets unexpectedly involved in a voyage - a voyage to safely send world's only newborn and her mother to off coasts of the Britain.<br/><br/>Clive Owen does a great job as Theo. Perhaps the film in fact is made for him. Other actors like Michael Caine have a very memorable performances. Julliana Moore had a very short role, but she was good.<br/><br/>The film depicts very realistic images of civil wars. It is very moving as well, and full of intense sequences. Alfonso Cauron does an exceptionally great job in pulling off all these 'war' scenes, they are very very authentic. Cauron's whole presentation of the film works like a charm. And yes, this time too he used wide angle lenses.<br/><br/>One thing for which this film will be reminded is its very innovative cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki. The film had a very 'documentary style' feeling to it. There were long takes, perhaps very long and several scenes were shot with hand helds, very effectively. And one thing more to mention - the film was mostly shot in natural lighting. The whole atmosphere created by Lubezki is just short of words.<br/><br/>'Children of Men' is definitely Caurons best work to date.

This feeling should be treasured and kept forever whatever difficulties we met.Thus,what I'm quite sure is that people will be immortal. P.S. The photography applied in this movie is awesome. Being designed abundantly,it is very flexible and full of realism. I especially like the scene of boat staying on the sea surrounded by fog with an injured fighter and a great mother.

The countries become a battleground between the fanatical right who blame it on troublesome extremists and the lunatic left who blame it on terrorists.

Into this insane world is a secretive group who have developed a hopeful beginning called The Human Project. Their efforts are condemned by the government and their allies target everyone who tries to regenerate the population. One man who believes in the Human project is Theo Faron (Clive Owen) who learns of one girl called Kee (Clare Ashitey) who is pregnant. Seeking refuge a rebel friend puts him on a hazardous, adventurous roller-coaster ride which takes him in and out of Gunfights, ambushes, assassinations, concentration camps, street fights and armed clashes between roving armies. Along the way he seeks out advice from a once promising cartoonist called Jasper, (Michael Caine) who has become a hermit.

","This is one of the most engaging experiences i had in film world lately. Cuarón is already responsible for some strong creations, including ""Y tu mama también"" or the best Harry Potter feature, to my view, which was the third one (Azkaban). Nevertheless this is, to my view, his most successful accomplishment to this point. That had to do, as far as i know, with knowing the masters, the guide lights in the visual world of cinema, i mean really knowing what was the strength in their movies (more than copying the style like, say, Tarantino often does to his ""references"") and using that knowledge in a personal project.<br/><br/>I am not such an expert in the world of films, but for what i do know, i got to ""see"" four masters here. So, back to the basics: <br/><br/>. start with Hitchcock. In his wide-known book-interview with Truffaut, Hitch praised above all the capacity for his movies to engage the audiences; in order to do that he always played with elements of the story, surprises, turn-backs, unpredictable happenings, etc. and more important, he placed his vision in filming the scenes in a way that made them fascinatingly engaging: Watch Psycho and you'll see the death of our Julianne Moore coming at this one which is to say, much sooner than one would expect even more when we have a ""star"" which was ""supposed"" to live until the end (or close). Watch Hitch's films especially from the ""rope phase"", ""dial m..."" ""rear window"", and you'll find where Cuarón got much of the ideas for much of the shots, including the final idea for a ""one shot sequence"", or at least, it strikes you as that.<br/><br/>. than we have Welles. This one, in Cuarón's vision, completes the structure he got from Hitchcock. Watch Welles's work when he is more clearly aims at exploring space, finding reasons to move the camera, go around the set, unknown places, in and out, etc. In other words, watch ""Touch of Evil"" where his reflexions on cinematic space exploration come more vivid than ever. Compare the longest shots in that project (the first sequence, and the last ones, bridge persecution, etc), and than come to this again, watch the final very long sequence, inside the prisoners camp, and observe how brilliantly Cuarón understands the possibilities Welles opened, and how well he explores those possibilities.<br/><br/>Than we have the reflexion portions. Cuarón gets more clumsy here, and shows a smaller perception of the masters he seeks. But it still is worth watching, and i personally understand the fact that he ""rushes"" things where his references would have taken longer for matters of general coherence, and pace. So here we have: <br/><br/>. Tarkovsky, who could as no one in film-history, place the idea of memory in front of his camera. All his work is a big, beautiful, delightful, almost orgasmic reflexion on meditation. Cuarón doesn't get halfway through in getting to Tarkovsky in deepness and meaning (visually speaking) but there is one shot which is worth attention, the one in which the camera explores an old abandoned school and we get to here the jingle from an old rusty swinging toy where our pregnant miracle mother thinks about her life, and represents at the same time the memory she never lived in, but in which Owen's character lived good (and happy) portions of his life; <br/><br/>. Leone/Morricone: the musical vocal theme is here for the same reasons the main theme from ""once upon a time in the west"" is there and that is to provide the audience with the same emotion and inner feelings the characters are supposed to be feeling in that moment. Leone was a genius, an absolute master in getting this effect, and his collaboration with Morricone probably has lots to do with this. Anyway, Cuarón understands Leone; so check the moments in which this theme shows up, after reviewing ""once upon a time..."" and you'll understand.<br/><br/>The power of this film is that you are able to enjoy it as a piece on its own, and still, afterwards (and during it) identify the references. I admire people who can dignify the masters they admire. Watch this.<br/><br/>Trivia: Oh and i couldn't stop noticing. One more use in cinema of the Battersea Power Station, London. This case has two particular aspects: <br/><br/>. It is used as an Art Ark, place for gathering works of art that survive the chaos. We see one of them through the window while Owen's character is inside and that is the flying pig from Pink Floyd's animals, which was at the cover of that album exactly in that position. Animals was loosely based in Orwell's work Animal Farm. Orwell also wrote 1984, which, when adapted to cinema, was partly shot in the same Battersea station. 1984 described a world of oppression, hopeless future, partly close to this one (oh and when Owen gets in that ark the space is in fact Tate Modern, reconstruction of another factory by the same architect of Battersea) . The other aspect is that in a street shot we get as soundtrack King Crimsons famous progressive song. This is a band from that 70's period, of which Pink FLyod came out the most famous and successful. This is, to my view, interesting trivia<br/><br/>My evaluation: 4/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","Lots of spectacularly unsophisticated reviews chanting the 'not-properly-elaborated' mantra, some of them objecting an anti-American edge, too  a leftist one at that! My oh my! So let me interject my two points on those issues: 1. It's not holes in the plot, it's your ignorance. Go get a clue about the world you live in, then please give a damn. 2. Nothing anti-American here  just some anti-Guantanamo, anti-Abu-Ghraib, anti-fascist, anti-ignorant, anti-dumbass and anti-Hollywood stuff. 'Children of men' is actually the most wholesome and honest movie in years, and by movie I mean absorbing entertainment made in the classic, sensible tradition. Also with enough innovation to make a technical buff's heart sing. It has points, and those points are all beautifully integrated into the narrative and scenery, so that a discerning viewer can decode them all, preferably during repeated viewings. It's all in the pictures  that's what I call cinematography. What the film lacks is spoon-feeding and shiny CGI candies that would assure a smooth 'consumer experience'. This is a bumpy ride through a sordid world, with long, hectic shots exploring a possible near-future which threatens to be the last paragraph in the story of our race. Mother Nature presenting the bill while humans keep chasing tail is DEFINITELY NOT a far-fetched issue  it's a reality that is affecting our life more and more each day, on multiple grounds. People going unfertile would be just a logical culmination of our estrangement from (and over-abusing of) our natural basics. Cuaron draws a frighteningly plausible picture of the imminent future, but through this he does exactly the same thing his fallible heroes do in the movie: by acknowledging a conscience, he recovers hope."

Very surprisingly Julliane Moore acts only for a few minutes, in spite of her being presented as one of the leads whereas Michael Caine is always a giant. I would eventually say that the movie is remarkable but despite its continuous turns it doesn't manage to take advantage of the nice idea and of the impressive story.

Watching it to the end was painful -- like poke me in the eye with a stick painful. The only thing that kept me going was the thought that something spectacular happens near the end to warrant the score on IMDB -- but it only got worse. Save yourself 2 hours of your life and don't watch this one -- despite the reviews."

","For once ( well twice ) i actually enjoyed watching Clive Owen. I usually find him extremely boring to watch. Michael Cane, as always, was brilliant. In fact there nothing bad to say about the acting maybe the girl who played Kee could of preformed better. This film is a achievement in cinematography. The scenery is fantastic and the story involving the characters struggle to reach a vital destination is grabbing.<br/><br/>there are some fantastic battle scenes which were done in one or two takes. These are brilliant. The camera work is no doubt the main highlight of the film. I felt more involved with the battles, more than Saving private Ryan. The nice little touch of blood on the lens, the hand held movements, brilliant.<br/><br/>the film looks greats and feels great."

","OK... where to start: 1) Clive Owen - He was superb. He added a freshness, a humanity to the role. I adored the scene where he was shooting balls from his mouth to his ex's. I felt his pain when she died, and his accomplishment in his slow, yet possibly welcomed death. He never lifted a gun, not once. I don't know why, but maybe the makers thought there was already enough background violence in the film to suffice. Whichever way... it was best.<br/><br/>2) The experience - The war was real. The hand-held camera gave it its required ruggedness. They even left the blood splatter on the lens. It was an inspired decision. Ordinarilly, i detest hand-held, but here, what can i say! What worked, worked better than anyone could imagine.<br/><br/>3) Michael Caine - His strawberry coated coughing character was splendid, and fun. He was required not to leave the film as a drab dull sequence. Pull my finger!!<br/><br/>4) Kee - She was okay. She played her character well, the clueless young, well guided mother. She made the film quite comic, with her virginity allegation, and her desire to name her daughter Bazooka!! But still she made her faith and trust in Leo look so genuine.<br/><br/>...i don't think IMDb would let me add the rest."

The movie starts out too fast, but after a minute or 10 you get the hang of it and you follow through..<br/><br/>The fact that the hero Theo doesn't touch a gun or weapon through out the film is excellent!

"EijnarAmadeus","8","1","11","25 January 2008"," A spirited, powerful and spellbinding movie
","The year's 2027 and there hasn't been a birth since 2009, and the death of Baby Diego, a eighteen year old boy, creates a national depression and mourning. In 2027 UK things ain't going too well, immigrants and refugees are held prisoners, being stripped, tortured and held in cages. It's a battle-battered country with terrorism, religions colliding, immigrant invasion and off course, human infertility. Theo (Clive Owen) is a former activist who decides to help his ex-girlfriend Julian with joining the Fishes (dedicated rebels), who fights a war against the military saving and rescuing refugees. Now Theo decides to help a young, black girl named Kee, who reveals that she's eight-months pregnant. This turns everything upside-down as Theo and Kee understands that they've become targets for special interest groups who's willing to kill him and Kee after her baby's born.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron made one of the most passionate thrillers in recent memory with this mind-blowing achievement. It's packed with intellect and spirit, he manages to create character in the long-lost London, a city burning and dying with confusion, depression and lost hope; Theo and Kee knows that there is hope, and Clive Owen's Theo is a shell of lost emotion, emotionless at first - but Owen lets us under Theo's skin in some short, heartbreaking moments. And although the movie is soaked in its long-lost hope and with war raging, there's humanity to find amongst the ruins here - for example Kee's beautiful appearance, Theo's hard-burning soul and off course Michael Caine's brilliant Jasper, a man devoted to his weed, zen music and senile wife, he sticks it to the system and lives in a hidden-away house in the middle of the forest.<br/><br/>The sorrow, beauty and excitement of this movie is unique - one of the finest scenes of 2006 features Theo and the gang being attacked by warriors whilst trying to escape by car, the hand-held camera effect has never worked to a more exhilarating effect, you literally live the scene. CHILDREN OF MEN is spellbinding, a movie that makes you believe and hope when things look as bad as anything, when the fire has stopped burning - there's always something better ahead."

","This film was a very big surprise, as I never heard of it before seeing it. And the title was not promising for me.<br/><br/>It was one of the few movies that made me drop a tear while watching it with other people. First, in the car, Theo and Julian start to play, they catch a ball with their mouths, their heads coming closer and closer. There was a feeling that their love will be revived as soon as they meet, and, as the action goes, this feeling is stronger. Only that a few seconds after the ball game Julian dies. Love won't resurrect.<br/><br/>Second, there is an incredible scene where all the fights stop as the soldiers hear a baby crying. It caused emotions just like a real world event seen with one's own eyes. This moment ends very soon, too soon I guess. <br/><br/>The action will continue to have nearly impossible situations, each one solved with a little luck and some divine protection. <br/><br/>By no means a classical happy-end story, there is no strong promise that the world will be better, almost everyone dies, the love story is killed early (though the ones carrying the most of hope survive) and though people survive, their condition and perspectives worsen every day. I don't know what still holds me from giving it a ten, maybe the genius scene when the peace lasts only for 10 seconds."
"DICK STEEL","10","1","12","10 August 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Children of Men
","I still can't fathom the reason how this film was left out of a theatrical release here. After all, Clive Owen should be a draw based on his roguish persona and audiences here would be familiar with his works like Inside Man, Derailed and Closer. Then again, science fiction may not be everyone's cup of tea, although this film is deeply rooted in basic humanity themes like despair and hope.<br/><br/>Set in the year 2027 in Britain, we learn that the future is not as glitzy as many would make it out to be. It's grimy and very much bleak in nature, where the world is already collapsing, save for Britain being the last country standing with some semblance of order that's in the form of a police state gone wrong, and the deportation and treatment of illegal immigrants becoming one of the hot spots. ""Fishes"" spring up in anti-government protests, being the freedom fighters battling for equal rights for all immigrants. Add to that, humanity itself is on the brink of extinction, where the youngest person, an 18 year old, has died, and the human fertility problem goes onto an overdrive. We can't reproduce, and as such, all hope in the continuity of our civilization goes down the drain as well.<br/><br/>Yes, that's an interesting premise to begin with, where we can question the What Ifs, whether our evolution can begin to go down that slippery slope, and if that chief reproduction problem could be tied down to technology, or ecology, that Nature or God just decided that our plundering of the Earth is enough, and it's time for us to take our place in history. For those who had enough of apocalyptic issues threatening us human beings, what with the Sun dying, or an alien invasion, or a disaster so extreme that it'll obliterate all of us in one swoop, this premise is a breath of fresh air, even though it may serve as an immense red herring, that the much larger context here lies in hope and faith.<br/><br/>Curiously, much of the context can be tied back to the current world sentiments, with issues like freedom fighters, homeland security, the corruption of those in power, and even a reference back in time to a flu pandemic which we are facing right now. There are plenty of imagery here, be it icons, or religious linked ones, right down to security issues, that makes this film deserving of more than 1 viewing just to pick them all up. Based upon the novel by P.D. James, director Alfonso Cuaron deftly incorporated many of today's world into this not too distant future that we may be in danger of slipping into (except for that human fertility problem, but who knows?) and the despair that will come and plunge everyone into, which is expertly placed in and around the visual backdrop of the story.<br/><br/>Children of Men accomplished what films like Babylon A.D. failed, where both on the surface deals with a protector of the last hope of mankind, and having to overcome various obstacles posed by those who are corrupt, and want to politicize humanity's last chance for their own ends. It goes to show that special effects if done right, will add a superb cinematic dimension and wow you. Babylon A.D. didn't offer anything new, and neither did Children of Men in terms of its cinematography, but its detailed and brilliantly crafted continuous take in action sequences, simply steals your breath away. And as if the filmmakers here are set on sadistically challenging themselves, they do no less than 4 of such scenes with increasing complexity, that has to be seen, admired and appreciated.<br/><br/>With amazing landscapes created, Children of Men tells a lot without showing you everything in verbatim. It has plenty of cultural references and metaphors, back stories of characters that make you care about them, eye popping effects and an excellent cast, it's no wonder why this film had wound up on many critic's top 10 lists for the year. If given a chance, do watch this film that had already placed itself on my list of recommendations and must watch list!"
"ClaytonDavis","8","1","12","20 October 2007"," Where are the children?
","From Alfonso Cuaron comes the depth defying, Children of Men starring Academy Award nominees Clive Owen and Julianne Moore with Oscar winner Michael Caine. One generation from now, women are infertile and no longer able to do the one things they feel they were brought here to do. The world is in turmoil, streets are dangerous, and there is no hope for future. When the youngest person on earth is killed at the age of 19, the downward spiral that mankind is going down only worsens.<br/><br/>All seems lost, until Theo (Owen) is contacted by his ex-wife (Moore) and presents him with a mission; transport a young African-American girl to an undisclosed location. There is a catch however, this young woman is pregnant and near birth.<br/><br/>Children of Men is a captivating motion picture of recent years. As we expect this spectacular sci-fi film with explosions and action, we are left without the theatrics and given a humane look into the soul of a society. The film excels on many levels, especially in the film's resolution. Clive Owen gives a very subtle yet striking performance. We haven't seen Owen like this before and it's in the beauty of Theo that he creates that makes the character work. Not since Closer has he been this sensational.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore is brief but very memorable. It still haunts me how that woman is without an Oscar. As underdeveloped as the relationship between her and Theo is, there's no real reason for us not care for the two. It isn't until her absence from the film, do we feel her prescience missed.<br/><br/>Michael Caine is as effective as always turning in one great supporting performance after another. Caine is clear cut, fun loving and physically different in his role. The character doesn't excel on the dramatic level rather balances out the melancholy nature of the film with some bright faces and wonderful laughter.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron however, is the main reason this picture succeeded so. His choice of location, placement, and artistic integrity is evident from start to finish. The film's cinematography is the most creative camera-work in possibly the last century of cinema. Its such a key element to the story and the whole beauty and technique by Emanuel Lubeski leaves him in the top ranks of other great cinematographers as Rodrigo Prieto and Conrad L. Hall.<br/><br/>This is a film for everyone to experience and with a good adaptation from Cuaron and four other creative writers, the film doesn't lose focus of their objective.<br/><br/>Grade: ***/****"
"Gordon-11","Null","1","12","20 October 2007"," Disturbing reminder of the current world
","This film is about a government agent becoming an unlikely hero by safeguarding the only pregnant woman on earth.<br/><br/>The title ""Children of Men"" does not give anything away, and to some degree sounds even innocent. So, the content of the film would be a shock to most viewers. In contrast to most films, the future is not bright and hi-tech. Instead, it is gruesome, disturbed and violent. There are numerous disturbingly graphic scenes of murder and execution. Random bombings, militant warfare and racial discrimination may be set in a futuristic world; however they are also present in this very moment. This parallel is highly disturbing. I think this film can serve as a reminder that we all need to stop destroying our world we live in."
"terylene","7","1","12","28 July 2007"," Watch the Movie, Ignore the Politics, Skip the Bonus Features.
","Children of Men is a dark, violent, beautifully filmed and action packed science fiction film. It is also one of the most original (aside from the politics) and enjoyable films I've seen from 2006. Unfortunately, it is heavily politically charged to the point where it's trying to drive its messages home with the force of an asteroid crashing into a celestial body. That's not exactly a spoiler there as it gets to the preachiness right off the bat. It's annoying and worse off, as typical extreme Left media projects often are (from TV to print media to websites to film etc.) it's highly exaggerated, highly anti-American and highly knee-jerk.<br/><br/>But, that's OK. This is science fiction with the emphasis on FICTION. I was able to ignore the politics and enjoy the documentary style cinematography, the suspense and the script that remains crisp up until about the last 20 minutes where it bogs down.<br/><br/>What made it easy to ignore the politics was the fact that they can't even get their message straight. There's a heavy pro-illegal immigration (a.k.a. open borders) feel throughout the movie. What's funny is the whole state of the World depicted is actually an argument AGAINST illegal immigration. The England depicted here is apparently one of separate factions of roving gangs and militias all representing separate ethnic groups who all seem to want something different. Translation: No one wants to integrate into the society they entered, they want the society to conform to them. That can't happen and this movie does a great job depicting what could happen in such a world of open borders.<br/><br/>There's also mention of a Flu pandemic. Guess what guys? That's another negative side to the open borders philosophy. That's the reason Tuberculosis and even The Plague is starting to make a comeback in the United States after having been eliminated for years. I know a great big hug to cure those maladies would be nice, but it's not going to happen.<br/><br/>Throw in some veiled references to global warming and an anti-Capitalistic message and you've got the whole extreme Left playbook.<br/><br/>What? You don't believe me? I don't recommend the ""The Possibility of Hope"" bonus feature on the DVD, but if you deny anything I've written above about the messages in this film, check it out. It will confirm everything I've said and more.<br/><br/>Perhaps you enjoy a good laugh, especially after such a dark film. Then you also might be interested in the tripe being spewed throughout that same bonus feature if you have 30 minutes of your life to throw away. It's almost like a comedy skit that goes on way too long. The evil music with the long panning shot of the White House. Speaking about ""fear"" while showing a shot of a memorial wall emblazoned with the phrase ""Freedom is not Free."" Blaming all the world's troubles on global warming...at least when it's not blaming America. All that was missing was the 1-800 number where you can order your Home Leftist kit complete with Che Guevara T-Shirt, American Flag pre-soaked with gasoline, lighter and a copy of ""The Wit and Wisdom of Karl Marx."" Maybe that was at the end. My bad. I couldn't sit through the whole thing.<br/><br/>At this point, you must be saying, ""Wait a minute! I thought you started off this review saying you liked this movie. Plus you gave it a rating of 7 out of 10."" Good call my friend. You're correct. I did like this movie and believe it or not I actually have to recommend it. While it's political to a fault, there are enough good points to overshadow all that hokum. Again, this is Science Fiction and nothing more. Leftists will probably walk away with a smug sense of self-satisfaction. Those who stand to the center and the right will chuckle at the now trite political statements regurgitated from yet another film. But it's an absorbing 1:48 minutes of film and an intriguing suspense story that ultimately overshadows the politics."
"howard.schumann","8","1","13","16 December 2007"," A dark and doom-laden affair
","Apocalyptic films and literature have run the gamut form monsters and fascists to aliens with most stories featuring narratives in which mankind is either enslaved, impotent, or on the verge of extinction. Nowhere do we see the human race being transformed into higher, more evolved spiritual beings. In Children of Men, last year's excursion into futuristic gloomsville, Lou Dobbs' worst nightmares have come true. Only Britain seems to have survived some sort of holocaust and immigrants (called 'fugees) from all over the world have descended upon its gleaming shores. Why the Brits are the chosen people is not explained. All we know is that the 'fugees have flooded the country and are suspected of terrorism and restricted by martial law. Rounded up and arrested, they are put in holding pens near the seacoast and are treated as less than fully human.<br/><br/>Set in 2027, Children of Men depicts the chaos and confusion of a world on the brink of madness. Based on a 1992 novel by P.D. James, mankind has lost the ability to procreate while scientists in the Human Project work to reverse the loss the last child born on Earth, now 18 years old. The government is a police state beset by terrorists such as the Fish who are fighting for the rights of illegal immigrants and working to throw out the hated government. The streets are littered with garbage and people live in rubble and bombed out buildings that look like Dresden after the fire bombing. Old people are given Quietus programs to assist them in committing suicide. In this scene of atmospheric darkness there is a glimmer of hope. A former radical Theo Fearon (Clive Owen) has given up the fight, content to do his job as a worker in the Ministry of Energy and consort with an old pot-smoker Jasper (Michael Caine).<br/><br/>Jasper lives in the woods and mouths inanities such as the world is a battle between faith and chance (without any purpose I presume). When Theo is detained by former radical Fish associates led by his ex-lover Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore), he is drawn back into the conflict once again. Asked to provide transit documents to ensure safe passage out of the country for a young 'fugee named Kee (Claire Hope-Ashitey), Theo finds out that the girl is miraculously pregnant and mankind's last hope. As the two fight off the police and the terrorists to reach a ship operating as the Human Project, seen as the last sanctuary left on Earth, the film takes us on a wild ride through many taut battle sequences and Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron does an amazing job of keeping us involved in a thrilling ride in which the survival of the human race is at stake.<br/><br/>Although Cuaron has said, ""I believe an evolution is happening, an evolution of the human understanding that is happening in the youngest generation. I believe that the generation to come is the one that is going to come with new schemes and new perspectives of things"", Children of Men is mostly a dark and doom-laden affair in which mankind seems not to have made any spiritual progress in the last twenty years. There is no beauty. There is no transformation. Devoid of the new perspective Cuaron talks about, Children of Men describes a physical and spiritual dead end."

","Wow, I can't remember the last time I was this emotionally involved in a film. Apacolypto was pretty heart stopping too, but the stakes are raised from fate of one family to fate of the world, and the execution here is nearly perfect. There's very little exposition on the state of the world, much of the back-story is communicated indirectly, TV's, radio's, newspapers etc, which can make it a little hard to piece together fully, if your not paying attention. The drama is unrelenting, the camera work amazing, the music is great, the dialoge especially the conversational bits I thought was pretty natural and worked well to create a false sense of security (moments of quiet before the storm). The Pink Floyd house was great. I couldn't imagine anyone with a pulse not at least being engrossed by this."

","I read this novel about five years ago, though it was written even earlier. I was intrigued that P. D. James, one of my favorite British mystery writers had written a Sci Fi dystopian novel. The book captivated me, but the movie made it hard to sleep. It is the stuff that we worry about. That when our culture ceases to reproduce, what is there to save and create and do for? The images are very documentary-like. The cinematography is outstanding, and the acting is simple and real. As you probably already know, anarchy has been unleashed on the world and the British government is trying to sustain its borders. This happens because for many years, women have been unable to produce children. I remember the Arthur C. Clarke book Childhood's End, which is a new epistemology, ala 2001: A Space Odyssey. This movie is down and dirty and much more realistic. What if a virus or some meddling with science could bring about this reality, would be react the way these cultures have, every man for himself. If there is a criticism, it would probably be that we don't get to the roots of the anarchy. It seems like an awfully short time for so much to have happened. This is one of the most thoughtful movies I've seen in some time. It has a real message and doesn't pull any punches."

Very good plot on paper and its pretty well done. I will say the 1st 40mins of the movie I hated and felt so boring and mundane. Then it started to pick up and get pretty interesting in the end.

","Time has only demonstrated some of the realities of the prophetic nature of Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men, especially in regards to the global waves of immigrants seeking a better life and/or refuge especially in North American and European countries.<br/><br/>This grim, bleak film is arguably the best imagining of an urban society facing its descent into anarchy. We see an increasingly, we gather, dictatorial British Government in 2027, being besieged by various activist groups, the most militant being The Fishes. Simultaneously, it is also dealing failingly with huge social upheavels brought about by mass waves of immigrants and a human race trying to adjust to 18 years of female sterility.<br/><br/>This is the background setting for the film which follows the personal journey of Theo, a fearful, cynical, one time activist, who reluctantly becomes the personal guardian of both a mother and her new born, who just may hold the keys to the salvation of humanity. If this sounds like a Nativity story, that's because it is; a Nativity story set in a semi-anarchistic state, with Theo played by Clive Owen, being a Joseph like figure to Kee's Mary and her child Dylan, a Jesus substitute.<br/><br/>Though the film is full of religious symbolism and overtones, the story is quite secular in nature. The film's second and third acts essentially constitute a chase film, but one filmed with an extremely documentary type feel. The camera work is remarkable, but again, very consistent with many of Cuarón's other work. Hand - held cameras are frequently employed but not in the choppy, rapid-fire editing style of many other contemporary works. Cuarón continues to demonstrate in Children of Men, his love for elaborately long tracking shots, as seen in his other films such as Gravity. It makes for some fascinating viewing.<br/><br/>The narrative is less objective with some of the characters' and groups' actions and motivations not always clearly or easily explained.This, in addition to the fact that there is never any explanation offered for female sterility, nor for Kee being able to conceive (thus paralleling the biblical Immaculate Conception).<br/><br/>Children of Men is truly a cinematic project with most critics acknowledging that it is a far superior piece of work, than its source novel written by PD James, more famous for her mystery tales. Those wishing to see some extremely complex, but successfully shot dramatic and action sequences could do far worse than give this film your attention."

","I would give 8/10 if not the last 2 minutes of the movie...<br/><br/>First of all the story is unique, interesting, I didn't see an idea like that before. It was often intense. I had emotions while watching this, so it's great job. Even though it's pretty good, something was still missing, I felt like some things could be improved. There were interesting twists portraying that no one could be trusted. Who knows if even the Project of Life exists and if they do if they really are good guys. I don't like unknown endings like that, they have to be done correctly. Also why does a hero always has to die in the end (yes, most people say everything points that he died)? Why is it always a man? Why do men always die for women? Men always have to do more and die early, ugh!
Some people say that this movie has some religious meaning, for example like Jesus died for our sins to save everyone, similarly this man dies to save humanity from extinction. Maybe next time I watch this I should google this topic more and try to think about that while watching.<br/><br/>The shots were amazing in this movie! There were many very long shots which give uniqueness and shows how good the actors are. This is something worth giving an extra star. Unfortunately the ending took it away."

","10 February 2007. While a pretty good movie with compelling, thrilling cinematography, some of the best of the year, the screenplay falls a bit short with its over the top, somewhat manipulative and unnecessary exploitative death scenes. More subtlety and independent movie thinking would have made this movie a clear nominee for best picture. This movie follows in the footstep Fahrenheit 451 (1966), A.I. (2001), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Blade Runner (1982) with this amazing military scenes and the fine contrast between the rich and poor. The whole look of the movie is clearly a notch above almost any movie of the future, the atmospherics are terrific. The weak parts of the movie are the circumstances the scriptwriter needed to say the obvious with how many of the characters die. This is an ensemble piece where there really isn't the acting so much as the performance of the composite of the movie's actors. A credible, richly dense, layered movie with a few writing and plot weaknesses. Eight out of Ten Stars."

","Its intriguing concept pulled me into this movie. I love thoughtful science fiction. And its dystopian near-future setting was crafted with remarkable attention to detail - alone worth the watch. The artsy, jerky camera work was also done well. And while I could overlook the jarring violence, I couldn't overlook the shallow characters and lack of thinking that went into the plot as the movie developed. The final third of the movie wasn't much more than a war movie. Too many characters died, often too qiuickly - and we never really got a chance to care about most of them. I don't mind dark movies, in fact I often enjoy them, but the dark mood needs to bring out vulnerability and hope in the characters. And while that vulnerability and hope were central to the movie, as the subject implies, somehow it didn't connect well. The chemistry between the 2 main characters never really happened. The only chemistry seemed to surround Michael Caine's small part, one which almost stole the show. The lead performance was particularly hollow. This movie reminded me of 2012, another dark and jarring movie that was difficult to get through. I was able to finish Children of Men, unlike 2012. But I felt there wasn't enough payoff for suffering through the violence and darkness."

Even the color grading of this movie is absolutely perfect. This movie just looks so damn good. <br/><br/>Everything else though, is very debatable. The world building, is very haphazardly done.

Like I felt like I was watching a Spielberg movie at times with how forceful this movie was with these melodramatic sentiments.

Partially because of the sub par script, but also because of straight up bad casting. Clive Owens and Julianne Moore were decent, with Clive Owen showing glimpses of brilliance. Michael Caine was good beside having some of the worst dialogue. Everyone else though was just so stiff and boring in their performance. <br/><br/>It is a real shame.

","While I appreciate the well-meaning and important message behind 'Children of Men', its on-screen execution is extremely disappointing. This might be a sci-fi film but, given it's supposed to be portraying a real life scenario in the near future, the storyline should at the very least have some substance and believability to it. Unfortunately I couldn't buy into any of what was happening and it never really had me fully engaged.<br/><br/>The problem is that nothing in 'Children of Men' is ever explained, including the most crucial part of the plot - why have women become infertile? We are just expected to go along with everything that happens without questioning why or how. The film becomes more and more implausible as it goes along, with an ending that is rather appropriately uninspiring and far-fetched.

","MAJOR SPOILER AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW! 
An important supporting role in this movie is played by Michael Caine, born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, England, to Ellen Frances Marie (Burchell), a charlady, and Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, a fish-market porter. 
Now he's ""Sir"", but from what a very close friend of mine experienced about 30 years ago, Caine is far from a gentleman. 
My friend was waiting for a train on a station platform in Sussex, England, when he spotted Caine walking along by himself. He went up to Caine and addressed him politely simply to say hello. Caine INCORRECTLY assumed my friend was seeking an autograph and said sternly ""Ahm not signin' any or..."". 
My friend quickly assured him he was NOT looking for a signature, Caine replied ""Ah, good"". A few moments later a young boy approached Caine and DID ask for his autograph; Caine rudely refused, very visibly upsetting the lad who went back to his parents, clearly distressed. 
It was, therefore, with some astonishment that I saw this unusual movie ""Children of Men"" begin with a person of world-wide fame being KILLED because he refused a request for an autograph! 
The movie is a one-off, very intense, disturbing, creative, but doesn't quite come off. The storyline premise is fascinating, there are many compelling scenes, but the violence is over-the-top (unrealistic gun battles), and some scenes are too drawn-out. The film cannot be termed ""entertainment"" in my view; it's not a documentary; perhaps it's just what it seems ~ a harsh concept of a potential future world in which women can no longer become pregnant, for your intellectual pondering. 5/10."

Although now (2018) I fear some aspects seem pretty much so, currently the problems are generally caused by over population, in an exploding way, not under population. If the scenery would be reality that a problem of massive infertility would occurs (sad sad sad the faith of newborn Dylan at the end, who will statistically have to survive 18 years lonely, at the end of her life,although I cannot imagine she is really the only one; if she is born, others must have been born, maybe rarely depending on the unknown cause of infertility, but still), I would guess European governments would enthusiastically welcome immigrants, to deal with their old grey people worries, not lock up immigrants."

"hellahuyen","10","0","2","25 July 2016"," More relevant than ever
","Although released in 2006, Children of Men is more relevant today (2016) than ever. The film explores the crisis of an end of the world scenario where fertility had all together become nonexistent. The feeling of depression, terror, and down right chaos prevail all over the fictional world. Fictional as it may be, the world of Children of Men explores the same fear and terror plastered on the news we see today. Dir. Cuaron and his team, most notably cinematographer Lubezki, amazingly depict a future that is no far from ours today. Pictures of caged immigrants; the dismantle of strong and sane leadership; riot police and garbage plaguing the deteriorating world all reflect what may occur in our future. Today, anti-immigration aggression; riots against authority (namely against police brutality); and a dictatorial, racist presidential candidate evoke the same omnipresent fear felt in the world of Children of Men.<br/><br/>In an addition to the gut-reaching pictures of chaos, the film has been stylized in a way that could only be due to the genius minds of, long time collaborators, Cuaron and Lubezki. Filled with loads of cultural references and incredible use of the camera to submerge the audience even further, surpass the vision of the main character but to make the audience its own subject, this film is just a beautiful, chaotic piece of art that deserves to be dissected and analyzed. It's a glimpse of the past, present and future. Maaaan, I sure wish I had a crystal ball... and know how to use it."

","The future: it is vital to the spirit of mankind. We live for the future. Without it, we can't hope or dream or believe. Without it, our lives are bleak and meaningless. Children of Men takes place in a world with no future. Women have become infertile. Not a single child has been born for eighteen years. It is the darkest kind of dystopia. Most dystopias are caused by war or famine or disease or an oppressive regime. All of those things are loud and tangible. This is different. It's slow, gradual, and complete. Once the current generation dies out, human life on earth is finished. Time is eating the human race alive.<br/><br/>There is only one thing more depressing than living in a world that has ended, and that is living in a world that is ending and knowing there is nothing you can do. That is the situation everyone has to live with in Children of Men, and it has caused the world to erupt into chaos. All the major world powers have collapsed into anarchy. Only Britain is left, and it has become a totalitarian police state determined to keep out foreigners at all costs.<br/><br/>No one in this world looks happy. They want to get as much power for themselves as possible, of course, but they know it doesn't really matter, not in the end. They are all going to die, and no one is going to replace them.<br/><br/>There is but one light, one ray of hope: a pregnant woman- a living miracle- has been discovered. The majority of the film is our main protagonist, Theo, trying to escort this woman through the dystopia to safety. He was only caught up with her because of his wife, who is the leader of a revolutionary wing trying to get immigrants the rights they deserve. The pregnant woman was in the revolutionary camp, but after the camp is taken over by radicals who want to kill Theo and use the baby for their own purposes, the two of them leave, meeting many interesting figures on their difficult path way to freedom.<br/><br/>This is arguably one of the greatest pieces of postapocalyptic fiction ever created. The storyline is good, the writing is great, and the characters have a sense of desperate humanity to them that's missing from too many postapocalyptic tales. But it is Cuaron's talent as a director that makes this film extraordinary. This is one of the best directed films I have ever seen. While much credit should go to the cinematography, which is astounding, Cuaron seamlessly weaves these excellent pieces into an evocative tale that is equal parts elegant, gritty, and haunting. No other filmmaker can match his love of- or talent with- moving camera shots. The full scope of the dystopia is on full display. He indulges in the entire world, not just the main character, making everything feel darker yet more alive and certainly more focused on the emotions this film is generously putting on display.<br/><br/>A glorious, grim spectacle, this is a triumph of modern filmmaking from one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Every second, every shot, every sequence breathes with energy, with power, with unequaled decisiveness, showing perfectly a story of desperation and despair, of misery and desire, of oppression and resilience, of hope lost and hope found."
"gimlet_eye","7","0","1","1 June 2016"," The movie is one thing; P.D. James's book another
","""Children of Men"" is a very well done movie based on the essential premise of P.D. James's book of the same name, and I have nothing to add to its many glowing reviews here, though there is perhaps a bit to subtract. Although the author is said to have thought well of the movie, the only thing it has in common with the book is its premise: a world some 20 years in the future in which no children have been born for some 18 years since - which changes everything, in ways that provoke the speculative imagination.<br/><br/>However, the director and chief writer of this film, Alfonso Cuarón, has reduced James's character-driven exploration of civilization's slipping hold on humanity to a conventional English dystopian action adventure story, punctuated with a few touching human dramatic moments, but hardly differentiated from the similarly denatured film version of Orwell's political philosophical book, ""1984"". James was one of our best (and maybe last) novelists of moral sensibility, whose great strength was her ability to create full-fledged modern characters with all their complexities and contradictions, yet not one of her characters is to be found in the film: only their names have (rather inexplicably) survived the transition.<br/><br/>Missing also is James's trenchant and balanced dramatization of the moral dilemmas of governing a degenerating society, or simply of surviving morally intact in such a society. And there is nothing dystopian, because nothing imaginary, about the social decadence that James was writing about. The soon to occur infertility pandemic that forms the premise of both book and movie, but which is exploited in the movie merely to create poignant human mini-dramas, is in the book essentially a metaphor for the state of modern civilization. Consequently, the book, which I think is one of James's best, owes as much to Swift as to Orwell.<br/><br/>The movie is exciting in places, and moving in others. The book, however, may have much to teach you about human character, and I guarantee that it will make you think."

Plagued by a difficult past, it's easy to see how he has arrived at his present self.<br/><br/>Julian (Julianne Moore) leads a rebel group fighting for equal rights for foreigners within Britain. We're gradually introduced to her complicated past with Theo and shown why he's the sole person she trusts.

Despite a lack of critical acclaim during its initial release, Children of Men will undoubtedly go down as one of the great movies of the early twenty-first century, and will certainly be studied for decades to come. We notice an abundance of long tracking shots that allow us to explore the world Cuarón has created. This includes a six- minute, eighteen-second epic (!) as we're led through a wasteland in the heat of battle. The shot concludes with one of the most humanizing experiences in recent cinematic memory. We're often pulled away from the protagonist and introduced to a world of pain and suffering. The attention to detail within this world is unmatched. Overall, Cuarón and his supporting team have created a modern masterpiece."
"Style_is_Substance","7","0","1","24 May 2016"," Spirituality Analysis (abridged class paper)
","Alfonso Cuarón's 2006 science-fiction drama film, Children of Men, depicts a not-so distant future in which there are no recorded births across the world. This tragedy results in a chaotic dystopia atmosphere filled with people lacking faith and hope. The film both implicitly and explicitly features various references to Christian themes, imagery, and stories. If a viewer analyzes and compares the film's subtext, the person may find that the film's use of spiritual symbolism may enrich the person's appreciation for the film through its messages on hope and redemption. <br/><br/>The central story of Children of Men is set in 2027 United Kingdom, around eighteen years after the last recorded child birth. The film follows the character Theo as he is pulled into a mission to quietly escort a miraculously pregnant refugee woman named Kee through a dangerous region controlled by the corrupt government to a safe haven in order to assure safety of the mother and child as well as hope for the future. Throughout the film, Theo subtly undergoes a change of character as he starts off hopeless and dies with hope for mankind. A particular sequence of dialogue within the film serves as exposition that gives insight to Theo and Julian's past as well as referencing an ongoing continuous existential crisis many Christians have after facing a tragedy involving chance and faith. The conversation features the character Jasper telling Merriam and Kee his take on Theo's past by applying faith versus chance philosophy; thissequence of dialogue happens as Theo listens in nearby agreeing. Essentially, Theo represents a character that has lost or struggles with his faith, something that can be compared with many devout Christian's recurring existential crises when in doubt of their God's love. Theo is mentioned to have once been a part of protests exercising his beliefs. The death of his child led to him and his wife seeing less of each other and likely the cause of his alcoholism and separation from his wife. The film begins with him nearly hopeless for the future due to the mass infertility of women across the world. He later has a glimpse of hope when he discovers the character Kee is pregnant. This hope continues to grow and change him throughout the rest of the film as it serves as a driving force of his motivation. <br/><br/>The film's story may draw various allegories and references to Christian theology, such as the resistance group within the film being called ""fishes,"" (a common Christian icon), but seems to be able to be compared more to the nativity story within the gospel of the Christian Holy Bible. The birth of Jesus, according to Christianity, is a miracle in itself as Mary, his mother was a virgin at the time of his conception and birth. ""Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us"" (Matthew 1:23). While in a different nature, Kee's pregnancy was a miracle as well, and like Jesus' birth set in motion hope for the future. Theo's words when discovering she was pregnant was also ""Jesus Christ."" Kee even further references this story by jokingly telling Theo that she is a virgin. The Gospel states Mary and Joseph fled from their home and gave birth to Jesus in a manger, while King Herod sent his men to kill newborn children in search of the Messiah. This can be compared to various scenes in Children of Men, as Theo guides the refugee Kee through danger to birth her child in what appeared to be a barn or shed, which is followed by someone discovering the child and inflicting potential danger on the family. Towards the climax of the film, various soldiers see Kee holding her child and are in awe, some even bowing, and performing the Catholic tradition of crossing themselves representing trinity. While this does not mean that Kee's child necessarily represents God, but does represent faith, hope for the future, and a miracle to behold. Theo can also be compared to Jesus in some ways, or rather a Christ like figure. This can be further expressed in the ending scene in which Theo essentially dies for the child's safety, sacrificing his life for the safety of the world. Further symbolism is seen through Kee at the ending as she is rescued by the ship ""Tomorrow"" which will take her to a safe haven for her child. This scene can be interrupted as the ""key to tomorrow"" as the child may be hope for the future. While not all of the Christian allegories may be necessary to the film's central plot, some definitely add to the film's subtext. <br/><br/>Drawing from the Bible and other familiar icons of Christianity aids in giving the character's depth and fulfill traditional moralistic behavior. Throughout the Bible, there is a consistent message about redemption; trusting in and living for God, repenting from one's sins, and asking for forgiveness can allow the person to become redeemed. Theo's character is redeemed in a way, from turning from alcoholism and a lack of hope to a selfless person, caring less for himself, and more for others and the state of mankind. In addition to selflessness, this film seems to promote the concept of having hope, which can also be seen not only the character of Theo but within the film's overall environment. It seems that while one known remaining child may not be sufficient enough to repopulate the Earth, it still gives people hope. With these Christian symbols, allusions, and themes, viewers can draw meaning from the subtext of Children of Men to enrich their experience and appreciation in watching the film. The film on the surface is a violent science-fiction survival thriller, but upon analysis, one can find more meaning through its optimistic Christian themes of hope, redemption, and selflessness as seen through the character Theo and Kee and her child."

Although there is a Glimmer of Hope it is Mainly just a Glimmer.<br/><br/>The Remarkable Detail of the Production makes it Look Very Real and that Adds to the Unsettling Feel of the Film and it can be a Hard Watch at times.<br/><br/>Of Course the Theme of a World in Total Madness, Chaos, Decline, and Decay is NOT going to be a Pretty Picture and there is no attempt made here to be anything of the sort.<br/><br/>The Film is an Artistic Accomplishment of the First Order. It is Emblazoned with Layers and Layers of a Crumbling ""Reality"". It is so Rich in its Plight of the Poor and Disenfranchised that it becomes Hypnotic. It makes You want to reach for the ""Quietus"".<br/><br/>Clive Owen with the Help of a Willing Cast of Good Actors make this a Believably Unbelievable Gut-Wrenching Warning about Something, it could be Anything, that in Real-Life is bringing the World to its knees. This is what Might Come and it Pulls Few Punches while throwing it in Our Face to make Us Face the Fear, and perhaps Deal with it before it's Too Late.<br/><br/>It's the Kind of Film that may not Invite Multiple Viewings, Once might be Enough. It is so Well-Done it should be Seen and Appreciated as a Work of Art with a Simplistic Story that is about a Complex Situation that could Result from.........Fill in the Blank."

","When I first saw Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men 10 years ago, I loved it for its kinetic action and terrifying vision of a world devoid of newborns, made to feel closer to home by the fact that it was set in England. The grim near-future it depicted (set in 2027) felt authentic, with the lack of flying cars, fancy gadgets and futuristic fashion sense making for a more grounded experience. But it felt a world away. Ten years on, the film's unglamorous and sobering scenes of terrorism and refugee overcrowding takes on a whole new level of prescience. Switch on the news now and chances are you'll see footage similar to the grey landscape of Children of Men.<br/><br/>Activist turned paper-pusher Theo (Clive Owen) cynically drinks away his days, with the United Kingdom now one of the few safe havens left in the world, albeit a police state struggling to cope with the influx of migrants. He is kidnapped by militant group the Fishes, led by Theo's former lover Julian (Julianne Moore), and is forced to use his influence within the government to acquire transit papers for a young immigrant named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey). With the Fishes' motivations somewhat unclear and divided, Theo flees with Kee and nurse Miriam (Pam Ferris) through hostile terrain in the hope of delivering her to a group dedicated to curing infertility.<br/><br/>Politics and social awareness aside, the action more than holds up to today's standards, with three-Oscars-in-a-row cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's long takes and swirling camera still managing to take the breath away. In the films best sequence, Theo, Julian, Kee and Fishes muscle Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are subject to a surprise attack by an armed gang. Action nowadays tends to be edit-heavy with a hand-held camera blurring the proceedings, but Lubezki's fluid camera-work captures the immediacy of the situation while maintaining clarity. Mixing special effects and breathtaking choreography, it's a moment that terrifies, excites and shocks all at once. It is a technique that innovates without feeling gimmicky.<br/><br/>On a deeper note, Children of Men is not just a tale of caution, but also a study of what humanity desires of their children. Here, without children there is no hope. The youngest boy in the world has been stabbed to death, and the world has fallen into complete chaos with the sudden emergence of infertility. While some parents may view their children as an extension of their bloodline and a way to live on after death, some see them as the next generation with an opportunity to affect the world they will inherit. This sentiment is etched on Theo's face when Kee reveals her secret and his task becomes clear. As Theo, Owen proves why he was such a solid leading man for a brief time before retreating from the spotlight, and is backed by an subtly intimidating Ejiofor and a comic-relief Michael Caine as political cartoonist turned pot-grower Jasper. The real stars, however, are Cuaron and Lubezki, who have crafted a nightmarish vision that is both terrifyingly plausible and uncomfortably gripping."
"arthurcalibreapps","10","0","2","19 April 2016"," Honestly confused to how anyone can give this film a bad review?
","I found this film after looking up best recent British films, maybe that's the issue, maybe there wasn't enough nudity and aliens for Hollywood ""big screen"" fans. Maybe I'm bias but the film I just watched had me far more gripped than any big Hollywood film of recent.<br/><br/>Felt tense and thrown in to the suspense, as well as being touched by the plot line and trying to imagine how horrific the events in the film would be if they were to happen. There were parts in which this was very potent, especially near the end, no spoilers intended.<br/><br/>Michael Caine played a role I could never see him suiting and he played it well. The two lead roles also pulled me further into the suspense, especially like how, again, Hollywood poison seemed so distant from this film in the respect that the lead role didn't even need to fire a single shot in this quite action packed film.<br/><br/>I read a review on here before watching that claimed that this film left things unexplained, and having just seen another current film in the cinema recently, I salute the makers of this film. It's like people have lost the use of their imagination and need to be spoon fed what to think, also don't take that as in this film leaves stones unturned, they are silly little things that lazy people can't be bothered to think about.<br/><br/>Great film<br/><br/>Worth watching."
"talisencrw","10","0","1","8 April 2016"," Cuaron's masterpiece so far, and the greatest film so far this century!
","Cuaron's masterpiece so far (including Gravity, which was gravely miscast). This film is: a) easily the best film of the decade of the 2000's; b) the finest dystopia film since 'A Clockwork Orange' and probably the best sci-fi since '2001: A Space Odyssey'; and c) all the evidence you need that Clive Owen should have been selected as James Bond in place of Daniel Craig. Heartily recommended to anyone interested in how great both science fiction and cinema can possibly be. You may be depressed with the state of both the world and mankind, after watching it, but you won't be disappointed in the possibilities of cinema."
"Dan_Santana_Silva","10","0","1","28 March 2016"," Ten Years Later, This Movie Makes Much More Sense
","When you realize that Children of Men is not actually a obscure sci-fi movie, but a war thriller it is too late to not get involved. Cuaron has a perfect hand to conduct this 2 hour movie that never gets less exciting. We follow the journey of Theo Faron through the decadent England, but from time to time, Cuaron focus on random people suffer. It's this technique that feeds the environment around Theo and makes us notice that we're just seeing a tiny pixel of a huge picture. Today, Children of Men could be compared to the real life situation on Europe immigration rate.<br/><br/>Great movie. You should definitely check it out."
"greatdeceivah","Null","0","1","17 February 2016"," A visionary masterpiece!
","Watching this movie ten years after it was released, i got the feeling of watching a current documentary of what is now going on right in Europe: Third world immigrants invading the biggest cities in Europe by the thousands? check. Countries around the world with failing governments being ruled by militias and chaos? Check. UK being controlled by a militarized police state? check. European cities suffering never-ending random terrorist attacks? Check. <br/><br/>Very few other movies have managed to predict the present of our troubled world with such accuracy .<br/><br/>One of the few things this movie purposely or accidentally failed to predict is the real reason why world is in such a state of chaos, namely the war that the American neocons and the NATO puppets are currently waging against Russia, Syria, Iran, etc. No fertility crisis was needed to create such a dystopia around the world. Another thing that this movie got wrong is that in the real world most Europeans are against (and protesting) the invasion of their countries by ""refugees"" or ""fugees"" are they are called in the movie, As as consequence of this, protesting European citizens are now being arrested by the militarized police state for opposing the European banker's""multicultural"" agenda.<br/><br/>The aesthetic decision to create a sci-fi movie with documentary-style production was brilliant. Couple this with top-notch acting, great direction and story telling and you have a brilliant piece of visionary film-making. The movie's now famous car scene has already entered the canon of cinema's great long one-take wonder sequences. <br/><br/>I have to laugh at all the geniuses that 10 years ago gave this movie one-star ratings, mocking the plot and premise of this movie as ""implausible"" and nonsensical. Unfortunately, reality has proved all those who (for whatever reason) didn't understand this movie, wrong.<br/><br/>Children of men was way ahead of its time, and clear proof of this, is that today, ten years later, even network TV and game companies have jumped in the ""conspiracy theory"" and dystopia bandwagon with countless TV series and games about citizens resisting the police state, etc. <br/><br/>Children of men is easily the best science fiction movie of the 21st century, pushing the technical boundaries of science fiction film making; standing way above the current wave of Hollywood tired and brainless superhero and never-ending sequel crap movies."
"dvspindl","10","0","1","17 January 2016"," Timely story
","Not only is this movie a superb piece of work--superior acting, writing, directing--but its message is timeless. Everyone should see it, particularly at this dubious moment in history. I'm ashamed to say that I haven't read the book, and I have avoided it because I love the movie so much, and the book versions, the original articles, are *always* better, I find. <br/><br/>Though the movie has a political hue, above all else, it's about humanity, individual acts of kindness and sacrifice for something greater than oneself and for that which cannot be seen in the present moment. Hope, faith in others, and faith in oneself that what seem like the smallest contributions can have a huge impact down the road."
"Leofwine_draca","8","0","1","29 December 2015"," Exemplary direction lifts an offbeat futuristic thriller
","This futuristic thriller disposes of much of the sci-fi jargon we've come to expect from Hollywood films. There are no outlandish gadgets or chases through CGI-created landscapes; CHILDREN OF MEN, based on a novel by P. D. James, is a realistic thriller through and through. It's set in a recognisable dystopia (full of violence, poverty, disease, segregation and warfare) and the story follows a strict 'journey' template, following a group of characters as they travel through myriad locales, suffering death, defeat and adventure along the way. So far, so predictable. However, this film works because it's literate, it's intelligent and the focus is on storytelling over flashy special effects or action nonsense.<br/><br/>Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN) is a force to watch out for on the strength of his work here: this is the best direction I've seen in a long while and the film is chock-full of great tracking shots which really emphasise the excitement and danger around every corner. The view of a future UK is nightmarish and believable and the backgrounds and locations are as much a character as the protagonists themselves.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the fact that the film remains as unconventional as possible as it moves along. Clive Owen, the heroic protagonist, never fires a gun and is definitely an everyman character rather than a hero: he's utterly believable and this is the best role I've seen the actor in yet. Supporting actors are good, but it's the older heavyweights who give the best turns: Julianne Moore, as likable as she's ever been, as a terrorist leader; Pam Ferris as an ally; Michael Caine as an aged John Lennon-type. Chiwetel Ejiofor is also very strong in a minor role. The film does have action, including a ferocious fire fight at the climax, but it's never an action film per se. It's just a great movie that avoids pigeon-holing and never left me bored or underwhelmed once."
"amitkgupta28","10","0","1","24 December 2015"," One of the most captivating movie of 2006
","If you are a fan of uprising allegories like ""Animal Farm"" or political revolution movies like ""Snowpiercer"", this could be another thought provoking peace of art for you. This movies touches you at multiple levels. <br/><br/>At one level, the movie depicts politics centered around hope where few people in the interest of their petty self sacrifice the larger good. On the other end, how a revolution is a result of the sacrifices of many hidden characters which could believe in something larger than themselves. Also, it's a wonderful portrayal of refugee situation which can be related to various real world events in the history and even in today's era. It's a superb mix of thrill, story and strong characters. <br/><br/>Overall, wonderful movie."
"droman-54215","9","0","1","12 November 2015"," Great movie
","Children of Men creates a chaotic world uncomfortably similar to the one we live in right now. It gives a palpable story of a society who has experienced no births in eighteen years. However, a new baby is born and Theo has to face a lot of trouble just to keep him safe. The story is interesting from beginning to end. The way it emotionally connects you with Theo throughout all his struggles to save Kee and her baby is amazing. You get to really feel what these characters are experiencing, you get to cry with them, feel frustrated with them, have moments of happiness like they did Through this, the message that the director wants to transmit is successfully delivered. It gives a powerful social and political message. It opens our eyes to show us that we are not very far from a dystopia like that one. With unexpected plot twists and deep messages, this movie is not only a fun movie to watch, but one that everyone should watch to understand more about modern society."
