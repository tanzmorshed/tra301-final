"MR_Heraclius","10","52","61","23 February 2020"," Awesome movie, watched it multiple times
","This film is every definition of the word ""impeccable."" Scorcese's fantastic storytelling ability mixed with phenomenal acting from DiCaprio, Hill and the rest of the cast makes for an awesome combination. The film is never boring and gives you a glimpse into the life of a man who had everything in the world only to have it taken away."
"BrentHankins","9","501","715","24 December 2013"," DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career.
","In the mid-1990s, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the rest of his associates from brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont became the very definition of excess and debauchery, their offices a boiler room fueled by cocaine and greed. High pressure sales tactic and less-than-legal behind-the-scenes manipulation bred plenty of twenty-something millionaires, and Belfort built himself an empire at the top of the heap. His rise and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street, based on the memoir of the same name.<br/><br/>Under most circumstances, the actions of Belfort and his cronies (including Jonah Hill in a howlingly funny turn as Belfort's business partner) would be viewed as disgustingly abhorrent, but Martin Scorsese frames this tale of greed with a comedic lens that allows us to laugh at things we probably shouldn't find humorous. Whether it's a clumsy attempt at fisticuffs between two characters overdosing on Quaaludes, or the categorization of prostitutes using stock market terminology (""blue chip"" hookers make you wear a condom and typically accept credit cards), the film is outrageous from start to finish, and rarely falters in its quest to entertain the audience for three hours.<br/><br/>Belfort manages to delude himself and his pals into thinking they can live like this forever, but the audience knows better, and Belfort's eventual comeuppance is hardly surprising. But the path is paved with hilarity, especially in a scene aboard the mogul's luxury yacht, where he surreptitiously offers a pair of FBI agents everything from booze to girls to cold hard cash in exchange for their silence. And let's not forget his punishment for drunkenly piloting a helicopter into the backyard of his estate at 3am, raising the ire of his trophy wife (Margot Robbie).<br/><br/>Scorsese has always managed to elicit astounding performances from his actors, and his fifth collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio results in one of the most charismatic, despicable, offensive and captivating characters to ever appear on screen. As financial bad boy Belfort, DiCaprio swaggers from scene to scene ingesting eye-popping amounts of narcotics, groping and fondling nearly every female within reach, and spouting more profanity in three hours than an entire season of The Sopranos. Belfort is the kind of person that any sane person would detest in real life, but thanks to Scorses and DiCaprio, we can't take our eyes off him.<br/><br/>-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com"

","It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed, Goodfellas and Casino, of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That's the way it works, and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.<br/><br/>There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.<br/><br/>The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.<br/><br/>The script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort's second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort's mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that ""most-addictive drug"" Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one's lifestyle but the effects it has on one's morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.<br/><br/>With a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese's best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it's one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made."
"bob the moo","Null","181","263","17 January 2014"," High energy and wonderfully excessive as it delivers an engaging true story, but the lack of morality anywhere was a limiting factor
","This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it, adding an expectation which it really didn't need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill-gotten funds and, to be honest, it is an impression that isn't helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical/Comedy section. Now I am sure that was a political move by the studio, but it does say something about the film because indeed for most of it we have stuff so unbelievable and so excessive that it is hard not to laugh at it. It is hard not to enjoy it.<br/><br/>And this is a problem, because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you, how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself; I don't think the film goes out of its way to glamorize this excess and this life, but for sure it doesn't do much to balance it – and this really is my problem with the film.<br/><br/>The structure, subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to Goodfellas that it is hard not to mention it. If you remember the opening of Goodfellas you'll remember that it opens with a memorably violent scene where an near-dead man in the back of a car is stabbed by Hill and his colleagues in a scene that is oppressive and violent but yet ends with the narration telling us ""as far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster"" and snaps to credits under a big track from Tony Bennett. This scene is important because it works as a microcosm of the whole film – the appeal but also the cost, all in one place. Wolf of Wall Street never has any of that and it hurts it. I suspect the message of the film is that our financial systems are screwed and that ultimately the rich will never be in the same world as the average person, because this is what I took from the rather sobering final scenes. However if this is the point it is trying to make then it really hurts itself with the rest of the film seeming to say ""so why not get on board"". I know this is not the case but the lack of a ""point"" or an agenda it the film means that it naturally fills it with its own, which is a weird feeling.<br/><br/>But then again – I guess it is a comedy. So the infamous Quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious, the scenes of excess and of criminality are not equally appealing and repulsive – they are almost totally appealing, we hardly get the other side or get to see a victim here, and a few seconds on the subway with the FBI agent really does nothing but yet again make the suggestion that ""it's all broken so why not at least get rich yourself"". Getting away from this, it is a well made film. Scorsese makes this award season's second film to owe a massive debt to Goodfellas (American Hustle being the other) and he directs the film with energy; music is used well as one would expect and the editing makes the film pop. DiCaprio is great in the lead – OK he doesn't find the heart of the character, but the film doesn't ask him to. Instead he is charismatic and energetic, drawing the viewer in and giving the film its energy. The supporting cast is deep with names and familiar faces and it is a statement about how well the film holds the viewer, because it isn't distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character from TV appear (although I did notice that this and American Hustle had lots of faces from HBO's Boardwalk Empire). Jonah Hill is over the top in a way that works, although I am surprised to see him getting an Oscar nomination for it in such a crowded year.<br/><br/>Wolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy and excess but in many ways it is not Goodfellas and the most important of these is that the film lacks a moral core to itself, to its characters and to its message. I don't mind the ""it's all screwed so who cares"" message that it ultimately seems to give, but I didn't feel comfortable with how wide a smile it had on its face while it was delivering it."
"Serge_Zehnder","Null","190","301","17 December 2013"," Where Human Flaws Make a Rotten Core
","Brilliantly acted, superbly written and as one would expect from a picture by Martin Scorsese, it is a masterclass of directorial craft.<br/><br/>Showy when it needs to be, but also quiet and contemplative. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the equivalent of something like ""Good Fellas"" or even more so ""Casino"" but set in the world of finance. The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"".<br/><br/>Where Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.<br/><br/>Leonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.<br/><br/>It's a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.<br/><br/>One could almost hear Scorsese's clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.<br/><br/>It is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference. For every individual but also society as a whole."
"ClaytonDavis","9","504","845","17 December 2013"," The Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprio's Crowning Work
","Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian's insight that felt like I was watching ""Intervention"" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.<br/><br/>A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I've never seen him truly ""go for it"" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it's the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90's in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he'd been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It's a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement.<br/><br/>As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He's allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he's not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.<br/><br/>Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan's outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she'll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she'll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be. She's the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson's character in Don Jon.<br/><br/>I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won't find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?"
"Al_The_Strange","9","204","337","29 December 2013"," Wolf of Wall Street review
","If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino, then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, out-of-control substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business; funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.<br/><br/>Based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort - the real-life stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks to average joes - the film showcases one seriously messed-up slimeball of a man. If his scheme sounds familiar, it's because it's been the inspiration behind the 2000 film Boiler Room, and this film covers much of the same concepts, albeit with better structure. The film maintains a close and intimate focus on the man as he rises to power, suckers thousands into his schemes, and then lives a life of extreme excess. And it is extreme: the whole film becomes laden with drugs, sex, superficial luxuries, material things, and characters who want nothing more than to take and consume everything. The sheer corruption becomes palpable on-screen, and I couldn't help but to shake my head at numerous scenes when I saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone in their unrestrained partying and debauchery. I have no clue as to how closely this film adapts the real-life events, but at times it's almost hard to believe that things could have gone this far. And yet, the excesses serve to underscore key themes and criticisms on the American dream; the pursuit of money and success, through any means, remains the main drive of the characters and the movie, and it leads to a fairly hard-hitting downfall.<br/><br/>This film features good-looking photography and editing. Acting is great: Leonardo DiCaprio is practically perfect as the titular character, and the rest of the cast pulls their weight really well (including Jonah Hill, who seems to fit into his character's archetype very comfortably). Writing is really sharp and good; the film is full of great lines and great speeches. There are some great-looking sets, props, and costumes on display in this film. Music has a varied mix of songs, and they're all used really well for their intended effect.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is every bit as good as Martin Scorsese's previous work with The Goodfellas and Casino. All these films work with similar plots and themes, but TWOWS is like a gangster film masked by the thin veil of upper-class corporate swindling. It is a film that candidly shows the crimes and excesses in full, before proving that, even for the super-rich, crime still doesn't pay.<br/><br/>Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)"

","The last few Scorsese pics left me a little disappointed. I had begun to think Marty had become a 'gun for hire' and that his brilliance may have been spent (his earlier works were some of the best movies ever made). I attended a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street this evening, and was expecting to be unimpressed. I am happy to say I was completely blown away. This pic is Marty at his best. I laughed, I cringed, I related (with fond memories as well as a bit of guilt) and I TOTALLY believed every unbelievable moment. A good book, a great screenplay and a delightful cast were formed and molded into what I believe should get Scorsese a best director Oscar, and likely a Best Picture Award for the movie. Leo DiCaprio has grown into a versatile actor and his creation of this super hero dirtbag's roller coaster ride in this crazy (true) story is really honest and delightfully entertaining. Jonah Hill pulled out all the stops too and this is definitely his best work. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for delivering the goods so brilliantly!"

(7/10) The acting, mainly Leonardo, was fantastic! (9.5/10) The story is a bit shallow. Basically a bunch of people lying, cheating, stealing, and running/escaping on Wall Street and making a lot of ""dirty"" illegal money. Then talking talk and talking bad about other people who are honest but make less. The movie portrays a picture that money is the most important thing and it is what brings you happiness very well. (2/10) Near the end it shows that being controlled by money is very bad, but it wasn't portrayed as well as it did trying to argue for money bringing happiness. It shows a bunch of ""rich"" folks who have nothing but money thinking they're above everyone else. No health, no relationships, no integrity, no manners, no respect, no honesty, no time, nothing but money and the animalistic drive to get more and destroy everything in the way.<br/><br/>As a movie it makes the world a depressing place. Overall the main thing I like about the movie is Leonardo Dicaprio. Props to him for continuing to be an awesome actor. The movie content itself was subpar."

","Even though Jordan Belfort is a convicted con man, Scorsese & DiCaprio were apparently too dense to realize that his book was yet another of his scams. They leapt on Belfort's book like pigs on a pile of slop and thought everyone would be just as enamored as they were with the alleged life story of a sociopathic, sleazeball swindler. One example of how they got conned: In real life, Belfort never warned his cohorts that he was wearing a wire! In reality, he was a cry-baby snitch who immediately agreed to testify against his co-conspirators, never giving any of them a word of warning. <br/><br/>It's rather amusing to watch Scorsese & DiCaprio as they try to explain that this movie isn't a glorification of Belfort's swindling & debauchery. C'mom, guys, 'fess up, all three hours of the movie is a celebration of it! You wasted $100 million to make an homage to a drug- addicted, misogynistic low-life who swindled people out of their hard- earned money!

We see the sales effort but not the people they're selling to. How can you do a movie about people perpetrating a fraud without showing the fraud & its effects??? <br/><br/>2) There's no character development: They all start out as disgusting creeps and they all end up being disgusting creeps. <br/><br/>3) There's not much of a plot: It's 2 and 1/2 hours of debauchery and then 1/2 hour of getting caught.

","I've always thought that there must be a very good reason for a movie to last 3 hours. Wolf of wall street does last 3 hours but there no shadow of a good reason for it. It could have lasted 1 hour and it would have been already too long.<br/><br/>It is difficult to summarize all the things I didn't like but let's try:<br/><br/>1- Characters development is simply not existent. There is no depth, just one-dimension flat characters that only do drugs, sex, and money. I am not against showing drugs or sex or money in a movie, if it helps the plot. But in this case, it didn't. It was 2 hours of absolute useless display of all the possible debaucheries on earth, without them helping in building up the characters. 2- If a guy manages to build up an empire based on a fraud, I'd like to see what happens to his victims too, and, sorry if I am not a master of Wall street, but I'd like to have 5 minutes of the movie spent in explaining what was this fraud about. 3- If the guy, once again, not only builds his own empire, but also drags other people in that, I suppose he must have some smartness, or intelligence, or be a master manipulator.. whatever it is, it cannot be just (once again) cocaine and prostitute. If they wanted to depict the guys as villains, they failed miserably. 4- the only relatively interesting part (the trial etc) is cut to 30-45 minutes max. Once again, I supposed it could have been a good chance to show some introspection of the characters, some development..something! But no, once again, nothing. We only notice that now the beer is not alcoholic. So sad. 5-Finally, DiCaprio performance: he did his job, probably, but he was alway over the top (and not in a good sense). Too much of everything, to the point that he fell into being ridiculous more than believable.<br/><br/>Ah, one last note. Wall Street? Where is it in all the story? I expected to see some connections to WS in fact, like what was going on in the meantime but there is - sorry to repeat myself- basically nothing about it."

That is sure to attract all kinds of law enforcement attention.<br/><br/>I have seen very few films that have depicted the alpha male world so well. Women just do not compete in DiCaprio's world. All they serve as are sex objects. Women work on Wall Street in the more traditional brokerage houses, but not with him where being one of the boys is the first requirement. The world consists of 50% orgies and 50% piling up paper profits and later on hiding them from authorities. True of DiCaprio and true to a lesser extent of all his associates.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese directed this film and handled the film like he did one of his gangster epics like Goodfellas. The narration of the film is by DiCaprio and it takes you from his rise to where law enforcement has him between a rock and a hard place. Like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas a combination of drugs and hubris makes him think he's invulnerable. But in Goodfellas would not have had a scene where the wise guys just out and out dared to challenge the FBI as DiCaprio does with agent Kyle Chandler. It so reminded me of that famous incident from 1984 where presidential candidate Gary Hart dares reporters to follow him around to catch him doing anything outside his marriage. And of course they did.<br/><br/>Five Oscar nominations went to The Wolf Of Wall Street, nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Hill was something of a revelation. The kind of nondescript character that you wouldn't look at twice, Hill gets taken to a world that he could only imagine in dreams wet or dry by DiCaprio. In his own Hill is almost as fascinating a story as DiCaprio.<br/><br/>The guy who beat Leo out for Best Actor has a brief but telling role as a mentor of sorts. Matthew McConaughey plays a stockbroker who takes him under his wing and they have a great scene at a club where he's getting his first three martini lunch. McConaughey only forgets to teach DiCaprio one thing, discretion.<br/><br/>I can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are nothing more than pawns in a male power game, but The Wolf Of Wall Street gives us a fascinating look at a man who tried to play with the big boys of the Stock Exchange and for a while, did."

","Martin Scorsese could have created a Real Movie about Real Characters who committed terrible acts on Wall Stree. Instead he chose to create a comedy farce for the sole purpose of a box office hit in order to generate tons of cash just like the character Belfort. There is no mention of the victims of Belfort's scams. I cannot believe he has been nominated for Best Director for this piece of Trash. I don't understand how this movie received 8.7 on IMDb.<br/><br/>The formula for the Box Office hit Pot Pourri is simple: Wild Parties, Fast Cars, Expensive Houses, Huge Yachts, Drunken Helicopter Pilots, Lots of drinking, drugs, Naked Women, Orgies, guns, Cheating husbands, Money laundering, Slimy Swiss bankers, seducing hot babes, seducing ex-babes (grandmas, And finally,Idiotic Extreme Behavior by brokers who act super smart in one scene And pathetically stupid in another scene. If Tarantino had been the director, I would have said, fine, that is his style, but Marty, I expected a bit more class from him. <br/><br/>This movie Glorifies Scumbags who manipulate people who entrust them with their hard earned dollars The scumbags have no moral or ethical dilemmas. The movie turns them into heroes to be emulated. Belfort's sentencing agreement mandates a total of $110 million in restitution yet the victims have received little of this. <br/><br/>The script at times makes you think it was written by a hyper-hormoned immature male high school dropout teenager. It tries extremely hard to be funny, yet it falls flat on its face in this arena. Reminded me of a 22 minute sit com on TV, yet no one in my row was laughing at the jokes. The story could have been summarized in 30 minutes, Get ready for 180 minutes We are forced to watch one unnecessary scene after another, the same topic is repeated over and over again, Same arguments, same sales pitches ""Sell me this Pen"", OK I got it, Belfort is a charismatic Speaker and a great Sales Person, I don't need to have it hammered in my brain. <br/><br/>The Range of behaviors of the characters go from one Serious Extreme to completely irresponsible infantile idiotic and unbelievably stupid levels. Watch Donnie (Jonah Hill) Play with himself in public when he first takes a look at Naomi Lapaglia ( Margot Robbie ). Remember that he is the Number 2 Lead at the Investment firm and Later in charge of running Stratton Oakmont. How can he be so stupid and so smart at the same time. The Characters are Caricatures of the real people they are supposed to depict. The tone was set after the first few minutes of Belfort's (DiCaprio) narrative while he is starring at the camera. It did not work for me. There are only two decent scenes in this movie that stand out for their realism. When DiCaprio first Seduces his future blonde wife at dinner in the restaurant When The two Fed agents board Belfort's Yacht Nadine and Belfort in a sly arrogant manner attempts to bribe the investigators. <br/><br/>Some movies are must see movies Because they change your view of the world and you never forget them. <br/><br/>This movie changes nothing."
"gavin6942","8","59","101","3 February 2014"," A Three-Hour Bacchanalia Caught on Film
","Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.<br/><br/>As of now (February 2014), this film sits at an impressive #57 on IMDb's list of greatest films of all time. Using that as a jumping off point for this review, we will have to scale it back a bit. Whether the film should be on the list is debatable, but certainly not within the top 100 -- it is neither that good nor among director Martin Scorsese's best work.<br/><br/>Along the same lines, the Oscar nomination for Best Picture is a bit much. While there is no denying it was probably among the ten best films of 2013, with some incredible acting and more than adequate cinematography and editing, the very fact it has no chance of winning makes one question why even nominate the film at all. (Of course, without nine nominees, we would be back to having the reasonable number of five...) <br/><br/>Scorsese received a best director nomination, and this strikes me as more understandable. He managed to assemble an impressive cast and tell a story that is both compelling and entertaining, without trying to put some moral tag on it. Whether or not the viewer thinks this is a glorification or denouncement of the acts depicted is up to them, as the film itself is blank (in the best way).<br/><br/>While on the subject, could the drug use and sexuality have been toned down? Absolutely. And there is a good argument that they should have been (especially the non-stop sex, which comes across as gratuitous and only adds more minutes to this lengthy financial epic). Another argument says the events are extremely unlikely and exaggerated at times. And this is probably also true; but the film is accurate to the memoir, not reality, and this is Belfort telling his story with all the embellishments that come with it. If you want just the facts, read the court transcripts.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor, and this is a choice that is understandable and yet hard to rally behind. He truly becomes Belfort, and probably makes the man out to be even more wild than he was. That deserves a nomination. But this is not DiCaprio's best role (he has also done a fine job portraying Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover) and not one he deserves the win for.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill, on the other hand, was amazing and deserves to win his supporting actor category. Being up again Jared Leto, he probably has no chance, but Hill has come a long way in a few short years from a lovable doofus in ""Superbad"" to a formidable actor in his own right. At first, ""Moneyball"" seemed to be an anomaly in Hil's career, but he showed the world he could do even better when he became Donny Azoff in this picture. Incredible.<br/><br/>Whether Terence Winter deserves Best Adapted Screenplay for this film is unclear without having read the book. Such a nomination seems fair, though the win is hard to say without more familiarity. I am surprised no nominations came for cinematography or editing, which are strong in their subtlety. But oh well.<br/><br/>Of the film's five nominations, it may walk away with one win (Winter) or two at most (DiCaprio). More likely it will walk away empty-handed. The film is not flawless (we could go on about how awkward the soundtrack was) and may or may not go on to be memorable for much more than its nudity and pervasive cursing."

","How can a film this bad costing $100M get past any adult review process. It seemed like Scorcese and DiCaprio made it for their own egos -- big budget/Gatsby-level theatrics and face-time respectively. DiCaprio does a good job in the role but we all (age range 25 to 65) kept waiting for the movie to come to the point. Hours of redundancy of plot and gratuitous over use of swearing and sex scenes the message and context could have been delivered with about sixty percent less: we kept waiting for a fatal drug overdose to change the direction of the plot and give it some purpose . . We almost walked out a couple of times but did not and waited for the plot to come to a point. We didn't and suffered the full three hours."
"bobbobwhite","Null","209","392","26 December 2013"," Entertainment, not reality
","Yes, Scorsese has always entertained us so well with abberant types, from mobsters to street criminals to boiler room stock brokers, all dealing death or financial destruction 24/7. But, do any of them bear even a faint resemblance to what really happened, and did those people actually behave that way? Regarding this film, I worked on Wall Street during that time, and even though we had heard of Jordan Belfort's firm, it was totally discounted as a boiler room and had no Street cred at all, just a terrible rep as sleazebag junk. It was no more than a side story to the real Wall Street, as those boiler room types were the lowest level of that era's greed-is-good WS slicksters.<br/><br/>But, the movie.....could any human superman take the amount of drugs and unprotected sex shown in this story and even function, let alone at a high continuous level and not have a fatal heart attack? None that I have known or seen, and I have seen a lot. But, Dicaprio as Belfort was a marvelous choice for this outsized role, and he played it to the hilt as never before, with Jonah Hill as his sidekick comic relief, and Matthew Macconaughey a great choice for Belfort's oddball, probably whacked out(off?)mentor, and Bob DeNiro in a short mobster spot.<br/><br/>It was such fast action that the 3 hours went by quickly, with not a dull moment in it. I enjoyed the fantasy ride that Disney could not have done better, but I could never get past the fact that it was 99% dramatized fiction, done to sell tickets(greed is good!) but not to enlighten us at all about the real Wall Street of that era."
"aharmas","1","292","556","25 December 2013"," Loud and Flat Failure
","De Caprio is the heart of the film, a daredevil whose motivation seems to be a misguided desire to acquire as much money as possible. He lives his life as a constant dare, using and abusing the investments of others, gambling with his personal relationships and his own health. He constantly endangers his life and those who are closest to him. It seems like he is capable of stopping this fall, but he keeps sinking and sinking. We could say he has a survivor's nature, but he carries with a very intense death wish, too.<br/><br/>Usually, it's easy to understand how people like him become so successful. There's gotta be a bit of charisma to their natures, so that we can see how they seduce the rest of the world into following them. Unfortunately, the main lead here lacks that quality, and in one of the worst casting choices in recent history, what we get is a man who is not full of life and youth. He himself become his own iceberg as he reveals his ""age"" early in the film, and De Caprio hasn't looked that youthful in decades. This is not to say that De Caprio doesn't try, but he's not a good fit for this role. About three years ago, in ""The Social Network"" we could see the recklessness and drive of man who could lure you into a trap. There's no way that seems believable here, especially when you see the people he surrounds himself with. His wolf can't cast a spell, and he can hardly bite.<br/><br/>Mercifully, we are not treated to the hyper kinetic editing and camera work we usually encounter in Scorcese's films, but he's found other ways to annoy us. He intermingles ""Infomercials"" throughout the movie, as if we need reinforcement about the seductive power of his character. They are sometimes ridiculous, and I doubt that is the intent. There are also liberties with the source, and it's a pity because the text is a delight to read, giving us the opportunity to wonder how something that is definitely based on reality can appear so unbelievable. The movie tries desperately to portray the excess and trappings of wealth, but there is nothing sexy about the constant parade of prostitutes and the overuse of obscenities, which occur at least every other minute. The books gives us time to breathe. Nothing like that is ever possible here, and that's why the film feels flat, not necessarily boring, but it fails to crackle because it's just too much of the same, never showing us where all the madness originates. There's little fire, just an endless portrayal of stupidity.<br/><br/>Not all is lost (like in that other film) because we have a rising star here. Margot Robbie makes quite an entrance and gives the best and most solid performance here, enhanced by the mess the rest of the cast comes up with. She's a formidable beauty, with lots of ambition, an overpowering stare that will let you see that she is not afraid to seek ambition, but she is still a full human being, capable of distinguishing between right and wrong. She reminds you of a more powerful Sharon Stone in her earlier films, and she is as talented as she is gorgeous. Here we see how one person can become obsessed with another, but it also makes you wonder why anyone would even stray from such a beauty. Oh, yes, I forgot it's perfectly obvious drugs can totally ruin your life and turn you into a monster.<br/><br/>The film is way too long, with more than a dozen scenes that could have been eliminated because they don't add anything to the story flow. We wish we could see more of the FBI agents, and it would be helpful to see why Wolf doesn't seem to find any way to listen to his father, a wonderful and underused Reiner.<br/><br/>We can guess the film's ending from its early frames. It seems as if all the energy goes into the presentation of the material, and little consideration is giving to the dialogue, other than peppering the conversations with redundant expletives. Parading naked people around, having snorting line after line of that white powder, or coming up with sound blasting songs to underscore a point is a brutal point to deliver a message. Just recently the Coens gives us a more dimensional creation with no more than a few ungrateful remarks here and there. All the time I could only wonder how it was that this film escaped the stamping of that NC 17 rating because its only success was the abuse of visual imagery and irritating language that loses its impact as it appears in an endless barrage of mind numbing utterances."

","The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)<br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Two word review: A Masterpice.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's latest film is yet another brilliant one with Leonard DiCaprio turning in the greatest performance of his career as stockbroker Jordan Belfort who takes some rather bland people and turn them into one of the biggest scams that the FBI ever saw. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is going to make many people unhappy and there are many more who are probably going to be offended by it but the perfection that is Scorsese was right when he decided to turn this into a comedy instead of a drama. Yeah, it's GOODFELLAS on speed and ramped up sex but it's just so brilliantly and wickedly funny that you can't help but laugh at all the craziness going on. Yes, there are some moral police out there who are going to object to a movie being made about a man who ripped off poor people but I'm sorry, I like the fact that this film doesn't really care about those people and instead just gives us an in-your-face look at these wild people, their wild drugs and their wild sex lives. This film is certainly over-the-top in regards to the excess but so were the characters so I thought they just went hand and hand with each other. Scorsese was the perfect person for this project because of his ramped up speed but here is goes all out and really delivers an incredibly wicked little ride that will have you smiling and laughing at some very questionable things.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of DiCaprio long before he became famous and this here is without question the greatest performance he's given so far. I was curious to see how he would do playing someone crazy and wild like this but he does so perfectly and I'd say it was a flawless performance. No matter what was going on in this crazy life you believe that you're watching a real character and as his character says throughout the film, sell him something. Well, DiCaprio sells this performance and role like no one else could. The supporting players are just as wonderful with Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Matthew McConaughey and Jean Dujardin all delivering terrific performances. The cinematography, the music selections and everything else are just flawless here. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET could have been a complete disaster in so many ways but the strong screenplay and Scorsese's wicked direction makes it an incredibly entertaining film that works so well. It's hard to fully put into words what Scorsese and DiCaprio have pulled off but it's certainly one of the best and most memorable comedies in ages."

But it is also about as sexually exciting as watching a Zamboni polish an ice rink....and about as cold. 2. Drugs.....tons of it. Think of Scarface levels. Hey, drunks are funny, right?

","Martin Scorsese is losing his gift as a director. The Wolf of Wall Street is another rendition of Scorsese's other movies. The narration, actions, and flow of Wolf of Wall Street is similar to Goodfellas, Casino and Mean Streets. Di Capiro's lead character is just another version of the Henry Hill character from the movie Goodfellas. Through the streetwise narration of Di Capiro one learns how the system is scammed, and experiences dysfunctional behaviour of drugs, and prostitutes. The characters lack of morals creates the usual drama stew of low lives. Scorsese tries to spice up the old recycled formula with nudity, massive drug use, over the top sex, which can not compensate for the lack of story depth. 3 hours was way too long for a half hour story.

",""" The business of America is business "" screams an old cliché but like so many clichés it's based on reality . Is there much difference between a gangster and a stockbroker ? It's the sign of a very poor mobster who can't make a profit for his firm and it's the same with the stock market . Thankfully capitalism is legal and every other socio-economic alternative has been a disaster for humanity but one can't help equating the stock exchange with being the same as gangsterism , supply and demand without any moral or humanitarian mores and one wonders how American auteur Martin Scorsese might bring a story of Wall Street to screen ? If there's a problem with Scorsese he sometimes remakes the same type of film as in THE KING OF COMEDY and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD are remakes of TAXI DRIVER . likewise GOODFELLAS was remade as CASINO .One can't help thinking the temptation to make a story featuring an amoral capitalist could quite easily end up becoming a gangster film set in the world of high finance . "" All my life I wanted to be a white collar criminal "" <br/><br/>In effect this is how the film works to a large degree but Scorsese is on top of his game so having such a large similarity on a narrative and visual level with GOODFELLAS and CASINO doesn't matter because for a movie lasting three hours it just flies by . Once again Scorsese uses the directorial technique of intensified continuity which is film critic speak for in your face direction . All the Scorsese hallmarks are here , breaking down the figurative fourth wall , garish and glossy cinematography , constant camera movement , pumping intrusive music etc etc . It's all here and you've seen it all before but it's so well done that none of this matters and remains totally compelling as once again the master director brings us Shakespearean tragedy in its most American and cinematic form <br/><br/>To be fair to Jordan Belfort he didn't torture or kill anybody and his methods of gaining economic profit only differs from the rest of the finance sector in that they're illegal . Actually in amongst the excess of drugs , sex and foul language the storytelling doesn't make a very good job in telling the audience the difference between legal and illegal stockbroking but we're asked to take on board that Belfort isn't that bad because he's played by DiCaprio . Fair enough and he does a good job as a shallow and greedy boy who seduces stupid greedy people in handing over their cash . The rest of the cast also go along with the loud colourful style of the movie but was I puzzled by the one scene cameo by Mathew McConaughey in a pivotal role and kept expecting his character to make a reappearance at some point in the film which doesn't happen . . it'll be very ironic if as I expect McConaughey beats DiCaprio to the Oscar this year . A British audience might also find the casting of Joanna Lumley distracting in much the same way as Ray Winstone in THE DEPARTED , but the cinema audience I watched this with spent much of the running time laughing at the grotesque blackly comical scenes as they played out on screen . Mission accomplished Marty , although one can't help thinking an inclusion of a scene where Belfort passes a card warning a colleague about something is trying a little bit too hard to paint Belfort in a better light than he deserves . I mean it's not like anyone would be queuing up to listen to his lecture seminars after seeing this film is it now ? <br/><br/>This is one of the better films from the long , prolific resume of Martin Scorsese , possibly his best since GOODFELLAS but one that will probably be very under rewarded at the prestigious award ceremonies due to one of the strongest film line ups seen in many years . It also won't convert anyone in to being a new found Scorsese fan but for those of us who's enjoyed his familiar language of cinema to tell a story about the American dream turning in to a nightmare it's proof once again that he's Hollywood's greatest living director."

","The title of my review says it all. The Wolf of Wall Street was literally the WORST movie I have seen in my entire life. My opinion might not be quite so negative if the movie hadn't dragged its disorganized, rambling plot on for THREE WHOLE HOURS. At about the one hour mark I was already checking the clock out of boredom and disinterest, and continued to do so throughout the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I appreciate good film-making, and I appreciate that Martin Scorsese is widely recognized as a film genius, but I think this one was an artistic flop. The movie starts off entertaining, but it never really feels like the film takes off. Instead, I felt as if the film was rambling, always promising to find the point where the action gets good, but never quite getting there. The pacing is slower than molasses, and the dialogue inundated with largely meaningless conversations consisting mainly of expletives. While the movie focuses on Jordan Belfort's (DiCaprio) addictions to money, sex, and drugs, we never see Belfort hit rock bottom as we would usually expect of such a movie. Nor does the movie glorify his addictions, so the audience is left merely absorbing the gamut of his largely taboo experience without any meaning or particular point to it. The nudity in this film, too, is needlessly gratuitous and seemingly serves no purpose other than to continuously drive the point to the audience that Belfort is an uncommonly selfish ass who enjoys the sexual underbelly of the underworld -- a point which could have been made just as effectively with about half the nudity and sexual scenes. <br/><br/>Throughout the film we see none of the characters grow, nor do we see their actions have any other consequence besides generating more money, aside from Belfort's divorce and imprisonment at the end of the film, which seem to carry absolutely no weight. The characters are flat and shallow -- not the kind of people you would want to spend three hours with. DiCaprio's performance as Belfort was strong and believable, although the character was so thoroughly unlikable that it was difficult to enjoy his performance. Jonah Hill also gave a solid performance, but again, the character was too unlikable for me to care.<br/><br/>Scorsese also used little visual and narrative tricks (such as slowing the film down to focus on a ticking clock flying through the air, or having DiCaprio narrate Belfort's thoughts) to break up the flow of the story that, had they been used more consistently, more frequently, or in conjunction with any sort of meaning, would have had a positive stylistic impact on the film, but their usage was sporadic, giving the film a disjointed and uneven feeling.<br/><br/>I will be sorely disappointed if the academy nominates this film for best picture, as it felt more like an unedited rough draft that was prematurely loosed on theater-goers rather than a carefully constructed, polished piece of cinema."

","This was like watching a cheap soft porn flick. The drugs were glamorized as if they were harmless, like crack being smoked as if it had no more harm than a cigarette. The sex was like watching a cheap porn flick, with full frontal female nudity in several scenes and the sex scenes left little to the imagination. The only thing not shown in the sex scenes was penetration. But the sex, too, was careless sex, like whores who use condoms, unless you pay them more, which is what he claims to do and then another statements when he went nuts over a beautiful woman, that he does not care if he gets aids from her, he just wants sex with her.

","Motivational Speakers have gotten a bad reputation throughout the years, and perhaps rightly so. They can talk up a storm yet there's not much behind the curtain...<br/><br/>The same can be said of Leonardo DiCaprio's energetic performance in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, providing intense pep-rally speeches without any real games to follow: In fact the narration by DiCaprio's con artist stockbroker Jordan Belfort gives just about everything away. Imagine if, during the first minute of GOODFELLAS, Ray Liotta described the mafia as a bunch of worthless, lowlife, backstabbing killers: What's left to learn and experience? Based on a true story centering on unapologetic greed and making gross amounts of money, director Martin Scorsese provides so much flash there's very little substance, despite several attempts for a worthwhile baseline...<br/><br/>When Belfort starts his career as a low-end stockbroker, he almost suffers a necessary hunger before getting a quick bellyful of other people's money. Instead, right off the bat, his boss (Matthew McConaughey) unveils the nefarious sleight-of-hand before it's even played out. And later on, as Belfort's team of shady brokers join his own Wall Street corporation, with the exception of sidekick Donnie Azoff, played by A-list sidekick Jonah Hill, no one not even Belfort's gorgeous trophy wife amounts to anything beyond wallpaper.<br/><br/>One scene works the best: when a straight-laced FBI agent meets with Belfort on his yacht, there's a beginning, middle and end to a somewhat intriguing conversation. Here we finally learn what our antihero's up against. Perhaps an example of an ""honest stockbroker,"" one not targeted by the feds, would make us learn more about what makes Belfort particularly crooked. Besides an immense rockstar appetite for women and drugs, we never get past the man's perpetual debauchery.<br/><br/>This bloated and overlong howler of a WOLF could very well contend with SHOWGIRLS if an otherwise talented movie star, along with his iconic director/collaborator, weren't on board...<br/><br/>When Belfort and Donnie take too many Quaaludes there's a surreal twenty minutes that seemed like part of another movie perhaps LESS THAN ZERO if written by a sixth grader Which is nothing compared to a storm-riding yacht sequence that should have ended like Leo's other ship movie, sparing us an extra half-hour...<br/><br/>Bringing us back to the Motivational Speaker concept: If DiCaprio's best moments involve convincing a group of born cheaters they'd be better off rich and dishonest, he's merely preaching to the choir. The rest of us might need a reason to trust this jovially narcissistic, intentionally likable shyster before buying three long hours of his crap."

Yes, yes, I know that some villains escape retribution and (even worse) don't seem to have learned anything from their downfall -- this is beautifully portrayed in the flawless GOODFELLAS. But this movie applauds rather than excoriates this steaming dog turd Belfort - most of the men in the audience I was with seemed to enthusiastically admire Belfort and thought he had it made. They didn't seem in the least appalled by the sociopathic manner in which he treated his customers (inexplicably, none of whom we ever see, nor do we see the aftermath of their ruined lives courtesy of The Demon Belfort - you see, that would detract from the good ole fun porn movie Leo and Marty so enjoyed making - let's keep those libidos high and the laughs coming!)

The most vile behavior of the characters is played for laughs (I guess these scenes are supposed to be the black comedy parts but neither Marty nor Leo seem to understand what constitutes black comedy). You failed, Leo and Marty. You failed miserably. Unless of course your aim was to make a corporate ""Porky's"" in which case you succeeded. And apparently, there is an inexhaustible supply of grotesquely pathetic women in Hollywood who will strip for the camera any time, anywhere, for any reason whatsoever thereby making it difficult for the rest of the female population to be viewed as anything other than bodies to be used and then thrown away - thanks a lot.

We are never shown the victims and the effects of the perpetrators' fraud.<br/><br/>Thirdly, there is no plot. This film is simply three hours of persistent, droning debauchery. In fact, it almost appears that Scorsese's aim was just to exhibit endless variation of depravity, with no plot and no context to justify it. And that's my main gripe: the film is just three hours of gratuitous obscenity, with a redundant plot, no sense of direction and absolutely no purpose. We wait for the film to 'take off' but it never really does. It, quite simply becomes a gluttonous and disturbingly self-indulgent seminal celebration of human piggishness, rot and squalor.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my final point: the film is an unapologetic celebration of human baseness and predation. We are left to absorb the gamut of tedious depravity and obscenity without any particular meaning or point to it; besides perhaps crass titillation.<br/><br/>With its rave reviews, box office success and Oscar nominations, I think it's fitting to refer to The Wolf of Wall Street as the Emperor; with no clothes."

So where did it go wrong?<br/><br/>it starts already with the first scene in which a lion walks around the office for no reason at all. Right from the beginning I was annoyed by the lack of a comprehensive and telling storyline. Rahter than focusing on an aspect of Jordan Belfart's life Martin Scorsese choose for the approach of trying to fit in as much as possible. <br/><br/>The result: an nearly 3 hours during movie containing sex scenes and even more sex scenes, without any addition to the story-line, since we get the fact that he is rich, uses drugs and has sex after 10 minutes already. This does not have to be enhanced and repeated over and over again. <br/><br/>To be honest, I have never seen an movie which is nominated for an Oscar being so absulotly terrible. Really, why is this nominated for even a single Oscar? I don't get it. <br/><br/>Perhaps it is because the Oscars are American, and if there is one thing they like most it is the "" American dream"": something which this movie is all about. However even that is not explained thoroughly: when Leonardo Di Caprio starts explaining, he cuts himself of and says all you need to know is that it was illegal. <br/><br/>Perhaps it was because some people find it absolutely funny, and it was funny. For the first 10 minutes only. <br/><br/>As a final comment I want to say that I was shocked at the way the movie dealt with homosexuality,(which was not positive i can tell you that) and the last scene was perhaps most hateful of all: as Jordan Belfart asks white members of the audience to sell them his pen (which I didn't get at all: why would people want advice from a criminal?) he asks several people, than skips the black member of the audience, and asks another white guy, why?

Who thrive conning white-collar's out of their money until the government catches on to their scams and the ploy inevitably crashes and burns. <br/><br/>The main problem I had with this movie surprisingly was not its glorifying of terrible human behaviour, greed, drugs and full-throttle misogyny throughout (which I did have a problem with), but the fact that it was all pointless, and continuously depicts the the same crap over and over; something that gets very old. Very fast. It is possible to show debauchery and distasteful conduct in context and with a POINT (I', not some crazy who can't bear to see nudity or cringes at the sound of profanity). But this movie is deprived of anything close to a message or even a dialogue trying to give any form of meaning whatsoever. It seems to show these things just to shock or for cheap laughs (I didn't laugh. But had I they would've been incredibly cheap.). And that is what I have a problem with, the movie glorifying these things for what seems like no reason, or for a reason the makers failed miserably to get across, it just makes the film itself seem rampant, immature and stupid.<br/><br/>Another huge problem with this film is the fact that it constantly barrages you with this debauchery brought about by DiCaprio and his cohorts, but never gives it any real substance, no blowback, no depth to it nothing (as I've already said) this in turn makes the characters look like exactly what everyone in this movie seems to be: immoral scum. None of the characters have any redeeming qualities whatsoever, they are all creepy greedy sexist pricks with nothing to show for. And this is where the movie falls ultimately flat. Its not a ""love to hate"" relationship between the characters and the viewer, it is a simple loathing of pretty much every cardboard cut-out in this terrible film, the writing is awful, almost seeming like they cut corners on purpose to avoid giving any characters or acts any depth or meat at all.<br/><br/>Overall its an immature film that Hollywood will eat-up. Ridden with dick-jokes and the grade of humour that appeals to most teenage boys. Its not quite boring, but flatlines of anything memorable throughout. Maybe there was some sort of thought and effort originally put into this movie as shown by all the A-listers who appear. But all this movie offers is a waste of time, a waste of effort (if there were any), a waste of talent and a waste of money.

The needle on my excitement and anticipation meter quickly rose up too super psyched up level. Unfortunately after having watched this excessive monstrosity of a film, that's not where my excitement needle rested 3 numbing hours later. Don't get me wrong, the film was beautifully shot by Rodrigo Prieto and delivered some standout performances both from its lead and supporting cast of Jonah Hill as Donie Azoff, Margot Robie as Naomi Lapaglia Belfort and Rob Reiner playing Max Belfort was sensational. Here is the thing, I found myself asking the same question throughout the 180 minutes of this feature film, ""Is this all there is, is this all there is?"" The answer resonated in my gut with a resounding thud of a yes. That was all there was, and after what seem like forever of gratuitous sex and over the top drug usage sophomoric greed fueled behavior, the story stalls like a bad case of constipation. Along the way Mr Scorsese fails miserably to add depth and weight to a story predicated on the bilking of hundreds of millions of dollars from unsuspecting investors. The Wolf of Wall Street comes nowhere near its superior predecessor of the 80's Oliver Stone's Wall Street. In Wall Street you witness the excess and greed with redemption and with a feeling that wrongs need to be righted. Gordon Geko was a more likable anti hero and Michael Douglas brought a degree of gravitas to a much higher quality narrative. Mr Scorses's mosh pit of debauchery and greed only makes us revolt even more to the outrageous and felonious behavior of Wall Street Gone Wild.

","I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Leonardo DiCaprio has been epic in his previous movies, and had done Gatsby so much wonderful credit from the book I couldn't help but to wonder if he himself was a fan. After King of Wallstreet, and the high reviews this movie had received, I was excited and I really, really wanted to like this movie. I walked away feeling as if I had wasted not just the price of a movie ticket, but a painful, excruciatingly long 180 minutes of my time that felt closer to 300 minutes.<br/><br/>Not only did this movie utterly fail in knowing when to cut things off (there were multiple times in the movie I expected the next scene to conclude the story, only to be dragged through more scenes that weren't needed), but it couldn't seem to decide what it wanted to be. The humor is a wash between slapstick, big-lipped alligator moments, god-awful prejudice against an assortment of groups, with a bit of witty commentary on the ridiculousness of the stock market and what big suckers most buyers are. Just a bit though, after all, let's not take things too seriously since there's drug addiction, adultery, and idiocy galore! I had suspected that some fridge logic was involved in all this since there was just enough wit to keep me in my seat. I felt like despite the movie's horrendous length, maybe I had missed something in the storyline that would wrap everything up in such a way as to explain the high rating and reviews and that this would be brilliant. Well, weeks later, I'm still left feeling utterly at a lost at how this movie is still rated so high. I'm starting to think that the movie industry is beginning to be plagued by what I lovingly refer to as the ""Napolean Dynamite Desease"", where a movie falls so short of a delivery and yet is rated at such critical acclaim. Hell, at least Napolean Dynamite had some okay quotes to make up for its anticlimatical ending. Wolf of Wallstreet just left me feeling empty inside. The only saving grace was the bit of comedy that didn't go so deep into the utterly ridiculous that it was actually funny.<br/><br/>If you want to waste your time and money on this excuse to throw midgets around, go right ahead. Give me King of Wallstreet any day of the week."

A scumbag's rise and fall and return to despicable life of greed, conceit and moral void. Scorsese and DiCaprio revel with the revelers in this flick to show...actually for an unknown reason. There is no moral reference point in the film, rather a neutral excitement about the cunning of the main character. There is not one good or sympathetic person depicted in this film. All are scumbags with no hope or desire for any form of redemption, remorse or a lasting human feeling. Very dark and depressing movie; actually misanthropic. The macabre disregard of any value is well hidden behind dark or foul humor and a blur of debauchery, crime and excessive luxury.<br/><br/>The one thing that maybe deserves attention is the depiction of Belfort as a magnetic and captivating speaker, a preacher of mammon.

","The beginning of this film appealed to the adolescent in me with the break the rules, crazy behavior of the wall street swindlers but soon it became so clear that this film was glorifying amoral, unrepentant thieves who stole millions of dollars from unsuspecting hard working people. They haven't paid back their victims and are now out of jail continuing to make money off of their illegal/amoral behavior. The acting was OK but hard to enjoy in the context of the real story and the thought that I was contributing to their wealth and probably boosting their pathological egos, not something I want to spend my money on.

"olimpija-mkd","2","34","62","20 January 2014"," Ideas have and will have consequences
","t is with a long due that I am writing my opinion on ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". I first wanted to inquire a bit into the opinions of my friends, and check myself whether I am missing something. Seems that I did not. I approach the issue of Wolf of Wall Street (WWS) movie with the question what was the main point of the movie? When people do or create things, they usually aim to make a point, at least 95% of the cases, excluding those that are doing things just for the sake of it. Here we talk about a movie. Here are some of the possible points WWS (in this case its director Scorsese) tried to make, and whether the means he used to make the point, actually served its purpose. Even if one does not want to moralize the story and just watch, a couple of ideas yet are hinted.<br/><br/>According to the last part of the movie we might propose that the point was to learn how to sell a pen- first create a demand. This is I think quite a cheap point for an excessively long movie, since it is lesson 101 in each economy class. I wonder why this was depicted with the deep look in Belfort's eyes by the end of the movie when he was holding a seminar. I would have understood it as the starting point of an interesting, challenging money game that unravels throughout the movie, but this was basically it! Just make people believe they need this particular product! But hold on, this came only after he experienced personality transformation, got terribly rich by fraud and enjoyed sex, drugs and money to its fullest. Yet he has a lesson for us.<br/><br/>Second point might be that power corrupts. But did we really need to swallow all that nudity, promiscuity, and orgies to get this point? Many movies capture this perfectly by telling a story, describing a historical event, even great fiction, but not taping semi- porn.<br/><br/>The legal system holes. Probably movies can present realities, hence raise awareness of the issues with legislation and its paradoxes, the flourishing of corruption, and the easily corruptible heart of men (as Lord of the Rings clearly and nicely depicts). But by the sheer snugger to these facts, this movie says rather go get them than go fix them! I also wonder whether the point was to bluntly present reality of Wall Street. Then this is kind of a descriptive argument, for which I think a documentary rather then a classical movie is required. Why watch 3 hours reality of Wall Street, instead of watching a good documentary with a warning of the contaminating content it contains.<br/><br/>Good performance of DiCaprio? Yes, he is witty, courageously teaching us directly speaking to the camera, amusing us with the Lamborghini part performance but really, is there anyone who decided that this is this movie's take away lesson?<br/><br/>Additionally to these murky points, this movie also puzzles its audience with absurdity rather then cleverness. Has anybody noticed how on earth the nice looking young boy, just married, with a fuse to go work, earn, build a carrier and future, just in a second turns into fraudulent, tainted mind?<br/><br/>I also wonder whether the director at all cares about the audience of the movie. Probably not, but generally, young and ambitions people are drawn to watch the movie, learn some more about money making or find at least bits of explanations why the economic crisis happens. Of course many young boys come to see it since the trailer promises fun, young buddy enjoying girls, cars, and using his super intelligence to get rich. But I guess most thought this was simply the context of a grander narrative. Well no, this was it. And these young boys simply take away this message to be very cool!<br/><br/>I am not demanding a light at the end of the tunnel (the movie), but I expect myself to finish watching the movie, and have either an ""aha"" moment, or at least a question mark. This time my question mark really regards the very sake of making the movie, not the content itself. In this case, the end of the tunnel was the transformed Wolf teaching people how to sell a pen. If only they knew how this little trick has broader implications for turning the business world around them upside down and build them a temple to worship their deceit! The motives but foremost the point of this movie are entirely dubious.<br/><br/>Dear Hollywood and Scorsese, in today's culture, the last thing we needed was yet another glorification of greed- there is plenty of it, both in movies and reality. How about some counter action to the media, fashion magazines and shiny attractive starry skies of materialism? How about many many more movies on personalities that do not just grasp opportunity whatever the price, but act and strive for what is right? Even if the motive for the movie was simply depiction of Belfort's life, Scorsese and Belfort and whoever thinking the project was worthwhile, should also know that no matter how meaningless, ideas have and will have consequences. The movie sets lowers the bar of decency, and I wonder what will be coming up next out of Hollywood in this vein?"

","I would just like to say that I got absolutely nothing out of the viewing of The Wolf Of Wall Street. It is easily the worst effort ever from Martin Scorsese. The story line is almost non existent , DiCaprio is just a loser with a loud mouth, and all the surrounding characters are one dimensional. I don't see any moral battle being fought, I don't care about seeing hookers, lots of drugs being taken , or stupid parties, very boring. The real role model in the story cites his hero's as Gordon Gekko of Wall Street, Don Johnson of Miami Vice, and Richard Gere in Pretty Woman, what a completely shallow loser, even in todays bottom feeding America. The whole effort is simple B movie territory, not just because of the 80's and 90's settings. Couple this film with American Hustle, and you have a pretty awful state of 2014 film-making."

","This film was so bad that it finally drove me to writing an IMDb review. Supposedly an expose of the criminal activities that lurk behind the facade of Wall Street, this film is nothing but a glorification of dishonesty, sex and drugs. <br/><br/>Jordan Belfort's swindles are portrayed in depth as a manual for those who wish to be happy and gain a standing in life, while honest dealers are despised and ridiculed. <br/><br/>There is nothing funny about this film. The reviewer who found it ""A comedic epic"" must have a poor sense of humour which finds a few gross jokes and the sight of a grown man pissing into a paper basket funny.<br/><br/>The only epic thing about this film are the scenes of drug-taking and debauchery on the scale of Roman orgies which are made out to be an almost normal way of life. Had the foul language, sex and drug-taking not been so over the top, the film would have had much more credibility, but they were so gratuitous and repetitive that they became boring! How could Scorsese have stooped so low - is this all he could come up with to draw the viewers?<br/><br/>Within the first half hour the pattern is set. By the end of the first hour we were bored and wondering when the film would come to the point but another hour of torture took us no where. 8/10ths of the film was spent drumming in the message that the only way to succeed and be happy in life is through sleaze. Finally the law catches up with the hero, but he sneaks on his friends and gets away with a smack on the wrist. <br/><br/>The film lacks characterisation; all the characters are one-dimensional. I can't understand how Di Caprio could have been awarded a best actor award when his role was so one-sided - even when he was down, Jordan was totally unrepentant. Not a single victim is featured to show the effects of Jordan's fraud. Even the jail looks more like a hotel and the final scene shows Jordan re-inventing himself, as successful as ever with little price paid to society. Similarly, the script required little effort since 70% is a repetition of the same speeches in which the F word is every third word.<br/><br/>The hypocrisy of this film is staggering. One would expect some sort of message from Scorsese but there is none other than the mind-numbing adulation of money and its trappings."

","I have two main points to say, first being Mr.DiCaprio has delivered a cracker of a performance. Second being Mr.Scorsese has made a farce out of movie which could have been something else.<br/><br/>I once heard a joke that if there was a movie made on Mr.DiCaprio in which the actor playing him had actually won an Oscar for the performance it would be damn hilarious as Mr.DiCaprio can never earn one himself. This joke i think struck Mr.DiCaprio rather hard, as you can see the desperation in his performance in this movie. Of course he has delivered many a memorable performances in ""Inception"", ""The Beach"", ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"". This movie is different, it is different for him very much as never has he been so bang on in creating a riotous comic scene with the true conviction of a actor. Some scenes in this movie have been written for Mr.DiCaprio and he fits into the shoes like a veteran with such ease that it amazes you.<br/><br/>Mr.Hill complements him very well as the awkward homo erotic klutz who is a steadfast friend.

Miss Margot Robbie was ever so gorgeous as all the leading ladies in Mr.Scorsese movies are.<br/><br/>Mr.Scorsese has been strong in weaving tales which grip you like a ""f**king"" iron vice, he hasn't faltered in this one too. Who am i to be even be able to review the great Mr.Scorsese but all i can say is ""tut tut"", as this movie could have been made into classic but it seems to have been settled down for a entertaining farce of urban gimmicks like drugs, stupid men who swear a lot and lot of ""A"" rated scenes.<br/><br/>Kudos to Mr.Terence Winter for writing a entertaining script with such plot points which you can expect before hand yet can't help but admire.

","Scorsese is my favorite director and I was really looking forward seeing his newest movie. The first half an hour was running very good. McConaughey was really great and his speech contained the whole truth as we all know it. BUT then began the colorful and crazy party full of ""fun"" and spending of money to sex and drugs. And this is it. I didn't get any more info or feeling about this movie. (of course if I don't count the FBI ""investigation"") I'm not saying it wasn't fun. A few scenes made me laugh as nothing for a long time before. But I waited for some point for some explanation. But nothing came out. I REALLY don't understand how Scorsese could even choose such theme. These people are idols of these days? Three hours to glorify such stupid and unmoral person is too much and the story was as much simple as it could be. I can tell the whole story in three sentences. I know the nudity could be very interesting for all men and boys but it was just TOO MUCH. It had no point and if I wanted to see so much sex I would see other type of movie. I was chocked by the age limit for this movie. Not for the nudity but because of the whole the message. Just have to have fun and spend the whole money for drugs and prostitutes the stupid ""normal"" people will pay it. And I don't know how would explain my young son that this is not the right way how to live and he will be happy once he get a good job and a good girl who will love him no matter what. Or this is not the way how it works now?"

","Martin Scorsese redoes Goodfellas in the financial sector. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a young man immediately smitten with the ruthlessness of Wall Street (at first represented by Matthew McConaughey in a hilarious cameo). After the market sees a startling crash in the late '80s, DiCaprio gets pushed out of the big leagues. He quickly finds a way in smaller markets, pushing penny stocks. He figures out ways, not all of them strictly legal, to make cash hand over fist. Soon, paired with new best friend Jonah Hill, he opens his own firm. All the rules go out the door as he pulls in millions of dollars a year, which leads to all sorts of drug-fueled mayhem. The draw here is the pure debauchery. It will surely offend some, but the pure spectacle of depravity is enormously amusing. The film really doesn't want to think too hard about the awful things that Belfort is doing, which is kind of a bold choice. Sure, he does end up suffering in the end, but, with all he experienced beforehand, the little bit of suffering seems almost worth it. It could easily be argued that it's a hugely immoral film, but I think it just wants to put us in the action. The film has an epic runtime, which isn't really deserved. I wasn't exactly bored with it (though I was feeling it physically), but it could have been shortened. DiCaprio gives one of his best performances, but I was most amused by Hill. Many will despise his abrasive character, but I thought he was hilarious."

This film depicts Belfort being a self-made man; albeit through partying hard, self over-medicating, no holds barred debauchery leading to his whirlwind approach leaving a mark on Wall Street. Belfort's charisma being able to attract followers in sharing his use of other people's hard earned money to live a life of beautiful women, exotic drugs, lavish homes and cars, and the utmost luxury making for a lush life.

It gets hard snitching on your closest friends, But Belfort manages to use the chance to garner a smaller stint in prison...36 months.<br/><br/>Leave the kids at home, because THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is forewarned a deservedly hard R, due to strong sexual content, blatant drug use, language, violence and very graphic nudity.

The juvenile toilet humour used in the movie to illustrate the debasement of Jordan Belfort was boring and even nauseating at times. I found it odd that Scorcese chose to leave out Jordan Belforts Jewish background, as well as many of the main characters in the actual biography of Jordan Belfort. This undercuts much of the meaning and social commentary, not to mention irony ie. when the up and coming lords of the universe decide to call their company Stratton Oakmont' such a WASPY sounding name tee hee. such chutzpah. The scenes where Jordan Belfort talks to the camera is reminiscent of the scene from Goodfellas when 'Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta"" gets up out of the witness stand in court and starts talking to the camera. Many scenes during ""wolf of wall street"" made me feel ashamed for Scorcese because he shamelessly plagiarizes ''Goodfellas"". The trajectory of the movie is obvious and not surprising. I found this movie to be far beneath expectation. Di Caprio was alright in his efforts. Nothing special. But Matthew Mconaughey was absurd, Cringe worthy! (I was very uncomfortable watching Mconaugheys outlandish display of pounding his chest and humming a mantra. He just was not believable, his cadence was off.

Unfortunately, this movie is not even close to any of mentioned masterpieces. The main character is an ordinary control freak, who is constantly anxious and tortured by the fear of losing control and tries to remedy that by sex, drugs and booze. Teenagers will be happy to watch something ""Hangoverish"" here, but for a responsible adult the main character would look despicable and offensive.

Told in a manic and repetitive style, this is the lurid tale of a disgusting, greedy, criminal ass**le and his equally despicable, moronic friends. In other words, Scorsese did a re-take of Goodfellas, moving from the mafia environment to Wall Street. I suppose this is to prove that all men are equally corrupted and disgusting, regardless of the environment... which is a rather depressing view of society (regardless of the orgies).<br/><br/>Half-way through, I started to feel nauseated by the overblown and endless sequence of shouted profanities, illegal deals and all sorts of wild parties, inclusive of one guy masturbating at the sight of Jordan soon-to-be second wife. Even if I know that the Academy's standards are very low, I was surprised to see that a movie with a guy jerking off was considered Oscar material.<br/><br/>Final note: even my male companion got fed up one hour into this, to prove that not every man is actually like Scorsese is repeatedly showing us."

","I give DiCaprio a thumbs up for his impeccable portrayal of the perpetually greedy Jordan Belfort, but overall I disliked the movie. This is based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort, a notorious stockbroker and self-made millionaire who's penny stock brokerage defrauded 1,500 clients of $200 million during the 1990's. He used aggressive sales tactics and adrenaline charged locker room motivational chants to persuade his vagabond group of 1,000 wannabes to follow his lead, get rich at any cost, especially to the client, and make a name for their brokerage, Stratton Oakmont. At three hours the movie is overly long given the numerous scenes of drug use, drinking, sex and raucous office parties, not to mention the nonstop foul language throughout. One clearly gets the message that Mr. Belfort is a debaucher, gluttonous, disloyal, lewd, immoral, fanatical, corrupt, demanding and ambitious, hence the title. Two hours would have been sufficient for this intense roller coaster ride of greed. I wonder if Mr. Scorsese is vicariously trying to relive the wild '60's in this film."

","Considering its many affiliations with American HUSTLE (noted in that film's review), it is interesting to watch how in the former, the F.B.I. emerged as foolhardy in their undeniably well-meaning approach – while here they are treated more or less as the heroes of the day when their operation proves a resounding success! Anyway, much has been said of this latest Martin Scorsese/Leonardo Di Caprio collaboration – especially in how it treads the line of tastelessness for much of its 3 hour duration (with some of the admittedly over-the-top sex'n'drugs antics seeming to belong more in a grindhouse or even ""Euro-Cult"" movie from the 1970s!). Still, I feel this backlash (especially for the way such serious offenses as depicted in the film are treated in blackly comic terms) was itself extreme: just note how much attention has been given to the dwarf-throwing gag (the pros and cons of such a wild scheme are amusingly delineated just like any other business-related item!) but, seeing how it occurs during the very opening scene, one would expect the viewer to have totally worked it out of his system by the time the picture's end credits start rolling! Indeed, to Scorsese's credit, if the Jordan Belfort gang's scamming of both poor and rich people was dealt with so thoroughly – or, should I say, the rewards they reaped from it – these characters' fall from grace is at least as detailed and spectacular; so, in that respect, it comes off as a balanced evaluation of a particular lifestyle which, like it or not, existsand to which gullible people themselves contribute in a misguided attempt to increase their own bank account without having to work for it!<br/><br/>As for Di Caprio, his performance is indeed among the year's best and one of his own towering achievements – but, personally, I feel he was even better in THE AVIATOR (2004) and SHUTTER ISLAND (2010; for which he was not even Oscar-nominated!), both also for Scorsese. The film under review is up for just five Academy Awards, which rather shuts it out from winning any of the top categories – unless the AMPAS voters prefer the star to Matthew McConaughey in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (another initially reprehensible real-life character dealing in illegal substances but, in his case, for the common good rather than self-gratification), which I sincerely doubt!; incidentally, McConaughey himself turns up here early on as the anti-hero's mentor and whose ritualistic hum to get him functioning on a daily basis is even worked into a song by the actor and the film's music director Robbie Robertson (ex-member of The Band and a Scorsese regular)! <br/><br/>Jonah Hill as the protagonist's sidekick is also shortlisted in the Supporting Actor category but, while his contribution is highly entertaining, there is little depth to the part (even less so where their other colleagues are concerned, who somehow seem stuck in the lower rungs of the firm despite its obvious flourish!). Di Caprio's role – being based on the book written by Belfort himself – is clearly much more rounded, then, especially since his intermittent narration is adamant that money and power (even more so when acquired at a young age and unlawfully) too often lead one on a self-destructive pathand the fact that he was able to rise again after 'doing time' is a testament to his talent for survival, if nothing else! To go back to its ties with American HUSTLE, the F.B.I. sequences necessarily recall those of Scorsese's earlier and superior GOODFELLAS (1990) – which suggests that its best (and funniest) moments tend to involve the after-effects of the copious intake of drugs, notably DiCaprio getting tongue-tied during a vital telephone call and his 'spastic' attempts to reach his luxurious car and drive back home. For the record, film director Rob Reiner appears as Di Caprio's colourful dad and Jean Dujardin is a Swiss Bank manager (to where the countless millions are literally transferred out of the federal authorities' reach). On a personal note, I should say that I was expecting to hate this going in but I have had to eat my words and admit that it was an enjoyable if (no pun intended) taxing ride...which, as soon as it was over, made me run to the medicine cabinet and pop a headache pill myself!"

The pace was fantastic but the tone of the movie was very much misguided. To a lot of people the whole depravity/greed point was missed because the tone of the movie was light and had almost no weight despite the gravity of what happens to the protagonist by the end. A lot of my friends (males) actually thought that going to prison for 3 years was nothing compared to the blissful obscene life of Jordan and were actually ready to give it a try if the opportunity presented itself. <br/><br/>The point of a movie is above all to convey a message and a morale and I am afraid to say that despite my admiration for Dicaprio, the message of the movie was nothing but the opposite. The sad part is some people get blaze when they watch this movie and think all of this is normal and acceptable! For so much callousness, greed and evil, the movie should have had a more serious tone. The ending shows a well off Jordan who was not crumbled by losing his wife, almost killing his daughter, possibly having Aids or his skin peeling off from all the drugs he had and not at all ashamed of what he did. It shows a man strong who is invincible JUST because he knows how to sell and take opportunity of people's stupidity and need. And this is a bad message all throughout. The movie depicts how he had a blast in prison! They say the beginning and the end are the most important parts...which is where he shines the most!<br/><br/>The movie (director's vision) might have been great in its conception but is just abhorrent in its execution.

Who paid off whom to get this an ""R"" rating? I'm angry with those who call this art. Art is taking a probably interesting story and not resorting to an overuse of trashy scenes and language to tell that story in an ""R"" rated movie. OK, sure, this man's life was excessive and degrading to the human spirit, but the actual story was lost in the crap I saw on screen over and over. I did not read the book so I'm not sure how close the movie stayed to it. But it seems to me that M.S. just wanted to push the envelope without telling anyone how much he pushed it until you bought you ticket and were in your seat expecting to see a good flick with a good actor. Disappointing to me and other than what I've already written, there is nothing about this movie that makes it noteworthy to me. Leonardo needs a great script again to stand up to his acting prowess.

'The Departed' is undoubtedly one of the best crime thriller's to ever hit theater's with outstanding performances from multiple cast members but 'The Aviator' was the role that took Di Caprio to that next level, Scorsese provided him the stage to perform and carry the movie to what I feel will go down as one of the greatest artistic portrayals on film.<br/><br/>Everyone did not share my love for 'Aviator' but it looks to be a different story altogether with TWoWS with the film already receiving fantastic reviews and praise despite the controversy about the extraordinary excess portrayed. For those who haven't seen it and are sitting on the fence due to the criticism remember one thing, this is a Scorsese movie and you are almost always certain to be a part of a truly visceral experience, Scorsese is used to pushing the boundaries of what is usually acceptable to a mainstream audience and this is no different.<br/><br/>At 3 hours the film never feels overdrawn, the characters are fantastically written (which is attributed to Terrance Winter's screenplay) and some truly memorable performances (Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughy are both excellent) but it is Leonardo Di Caprio's execution of one of the most sincere slime balls ever portrayed on film that you MUST watch this film for.<br/><br/>The best achievement I attribute to it is that without him, for this movie to be ANY BIT as good as it has turned out, you would only be looking at a very select few actors in the business.<br/><br/>Will he finally get an Oscar?

","The Wolf of Wall Street, which is Martin Scorsese's new film based supposedly on a true story and book by Jordan Belfort, is not only the single worst film I have seen in 2013 so far, but it is also one of the worst films that I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The film sounded interesting enough as I have an interest in wall street and the business world and more times than not I have enjoyed Martin Scorsese's films and Leonardo DiCaprio as well as their collaborations together, but this film just did not work. First off, I think that this is one of the most vulgar and profane films that I have ever seen. I would actually be curious to know how many profanities were uttered during the course of this film because it must have been an awful lot because there was barely a minute that went by without someone cursing. Besides the filthy language and lots of it, the film showed the lifestyles these characters lived and showed in graphic detail all the immoral and perverse things that they were up to. Basically this was the whole of the film, showing a bunch of spoiled an arrogant rich people behaving badly with no real message, or anything to wrap the film up with. The film was just endless excess and then some. I have seen a lot of films over the years including some that have objectionable content of varying degrees and styles and usually unless it is done in a certain way, I do not let it bother me, but for The Wolf of Wall Street, it felt like there was no point to it and the whole objective of this film was to be loud, crude, rude and vulgar. To be honest I am shocked the film did not receive an NC-17 rating. I guess I was not the only person to have felt this way because people actually left during the screening I was in for this movie and I read that during an official screening of the film with cast and crew, someone actually went up to Scorsese and said ""Shame on you!"". I wish I could have said the same thing right to his face. This is the type of film that I absolutely hated so much that I wish my friend, who very kindly paid for the tickets for the movie, would have asked for his money back because this film was almost 3 hours of my life that I will never get back, 3 hours I could have spent doing something better, or seeing a much better film. I am personally really surprised at the high ratings the film is getting and also all the awards nominations as well. Did they see the same film I did? To me though, there was nothing that made this film special at all. Every single character was loathsome, so to say I admired the acting would be hard for me to say, seeing as I did not care about any of these characters and after awhile they got on my nerves and I just wanted the film to be over. The film's screenplay was just excessive bad behaviour and wild living with no moral, or point to it, other than just showing it and going as far as they can with the content and hoping that the audience has a wild and fun time with it, which I didn't. Also the film was way too long. At almost 3 hours in length sitting through this monotonous and vulgar bore was actually painful. I sat and squirmed in my seat and wished for better lighting in the theatre, so that I could check my watch to get a rough idea of when this piece of trash would be over. Alas, I sat patiently and this film would just not end. The editing was all over the place and there were scenes in this film that had no point of being in there and others just went on for way too long. The film is being classified as a comedy, but I do not think I laughed once. Often it's attempt at humour, or trying to make me laugh was just scenes that I found awkwardly executed and filmed and they looked clumsy and poorly done. The whole film felt like it was made during a college fraternity party and written and made after everybody had probably way too much to drink. This is certainly a major disgrace for Martin Scorsese, the man behind such classics as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. I didn't think with all his talent that he could make a film this bad, but he proved me wrong. Unfortunately, people are going to go and see this film and probably kick a big kick out of it for all the wrong reasons. I will certainly throw a fit if this wins any major awards over much better and deserving films this year though. As it stands, The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that I hope to never see ever again in my whole life and it was a rare occasion where I saw a film where I wanted a complete refund from the theatre chain. The absolute worst film of 2013 and don't make the same mistake I did by paying, or sitting through it."

","An old adage goes that if on a certain day, everyone in the world received a million dollars, by the end of the day, ten percent of the people would have all the money.<br/><br/>""The Wolf of Wall Street"" pretty much shows how that could happen.<br/><br/>Based on Jordan Belfort's book, this is a very entertaining movie - although probably not for those who lost their money. The film follows Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) from newbie stockbroker to head of Stratton Oakmont, the largest 'Over The Counter' stockbroking firm in the US.<br/><br/>Along the way he has two marriages, acquires luxury homes and automobiles, a sea going yacht with a helicopter, a taste for wild office sex parties, which would put a Roman orgy to shame, and a huge drug habit. But even after the FBI steps in and everything unravels, the guy still can't help making money.<br/><br/>The movie is loud, lewd and often hilarious; it doesn't have a boring minute.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey gives a brief but telling performance as Mark Hanna who initiates Belfort into the darker side of Wall Street. He also introduces the tribal chest-thumping chant that becomes a motif throughout the film.<br/><br/>Aussie Margot Robbie is hard to take your eyes off as Belfort's second wife, Naomi. She was also an amusing guest on talk shows when the movie was released where she told how she pulled off the Brooklyn accent, and kept the news about her nude scenes from her family for as long as possible.<br/><br/>But this is Leonardo's movie. Although in his portrayal of Belfort, where there appears to be almost no moral or ethical boundaries, he keeps our sympathy because he can actually laugh at himself; it's a high energy performance, but with a light touch.<br/><br/>In a way, the performance has echoes of the one he gave for Spielberg in ""Catch Me If You Can"". Despite the fact that both Jordan Belfort and Frank Abagnale Jr. break the law, their sheer audacity dazzles us. Also, both Spielberg and Scorsese have great comedic timing; they know how to deliver a punch line. If you were looking for a reason why this film works better than Scorsese's ""The Aviator"", which also starred Leonardo, it could simply be the latter film's lack of humour - Hughes was eccentric but he wasn't funny.<br/><br/>Enjoyable as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is, at the end you can't help wondering if even half of it is true, how it is that with people like Belfort and his friends helping themselves to such over-sized slices of the pie, that the world's economy hasn't descended to the level it did in 1929. In a way, it's actually a very scary movie."

Mr. Scorsese you are starting (if not already) losing some of your best admirers by this. To me it reflects a screenwriter who thinks he needs to use explicit language to make a film about a bad guy interesting to audiences. Might I suggest you get your screenwriters together in one room and watch the entire series of ""Breaking Bad"" to see how to write a great script. No profanity. No sexist drivel.

I get it, I get it -- the excess of the film itself matches the excess of the Wall Street world depicted in it. But excess, both as a subject matter and as a style, is boring after a while. The first hour or so of the film blows the roof off the joint, and I was sure I was experiencing a film that would go down as one of Scorsese's best.

"ironhorse_iv","7","4","5","18 June 2014"," The Wolf of Wall Street was a pretty crazy movie. Not, only did it sell the pen. The dark comedy concept sold the movie.
","If this movie wasn't so outrageous mess up funny. It would be so unlikable to watch. In my opinion, should had been call, 'The Wolves of Wall Street'. Nobody has any morals balls in this movie as every character in this film is pretty greedy liars. They all felt like one-dimensional greed caricatures than human beings. Most of the character really need more well-rounded depth to them. Based on 2007's memoirs, true story of Jordan Belfort. The movie focus on Jordan (Leonardo DiCaprio) rise to a wealthy stockbroker through the use of corruption scams; while under the watchful eyes of the federal government in the 1990s. The black comedy directed by Martin Scorsese, is pretty well-made. Still, it really felt too much of a glamorization of the lifestyle, than a moral tale, in my opinion. It felt like lets show as much f*ck up things as we can for 2 hours, and then in the last few minutes, show the negative results of what happen. It was bit one-sided argument. It made the film seem a bit unrealistic, with how many crude things, these people could get away with. This movie will likely inspiring others to do the same mistakes, rather than teach them, not to do what Belfort did. After all, the real Belfort got paid for this movie, a million dollar and a cameo. Since 2013, the opening of this movie, Belfort hasn't pay enough money back to the victims of his crimes. The U.S. government is not holding Belfort in default of his payments, but it is unclear when the full amount of the mandated restitution will ever be paid by him. He's pretty much, got Scot free in his case, and that really sucks to hear, if he stole money from you. The acting is really alright. Leonardo DiCaprio can really put out the charm. He can also do the yelling, that he been known for. He wasn't afraid of going over the top with this. Still, this role wasn't anything new for him. After all, he played similar characters in both 2013's Great Gatsby and 2002's Catch Me if you can. Instead of playing it straight, he just went 100% crazy with this role with all the sex scenes and drug use. Honestly, with all the drug use, Jordan portray in the film doing, how is this guy even alive? The one person that deeply surprise me was Jonah Hill as his partner in crime, Donny Azoff. You really didn't see this type of acting coming from him. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. I have to say, while his premise on film is short, Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna, Jordan's mentor, was pretty memorable. The women characters were pretty typecast as trophy wives, money hungry girlfriends, or eye candy hookers, who mostly go around, full frontal nudity, or having sex. If they're not, doing that, they portray as bitchy gold-diggers with no sense of morals. Margot Robbie is a pretty face, but gees, she couldn't act. At the beginning of her presence, she had an Australian accent that made more sense since her aunt is British. Then,out of the blue, you hear this awful screeching New Yorker/New Jersey Guido accent that sounds like something out of Jersey Shore. She couldn't show depth in her character, if Martin Scorsese wanted to. It's really uncomfortable and offended how women were portray in the film. The only female character was somebody to root for, was Aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley), but she ain't no angel. I have to say, for men, at less, we got a counter-protagonist fighting against the antagonist Jordan in Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who did wonderful in his role. He wasn't one-dimensional pencil pusher, Boy Scout. He was willing to go one on one with Jordan. The movie even have a somewhat moral character in Jordan's father, Max (Rob Reiner) who tries hard to get Jordan to live life, the right way, but always his son to make the mistakes, needed to grow. I love the idea, how Martin Scorsese film it, with the use of wide ends, slow motion and others to show the effects of the drugs or heavy party scenes. The movie really felt like it could had work in a 3D settling. I love how he aged the film for the infomercial sequence to make it look like something that came out in the 1990s. I love all the commercials footage used from Benihana to Steve Madden. The CGI in the film is a bit choppy. You can see, how bad, it was in the storm scenes, but there is rare mistakes made this film. Great use of establish music to set the mood of the film. The humor is a hit or miss. Some of them were really just crude like the homophobic, sexism and racism comments. While, others were pretty clever and funny. I love all the fourth wall jokes with Jordan gives lengthy explanations of Stockbroker terminology; only to drop it midway through. I love pop culture references like Moby Dick, Gordon Gekko, Freaks, James Bond, Willy Wonka and others. The movie had a cluster F-Bomb with 544 uses of the word. Some of them seem natural; while other seem oddly place. This film has the record for the most uses of the word in a fiction film. The movie is 3 hours long with its pacing. You can't really tell, with the pacing, due to not a lot of slow scenes. Still, there were few gags did go on way too much. You can cut the movie to 1hr and 30 minutes, and get the same results. I was deeply surprised, that this movie wasn't NC-17 with its strong sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language throughout, and for some violence. It's one of the movies that should be. Overall: Well-made movie that was kinda offended, but still watchable."

","Okay, I did laugh a few times. And some of the settings were nice.<br/><br/>The problems in society practically beg for movies to shed light on the excesses that occur in the financial sector. And given the money, the life style, the extremes, it should be low hanging fruit for Hollywood to exploit artistically. This has been a problem since 1980s, made more intensely urgent by the collapse of 2008 and the bludgeoning of tens of millions of livelihoods around the globe, while the bailout for Wall Street took only 3 days for Congress to cut out. Despite the need and opportunity, the intensity on capturing the excesses and the problems is not being successfully dealt with by Hollywood.<br/><br/>I saw strong ratings for this movie so I couldn't wait to go see it. I had hoped that we had a movie that nailed it on Wall Street current generation. Not really in this piece.<br/><br/>Okay my spoiler: <br/><br/>Overall, I though I saw this movie before, ""Goodfellows."" By following the same basic story arc, it undermines, in my mind, the quality of this piece, but also, I don't think I'll appreciate the quality I thought I saw in ""Goodfellows"" again. Its just a story about a guy dazzled by a morally inferior but materially superior life, gets sucked into the vortex of it and then over indulges until reality catches up.<br/><br/>(I really don't consider that to be a spoiler. You knew this story was going to be something like this before seeing, didn't you?)<br/><br/>Part of this, I think, is the biographical nature of the plot. Biographies usually are disappointing to me. DeCaprio has done his share, so me must like them, but they aren't really an entertaining plot line. I didn't really like ""Citizen Kane"", perhaps the all time favorite of critics, which has basically the same story arch of this film. Maybe Patton was the best (most entertaining) pure (based upon a real person) biography, though in my mind the best movie that uses a biography arc is ""Its a Wonderful Life"" because we can see, (even feel), the growth and change in character's formation, and it is entertaining. I've always enjoyed ""Goodfellows"" but have thought of it as sort of a docu-drama on real world mafia that merely borrowed the biography plot line.<br/><br/>(Perhaps more spoilage) Also, this movie could have been cut into half the length. Here we have a guy who wants to be a stock broker because he wants to make money that's the beginning. He stumbles into the idea of pushing penny stocks. Then we have him selling his troops on it (with noted no concern for the clients), then partying (to extreme), then increasing prosperity, then declining personal life, then repeat. In this case, repeat over and over and over again.<br/><br/>The actors in this movie helped convince me how much better the actors were in Goodfellows. Basically I never believed these guys, at least like I believed the guys in Goodfellows.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we haven't had a good Wall Street movie since Oliver Stone did the original. (Unfortunately, Stone made two of the best movies ever, in the 1980s, Wall Street and Platoon, and hasn't done anything since. Wall Street II was good, I really liked watching it, but it was pedestrian compared to the original).<br/><br/>I'd watch this movie after it goes to HBO or some other cable. I'd also prefer it to be half the length. Once you see one pump up speech to the troops, one excessive party, and just a few scenes from his lifestyle, enough. Repeating that a half dozen times is boring.<br/><br/>In my mind, 4 stars is a great movie. 3 1/2 is almost great. 3 is worth paying to go to see in the theaters. 2 is worth seeing. I give this a 2 and a tenth. Its worth seeing if you have 3 hours to kill, but not worth paying to see. If you like watching Goodfellows every once in a while when it comes on Cable or renting it, I predict, you'll watch this one time, and then go back to watching Goodfellows when you feel like indulging in a Scorsese style film."

But I really regret having spent three hours on this movie because actually nothing happens. The movie is filled with very well acted scenes but that is all. It seems like one action takes hours - the expected climax never comes. The pointed out actions are also meaningless for the development of the story - they are just pointed out because... ? maybe because they are obscene. But that is all the movie gives you: an obscene junk of something, where you wait for the tragedy to start. But at the end there is only well acting actors and a huge black hole of nothing."
"lennythewicked","1","40","86","1 January 2014"," Misogynistic, Ableist, Racist, and apologist.
","I'm going to come right out and say I did not finish the movie. The fact that the main characters are portrayed as people to be exalted is absolutely disgusting - especially given that the titular ""Wolf of Wallstreet"" robbed his own daughter repeatedly. Belfort left his teenaged daughters thousands of dollars in debt by laundering money in their names.<br/><br/>I'm guessing that wasn't seen as important to the writers of this movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a seizure-inducing parade of hyper-fetishized women, shameless drug use (which is heavily glorified, even within the context that these guys are bad people), ableist slurs (at one point a character says if they had a ""retarded"" child due to an incestuous relationship, they would just send it to an institution, and the movie opens with a ""midget-throwing"" contest).<br/><br/>Even though the heroes of this story (as there was no possible way to interpret them as villains except for conscious disgust with the writers) are eventually caught, it is far overshadowed by the hours of cocaine-snorting whoring villain protagonists and the high life they appear to be leading.<br/><br/>While I understand that movies with scantily-clad sex objects (as the women are reduced to for the purpose of this film) tend to rate highly at the box office (and apparently on IMDb), this film claims to take from real life.<br/><br/>When a movie supposedly follows real events, I expect them to be real, not glamorized for the sake of saving a con-artist's reputation (which ought to be so befouled no amount of name changes or money could redeem).<br/><br/>This movie is absolutely revolting and shame on anyone who reviewed it as otherwise."

","Hollywood liberals take their best swipe at Wall Street liberals. Still, the old saw applies: you have to be one to know one. Is there really a clean end of a turd called art? I am no prude, still this rendition of the depravity of Hollywood excesses, projected into the Wall Street excesses leaves one feeling violated. The audience laughed, because it was reviled to an extreme, so that the laugh was preferable to vomiting. Try as you will, you cannot roll in manure and come up clean. Most people recognize that depraved behavior in the end is destructive, to self and society. Why spend hours examining excrement? Is the critical merit ascribed by critics and users alike, that the movie is so repulsively done that it makes it art? By Hollywood standards, it seems so. The movie actually did what the characters did, it stole from viewers for its own excesses, to make money and achieve notoriety. They tried to portray filth without becoming filthy themselves. That's an illusion. How sad a commentary on an aging director, and a failing industry. Yet we the public eat ""it"" (this crap) up. What a sad commentary on us. This movie is beyond tragic."

","I don't know where to start on this film. I guess I can start on the degenerates who play in the movie.<br/><br/>1. Jordan Belfort: A delusional character who apparently spends too much time snorting ""white-girl"" (Cocaine), partying and having sexual intercourse.<br/><br/>2. Max Belfort: Remember that angry guy in the movie who said ""f*ck"" or ""f*cking"" every sentence and always yelled? Whelp... that was him.<br/><br/>3. Naomi: The gold-digger wife who OBVIOUSLY married Jordan for his money and acted like a street sl*t. But hey.. I guess that's what happens when you're rich.<br/><br/>4. Donnie: The fat-ass who almost choked on ONE piece of pepperoni in the film and had his genitalia out half way in the movie.. which I did not want to see.<br/><br/>5. That mentor from the beginning: Remember the guy who created the weird African Zulu chant and people in the cinema found it funny for no reason? Well that was him, the guy who only had 5 minutes of screen play in the movie and was no where near involved after Jordan's success.<br/><br/>6. Brad: The one Jewish guy who had that necklace with Hebrew writing on it, seemed like an asshole but I got to say Brad and the FBI agent are probably the coolest realistic people in this entire film.<br/><br/>7. Sh*t. Nevermind. I feel like if I talk about the rest of the cast, i'll contract Ammonia.<br/><br/>Okay, so in the film we start off with the mentor, he mentors Jordan, gives him tips. Etc etc. But guess what?! Can't have success yet without a nude scene or parties!<br/><br/>Next we get to see how Jordan got to the top and started off his street- broker business. Oh wait! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! You can't show that until we see another anonymous nude scene along with some obnoxiously out-casted characters.<br/><br/>Then we get to the point, hell, I can't even remember parts of the movie because I fell asleep once then woke up. But anyways, we get to scenes where the FBI are on him, and he's scamming people through the phone.. but wait.. isn't this movie supposed to show HOW he done this? HELLO? The side-effects of the victims that got scammed? It just seemed to be more of an entertainment film rather than explaining what really happened.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, I forgot. There's also 1 Asian guy in the film, he was pretty dope.<br/><br/>Alright! The movie has end- WHAT? IT'S STILL GOING? MY LEGS... I CAN'T FEEL THEM! (30 Minutes later): I can feel my sweat inside my shirt.. deodorant did not do it's job... If I don't make it out of this hell-hole, please tell my mother that I love her... (1 hour later): My head is officially frozen. I feel like if I turn my neck or something I will pop a blood vessel. Or my eyes will fall down. (1 hour and a half later): Finally the movie is almost done.. but there's a scene! There's a scene of GAY MEN HAVING SEX WITH EACH OTHER! I ain't homophobic or anything.. but when you infringe MY life with that stuff... I highly need to do a Virginia Tech. school shooting! F*ck it, more like that guy who wore that Batman outfit and shot up the theater.<br/><br/>Then we get to the scene where they are in Italy, then they need to get to Morocco. They take the yacht there and end up surviving somehow over 10 story-tsunami's and flying planes that love to blow up in the Atlantic ocean. (I feel like a child created this script from his every- Monday journal.)<br/><br/>Then we have scenes which aren't funny at ALL come in. The scene where we have Jordan slide his body on the ground to his car for popping too much ""Lemons"". I got to say there was probably 20 minutes spent on such a ridiculous scene.<br/><br/>I got to say that this had to be not really a realistic film of crime.. but rather an entertainment life of what happened to him.<br/><br/>I was expecting NO action, which I got! But.. I wanted to see it in more of a mob-criminal way. (Like how Brad did business) Or something out of The Wire, The Sopranos type of thing. But I can't discount the film on that. I just felt like it needed more ways of showing HOW he scammed people and what their reactions were rather than seeing his ""love-life"" and probably around 12 HUGE parties in the movie.. I AM NOT KIDDING! Oh don't forget the random threats/jokes towards physically damaged kids who are ""slow"" if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Anyways, this film sucked. It was TOO long for such little shown on the business. Too much gay scenes, parties and nude women.<br/><br/>This movie was so bad that I think barf-bags should have had a dispenser on your way out so you can puke it all out and re-think your life or stuff like what you're going to eat for dinner."

","This movie is set in the 80's and is full of the worst of that decade; drugs, drugs, and more drugs, sex and greed. This should have been rated NC17 or X. Although, those ratings are never used today. No one under 17 should be admitted to this film. I have seen less sex in porn movies. The acting is top notch. Leo is at the top of his game BUT the excesses in this film made it difficult and uncomfortable to watch. There are a few scenes that are hilarious. But the whole premise that drugs are the way of life for this character is ridiculous. I have talked to other parents that made the mistake of taking their teenagers to this film only to say that they agreed this is not a movie for anyone other then adults. Wait for the DVD. Do not watch it with anyone other then adults!"

"lorraineesimpson","5","5","7","20 July 2015"," Too much in general .....
","The big problem with this movie is that it tells the story of a real-life, self-indulgent, amoral lowlife and the people dumb enough to be swept along by him, and it is, by all accounts, a pretty accurate portrayal of events. Consequently the viewer is ""treated"" to too much swearing, too much sex, too much drug-taking, too much teen boy humour ... and to cap it all, the film is too long. <br/><br/>There are good bits about it. The acting is generally good and DiCaprio is great in the lead role. I always think he does dissolute, self-destructive characters much better than the more lightweight ones he often plays. It is mildly amusing in parts, and the soundtrack is also good. I guess it should also score points for accuracy - unfortunately!<br/><br/>I suppose what it lacks is balance and morality. There was no portrayal of, or meaningful reference to, the victims in all this - the people who were conned by this guy and his business. I suppose it's also pretty unsatisfying in that it's not like the guy really got what was coming to him. A bit of jail-time and now I believe he's some sort of motivational speaker or whatever. I would have liked to see him suffer a bit more. So in some ways it's a celebration of getting away with it which is maybe why I find it a bit distasteful, but to be fair it's just a movie which is showing things they way they happened. <br/><br/>I didn't hate it but I didn't particularly enjoy it either and I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was just too much of everything, the swearing became tedious, the sex was incredibly unsexy, and the drug-taking just got boring. It just goes to show that too much of anything really IS a bad thing. Despite liking some aspects I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher than 5, and DiCaprio's performance probably accounted for 4 of those stars. There is absolutely no way it deserves the 8+ it's currently got on IMDb. That's Goodfellas territory and this movie doesn't even come close I'm afraid."
"veggieboycraig","1","5","7","17 April 2015"," Didn't deserve any of the acclaim it got
","This movie is comparable to a project x, or other teenage party flick. I am appalled that my generation, the generation of the future, considers this movie more deserving than the brilliant masterpiece, ""12 Years a Slave"". There are some films that can be riddled with profanity and still be great (case and point: ACTUAL Scorssese masterpieces such as ""Raging Bull"" and ""The Departed""), but that profanity isn't what's great about the movie as is the case with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". This movie is filled with nudity and drug and alcohol use as are the popular movies with my acquaintances today, however, those movies don't deserve Best Picture nominations, and they don't receive them. Just because this movie is set against the backdrop of Wall Street corruption, doesn't mean it deserves anything. There are great movies about Wall Street, such as ""Wall Street"", but this movie is a sorry excuse for an Oscar nominee. As for the acting, DiCaprio and Hill have done much better. The best acting job of the year for DiCaprio was as Jay Gatsby in ""The Great Gatsby"", and although that film was plagued by many of the same problems as ""Wolf"" (too much partying and modernization) and was, much like ""Wolf"" bogged down by the societal need for action that has lead to a detriment of the art of film, DiCaprio gave a performance that was superior to Robert Redfords in the 1970s version. Mr Hill has showed us that he can make the transition to serious actor, as he did in "" Moneyball"", this performance is more comparable to his performances in ""This is the End"" and ""21 Jump Street"", as those are the same quality as this film. Altogether this film is just a stupid party promiscuity drug film set against a ""serious"" backdrop. Scorssese, DiCaprio, and Hill have all done MUCH better, and hopefully will do better in the future. Don't waste your time."

It added absolutely nothing to the movie. It was in very bad taste and completely unnecessary. I cringed for any in the audience who had a family member with cerebral palsy.

","Plot: 5/10. Average. That same story has been told, written and recorded 1000 times before but with different characters. Most of the times the outcome is better than 'Wolf': A struggling mid-class Average Joe dives into illegal games in order to escape his financial shackles, at first he seems successful, then he succumbs into excess an debauchery and finally he gets caught by his own game and ends up in jail. Better examples of this exact same plot are: 'Scarface' (1983), 'Carlito's Way' (1993), 'Blow' (2001), 'The Queen of Versailles' (2012) and even DiCaprio's 'Catch me if You Can' (2002).<br/><br/>Narration: 3/10. Bad. The story was on speed while the visual narration was choppy. Dialogues constantly crashed into each other or into shopped down scenes that played some kind of nonsense 'strobber' action. The story was too long, to discontinuous, full of unnecessary details and lacking essential info about the characters, their personal life and theirs business. The constant soft-porn and drug scenes added nothing to the story (but the girls where actually cute). Leo's (Jordan's) off-voice narration was totally expendable. The visual narration of this film may serve young directors as a catalog of all of Hollywood's clichés in a single film.<br/><br/>Sound: 5/10. Average. While the music score was great, the audio mixing and the dialogs where terrible. The constant breaking, hitting, crashing and thrashing along with the excessive screaming followed or preceded by whisperings have a very unbalanced outcome in the audio levels.<br/><br/>Characters: 5/10. Average. I generally like Leonardo's acting and what it ads to the films but in this case not.. Probably the shallowness of his character didn't help him because there are no real insights into his internal emotions and sufferings. In general, the characters in this film have no evolution, they are the same at the end as they where when they first appeared and it is safe to say that there really is no other important character other than Jordan, it feels like all of the others are fillers.<br/><br/>After all it is not that funny, not that great and not that bad... just below average and in my opinion anything below average is bad.

"miapinkstaff","1","30","63","28 December 2013"," Wolf On Wall Street- Most vulgar and distasteful movie.
","As a 16 year old, I have never been so taken back and mortified by something as simple a movie. I went to see this movie last night with my mom, and even bought tickets online so we could beat the lines. The previews displayed a fun, maybe action filled, interesting movie, and Leonardo is one of my favorite actors, so we had to go. One of the first scenes in the movie shows Leo and a woman in bed, naked and using drugs. After seeing that scene I was a little hesitant on whether or not the rest of the movie was going to be better or not. Despite the vulgar and disturbing scenes we sat through hoping for a turn around. In between the unnecessary sex scenes, and promotion of drugs, Leo is a stock broker trying to make it big on Wall Street. The main point of this movie is the unrealistic promotion of drug use and the complete opposite of the truth in showing that drugs will not only benefit your life, but will give you the ability to make loads of money. In all of my years, I have never walked out of a movie, making The Wolf on Wall Street the first. Once I walked out I immediately realized that even though I looked away in most of the sex scenes, I should not have seen those images. Sitting through the movie was sad, and most of all extremely embarrassing. If you are a mom or a dad thinking that this movie is going to be a fun getaway for you and your child to enjoy together, it is NOT. DO NOT TAKE YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER TO SEE THIS. It is sad that children have the opportunity to see this movie, and have those images pressed into their minds. If you have any common sense do not see this movie."
"TxMike","Null","9","15","4 May 2014"," A very well made movie of a terrible group of stock traders.
","There are many noteworthy days in the history of Wall Street and the stock market, and the one featured here is ""Black Monday"", October 19, 1987, when the market dropped about 1/3rd. Jordan Belfort was a young man of about 25, had just started a new job on Wall Street, and this event put him out of work. It turned out to be the catalyst for the subject of this movie.<br/><br/>Belfort found a job as a trader with a motley band of guys who focused on so-called ""penny stocks"", very small mostly unknown companies selling for generally less than one dollar per share, often for only a few cents. He was puzzled, why worry about these. Because, he learned, the commission was great, 50% of the sales total and getting a few investors to buy $5000 to $10,000 worth would generate a very handsome income. Plus the operation of such trading was scarcely regulated, if at all in the 1980s.<br/><br/>So filled with the euphoria of big profits Belfort rented a garage and started his own trading company with his own motley crew and trained them well. But what they did was illegal, where a large number of traders each buy parcels of a penny stock to drive up the price, then dumping them. They get the profits from both hefty commission and artificially inflated stock prices, while the investors get taken. <br/><br/>This and other irregularities resulted in Belfort being convicted and sent to prison, but his term was shortened by his cooperation with the FBI. So this movie is about those 6 or 7 years where he was expanding his trading operation making himself and his traders wealthy by playing very loose with the rules. And living immersed deeply in the drug and sex culture. It mostly comes across as a dark comedy.<br/><br/>Belfort himself says the drugs and sex shown in the movie, including sex parties at work or on the yacht, and the pervasive foul language, are not exaggerated at all. Maybe so, but to me it was way overdone for what turns out to be a mainstream movie with an A-list director. I am all for accuracy but it would have been a much better movie if they had moderated the filth quite a bit. That part disappointed me, that Hollywood continues to get so raw and less entertaining. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is really good as Jordan Belfort, arguably his best performance so far, and to me he deserved the Oscar for best actor. Also superb is Jonah Hill as his foul buddy, Donnie Azoff. Margot Robbie is lovely as his second wife, Naomi. And also superb is the actual Oscar winner, in another movie, Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna, Belfort's early boss who explains to him what the trading business is really all about, they don't care about the clients, and whether they make money on investments. The traders get commission, their job is to keep the buying and selling going.<br/><br/>Although this is based on a real person and his own story, many of the characters and events are fictional."
"i_ianchev","8","9","15","18 January 2014"," I have recently watched ""The Wolf of Wallstreet"" and I'd like to share a few thoughts about this movie with you
","Since many critics emphasize on the overall quality of the movie and the artistry invested in it (no doubt about that), I'd like to write about three special moments in this movie which made my day.<br/><br/>So behold – SPOILERS are coming!<br/><br/>Are you still with me? Good.<br/><br/>1. The speeches at the ""Stratton Oakmont"" office.<br/><br/>There is such an evangelical preaching power beaming from these sequences that even I as a reasonable man feel compelled by the egoistic nature of these motivational statements. Without a single doubt I can say that they represent both the best and the worst sides of the capitalistic culture. We can clearly see how a man can grow wild because of his ego, greed and lust. But without a single doubt I can agree with the director Scorsese that if you show the true nature of things in a comedic-sarcastic manner in the 21st century, you can only benefit from that. And what a performance from Di Caprio. Hands down<br/><br/>2. First meeting between Belfort and FBI agent Denham on Belfort's boat.<br/><br/>A very aggressive episode in which the viewer can see how the internal tension builds up and blows out between two strong characters. Although pride is the main reason for this wonderfully played confrontation, I can see again the competitive elements of the American culture clash between the two symbols of this adventurous society. Indeed this is a very important nodus in the story.<br/><br/>3. The ""crawling"" episode when Belfort is trying to stop his buddy Azoff from making a call from his home and the ludicrous fight between them on the floor.<br/><br/>This whole scene is exploring the limits of human will to overcome whatever obstacle there is in the name of self preservation. The play is so real that I thought for a moment that Di Caprio and Jonah Hill have experience with such situations (I guess celebrities' life isn't easier than the lifestyle of the main character of this movie). This whole episode is so controversial that I was wondering if I should laugh or cry about it. And after all I chose to laugh.<br/><br/>""The Wolf of Wallstreet"" is a movie full of obscene content and crazy role playing. The director Scorsese is a bold and adventurous young soul (as always) and I admire him for that. We can all follow his example in our artwork.<br/><br/>I guess that most of the people with moral values will condemn this film in a particular way. But it's expected and it's okay. And even though this movie is not THE best film of 2013, to me it has one of the best (if not the best) cinematic incarnations. There are scenes which are truly ""creme de la creme"". Profit and Ego are evident sins, but we all have them, so why moralize on this movie instead of just enjoy its merits and remember the morals at the end. <br/><br/>Yes, we know it is bad to make a movie about these fellas (real life assholes), but as a part of our generation we can't stop cheering at all the wrong moments :)"

","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is about the rise and fall of one Jordan Belfort, a fast-talking con man selling penny stocks to unsuspecting clients to earn that whopping 50% commission, until he built up a financial empire with simply too much money than they know what to do with. Jordan and his cohorts, led by the loud and obnoxious Donnie Azoff, lead a life of unbridled debauchery, until the arms of the law finally catch up with them.<br/><br/>While this film seemed like it was celebrating the crime Belfort was perpetrating, director Martin Scorsese told it in a very frenetic and entertaining way. The structure of the film was odd though, as the first two hours plus was about the wild lifestyle Belfort had in the lap of luxury, but only the last 40 minutes or so was about his inevitable fall and retribution. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio summons again his inimitable charm and charisma we saw before in ""Catch Me If You Can"" to higher stakes criminal activity as Belfort. Leonardo amped up his millionaire characters in ""The Aviator"" and ""The Great Gatsby"", giving everything he had for this role and his burning passion that oozes through the screen. He has this hilarious sequence when he had a catatonic fit after taking a strong drug, never knew Leo was capable of such physical comedy.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill playing Belfort's reckless partner Donnie with rabid perversity, like ""This Is The End"" goes to New York high society. He has excellent chemistry with DiCaprio. The classy, beautiful and sexy Margot Robbie plays Naomi, the hot socialite who swept Belfort off his feet. <br/><br/>In smaller but still notable roles were Matthew McConaughey with a very short stint as Belfort's first Wall Street mentor, Rob Reiner as Belfort's prudent father, Jean Dujardin as Belfort's European contact and Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent who wanted to bring Belfort down at all costs.<br/><br/>After the first one and half hours of the over-the-top excessively obscene lifestyle Jordan and pals live, you will feel that all of this depiction of debauchery is kind of getting too repetitive and long for comfort. There will be scenes of sexual orgies of all kinds to the point of misogyny. There will be multiple scenes of almost everybody taking drugs and all the wild effects. Your ears will feel numbed with all the foul language that was integrated in seemingly every one of their sentences. <br/><br/>However, the pedigree of the people behind this film, Scorsese and DiCaprio, the brilliant cinematography and opulent production design, all remind us that this is still an A-list project, not some raunchy blue movie drowning in kilos of cocaine and naked prostitutes. <br/><br/>I just think the first two hours felt like they could have been shortened without significantly affecting the plot. It could have lost some of the excessive scenes of excess. We got the point already. 7/10."

Put together by the publisher/pornographer Bob Guccione, the graphic and elaborate orgies in ""Caligula"" featured A-list talent: Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, and Helen Mirren. One difference separating these two cinematic debaucheries - upon release everyone connected with the film disavowed it, and Gore Vidal, after seeing it, sued to have his name taken off it. (He wrote the original screenplay.) It seems everyone connected with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is standing proudly by it. Many better critiques of capitalism have been made about selling out. Just a few: ""The Devil's Advocate"", ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", ""The Boiler Room"", ""The Social Network', ""Wall Street"", ""Trading Places"", ""Risky Business"" and ""Blow"". And then there's the incomparable ""O Lucky Man!"" by Lindsay Anderson, another allegory about the pitfalls of capitalism. And oddly enough, it stars the star of ""Caligula"", Malcolm McDowell. And Helen Mirren too. Inspired by ""Candide"", McDowell's character, Mick Travis, experiences a moral revelation at the end. (As does Kevin Lomax in ""The Devil's Advocate"".) Jordan Belfort?

It's just an endless display of ""funny"" (was it really?) scenes where the main characters display their excesses and appetite for luxury.<br/><br/>By the second hour of Leo getting drugged I was completely fed up with itat least these kind of teen/party/drug funny movies are short and give no higher expectations <br/><br/>I was really expecting more of Leo and especially more of Scorsese..."
"tomgillespie2002","8","14","26","19 January 2014"," 3 hours of utter depravity. And it's hilarious.
","Boasting the fifth collaboration between lauded director Martin Scorsese and can-do-no-wrong A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street signals the moment the two finally took the step over the brink. Their previous films together - Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010) - were all solid, if hardly groundbreaking works. With The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese seems to have let go of his reservations and embraced the daring, X- rated innovations of his 70's and early 80's work, and DiCaprio deserves to look smug after giving his finest performance to date. From the opening shot of DiCaprio snorting cocaine from between a prostitute's open legs, this is 3 hours of utter depravity. And it's hilarious.<br/><br/>Shortly after being taught the ways of excess and cocaine by his Wall Street boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), young stockbroker Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) finds himself out of work following Black Monday. When he takes a boiler room job at a stockbroker's dealing in penny stocks, he learns that commission for these stocks are 50%. Soon enough he is making money hand over fist, setting up his own company, Stratton Oakmont, along with his dentally-challenged follower Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). He recruits some of Donnie's marijuana-dealing friends and teaches them a script designed to sell, but ultimately the operation is a pump and dump scam. He is labelled The Wolf of Wall Street in a negative magazine article, yet this propels him to cult fame, and soon has flocks of eager young Gordon Gekko's begging for a piece of the pie.<br/><br/>At one minute shy of 3 hours, the film could certainly do with a trim. Yet Scorsese and DiCaprio's obvious fascination with this anti-hero means that we are treated to experiencing every juvenile and ridiculous second of Belfort's rise to Wall Street superstardom. We get flights with on-board orgies and drug taking, Jonah Hill masturbating in the middle of a crowded party at the sight of Belfort's future wife Naomi (the stunning Margot Robbie), dwarf-tossing, and Belfort taking helicopter lessons whilst drugged off his face. This is certainly dangerous territory - the film could easily slip into a celebration of frat-house antics, which is kind of does, but Scorsese keep the insanity levels at such a height that it's hard not to just laugh and shake your head.<br/><br/>A lot of it is down to the performances of DiCaprio and Hill, the latter of whom is proving to be a damn fine actor beneath that Jew-fro and obnoxious mannerisms. The film's highlight focuses on a botched scheme to smuggle $2 million dollars via Brad (Jon Bernthal) to reptilian French banker Jean (Jean Dujardin). Having learned that FBI agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) has his phones tapped, Belfort must get home to warn Donnie to get off the phone. The only problem is, they've taken a large quantity of Qualuudes. Thinking that years of indulgence have caused a tolerance to build up, the expired best before date have simply lead to a delayed reaction. Belfort suffers from what he describes as 'the cerebral palsy stage', flailing around on the floor without control of his limbs or his speech. His long journey home is the most laugh-out- loud example of drug-fuelled ineptitude since the ether scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998).<br/><br/>Of course, the film's morals are questionable, and Scorsese has suffered the same narrow-minded criticism he did from his 'glamorisation' of the mob in Goodfellas (1990). Yet I like to think that Scorsese trusts and respects his audience enough to allow them to think for themselves, to get a laugh from the on-screen antics whilst understanding that this is not the behaviour of a sane or ethical individual. Refreshingly, the movie stays away from any moral preaching or underlying messages, and simply tells a story because it's entertaining. Although it doesn't quite justify it's 3 hour running time, this is the most fun I've had watching a comedy for a long time, and proves that there's plenty of life in Scorsese yet.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

"eacademyus","1","6","9","1 May 2016"," Disgusting Saudi-funded movie with little artistic value that leaves you in a dark place
","I must say I am becoming tired of freak show Martin Scorsese who, like Germany's Werner Herzog or Quentin Tarantino, is a repugnant movie-maker on a drug-fueled psychological black-holes of perversion in need of deep therapy rather than funding to create ""art"".<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street describes the real life of a small-time cheap criminal, Jordan Belfort, in his ""career"" as a stockbroker (telesales man) in New York City. Belfort's firm Stratton Oakmont made millions not by any skill or knowledge, but by criminality in a rampant corrupt fraud on Wall Street that ultimately led to his downfall. In 1999, Belford pleaded guilty to fraud and related crimes in Stratton Oakmont functioned as a boiler room that marketed penny stocks and defrauded investors with the ""pump and dump"" type of stock sales. This man cheated millions out of people's income and is now made into some kind of hero by Martin Scorsese. Belfort spent only 22 months in prison for his scams as part of an agreement under which he basically threw the people he had trained under the bus to take the blame for his own crimes.<br/><br/>Marking the fifth collaboration between master filmmaker Martin Scorsese and leading man Leaonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street is nothing less than a nightmarish portrait of the face behind greed culture, which manages to disgust, nauseate, offend and outright terrify – often all at once.<br/><br/>Even during the most disgustingly raunchy or absurdly bizarre sequences in the film (see: those soon-to-be-infamous quaaludes scenes), there is some sort of visual or auditory evidence that this is all being done with clear purpose and intent. This film pushes things way past the point of decency – past the point of envy or admiration but never believability – and that's the entire point of the commentary.<br/><br/>For some reason Leonardo DiCrapio's acting is being hailed as the best of his career. Well, that should tell us what his other acting skills are then. This is not acting skills. This is basically a camera left running to follow a moral abyss of venereal disease around at a drunken frat party.<br/><br/>This film like many of Scorsese's past ones, is a pointless display of soulless characters of little value. I would not be surprised if these characters, who seem quite similar in film after film, are just Martin Scorsese himself under different names and wrappings. This is not the work of a talent or genius: it's the mind of a freak.<br/><br/>The issue with ""directors"" like Scorsese is that they appear to be in a permanent place of suicidal depression and negativity to which they have to constantly pull their viewers into. You leave the film feeling very low, disgusted and pulled down. The Wolf of Wall Street is described as a black-comedy. Except there's nothing comical about it. It's really a marvel that this C-list director has managed to make a name for himself when there is so much genuine talent out there.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that the Government of Malaysia, through ""investments"" from Saudi Arabia, funded the film. Why would a government of a deeply conservative Sunni state fund a film that loves to promote America in such a negative and repugnant light? For those not familiar with Malaysia as a whole, the country is merging deep into Sunni-Wahhabi Islamic anti-America hate rhetoric. This film will certainly help them promote that kind of mindset within their country and beyond."

","'The Wolf of Wall Street' is the story of up and coming yuppie Jordan Belfort as he schemes his way to the top of the stock-broker game. It's safe to say, as entertaining as this movie seems, it really isn't.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is a legend in the directing business, but he falls short this time with the absurdity of this film. In no way am I intolerant of a hard R-Rated film, but this pushed it to a disgusting and uncomfortable level. The word 'F#%k' is used in close to damn near every sentence to a grand total of over 500 times. Clearly the script writers had an easy job writing dialogue where 80% of it is profanity.<br/><br/>In no way am I knowledgeable of the real Jordan Belfort, but DiCaprio's representation of him is way too exaggerated that it's borderline ridiculous. Even without reading the book, I'm 100% sure that the life of Jordan Belfort was in no way as bold-faced, wacky, exaggerated and goofy as it's represented in this film. DiCaprio does an okay job with his performance when it comes to the emotional and more direct scenes as Belfort, but it's buried under the crazy non-sense this film constantly bombards the audience with.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie plays Jordan's second wife Naomi, who's only purpose is being the 'sex object' and estranged wife. A woman who marries a man who cheats on his ex-wife (with you), is a sex and drug addict that runs a scheming business, deserves every bad thing that happens. Jonah Hill, rounds off the cast as Belfort's.....goofy sidekick Donnie......and that's it.<br/><br/>Scorsese fails on every level for a director of his capacity, making this film a huge miss for him. People are gonna like this film more than not, so DiCaprio will get an Oscar nomination for all the wrong reasons. This was a viewing experience that made me feel high on cocaine when it was over, but not in a good way. The film pushed itself and it's audience till it breaks with all the ridiculous profanity and erratic craziness that leaves you baffled and wondering: ""What the hell did I just see?""<br/><br/>So if you get a chance to see this film, don't take it."
"christhjian","3","6","9","15 July 2015"," Poorly presented recycled story about enormous greediness
","Wolf of Wall Street is one of those movies that should be great on paper. It has great director, great cast, even greater budget and based on seemingly interesting tale from real life. The clumsiness of this one, however, is almost unbearable.<br/><br/>The storyline follows the craziest years of the ""Wall Street Wolf"" named Jordan Belfort who starts to build his way up to the stock markets, starting from the so called penny business and ends up challenging the well established Wall Street stock companies. Much of this road happens to be illegal and almost exclusively amoral. It follows pretty much the classic route of these kind of movies - becoming successful and then slowly going crazy and ending up with the biggest mess.<br/><br/>OK, no doubt that we've seen something similar before. Probably the most similar fashion is known from the Scorcese's own Goodfellas and also, perhaps to even a bigger extent, from the Scarface. Mind you, this really isn't a point of criticism for me, because the two mentioned movies are really damn good as far as I'm concerned. The movie is extremely predictable though.<br/><br/>Also the Wolf of Wall Street's mafia relatives have the sense of tension from the first second - many people will be easily fascinated by the no good gangster life, but is it true about the stock brokers? Well? Of course not! Only thing interesting about it is the money and in the Wolf of Wall Street they made some. Well, pretty much actually. And spending it is something that would make people interested. Especially if it's something fancy, in your face or just illegal. This became the disguise of the mediocre script, non-existing character development and made the entire flick repetitive as hell.<br/><br/>The large part of the film showed coke snorting, pill swallowing, drinking and hookers. I'm not the one who has some moral dilemmas, but come on - enough is enough. For me this is one of the biggest problems of this one. Not only is this repetitive, but it also gave the feeling that the creators tried way too hard to shock the audience. This attempt became a flop pretty quickly though, but as said this probably disguises many of the weak points fairly well. At least the overall rating suggests that. The same can be said about the jokes which fell flat for the most part. These seemingly had shock value, but they just lack that something. Most dialogs in the movie are sloppy and end up nowhere. We could see some lines going on in the character's heads while in conversation. These were awful and amateurish for the most time as well, again considering what caliber the movie is supposed to have.<br/><br/>It takes special talent to make characters as one dimensional and unlikable. There was no one to bond with, no one to cheer for. The only small character development was with our main character, when he changed from a Wall Street freshman to an absolute douche. After that he and everybody surrounding him had only money, money, money in mind and cared for nothing and nobody. Well, Belfort played by DiCaprio did seem to be generous with his employees, but family for example didn't mean a thing for him. Almost three hours of non ending soulless malevolent hustling by the Belfort crew sure got on nerves.And there were at least four scenes where we were told how great such lifestyle was. The complete lack of the main characters moral was intended to be balanced by the father of Belfort, but the only thing he seemed to care about was the son's prostitute addiction. Drugs or illegal business was seemingly OK in daddy's eyes.<br/><br/>The illegal side of the whole Belfort's business should have been explained a little better as well. We saw DiCaprio explaining it quickly, but then canceled it by saying ""You don't care anyway."" or something like that. Another example of lazy writing. Right, let's watch some orgy instead. That fixes everything.<br/><br/>As critical as I've been, I'm going to say that the movie is not all terrible. Most of the jokes are rubbish, but few of these work nicely. As little as the actors had a chance to work with, most of the performances are good. I'm not too sure about this being DiCaprio's best role, but he put on a good show for sure. Also scenery is nice and seemingly flawless wherever the action is going on, but that shouldn't be too big of a surprise.<br/><br/>In the end this film remains a disappointment. What we have here is a recycled crime story that shows us bland Wall Street style hustling which is artificially ""spiced"" by the endless partying and sex scenes. This film offers nothing new or interesting. It is incredibly predictable and boring, additionally lacking any sort of character development or interesting plot twist. I just feel this movie was incredibly needless, at least the way it was served. Finally I'll have to admit that with all the hype surrounding it, I had actually really high expectations, but The Wolf of Wall Street failed to deliver."
"Monkey-D-Luffy","3","6","9","15 March 2015"," Don't cry because it happened, smile because it's over.
","One way of looking at this movie is to wonder if Jordan Belfort, played quite decently by DiCaprio, was right in his successful stint, and a loser in his downfall. If you're a human being, and you're not part of the richest 1% of the USA, you WILL feel jealous of Belfort. Even if you're a Buddhist Amish.<br/><br/>But that's okay because though I did envy Belfort's wealth, I was not green with jealousy, and I didn't feel jealous about his wife, played by the popular Margot Robbie, who I thought had a too stringy body with ropy arms. I'm content with the fact that at once time, a girl prettier than Robbie had a crush on me. And I also believe, that I eat better food than Belfort.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about Martin Scorsese. I loved Taxi Driver. His masterpiece. The Wolf of... is better than Raging Bulls, a movie that I happened to rate 4 stars here. That was under my old rating system. Nowadays if I have to re rate my movies watched, then I'd give Raging Bull 2 stars, just to make the comparative thing work.<br/><br/>Scorsese is behaving like a menopausal cozy mystery writer. He's churning the same movies, serially. He has nothing new to say, which is frightening, because there are quite many current, younger directors in Hollywood drawing inspiration from his movies. It's sobering to realize that right now, there are directors in America and abroad, taking these terrible movies and making an inferior shadow of them. My two cents! Hope you found this review useful."

And they will never change. And the justice system is screwed up. You could have showed us that in 5 minutes. Instead we get three hours of shallow, meaningless, repetitive, and most of all completely unfunny nothingness, with stock brokers screwing prostitutes and snorting cocaine. There is no depth here. This is nothing but cheap entertainment, and if you don't find something as shallow as what is portrayed as entertaining, then you'll be staring at your watch for three hours, wondering how time can pass so slowly.

","The Wolf Of Wall Street seems to be a story about a very smart man who cheats his way through the stock market, with a strong hint of mature and intellectual humor throughout the way. As he goes about his way, women take place in his life as well as bumps on his way to success. This is what the trailer depicts. In reality, the film was about a scumbag who has no morals whatsoever and a team of the same people that fake their way to get rich. The writers for this film must have been quite bored to come up with this ridiculous, dirty, 3 HOUR, waste of time movie. As for the director, (Marin Scorsese) the film had and odd feel the entire way through and transitions that just didn't work. The acting was fine for most of the characters, the two stars, DiCaprio & Hill did a decent enough job for themselves too.

","The film attracted conservative viewers by depicting a more moral tone in its marketing than the film itself depicted.Christina McDowell, daughter of Tom Prousalis (who worked closely with the real-life Belfort at Stratton Oakmont) wrote an open letter addressing Scorsese, DiCaprio, and Belfort himself, criticising the film for insufficiently portraying the victims of the financial crimes created by Stratton Oakmont, for disregarding the damage that was done to her family as a result of such, and for giving celebrity to persons (Belfort and his partners, including her father) who do not deserve it.The story ""wants us to be interested in characters who are dull people to start with, made duller by their delusions of being interesting because they are high.An irresponsible glorification rather than a satirical take-down.Ultimately hollow exercise in movie excess. Plays less as an insightful critique and more as an exercise in indulgence. There is no psychological insight, no moral insight, just no insight, full stop. And it palls after a while. It's sick and disturbing in all the wrong ways, rendering this 'Wolf' nothing but a dog.It's not OK to make three hours of graphic sex, epic drug binges, and general debauchery as boring as it is in The Wolf of Wall Street.As a major filmmaker, it's about time Scorsese found some material that stretched his ideas, rather than his audience's patience.As Johnny Rotten famously asked, ever get the feeling you've been cheated?I couldn't buy it, and couldn't wait for the hollow spectacle to end.The weakest movie in Martin Scorsese's fifty-year career, the worst writing Scorsese has ever been associated with.It's showy, but it doesn't amount to much.The characteristic traits build up, intolerably: the grinding pace, the deadening repetition, the pointless wordiness (Terence Winter's screenplay never shuts up), the self-congratulatory yuk-yuks.<br/><br/>Just watch Wall street 1987 , Glengarry Glenross , and Scarface better films and more realistic and far less glamorised."

"ericjams","6","17","33","25 December 2013"," Excessive in style, lacking in substance
","When the final cut spun in some back room, I wonder what Scorsese thought he had here, a comedy, a thriller, a drama. This movie has a little bit of everything, but the sum of its parts adds up to very little. Very little that we as movie goers have not already seen 100 times before and nothing that I necessarily needed to sit through 168 minutes to see again. <br/><br/>The lack of a conscience, the drive to make money at all costs, these are things we all already associate with Wall Street. So when Leo takes his messed up principles and quickly turns his smooth talking ways into millions of dollars, the audience says to itself, OK, now what? How will the story turn dark, how will the greed and booze catch up to these guys, because it always does, right. <br/><br/>Wrong. The plot here floats at the surface to allow the merry pranksters of Leo and Jonah Hill to basically do whatever it is they want throughout the entire movie. The parties and intoxication are normally something I love, its fun to watch people party and do drugs (at least for me). Here, the excess becomes tiresome, and that would be fine, if the film was intended to show the perils of excess. But that's not the intent, the negative effects of the drugs is touched upon, and as the plot slowly veers toward the end for our wild wall street bunch, the drugs naturally move the plot deeper down the rabbit hole, but its too much after awhile and thus the film becomes a caricature of itself. A comedic display of excess that the viewer may enjoy like an exaggerated drawing, but not something that has any staying power. <br/><br/>Scorsese may have realized this, so the plot meanders through FBI investigations, ship wrecks off the coast of Italy and Swiss Bank fraud. Its the classic example of throwing too much at the window and hoping something sticks. I found the plot to be unnecessarily bloated, I found the story to be largely superficial, and I found the actual direction to not be nearly as good as Scorsese's past films. <br/><br/>Leo and Jonah are fantastic, some of the bit actors are good, but there is no real story here. It's just a party with consequences that do not seem to bother the characters and therefore, never really create any tension in the narrative. Its an enjoyable film at best, a plodding, repetitive, shell of a movie at worst. You be the judge."

Sure there is an underlining message, that Wall Street brokers and bankers are soulless money hungry animals, but then we already knew that, and so there was really little need to nail that point in 5000 times in this movie. This sort of has a story, but it's mostly just people doing drugs, having crazy parties and showing the average IQ span of about 50, once again, like the American Pie movies, and when you do eventually find the story it's not that great, pretty much just ""guy cons people....gets rich....then gets caught.

Sure, some people might think that ""It's a Scorsese movie, you know what you're getting into,"" and for some people that's true, but there are people who don't research every movie they go to, and who feel they usually get enough information from a preview, or they decide to go spontaneously. More upbeat: the movie had some good irreverent humour.<br/><br/>At the rate of moral decay on screen, we will be watching porn on the big screen in just a few years now. My feeling on the matter is that I can stay at home and jerk off to porn for free, so why do I want to pay money to go see porn in the theatre."
"SteveMierzejewski","3","19","38","11 January 2014"," What the hell did I just watch?
","If you don't like what you see within the first 15 minutes of this film, turn it off or leave the theater, because that's what you will see repeated over and over again for the next three hours. Okay, I get it. There are people who will do anything for money and who are morally bankrupt. This is Hollywood meets soft porn when soft porn has already been killed off by one-click-accessible porn. I'm not a puritan. This is just an objective fact. We live in the Age of Pornography. I, therefore, don't understand why Scorsese thinks this is the 'shocking' lens he should use to educate us on the evils of Wall Street greed and excess, unless he hopes to drag in the teenage boy audience, in which case, it simply amounts to pandering. In the end, I felt that it was Scorsese himself who was morally bankrupt. I think it is time for him to reassess his career. No great film was ever made so by pandering to base instincts. Great films stand on the strength of fundamental truths about human nature that leave the viewer leaving the theater uplifted, inspired, or awakened to elements of human nature in some way. This does not mean all movies have to have happy endings. The knowledge one takes from a good film can force one to reassess their values or ideas and this can be a difficult experience. But there is nothing fundamentally challenging about this film. Even if you try to think of it as a sort of documentary, it falls flat.<br/><br/>Now, what about the acting? There is no doubt that Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor. However, I haven't been impressed by many of his recent efforts (i.e. Gatsby). In this film his character is one dimensional from beginning to end. There is no character development and no real opportunities for him to show his acting range. The same can be said for all the other actors, but given such an insipid script, what can you expect? After a couple of hours of watching Scorsese trying to educate us on the evils of wealth, I just wanted the film to end. He seemed to have an ax to grind in the tradition of other ax-grinders like Michael Moore and Oliver Stone. The last hour was simply an ordeal. Scenes seemed randomly cut and pasted together. Although I can't say there were not some interesting scenes within the film, they only served as sad reminders of Scorsese's wasted talent.<br/><br/>It makes no sense at all to me why this film is rated so highly. Maybe there are a number of people who were surprised to learn that excessive wealth can lead to bad behavior. All I learned is to be careful of giving too much credence to the ratings of any Scorsese film."
"Klinky2000","4","16","31","10 January 2014"," Excessive Scenes of Debauchery Highlight a Lack of Substance
","While the goal of this film was apparently to highlight the negative aspects of capitalism, it relies on scene after scene of sex and drug use to propel the story forward. Like the shallow characters portrayed, the movie has trouble finding meaning or a message.<br/><br/>Many of the negative consequences of Belfort's actions are cast into a ""funny"" light, while at the same time detail is placed into the explicit sex scenes and the highlighting of drug use in practically every other scene. It's very hard to see the movie viewing infidelity or excessive drug use in a negative light.<br/><br/>If Scorcese was trying to make a statement, then the movie should have had a strong message. Some will say that the movie should not force feed a message to the viewer, but I still think Scorcese could have tried a bit harder, especially if this movie was suppose to have an anti-Wall Street message. Instead it seems a collection of stories you would hear about from some fratboy's crazy times in college, i.e. something to be idolized and reminisced on, rather than highlighting a dark period in someone's life.<br/><br/>The real-life Belfort got millions of dollars for his life story and 100 million dollars was invested in making this movie. That alone suggests that society has given this scumbag more attention and wealth than he deserves. Was Scorcese trying to showcase the ills of Wall Street or the ills of Hollywood directors idolizing scumbags through vague storytelling and shock factor?"
"dbstoughto","1","24","50","30 December 2013"," Great Performance by Dicaprio But Bad Direction and Script
","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is one of the worst films of all time. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a super performance, but the script and direction are so flawed that it leaves one wishing that this story could have been told by a younger and more gifted director. In addition, it is way too long. Better editing would have made the film more tolerable. All in all, a waste of time and talent. Hopefully, Leonardo's next fill will do his talent justice. ""The Great Gatsby"" was much more worthy of his talent. It was obvious that the audience that I attended the film with were bored. There was a lot of fidgeting and people going to the restroom and concession stand. Not a good sign."

But I feel like I got the message about 45 minutes into the movie and it didn't go anywhere from there. In all fairness, I missed the last 20-30 minutes because I just couldn't take it anymore. Some ruthless cutting of the screenplay would have helped some, but I don't know if there's much to salvage. The experience of seeing this was rather like having a really stressful day at work where nothing actually gets accomplished. A lot of the ladies are beautiful, but the sex is ugly - demeaning to both women and men. Oh, but I guess it's really about Wall Street. And the motivational speeches to the troops go on forever. I don't think there was a scene in this film that employed any economy of storytelling whatsoever. One critic (approvingly) described this as the last half hour of Goodfellas stretched out to three hours and that's pretty true. It reminded me a bit of the single-mindedness of Raging Bull, but was much harder to sit through. I think it's a bad sign when you start hoping that some of the characters will die of an overdose just so they'll shut up."

","Rated R Post... within the first 5 minutes, Leonardo Dicaprio snorts cocaine off a hooker's ass. The rest of the movie is just as excessive. A spectacular orgy of excess: cocaine, Quaalude, materialism and full frontal female nudity. Check your morals and you might have a good time. But DEFINITELY NOT for everyone.<br/><br/>Scorcese directs in his usual High NRG style (like ""After Hours"" and ""The Color of Money"", the camera never stops moving.) DiCarpio goes all out with this character, making him human, though not heroic at all. These are awful people doing awful things, and the film might revel too much in that, without showing the consequences of it. <br/><br/>A definite GUY film, probably could complement with Pacino and DiPalma's ""Scarface""."
"ligonlaw","4","12","22","26 December 2013"," Nothing Exceeds like Excess
","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the story of a despicable piece of human slime called Jordan Belfort, a lying, cheating, alcoholic, drug-addicted, whore monger who happens to know how to con people out of their money. When his lips are moving, he is lying. His partners are less charming criminals Jordan handpicks because of their character flaws and lack of moral accountability. <br/><br/>The film devotes most of its time to the day-to-day chore of finding and using narcotics, wooing and banging prostitutes and how to dispose of vast amounts of stolen money in the most idiotic, wasteful ways possible. <br/><br/>Where ""Wall Street"" was somewhat plausible because insider trading is, in fact, a way to grab obscene amounts of unearned money, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is not a film which will satisfy the MBAs or the street-savvy viewers. Scorsese's film is self-indulgent on many levels. It is long, running about 3 hours. It is vapid, dealing only with style without substance. When the film gets a little slow, Scorsese throws in another orgy. Men banging whores. Men banging men. Men banging on airlines. Men getting blow jobs on elevators, in cars at their desks. Public sex, sex at work, sex in the toilet at work. This movie has an army of whores servicing a large number con men. <br/><br/>DeCaprio's Belfort is always humping someone. The drugged, drunken orgy continues for a long time. Jonah Hill, playing Donny Azoff, Belfort's business partner, dons some fake teeth and becomes the most annoying sidekick ever. He is every bit as drunk and sexually perverted as Belfort, but he is profoundly stupid. He is stultifying and sucks the oxygen out of every room he enters. As the film moves forward, you dread the sight of him.<br/><br/>With ""Mean Streets"" and ""Good Fellas,"" Scorsese provides a glimpse of the world of Italian gangsters. The films ring true. The stories feel authentic. Maybe Scorsese doesn't know enough about Wall Street to create a sense of authenticity. Wolf of Wall Street is disjointed; it changes tone, and it never finds its true voice. <br/><br/>The lead characters are nauseating, and there is hope that Kyle Chandler's FBI agent will bring balance to this film providing a dose of reality with gumshoe detective work, but that part of the story never fully develops. The story would have improved if we saw studies in contrast, like the ""French Connection,"" where the cops are poor and dedicated as they observe the massive benefits of the lawless life.<br/><br/>In the end, the orgy peters out. There are some unhappy vile people who get much more than they earned and much less justice than they deserved. Scorsese may be saying that this is how the world works. The cops take a pathetic plea agreement, and the con men blow up the world without paying much of a price for it. But Scorsese was seduced also. He could not take his eye off the whores, the drugs, the cars, the mansions and the glitz long enough to tell a story about money and Wall Street."

","Add ""Wolf of Wall Street"" to my list of LEAST favorite films of 2013. A shame, too, because it held such potential - but honestly, this is the first Scorsese film I've ever seen that actually bored me. Not only boring, but also filled with dull, 2-dimensional characters that I cared little or nothing about. I couldn't get out of the theater fast enough - even though I stayed through all three butt-numbing hours of meaningless, cliché-driven hyperbole.<br/><br/>And - can we finally give Leonardo DiCaprio an extended leave of absence from Hollywood? After 180 minutes of his over-the-top, scream-filled over-acting in this effort, I think I've had enough for quite a while. Jonah Hill's paper-thin two-dimensional character was rather disappointing too. But I'm not sure who to blame here - the script was probably as much at fault. That said, two cameos almost made up for the rest of the performances - Matthew McCaugnahey's eccentric broker (who was gone after the first 20 minutes, unfortunately) and Rob Reiner as DiCaprio's quirky father.<br/><br/>Sure, it had the usual stylistic flair of a Scorsese film, but it was almost like a film school student's homage to a Scorsese film. Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights was a better Scorsese film than Wolf of Wall Street.<br/><br/>Bottom line, save your money and rent (or re-watch) Wall Street - Oliver Stone's timeless classic still stands as the benchmark for the subject, even after 25 years.<br/><br/>I may have to go see another film soon as ""mental floss"" to get this one out of my head..."

About a half hour in, I lost interest in the shallow and manic characters and their clearly foreshadowed repetitive and unfunny trajectories. The sex, drugs and moral shallowness quickly turned to boredom and the minutes passed slowly. The only relief came as the credits started to roll! What was Mr. Scorsese thinking?

Has Hollywood become so distant from the rest of America that they think they have to tell us drugs, sex, and fraud are bad? On this epic scale?

"aaron1506","8","2","2","30 March 2020"," Stylish, funny and very entertaining
","The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas. It's stylish, funny and very entertaining.<br/><br/>Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street actually have a lot in common. For one, they share the same narrative arc: one film is about the rise and fall of Henry Hill, the other, Jordan Belfort. They also have a lot in common stylistically, such as tracking shots, freeze frames, narration and breaking of the fourth wall. Goodfellas is ultimately the better film, though - it has more depth and feels more grounded in reality.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives a brilliant performance, one of the best of his career. His portrayal of Belfort is larger-than-life, captivating, even terrifying at times. Consider, for example, the scene towards the end of the film in which Jordan punches Naomi and attempts to drive off with their daughter. It's one of the film's most powerful moments. The supporting cast is also strong, most notably Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, who both have great chemistry with DiCaprio. Matthew McConaughey only has a brief part, but it's certainly a memorable one at that.<br/><br/>There are so many scenes in The Wolf of Wall Street that could be singled out for praise. Belfort taking 15-year-old Quaaludes and entering the ""cerebral palsy"" phase is hilarious. Then there's Belfort's first time selling penny stocks. Belfort's attempt to bribe an FBI agent. The list goes on.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is great. The use of ""Mrs Robinson"" by The Lemonheads during the FBI raid on Stratton Oakmont is a particularly inspired choice.<br/><br/>Critics of The Wolf of Wall Street have accused it of glorifying Belfort, but such an accusation fails to appreciate that the film is satirical. The film's final scene is crucial to understanding its message. Belfort goes unpunished for his crimes. He continues to be idolised. His audience hangs onto his every word. Scorsese observes that this materialistic, get-rich-quick culture is precisely what gives rise to someone like Belfort."

"nagavedula","1","2","2","20 March 2018"," Scorsese and Dicaprio having too much fun
","This project started when Dicaprio outbid Brad Pitt to buy rights for the movie.
One of the main reasons he bought it was because Dicaprio felt he was perfect match for the role.Then he hired Terrence winter to write a script and Scorsese to direct.So this is basically a project Dicaprio wanted to make.
 The problem here is this movie is juggling lot of things.
1)Dicaprio doesnt want to loose his boxoffice appeal, so if the movie is made like a dark character study then it wouldnt make its budget back.
2)Its desire to portray debauchery on screen authentically using huge sums of money meant that there is lot of weight on it to make money back.
3)Oscars like winking devil like Daniel plainview from there will be blood...but they dont like pure evil like Ralph fiennes in schindlers list or Michael fassbender in 12 yrs slave..so they portrayed jordan belfort as this ambitious guy changed by the system felt kinda pandering.
4)Focus of story is on all the wrong areas...yes you can show boobs, sex, debauchery but at the same time you need a contrast element in the storyline to show the excess.
5) This might be the main thing..one group of fanbase you can always trust to show up time and again is young men between 12 and 30.....if you can tap into this demographic..they will show up time and again like MCU or DCEU. Dicaprio tapped into this fanbase somewhere around inception and django. So if he can make movies that this group enjoys then they will keep showing up and that age range is ready to idolize someone.The are just waiting for a idol figure.
 Key thing to appeal to them is play roles that are Macho,Rule breaker,Anti heroic,Dark,Brooding,,Leader of people,Filled with revenge aka brooding and roles like that.
 As long as you stick to those, this demographic will show up and Dicaprio is banking on it every single movie.He morphed this sleazy banker into those archetypes.
 So all these checkboxes are met in making this movie and we ended up with a dark comedic 21 jump street movie with a prestige picture kind of touch by a auteur director in scorsese.
 So we end up with a movie that spends way more time on excess to the point of making it look cool."

For example the scene where Jordan is too high to get to his car to leave the country club.I do not know how long that lasted, but did we need to watch every centimeter of his travel to the car? That is just one example. Had an editor done his or her job (I would guess Martin did the editing) it would have been much better.

The movie is filled with sex, drugs, money, games, drink, girls etc. but really nothing more! I know that this is the story of a guy whose life consists of such kind of activities, but the problem is that The Wolf of Wall Street is just a hilarious biopic, an entertaining popcorn flick, a dark comedy, an amusing adventure, but no more than that. This is a rise and fall story and during the whole movie, you don't feel bored. Comparing to Scorsese's old classics, this is just an ordinary movie. It doesn't feel like a Scorsese flick. The Big Short, American Hustle, American Made, this movie is in the same category. Some jokes, some scenes are amusing, but there is no emotion, thrill or an amazing piece of cinema feeling in this movie. Oliver Stone's Wall Street is a much, much better film, but I understand that this movie is for our generation and Scorsese adapts himself into this generic, formulaic storytelling instead of putting his one of a kind signature. Everyone with me at the theatre left satisfied and pleased except for me I guess. Jonah Hill does his part as a comedian, Di Caprio gives a hilarious performance, but not among the best (may I remind you The Revenant, The Departed, Django Unchained etc?), Matthew McConaughey steals all the scenes he is in, Margot Robbie plays a sexy housewife and in the end, this movie is considered to be a masterpiece!"

","I'm getting tired of Scorsese getting lauded just cos, hey man, it's Scorsese. This film was so excruciatingly mundane. I read in the ""Trivia"" section that there is a 4 hour cut somewhere. Christ. It's mostly improvised and you can tell as a lot of the actors are not capable improvisers. McConaughey is fine at it, as is Hill with his comedy background but the others? Pfft. DiCaprio just ends up chewing up the scenery and Robbie, god love her, tries her best but is usually overwhelmed by DiCaprio's voracious chewing. The problem with relying on improv to cover up your lack of a script is that you need a very very good editor, which Scorsese does not anymore. I also read in the""Trivia"" section that Scorsese said the editing was intentionally 'odd' to heighten scenes where the characters take drugs. Bullcrap. Maybe in a couple of instances, but the rest of the time the editing is just awful. Continuity mistakes all over the place, lazy use of still shots, and one scene where there was a dissolve transition literally in the middle of a shot. Wft? But the main problem with the editing is the instances where there wasn't any. Soooo many obviously improved scenes were made even more obvious by the inability of the editor to do their job and cut at the right time. I'm all on for long continuous shots but they have to be justified. This film was like a student film-maker wanting to leave in all the footage cos, huh huh, my mates, huh huh, they're hilarious, huh huh. You wouldn't think Schoonmaker has over 40 years of editing experience. Since Kundun her work has been steadily declining, Gangs of New York, The Departed and Hugo stand out as particularly badly edited in recent times. And this one joins the list. So, overall, this film is over long, over indulgent and over praised. Kind of like the main character, but not intentionally so."

","To many, 'Goodfellas' is Martin Scorcese's finest film. It's certainly well-constructed and entertaining, but it's arguably less nuanced and elusive than his earlier works. It's also better than anything he's made since. I liked 'Casino', but it was essentially the same movie in different clothes. And although he has made different (although generally inferior) movies since then, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is the same movie for a third time. But it's not a patch on it's two predecessors.<br/><br/>For one thing, at least Robert De Nero could act. Leonardo DiCaprio, who has replaced De Nero as Scorcese's go-to lead actor, cannot, and chews the scenery throughout most of this film. Secondly, like most people, you've probably wondered how the financial services industry manages to capture such a large proportion of our national outputs for itself. This film won't tell you. At least, it hints at some of the causes - pumping and dumping penny stocks, breaking the law and the use of a sales force highly motivated by greed. Yet there isn't a real explanation of how Jordan Belfort made his fortune from nowhere, nor indeed for the general significance of the role that Wall Street plays in all our lives. At times, DiCaprio starts to explain things directly to camera, but he rarely completes his expositions, brushing it off as boring details. Thirdly, as played by DiCaprio, Belfort comes across as a uniquely unlikable (and unrepentant) man. Fourthly, the whole rags-to-riches-to-rags again tale seems at times dangerously close to suggesting that a big house, a fast car, a blonde wife and a steady supply of hookers and drugs really are the keys to happiness - the only tragedy is that the life had to end. Finally, everything in the film seems over-the-top: not just DiCaprio's acting, but the language, the drug-taking, the nudity, even the dumb-ass special effects when the characters get stuck in a storm while at sea. This is not a movie that makes its points subtly. It's loud and long; and not a patch on the quixotic 'King of Comedy', the elegiac 'Raging Bull', the dark and fantastical 'Taxi Driver', and the other works that made Scorcese's reputation back when he still knew how to direct a film."
"Monknificent","6","2","2","5 September 2016"," 2001's Blow by way of 2000's Boiler Room
","I can't believe I'm about to say this about a Scorsese work, but this film was utterly UNNECESSARY. It was also predictable - OK, it was a true story, so not much you can do about that - except NOT MAKE THE FILM! This is the basic problem I have with it: it simply didn't need to be made. Why? Because it's ALREADY BEEN MADE. More than once. It's basically an uncannily blow-by-blow retelling of Blow, 2001's biopic of George Jung (a similarly ""right place at the right time"" true figure who changed everything in a massive business sector), merely replacing cocaine with stocks, cartels with brokerage firms, the DEA with the FBI, and Johnny Depp with Leonardo DiCaprio. Everything else is exactly the same, from the loser, unversed friends becoming ever slicker, to the fast success to the crazy excess, to the pretty wife, the huge, beautiful mansion and non-stop party lifestyle, to the later disastrous business decisions and the inevitable downfall and prison time, right down to the very young progeny (also a daughter) trapped in a situation she cannot yet understand, fought over by both parents. It's basically Blow mixed with Boiler Room (2000) mixed with Wall Street and a tiny bit of The Company Men (2010) and Too Big to Fail (2011) for the casual, irresponsible attitude to big financial moves with huge repercussions for many people (both the latter films are about the 2007- 2008 credit crisis), plus a fair bit of another Depp film, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) for some of the the drug madness, though Fear was a much more fun and interesting film. <br/><br/>Lest you think so, I did not mind the length of the film at all. I'm actually a fan of a film that takes its time to cover everything, if it's technically well made (which this was), and if the story bears it - which it sort of did, but as I said, the main problem is I've already seen this film half a dozen times, or at least 98% of its separate components, even before I sat down to watch it, so I was left utterly cold by it. The ONLY part I enjoyed in the entire film, hand on heart, was the scene where Belfort experiences the delayed effect of the ""super-'ludes"", that entire scene was very funny, his ""interactions"" with Donny in particular, and the reveal of what had actually happened to the Lambo on his short 1 mile return trip - incidentally, the only bit that I did not see coming. And that was pretty much IT! Oh, and if I had still been 14, I would have also gone a bit ga-ga over seeing the gorgeous Margot Robbie in her birthday suit. As it was, I still liked it, but even the fairly charged scene with the nanny-cam bear barely raised a twinge. Shame.<br/><br/>So, IF you have never seen Blow, Boiler Room, Wall Street and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, I can understand you being wowed or at least appreciating this film, BUT for all other people who watch a lot of films, who are over 30 and who follow the news, this film will have been a disappointment for the same reason it was a disappointment to me."

It was a great story, but it was told in such a choppy manner, some of the scenes were so over the top I felt like I was watching another Tucker Maxx movie. I was really hoping for more. Great acting (Rob Reiner deserved an Oscar nomination too)...OK movie...and it was WAY too long!!! I don't know how he did it, but Scorsese managed to drag this out for almost 3 full hours. He couldn't do a 3 hour version of Goodfellas or The Departed, but managed to extend the life of this for 3 hours? Again, I was really hoping for more."

","Where to begin with this one? There's no question that the events depicted are fascinating and that Scorsese is a superb director. There are actually a few laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled throughout this film. Still, the movie is three hours long and, at times, feels that way. I kept expecting it to end half hour before it actually did. As has been noted everywhere, there is absolutely no one to root for or like during this entire running time. However, the performances are all quite good. You don't see many Oscar contenders like Leo get nominated for a film in which a candle appears in his ass. On that note, so much of this film focuses on the extremely vulgar and extremely decedent living. That certainly was the point but is it possible to drive home that point too much? Excess living depicted through excess film making? <br/><br/>One thing's for sure, this is NOT a film to take your parents or grandparents to."

I couldn't wait to get out of the theater and I would have done so without waiting for the end had I not been sitting in the middle seat of a crowded auditorium. Sitting there to the end was actually painful. <br/><br/>Moreover, during that last hour I found the scenes to be repetitive: the cocaine-snorting, the manic behavior , the parties, the shouting - all of it tiresome, tedious and incredibly boring and dull. <br/><br/>This movie, while it has some great acting and truly funny scenes, will test your patience.

The only redeeming qualities of this film are a few laughs and lots of scantily clad hot bodies.

There are no sympathetic characters, there is no moral dilemma, no twists and not even a real story.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is great and all the other actors are pretty great too and you will enjoy the first half of the movie, laughing about all the crazy things they do. Then you will feel that you just see more crazy ""fucked up"" things and not much else. Even when the FBI closes in on DiCaprio's character, you don't feel tension, you don't feel sorry for him, nor do you feel satisfaction that he is punished.<br/><br/>So, I'm all in for the absurd humor of this flick, but it could have been done in half the time.

"Andy-296","5","14","27","4 January 2014"," Well acted and with an interesting subject matter, but too long, repetitive and unpleasant
","A biopic directed by Martin Scorsese about the rise and fall of one Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street stock broker who founded in the 1980s a brokerage firm that centered on selling penny stocks using high pressure tactics to small investors. He was indicted for fraud in 1998 and was sentenced for a relatively lenient 22 months in prison. The amoral, drug addicted Belfort is played by Leonardo Di Caprio (this is his fifth film for Scorsese); Jonah Hill is Belfort's main sidekick, Donnie. The Australian actress Margot Robbie is great as the blond bombshell - dumb model - trophy second wife of Belfort. Rob Reiner has an unnecessary extended cameo as Belfort's father. Though the subject matter is certainly interesting and the acting is fine, this film, despite its undeniable brio, is also quite unpleasant with its three hour non stop show of drug use and sordid sex. The movie is very repetitive: we see sex, drug use, a joke involving oral sex, sex, drug use, etc. Moreover, the movie has no characters one can sympathize â€“ everybody is extremely unpleasant (well, maybe with the exception of the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler, but he appears in the screen for only a little time). Jean Dujardin (the silent movie star from The Artist) has a nice cameo as a venal, corrupt Swiss banker."

I am of a German background and you will get nothing from me but the raw truth and that as a future female director and current producer in the biggest flaw in this film. i laughed at that scene and i don't think it was the intention.....<br/><br/>then at the end, it didn't seem that jordan has any remorse and again just to me not a satisfying finish for such a long film. i am not a fan of satirical films and would rather sit down and watch ""the departed"" instead. Still I greatly love and respect Scorsece for trying something out of the box for him but it didn't hit the mark for me-<br/><br/>i prob would not watch this again and i don't think it will win any academy awards especially the kind of films the academy recognizes which this is not one of them!"
"wannall","4","10","18","4 February 2014"," Go watch Boiler Room instead, or at least also
","Wolf is entertaining enough, and Leonardo does another bang-up job, but the movie is also a good example of Hollywood turning out a movie that technically shows the hazards of excess but in the process revels in the excess to such a degree that you have to push aside the 95% of the film that revels in sex, drugs and greed to notice that, oh, yeah, lives are wrecked in the process. If you didn't come out of this thinking that some drugs and some gang sex are the next thing to try, then you are a thinking person and a conscious, active viewer. Congratulations.<br/><br/>I would say instead of seeing this, see Boiler Room and watch Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Nia Long, Nicky Katt, Scott Caan, Ben Affleck, and Jim Young perform Writer/Director Ben Younger's far better movie. To be fair, Wolf contains several admirable performances, but that doesn't make up for the self-indulgent movie they wound up in.<br/><br/>Boiler Room actually contains a few characters you might care for. (I didn't really care much what happened to anyone in Wolf, except the victims, who are entirely off-screen.) It is a tighter film by far, indicating excesses without offering them up as the main dish. Tightly written, well acted, simple and honest.<br/><br/>If you will only see one of these two, see Boiler Room. If you must see both, see Boiler Room first so that you can see how Wolf pales by comparison as you watch it."

With those themes for a plot, why not just make porn. The audience would be wider, and the profits greater. <br/><br/>As for being a dark comedy, that might be a tough sell, give that comedy tends to be more individualized and subjective than drama.

","The movie comes in its own, briefly, when the FBI agents visit the DiCaprio character on his boat. Until that point, the film is nothing more than regenerated scenes and dialogue from previous work we've all seen before, including but not limited to: Wall Street (Gecko speech, Bud- wannabees), Glengarry Glen Ross (Baldwin speech), Good Fellas (Liotta narrative, drug use and paranoia), Boiler Room (motivate the troops), Fear and Loathing (effects of drug use). <br/><br/>The film may appeal to Generation Y-bother, but for anyone that actually saw the aforementioned films when they were fresh, there's not much original meat on this turkey. Parts of the film look pulled from Porky's. Quite frankly, Scorsese should be admonished for ripping off so much of other people's material and style (unless, of course, his intent was to make a tribute film to finance and banking films as a genre).<br/><br/>I could care less for the portrayal of debauchery - I worked in a similar sector in the eighties and it was like that, although not nearly as amped- up as Scorcese may envision. There's nothing in this film that hasn't already been explored more coherently? The film will appeal - as evidenced by the early box-office - but how it benefited me as a viewer having already viewed the other films I listed, I don't know.

","Martin Scorsese's new film THE WOLF OF WALL STREET makes Gordon Gekko, famous for his ""Greed is Good"" speech in Oliver Stone's 1987 movie WALL STREET, look housebroken and tame by comparison. This wild and offensive cinematic experience is overly long, with a kinetic performance by Leonardo DiCaprio portraying the real life, shameless Jordan Belfort (who wrote the book from which this movie was made,) an individual who reminded me of an evangelical preacher - stirring up his congregation of hungry, amoral brokers to bilk working class people - seducing them to invest in fraudulent penny stock transactions. The rapid ascension to personal enrichment is made to seem smooth and simple.<br/><br/>While many people in the audience laughed at Jordan and his team's gaming of the ""suckers"", I wore a dour expression during the three hours of what some experienced as exhilarating entertainment. I despised Scorsese's celebration of the perks of debauchery. Though some critics might see this film as a sharp indictment of the culture of Wall Street, I found the opposite to be true; there was absolutely no penetration of the surface capitalist veneer of grasping wealth at the expense of others. On the contrary, this movie plunges into the dank, muddy swamps of excrement and attempts to beguile us with the empty putrid spoils that are found there.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill is proving to be a good actor playing Jordan's co-conspirator, Donnie Azoff - introducing him to the world of getting ""high"", giving him the ""gift"" of hallucinatory release, ecstasy and eventual addiction. Also Matthew McConaughey in a very short cameo role, almost steals the show as Belfort 's early ""mentor"" in the business of exploiting corporate acquisitiveness. It was also good to see Rob Reiner as Jordan's father, the one sane person in a room of ""animals"" all unfettering their ""ids"" in unison.<br/><br/>We witness the hackneyed culture of ""the good life,"" lots of drugs, (quaaludes and cocaine,) constant screwing – women's bodies were all of the typical fantasy mold - existing to satisfy the ""boys"" in both classic and extravagant positions. Despite the illusion of ""extreme"" dissipation, the unfeeling and repetitive acts of dissolution became tiresome, and that was one of my major problems with THE WOLF OF WALL STREET. Jordan Belfort is a cardboard, onanistic testosterone driven, self-indulgent man who can motivate others with the passion of his own greed, but there is no sense of an actual person behind the beautiful clothes and cars that he surrounds himself with, and so frankly I don't give a damn about him or his ilk."

(Unlike your other films).<br/><br/>2) You have put your focus on a story that is unfortunately not only not new, but in fact too familiar and been said before.<br/><br/>3) The length of the film for this particular topic is a problem.<br/><br/>4) The most interesting aspects of this film is showcasing of the excess and the sex. And I wish you didn't cut that out as much as the other mundane parts.<br/><br/>5) Why treat the audience as dummies. Why assume that we can't handle something as relatively routine as an IPO (and I am not in finance) and cut off De Caprio's explanation of such in his narration.<br/><br/>6) Why not show us what De Caprio's character actually did wrong.<br/><br/>7) I am not sure what it says about us that we prefer to watch movies about Italian gangsters vs Wall Street types.<br/><br/>8) This movie would have worked better as a 2-hour wild ride with more of the excesses showcased than a 3-hour vague promo for the main character.<br/><br/>9) I understand that while editing this film you tried to narrow it down to under 3 hours, but doing so, you have made compromises about what we consider Scorsese touch vs what you think the audience wants to see.<br/><br/>10) Maybe, this is a case where studio interference would have helped. Knowing full well that the movie was independently financed and hence granting the director a rare opportunity to release the version without a green light from the bosses.<br/><br/>11) Where is the Scorsese touch in this film? Where is the wow factor? Why would a director of your stellar reputation and vision release a film that doesn't project your signature touches.<br/><br/>12) I understand that for this film you have chosen not to showcase the camera. I get it, that the subject matter may not have required (for example) Robert Richardson's amazing lighting techniques, but by giving in to the script too much you have lost your DNA in this film.<br/><br/>13) We are used to watching Scorsese movies about degenerate characters, nothing new there, but you always mix that with awe-inspiring visual narrative. None of that exists in The Wolf.<br/><br/>14) Where is Ms. Schoonmaker's now iconic editing chops in this film? Why is it so mundane? <br/><br/>15) If you would have kept more of the sex, and lessens the movie by a full hour (at least 30 min), added your signature visual style and more of Ms. Schoonmaker's editing prowess you could have saved this film.<br/><br/>16) This movie comes across as your first film that was made purely with box office numbers in mind and that's beneath a director of your stature and frankly doesn't sync with your legendary reputation.<br/><br/>17) I prefer to watch movies at home, as I have a nice set up, but I only go to the theater and suffer through all the hassle and commercials for 2 directors, yours and Tarantino. I was sorry that I sat through this farce for 3 hours and I am a huge fan of your work."

But why did Scorcese and Leo make a film about such an unimportant person and even a vile person. Movie full of drugs, sex and violence and not in a good way. Compared to American Hustle it's truly a loser. I can't believe people are suggesting that Leo should get an Oscar for this garbage."
"lee_eisenberg","10","18","37","29 December 2013"," Greed reigns supreme!
","Martin Scorsese must be a director who can't make a bad movie. Most of his movies have focused on streetwise lowlifes, and so now he looks at a different kind of lowlife: the Wall Street kind. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the true story of stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Having come of age in the '80s, Belfort was convinced that there was nothing wrong with greed, and so he stopped at nothing to get what he wanted. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort as an amoral slimeball leading a hedonistic, frat boy lifestyle: drugs, booze, hookers, the whole shebang. And yet the whole thing is very funny.<br/><br/>There have been complaints that the movie glorifies greed and egotism by portraying the characters having a lot of fun. I'd say that the movie is showing how they don't have a care in the world. They make millions and spend it on their own decadence.<br/><br/>No, it's not Martin Scorsese's best movie, but you're sure to have a lot of fun watching it (understanding of course that the characters are NOT good people). I recommend it."

Dreams of getting rich day by day makes him blinder and he joins the gang of criminals. Smartass FBI guys comes after him, both sides attack and finally the material boy gets busted. He loses his money, friends, wife and children and restarts his life. Of course with the same blindness. Another failure for DiCaprio after Gatsby, which was full of showy scenes, ""wise (!)"" dialogues, expensive decors, image of young, handsome, brilliant character but still lacks some elements of a superb film. I don't need to criticize many ridiculous scenes (Like taking dozens of stacks of money abroad on them, DiCaprio's car driving after he gets paralyzed by drugs, Donnie's drowning, Donnie's and Brad's hassle in the street etc.) because maybe these scenes are supposed to be ""comic"". The main idea of the movie seems to be catching people's attention with the help of some explicit and exaggerated content. For those, who are to watch a movie about Wall Street for the first time and teenagers who like to see some hot women bodies, this movie is a good choice but for the rest it's a crap. One final note for Jean Dujardin, it's not a wise idea to act such a trivial character for an Oscar-winner actor, just because this is a Hollywood movie which is directed by Scorcese."

","This movie is very good indeed. Beautiful photography and acting by Jack Dawson, sorry, Leonardo DiCaprio. However, it is too long, one hour and a half would have been more than enough. And the worst part of it: It has too much sex (looks like an adult movie in some scenes), too much drugs, too much vice, too much scamming, too much of human degradation. I'm sure this picture would have been much more impacting without so many demonstrations of human decadence. I know that all these situations attract viewers but I think that they were absolutely unnecessary in an otherwise excellent film. I can't imagine what would have happened if this movie was made in the 50s. The censorship would have banned it almost completely. I'm not against showing real life occurrences in a movie, but I think in this case the director exaggerated by including such degradation situations as orgies, how to use cocaine and how to deceive honorable investors. A message can be transmitted without disrespecting the human being. And perhaps the worst part of all this, why show fighting situations in front of a small child?"

An hour and a half is devoted to establishing Jordan Belfort's debauchery, but it is overkill. We do not need this many scenes depicting his lifestyle. The acting and cinematography are very good, but since it has these two aspects and no plot, it only has two of three very important pieces and does not deserve higher than a 66. Additionally, each time the movie is viewed, Belfort makes money. He is only required to give 50% of his profit to his victims, to whom he still owes millions of dollars."

So, if you only want to hear some 800 curse words, with a lot of sex and drugs all at the same time without any sense, go for it.

"chris-bushwacker","1","8","14","2 March 2014"," No spoilers because there are no surprises
","To say I hated this film would be an understatement. I knew little about it, other than reading a review in Empire magazine a couple of days before. Approximately one hour in, I went and retrieved the magazine to read the review again because I could see no resemblance on screen to the reviewer's glowing praise on the page.<br/><br/>Here I must admit to being female, and also totally appalled at the misogynistic, vile portrayal of just about every woman in this film. The only one that isn't pawed over, stripped and slapped about like a piece of meat is Jordan's first wife, but she is lied to, sidelined, betrayed and dropped as though she never meant a thing. The new wife that replaces her gets a 5 minute courtship, a honeymoon period of approximately the same duration, and is then firmly placed on the humiliation conveyor belt.<br/><br/>As for the legions of whores and other apparently inconsequential women, just about every scene is filled with their degradation. Not even key colleagues get any respect, as one scene determinedly shows the only woman at work to be named down on her knees in a glass lift with her face firmly stuck to the front of some moron's flies.<br/><br/>Yes, I am sure that being a woman has coloured my view of how women are portrayed in this film (and yes, the Empire reviewer was a man) but I notice I am not alone in being disgusted by the over-the-top porn and sheer vileness of behaviour that is revelled in and served up for what I am assured in other reviews is 2.1/2 hours. I probably lasted just over an hour before I gave up. Gave up hoping for any kind of story, gave up hoping for different characters instead of the same character assigned to just about every actor on screen. Gave up hoping that somebody, ANYBODY of the opposite sex might actually be treated fairly, even for half a minute.<br/><br/>Where was the story? What was this about? What was the effect on the victims that were sold useless penny stocks? No, they don't feature either as the film relentlessly focuses on the bullies and morons that relieve them of their hard-earned cash with no glimpse of the consequences. When these heroes stop their carousing it is only to have pointless gibbering conversations about nothing which just serve to delay the orgies momentarily. Nothing is said that advances the story as the only story here is sex, drugs and exploitation. It is the pornographic equivalent of an evening looking at someone's boring holiday photos.<br/><br/>There is zero progression, zero development, and - as far as I am concerned - zero interest in actually telling a story and entertaining the audience, just a determination to portray every excess known to man for no reason or purpose. Who cares if the real Jordan did any of this? I kept waiting for Vince Vaughn to show up as it was more like one of his puerile comedies than an Oscar-nominated film.<br/><br/>I am old enough to have worked in a corporate environment in the City of London during the 80s. Yes the place was awash with money, but every woman was not treated like an expendable whore. Shame on Scorsese and all involved. I am no shrinking violet but so much emphasis on misogynistic, negative behaviour means little or no emphasis on anything else that could have made this a worthwhile film to watch. Ultimately it has nothing to say except F U, and does nothing but relieve the public of its entrance money with little return (true to its subject matter in that respect).<br/><br/>This morning I watched District 9 which I had recorded on a whim and also knew nothing about. A film with plenty of heart, made on a tiny fraction of the budget blown on The Wolf of Wall Street, and to much greater effect. No prizes for guessing which of these films I would recommend."

"secondtake","7","8","14","16 January 2014"," Great movie-making, DiCaprio astonishes...but it's a bit all the same, all the time
","The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)<br/><br/>First of all—yes, this is a zany, hepped up ride, and it's intense and tiring and impressive. But<br/><br/>As crazy as the hedonism here is, this is a notably straightforward telling of the tale of a stockbroker's rise and fall. And as energized as it is, it's also monotonous. You can't quite say it's boring—or maybe you can, because after the fifth or fifteenth party overflowing with drugs and prostitutes you go from numb to restless —but it occurs to you later: the story is thin, as a narrative structure.<br/><br/>Too bad. This could have been edited to a 90 minute movie—it's TWICE that as it stands—and it would have had even more velocity and energy. And maybe a few details would be left out, but you know what? They wouldn't matter! In fact, all that matters is the single large arc as Belfort builds a stock trading company out of nothing—out of a garage, literally—and then sees the FBI roll in toward the end.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong—Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing, covering the whole terrain from drugged out of his mind to inspirational speaker, from down in the dumps to innocently hopeful. He's so ""on"" in every scene it's a marvel. And around him are some equally strong players, such as Jonah Hill as his second in command. The women have less to do (more on that in a sec) but the woman playing Belfort's wife, Margot Robbie, gives the character more depth than you might expect, and with a great New Yorker working class accent.<br/><br/>Scorsese directs this as he always directs—with absolute force. He doesn't know the word subtle, which is fine (which is great overall—we have other, subtle directors). Whether you look at ""Shutter Island"" or ""Hugo"" or this movie (all recent examples), you see someone who is worth following closely. He's one of the great directors we have. If all of these movies have flaws, they have so many other things going for them you end up impressed, and maybe even moved.<br/><br/>But moved—emotionally moved—is not the result of this film. You can say that was on purpose (people have). Fine. But that means the bacchanalia is what it is. You watch and watch. And it's such a man's world—and I mean men with their testosterone unchecked, supplemented, worshipped—that women are almost totally there as toys and companions. For sex and for sex. It doesn't matter if you agree or not, if you're a woman or not, or if you have politics on this one way or the other. It remains clear that we see nothing from their point of view, and we are made to accept (as a viewer in a chair) this unevenness. It's actually sickening, if you give it the time of day. And if you really study it, you see that ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is yet another film that trumpets a male over female system as good, or as inevitable.<br/><br/>Maybe it is! (I'm not defending sexism here, hold on.) But maybe you need the testosterone to be as greedy, cruel, mindless, and driven as all the men in this movie are (including the FBI guy in his ""dignified"" way). Maybe this is another way to condemn the mosh pit of Wall Street completely. Maybe there's another way to run an economy, to have corporations make things in a competitive world.<br/><br/>Probably not, but you do strain a bit to give the movie some rationale. The real content here is more gut level—intensity and insanity. It's amazing. But it is what it is, too, an expert docudrama with surprisingly few surprises."
"CanSteve3","7","8","14","12 January 2014"," Not Marty's best work, more flash than substance
","It's comforting to imagine that everything Martin Scorsese touches turns to gold, but it's not true. The same rules of thoroughness that apply to every other filmmaker also apply to Scorsese. If he rushes through a compressed editing schedule to meet an Oscar-friendly release date – as he did on The Wolf of Wall Street – his work suffers. Scorsese's latest clocks in at 180 minutes, not because its characters or narrative demand that kind of exhaustive treatment, but because Scorsese didn't have time to find a more focused, impactful shape for the film. Exploring the personal and professional corruption of notorious stockbroker Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street has several memorable sequences, but it plays like a clumsy, repetitive work-in-progress.<br/><br/>Praise has already been heaped upon Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill for their charismatic performances, but it's important to note that this is wacky comic acting more concerned with eliciting shock and amusement than any deeper human truth. This miscalculation of emphasis also infects the storytelling in a more general sense. Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter focus nearly all of their attention on the excesses – sex, drugs, greed – that drive these characters, rarely placing them in a context that might reveal complicating texture or shading. It's perfectly logical to portray these characters as one-note imbeciles with an absence of inner life, but this also makes for stifling, unsatisfying drama.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street never finds its bearings, but it becomes more tolerable in its second half when Belfort finally encounters some resistance (in the form of FBI agent Patrick Denham, played by Kyle Chandler) and sees his warped life of excess start to unravel. But even then, the film is dragged down by its reliance on Belfort's moronic perspective – the film is derived from his self-mythologizing memoir – which gives an Animal House frivolity to his constant misbehaviour, a smokescreen that distracts from the devastation of his professional crimes.<br/><br/>Simply recycling sensibilities from Goodfellas and The Departed may seem like a logical strategy, but there's a crucial difference this time around. Whereas gangsters generally do harm to other gangsters, Belfort's victims are relatively innocent, draining this film's lawlessness of charm and fascination. Scorsese's ability to find humanity in reprehensible characters has always been one of his greatest strengths, but he doesn't even attempt to humanize the characters in The Wolf of Wall Street. This wilful oversight results in one of the director's most disposable, nihilistic films, a half-hearted effort that abandons the complexities of his own world view in favour of Belfort's clueless primitivism. This might have made for a uniquely compelling Todd Phillips (The Hangover) movie, but in the hands of Scorsese, this mildly entertaining diversion feels hopelessly erratic and insubstantial."

","When The Wolf of Wall Street first begins its nearly three hour running-time, you aren't exactly sure when the opening studio titles end and the film begins because of Scorsese's stylized letterboxing academy ratios with certain scenes, emphasizing a television type framing as opposed to the rest of the film's widescreen cinematography. The questioning doesn't stop there; after the entire year of anticipation, the story of Jordan Belfort unfolds for the first hour, I continued to wonder when the real The Wolf of Wall Street was going to start.<br/><br/>I follow numerous accounts on Instagram, on Christmas morning I came across a screenshot someone took on their iPhone of an elderly female critic reviewing The Wolf of Wall Street. With rotten icon from Rotten Tomatoes and the preview of her review stating, ""Too much sex and drug use,"" I rolled my eyes in agreement with the Instagram account of the unfair criticism. Then I saw The Wolf of Wall Street and realized it was not just a senior citizen compliant, I think Scorsese crossed the line of fun and entered an area of repugnance.<br/><br/>I may be the only member of my age group (18-24) who complains about the overuse of sex, greed, and drugs, call me an old man, but after a three hours enough is enough. If The Wolf of Wall Street had some sense of a moral compass that drove the narrative, I may not criticize this aspect so harshly, but neither Scorsese nor the screenplay has anything to offer the audience to latch onto in selfish, unlikable, pathetic characters.<br/><br/>Scorsese had to tell the story of Jordan Belfort and I'm sure his life was as unruly as the film paints it to be, but he abandons any sense of class. This is not the Scorsese we all have been enamored with the past. The Wolf of Wall Street is the type of film to be enjoyed by the same audience as The Hangover, not award voting Academy members or critical film analysts. I kept having the feeling I had seen this exact same film in May with flashier costumes, called The Great Gatsby. Wolf is not that far off from it, a few steps above Gatsby in terms of quality filmmaking, but the empty feeling it gives off to the audience is no different.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese's fifth collaboration has been brewing in the minds of everyone who enjoyed their previous films and hope that one day they can finally ""click"" the way Scorsese did with Robert DeNiro back at the apex of their careers. The best thing The Wolf of Wall Street has on its side is Leonardo DiCaprio's eminent charm; he melts his audience and hits some of the greatest highs of his acting career. Certainly deserves to be included in any of the Best Actor races this award season.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street's problems do not stem from the technicalities of filmmaking. Though the storytelling half of Scorsese's job that could have been executed much better, at least he forms the shell of a quality movie. His films typically have a masterwork of film editing; the editing for Wolf is no exception. It is like DiCaprio is snapping his fingers the whole for the three hours. The look of the film is another strength. The juicy cinematography looks as if it was painted with the infinite money made my Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>Some of Scorsese's past film successes find themselves drilled into The Wolf of Wall Street. The first person point of view from Goodfellas and Casino is put to good use, it even grows in this film. DiCaprio not only narrates the majority of the film, but also pulls a Woody Allen and looks directly at the audience and speaks to us like we are having a private conversation with Jordan Belfort. His obsession with wealth and drugs damaging his life and family echoes from Raging Bull, but this works against Wolf. In Raging Bull we saw Jake LaMotta beat his wife, but we also felt his guilt. There's a scene in Act Three that feels like a direct homage to Raging Bull, but Wolf lacks the humanity of that film. Scorsese wanted to isolate us from the world in Wolf like he did in Taxi Driver, where we understood the violence Travis yearned for, but here Wolf fails to tug at the same cords with greed as Taxi Driver did with loneliness.<br/><br/>At the end of the day does the greedfest of The Wolf of Wall Street matter? No. If it were not so hollow, it could have been a fun movie, but I didn't even buy into the ""enjoyment."" People around me were laughing at the slapstick comedy, but I did not find most of it funny, not even DiCaprio's raved physical comedy scene in the last section of the film. I shrugged my shoulders after the first thirty seconds and then the scheme continued for five more minutes. Not a bad film, a bad narrative, and a poorly communicated film. If I retitled the film, it would read: The Disappointment of Wall Street.<br/><br/>Grade: B-<br/><br/>Rating: 6"

","Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an ambitious young Wall Street numbers-cruncher, working under an equally ambitious (though decidedly more corrupted) stock broker named Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey). Things are going well until Hanna's firm goes under, leaving Belfort to create his firm. Belfort throws together some sleazy characters (Jonah Hill, Jean Dujardin, Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal) to create a large securities fraud investigation-in-waiting, finally forcing him to use his conscience to decide between an extravagant life or a way out for himself.<br/><br/>""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a nightmare, for both the characters and the viewer. A script that can't fit itself into coherence drones on and on about corruption, while never seeing fit to inform the viewer of exactly how Belfort became what he is. He just, is. We never learn much of anything about him. Nudity, drugs, and violence corrupt his despicable life. And that's what the movie is. In many ways, I would have learned more from watching a documentary about Belfort than watching this movie. <br/><br/>For a Martin Scorcese picture, especially one written by Boardwalk Empire scribe Terrence Winter, I was shocked at the utter one- dimensionality of these characters. Belfort is a scumbag. Each and every one of his cronies are equally scummy. The only characters who seem to have any benevolence are Belfort's first wife (despite her many scenes, we never learn her name) and the FBI Agent pursuing the fraud, Kyle Chandler. Chandler might have had a name. If I saw the word ""Cop"" across from his name at the cast and credits, I wouldn't be surprised. <br/><br/>By far the worst part of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the structure. The end result looks like someone took scissors to the reel and haphazardly pasted the final third together. It's a complete mess, trying to force all the character development we didn't get for the first TWO HOURS into the final chapter.<br/><br/>The only character who was at all interesting was McConaughey's, who as a powerful broker who loses it all perhaps served as the heaviest foreshadowing the film could offer. Yet we lose track of him after the first twenty minutes, and by the time you're numb from the waist down and your brain is turning into mush, you've completely forgotten McConaughey was ever there. <br/><br/>Scorcese and DiCaprio should be ashamed.

After a couple of overlong Rocknesque team motivating speeches channeling Andrew Dice Clay along the way Lenny and Wolf of Wall St. hits a dead end with nowhere to go but from one drug fueled, sex crazed Bachannalian bash to the next while staying a step or two ahead of the feds.<br/><br/>Wolf starts fast with altruistic but ambitious Jason Belfort's ( Leonard DiCaprio) rise, stumble and meteoric burst by way of the penny stock trade to heading a major Wall St. firm. But less than halfway in Scorcese begins to audition acts for a comedy show slowing the pace in favor of DiCaprio and company giving us some stooge slapstick and dense straight man in scenes that neither build or deliver, just eat up endless minutes. The hedonistic office orgies, DiCaprio pep talks, the lust for coke, the reverence for Quaalude we get the first time, enough already.<br/><br/>DiCaprio also starts strong but is asked or was given free reign to emote beyond audience patience and he staggers to the finish with one over the top outburst after the next. A scene (one of many) where a nostalgic return to some revered drug goes awry and we are treated to Lenny crawling from the interior of a dwelling down the stairs across the lot and into his Ferrari. It is a scene emblematic of Scorcese's self indulgence and sluggish pace. Halving it (no less) may have salvaged it. At least it would not have wasted so much of your time.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is relegated to throwaway inanity (save for a charismatic cameo by Matt McConaughy as a high powered trader) and team spirit in one noisy scene after the next that just goes in the same circle over and over and over eventuating in a dull payoff. Face it, his films have gotten longer and lousier. The Wolf of Wall St. has no bite it simply howls and howls and howls."
"buckbeasom","Null","17","36","26 December 2013"," This Is a Truly Terrible Movie
","It would be impossible for me to write a spoiler in this review, as I walked out after an hour. <br/><br/>Basically, this movie is about a shameful, conscious-less prick who has surrounded himself with an assortment of losers who are quite content to emulate him in the pursuit of money at the expense of anyone who is unfortunate enough to cross their paths. In Goodfellas and The Departed, Scorsese showed us equally unsavory people, but those films were redeemed by having - at least - great dialog, engaging characters and a decent story line. <br/><br/>""Wolf"" has none of these things. It's as if Scorsese dropped acid and decided to make a movie about people who lack any redeeming values whatever - and celebrate the fact every day. There are no characters you care about, no story line of even the remotest interest and - frankly - no reason to bother watching this mess.<br/><br/>The problem with today's movie business is that about 90% of the movies made are targeted at the ""14 year old boy"" demographic. Thus Thor, Enders Game and all of the rest of the crap that clogs up the cinema universe.<br/><br/>""Wolf"" is not just aimed at 14 year old boys, but at DEPRAVED 14 year old boys. If you get the urge to go to this movie, just take the ten bucks out of your pocket and wipe your butt with it. You'll get the same result and save yourself the three hours. <br/><br/>(BTW, after walking out, I was lucky enough to stumble into American Hustle. Now THERE is a movie worth watching.)"

","8.2 Rating for this tripe? Wow, did the sheep get caught in the echo chamber and herd for this one! They heard, ""Oh Scorcese! Oh Leo DiCaprio! Oh Jonas Hill!"" and they all fell for it! Haha! Suckers! They got sucked into it just like Jordan Belforte sucked all his clients in! That's the only thing funny about this garbage.<br/><br/>And please, don't try to pretentiously turn this movie into some kind of moral message, or some kind of hipster perspective on it because there is nothing deep, profound, or any message about it.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, this is one of the most insulting films I've ever seen, and not because of the adult content at all, but because it was really a bad movie. The only part I even remember was DiCaprio high on Quaaludes and having a hard time crawling out of his car and up or down the stairs- that was actually funny to see, but that's it. Sure Robbie spreads her legs in the skirt, woopedy doo, nice meme for the vapid millennial generation.<br/><br/>Everything else was pure garbage. And another thing: DiCaprio looks nothing like Belforte. Belforte has an alpha male suave about him when this was going on in real life, while DiCaprio is just playing DiCaprio, and I didn't believe for a minute he was capable of being in charge at that corporation. This whole thing is awful.<br/><br/>If you want to see a more subtle and intellectual take on the very important topic, then just watch the far superior ""Boiler Room"" with Giovanni Rabese, Vin Diesel, and those guys from around 2000. It is much more intelligently made and still portrays all of the same material, but just with a little more realism and subtlety.<br/><br/>It should be in the Bottom 100 worst movies ever made!<br/><br/>1.5/10"
"Hitchcoc","4","7","12","4 June 2015"," Just Kind of Tiresome
","I kept waiting for something to happen that had even an element of surprise. The plot has to do with a character who is great at using the stock market to his advantage and then spreading the loot around. He has a group of dysfunctional sociopaths working for him and for some reason they are successful. This is all contrived to make things move along and be interesting. As the profits rise, there is more and more debauchery that is about as graphic as anything I've seen. The interesting thing is that it is not erotic; it is just plain boring. DiCaprio has a lot of lines and gets to emote like crazy, reveling in his excessive use of drugs and his lack of any kind of commitment. I suppose this is so outrageous that we viewers who are not with it don't realize it is tongue in cheek. I knew where the principle plot was going and had a hard time imagining that so many people could exist under these circumstances. It's just rotten people doing rotten things to other people. It's like Caligula has been reborn in the 21st Century."

","Ever had the urge to drive fast after watching a Fast & Furious movie? If you are on the page as me, then beware, The Wolf of Wall Street might make you wanna jump start a career in investment. It is exactly what the protagonist Jordan Belfort motivated his accomplices to do in it. There is always something that you could (not proudly) relate to in a Scorsese movie and in The Wolf of Wall Street its about money and who wouldn't love to relate to it.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street tells the rise of Jordan Belfort, a man with high ambitions and even higher exuberance, how he conquers the stock market, goes over the top and more. This could be considered a rags to riches story and the narrative takes a turn after the second act when the riches phase goes a notch above and becomes greed, power and eventually an inevitable descent. When you are this far down the rabbit hole there ain't no coming back to the surface, unscathed at least. A movie with excessive nudity, sleaze and drug use, The Wolf of Wall Street is exactly how its meant to be and Martin Scorsese has done a job which takes its justified crown at the box office and most likely even at the Oscars. One of the strong points of the movie is humor and Wolf of Wall Street packs it in tons. This is by far Scorsese's funniest movie till date that I developed a cramp in my stomach laughing so much.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is about 3 hours long and not once did I feel an impatient bladder, I was rooted to the seat eager to know where Jordan was going with it. Agreed Jordan Belfort is not guy you'd want your kids looking up to and his ways are never strictly speaking legal. But despite that you want this guy to emerge at the top for his ambitions, this character is as fun as it can get and who brought life to Jordan? Leonardo Di Caprio of course! This is maybe his 6th collab with Martin Scorsese and you have to owe it to them, they do make a dynamic duo. Leonardo despite his charismatic and magnetic performance in his recent movies never landed him an Academy Award but who cares? He has proved that he is one of the greatest actors of our times who literally steals every scene he's in. For once I wanted to step back from the cosmetic layer of Jordan's pompous life and have a different angle at his ways. But Leonardo Di Caprio's performance was just so captivating and he just didn't give me a chance, there was no stepping back when you have delved this much into being entertained.<br/><br/>A stellar supporting cast promises that the screen is always filled with intriguing characters. Jonah Hill especially is a force to reckon with as Jordan's most trusted Donnie. This guy has become the go to guy for brilliant supporting roles and is getting increasingly entertaining, starring in almost all of the Academy Award nominated movies. This is indeed a boy's club where there's little importance for feminine characters and I felt the their roles in the movie were objectified. Of course it'd be Pan Am's Margot Robbie's nude scenes that'd be the talk of the day after watching this movie and it is indeed hard to take your eyes off her but you have to admit it takes a splendid performance to be noticed when you've got a star studded male cast to compete with. Matthew McConaughey, Jean Dujardin, Kyle Chandler and Jon Bernthal equally deserves a thumbs up for their short but memorable roles.<br/><br/>Its impossible to deduce how Martin Scorsese had done it. The man's edging over his 70s and has crafted a movie so modern, so energetic and with so much passion that even a younger director would be challenged to top it. I really don't care how he is being criticised for his apparent sleazy glorification of the stockbrokers or for the 506 F-bombs thats been dropped in the whole movie. He just delivered another masterpiece, an edge of the seat dramedy that is on par with most of the his as well as others' best movies ever. I enjoyed every frame of it and was left wanting more. Relentlessly funny, loud & ceaselessly crazy, The Wolf of Wall Street in undeniably one of the best movies of 2013 and is by far the best time I had at the movies in recent times."
"preppy-3","9","7","12","9 February 2014"," A very good Martin Scorsese film
","Movie based on the life of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). He was a poor man who joined Wall Street in the late 1980s. He slowly built his way up to the top--making his own company and doing anything (legal or illegal) to come out on top. He also became addicted to drugs and sex and it slowly destroys him.<br/><br/>A VERY good but not great Scorsese film. Let's get the negatives out of the way first--it's far too long at 3 hours (this could easily have lost 30 minutes); Jonah Hill is TERRIBLE and annoying in a supporting role; the constant swearing and screaming gets tiresome; there's WAY too much female nudity (while a scene with male nudity was cut down to nothing) and there's no real ending...it just sort of stops. Still I loved it a lot more than I hated it. The acting was great by everybody (save Hill). DiCaprio was brilliant in the title role. Who knew he could do comedy as well as drama? He anchors this film and he's never less than mesmerizing. As I said mostly everybody else is good but special mention must be made for Margot Robbie (as his second wife Naomi) and Joanna Lumley who is incredible as Aunt Emma. The story moves fairly quickly and there's a great use of period music. So this is excellent but not great Scorsese."
"hkauteur","7","7","12","26 January 2014"," HK Auteur film review - The Wolf of Wall Street
","Martin Scorsese's latest is based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker and founder of Stratton Oakmont, a company which engaged in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street during the nineties. <br/><br/>First off, the performances are top-notch. Leonardo DiCaprio has managed to find new depths by playing a character that is even debatably worse than the racist plantation owner in Django Unchained. DiCaprio has done more than enough to win his Oscar, and winning for The Wolf of Wall Street is as good any of his other roles. My favorite DiCaprio performance is still Howard Hughes in The Aviator. Though my vote goes to McConaughey for Dallas Buyers Club this year. Speaking of which, McConaughey has a great cameo as Jordan's mentor, who gives Belfort the inspirational push. However, Jonah Hill is the standout as Belfort's psychotic sidekick Donnie Azoff, delivering an even more impressive performance than in Moneyball.<br/><br/>At a 3-hour running time, the film is too long and it easily could have been shorter with less party scenes and throwing midgets into giant dartboards at the office. As a rise-and-fall story, it has too much 'rise' and not enough 'fall'. I wanted the story to move on and inform us about the financial damage this all caused and all the lives it hurt in the process, but Scorsese does not seem interested in the forensics. Overall there are some very good party set pieces and funny scenes, but after a while, I was just numb.<br/><br/>The story is essentially told from the villain's point of view. Extending this idea to the classic children's storybook The True Story of the Three Little Pigs, which is told from the Big Bad Wolf's perspective. The Wolf retells the Three Little Pigs story and asks the reader to consider his side of the story. The Wolf was simply trying to bake a cake for his grandmother's birthday while nursing a bad cold, and things got out of hand. Therein lies my criticism: there is nothing redeemable from the Jordan Belfort character in The Wolf of Wall Street. Or at the very least, the filmmakers do not seem interested in showing anything beyond the surface. <br/><br/>The breaking-the-4th-wall story device of having the villain narrate his story to the audience is raunchy and creative, but Scorsese totally forgets that it is supposed to be ironical. The premise of the black comedy is that we're supposed to laugh at how vile and putrid these people are. But by the nth orgy scene, the characters are matted into two dimensions and we never get beneath the surface. The morality play tips over to the other side and it mistakenly justifies itself. Just because this a tale about self-indulgent shallow people doesn't mean we have to tell their story in a self-indulgent shallow fashion.<br/><br/>The bad taste left in my mouth at the end is not the film's self-indulgence, but out of worry that The Wolf of Wall Street is so unclear about its cautionary message, that there are certain viewers that will admire this lifestyle and become inspired to become a stock broker. For the rest of that find the Belfort character repugnant will feel empty wondering what justified the three-hour running time.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"
"Dr_Coulardeau","7","7","12","26 January 2014"," A shorter and denser version would have been so much better
","A surprising film indeed. What is it about? <br/><br/>First of all it is about 45 minutes too long. The sex scenes and the orgies could have been cut short to a simple ellipse instead of a graphic depiction. That is one easy shortening that should have been used. Same thing with the drug scenes that are by far too numerous and too long. We got the message very fast that to succeed in Wall Street you have to be a sex addict, a drug-cocktail addict, an alcohol addict, a money addict, a money-lifting addict, a thief, a liar and a few other little things like that. We know that, we knew that and we have known it since at least American Psycho. <br/><br/>So, what is the original message?<br/><br/>It is simple. Anyone can succeed like that wolf in the USA in the most ruthless way possible with the most illegal and unethical means possible because the system is a filter-less abyss. There is no real filter to prevent these crimes and other offenses. There is no protection of any kind to prevent criminal minds to get into the business. The American system after 1987, date of the beginning of the wolf's career, is absolutely deregulated and it will be so till a very recent period, till a couple of years after the 2009 crisis. What's more most of those who are supposed to look after the various crimes committed in the financial field can be bought for a pittance, at times a little bit more, be they American, or Swiss, or whatever affiliation they have as for financial paradise. <br/><br/>Yet the FBI cannot be bought up. They are incorruptible, which I doubt very much. But well we can always think there is an Eliot Ness in every FBI special agent.<br/><br/>The worst part is that these people when they are caught will become, in their own interest, the most talkative monsters you can imagine. They will accept a deal at once. The principle is simple: ""In Wall Street there is NO friend!"" Partners, associates, colleagues, collaborators are ALL, all of them, nothing but competitors, enemies. As long as they can work as a pack they will, but as soon as the pack is under a real menace each one will go alone against the pack if necessary. A starving pack in the Rocky Mountains may die though if it comes to that the outcome will be ONE survivor and ONE survivor only. Wolves are cannibals in situations where survival is at stake. <br/><br/>As for a meaning that is very light and very naÃ¯ve. ""Lupus est homo homini, non homo, non quom qualis sit novit"" (wolf is man to man, no man when he does not know who the other is). Erasmus (15th-16th centuries) quoted it from Plautus (3rd-2nd centuries BCE), the original author, and then Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century made it a central concept of his vision of humanity in his work Leviathan. Nothing new under the sun. This phrase ""Man is wolf to man"" has become a catch phrase with the Industrial Revolution and Marxism. Though capitalism, and any form of it, did not invent it. Gladiators were Romans. The Celts burnt their criminals. And the modern times invented a lot of such cruel treatment of human beings as slaves or as playthings for sadistic or didactic practices, even calling it the death sentence. A woman was recently raped in public by more than fifteen men in a village in eastern India on the order of the village elders because she refused to break off with a man, her lover, who was from another village that was sexually off limits for these elders. Maybe the saying does not apply to women?<br/><br/>When we thus look at the film and wonder what makes it in anyway different, original, new, we have to say it is a brilliant cinematographic illustration of a common place idea and situation. The catch phrase of the film is that New Zealand has become the haven, paradise, refuge and shelter of all those criminals, financial, copyright or data all together and the same, where they can go on striving without any menace from the FBI. Australia is a second haven of the type and then Russia too is trying to set her feet in that juicy field. The juice is not only money, it is also a lot of blood. <br/><br/>That last remark, the catch phrase, the final scene of the film is the most powerful argument for a shorter film, a film that could have been a lot shorter. ""Sell me that pen"" becomes very shallow and trite after three hours of ranting, raving, partying, raping, raging, and so many other off-normalcy attitudes, actions and principles. The film is in itself an orgy of ever and endlessly repeating sequences: we are framed in a million images of exactly the same value and tinge and color and hue. What a shame! Scorsese could do better.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

It is just a crass ""man"" movie of the lowest caliber. It should have had an NC- 17 rating in the first place. It's just a film about debauchery and degrading women. Nudity, drugs and sex are what the film is really about. So much so I could only sit halfway through and walk out for the rest of the movie. No matter how great the plot could have become couldn't have made up for the first half of the movie, I had no interest in seeing what became of the main characters, so little attachment did I have for them.

","Jordan Belfort arrives in Wall Street and gets a job selling stocks over the phone. The environment is vulgar, brutal, ruthless. One of the senior guys takes him to lunch and gives him the lessons to survive. The main point is to put money from the customers in their pockets, not so much enrich their customers.<br/><br/>When Black Friday hits, Belfort is out of a job, and ends up working at a company of amateurs selling penny stocks. He does so well that he ends up opening his own firm ripping people off. He hires friends and shady characters. One of them introduces him to drugs. They are so wildly successful that they pretty much don't know what to do with all their money. He becomes addicted to money, power, and all drugs he can get his hands on. His wife divorces him and he marries the gorgeous Naomi.<br/><br/>As the feds start snooping around his business, which involves everything illegal under the sun, he decides to move his money to a Swiss bank and Naomi's English aunt helps in the process as well as various carriers who transport millions of cash by hand. Eventually, the government catches up with him as his life unravels.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is your typical Scorsese ""rise and fall of a bad guy"" movie. It's a bit different in so far as Belfort is nowhere near as likable as the other Scorsese main characters. Here you are not wishing for Belfort to escape and get away. You want him to face justice. And violence has been replaced with comedy. Much of this overlong movie is made up of comedy skits basically. There's DiCaprio on drugs, DiCaprio having deranged sex, there's DiCaprio fooling his wife into doing naughty things in front of a hidden camera, there's the company jerks throwing little people at a target, etc, etc. This movie could have easily been cut by at least half an hour. There's also not nearly enough drama.<br/><br/>Most disappointing is the lack of any sort of moral message, if you will. It shouldn't have been difficult to point out the insane misantrophy of Wall Street folks. But there's only very little of that. Given that the finance world still gets away with murder, or perhaps these days even more so, it's not clear why Winter, Scorsese, the producers, anyone, was not interested in taking the opportunity to scold the finance world.<br/><br/>Acting is OK. DiCaprio is strong except for the scenes where he's motivating his employees. There are too many scenes of those and DiCaprio doesn't convey the charisma necessary. Margot Robbie is the revelation here. I'm not crazy about the rest of the cast- Hill in particular doesn't convince.<br/><br/>Like all stories about larger than life personalities written by themselves, much probably didn't happen as told. Nevertheless and despite the excessive lengthy, Wolf of Wall Street is entertaining yet surprisingly and unnecessarily superficial."
"sjohnson134-878-955038","6","6","10","20 January 2014"," The Wolf of Wall Street Literature and Movie Review
","The 2013 film of Jordan Belfort's The Wolf of Wall Street novel begins with Leonardo DiCaprio breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the audience. He does this repeatedly throughout the film and if he is not speaking directly to the audience, he is doing lots of voice-over to explain or inform what he or the other characters are doing at that particular time/situation in the film. Most of the time, I find voice-over very distracting, but I have to admit that it works in this dramedy film very well. The book, written by Jordan Belfort, a former New York stock broker who earned hundreds of millions of dollar during the 1990s at his Stratton Oakmont brokerage firm on Long Island, New York (not really Wall Street in downtown Manhattan). The book is very long and seems to glorify everything Belfort did during this time of his life along with all of his friends and co-workers at his stock firm. He founded this firm which started as a penny stock firm, where unfortunately he defrauded everyday ordinary investors with fraudulent stock sales. Considered a stock swindler, he developed a very severe lifestyle, which included a very serious addition to Quaaludes. The company at one point employed well over 1,000 brokers and dealt with more than $1 billion stocks, including the Steve Madden show company. The 2000 film Boiler Room was inspired by Belfort and Stratton Oakmont. It should be noted here that Belfort was indicted in 1998 for money laundering and securities fraud. He spent 22 months in a federal prison and was to pay back $110.4 million that he swindled. Meeting Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong in prison, Belfort was persuaded to write and publish his story, which he has. Stratton Oakmont was considered a boiler room that manipulated stocks. In the book, he tells in full detail how he did it from money laundering to swindling customers. Millions poured in, bringing with it many excesses, which included women, drugs, huge homes, servants, yachts, aircrafts, not only for himself but for everyone who worked for him. He also describes in detail all his dope escapades and sex, despite constantly telling the reader how much he loved his wives, particularly his second (and now ex-wife) and his children. Again, in full detail, he tells the reader about the supporting characters, from Aunt Patricia, his father who he calls Max Max, the Swiss forger, his cohorts in crime at Stratton, along with Steve Madden and others. The drug use, the sex, the violence, the storm at sea that destroyed his yacht, and the car wrecks are all listed throughout the book. It finally ends with Belfort being arrest and jailed. In the film, which is considered a black comedy, the story deals with the scam that Belfort initiated and where, or not, some, any, or all of what he tells the reader what he did during this time in the book is accurate remains to be seen. As is always the case with any film, plenty of creative license is used to tell a particular story. Seeing how Martin Scorsese, the director, in all his films, tries to be as faithful to the novel as he can be, he has done the same with Belfort's memoir. So this particular film is a close adaptation since most of the story elements are kept while some have been changed, added, or dropped. But, one has to be reminded that Belfort was a true scam artist, so just how much of his story is legit is up to the reader and now the watcher to decide. Most of what Scorsese has included in this film is accurate based on the book. Mark Hanna, played well by a still very thin Matthew McConaughey from his role in Dallas Buyer's Club, tells a very young Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) that the key to being successful included hookers, cocaine and masturbation is told in the novel. The use of what is called a pump-and-dump scheme (selling a risky stock at an inflated price and then sold the stock to make a profit for themselves) to make a profit is also accurate. Belfort and Danny Porush (Donnie Azoff in the film, played by Jonah Hill) did this. The brokerage firm did in reality take Steve Madden's shoe company public, which Madden, Belfort and Porush owned the stock, driving the price up. All three of them went to jail for this. The smuggling of the money that Belfort laundered in Switzerland was actually done by his wife's mother and English aunt. Prostitutes were hired and were billed to the corporate credit card and then these expenses were written off their taxes. The yacht, originally owned by Coco Chanel, was sunk. In the film, his second wife's name was Naomi; in the novel, her name is Nadine. In the book, Belfort gave up Porush, among many others for a reduced sentence. In the film, he tells Porush not to incriminate himself. It is true that Belfort was born in the Bronx to accountant parents and he was raised Jewish which he is still today. I guess the audience would like to believe that Belfort only stole from the rich. Truth be known, many small investors are still to this day trying to recover from his scheme while Belfort has failed to repay what he owes and Porush is still doing his get rich quick plans. Many of the characters; names from the book were changed. Danny Porush is Donnie Azoff, Patrick Denham (FBI agent) is in real-life Gregory Coleman, Denise Lombardo was changed to Teresa Petrillo and Nadine Caridi was Naomi Lapaglia. Chandler was the name of his first child, but was referred to in the film as Skyler. Scorsese did include at the end of the film a disclaimer saying it was a fictionalized version of the novel and in the film, some of the names had been changed."
"ronald-litvak","Null","6","10","12 January 2014"," Read the following sentence to know all the movie is about
","It's about sex, drugs, and money. That's it. No really that's it. Pretty much nothing happens in between. Think of transformers 3 only drop the CGI metal on metal violence and replace it with Dicaprio snorting cocaine, banging hookers, and spending money. If you want to watch a movie to get some sort of vicarious good feeling out of watching a character do what you wish you could then this is your thing. Otherwise, it's pretty much a three hour waste of time. This is no Wall Street 1987, or American Psycho. Both of those movies actually had something this movie is devoid of: plot and character development. It's just a giant perpetual orgy. If that's your thing go for it."

","I think this is a very well crafted movie. The performances are excellent and the director and all his staff made a wonderful job. And this has the best dialog I have heard in years - despite the frequent f-words. Yes, this is one of the rags-to-riches-and-then-to-jail -movie. But somehow I missed the larger-in-life -character Gordon Gekko, who has already become a living legend although he is only a fiction from Stone's Wall Street. The main character is just a brat with addictions: drug, sex and money. Like a teenager-for-ever -type. He never grows and he never learns. At the end he is still making money for himself and some avid listeners. I hope his methods are legitimate now. But there is virtually no reference to the outside world. No political or philosophical connotations. And during this time inside Wall street was happening a lot! Later we found out what... So my only complaint is that this movie tries to be a Novel (apparently Epic Novel for 3 hours!)but manages in only being a short story."
"R-Clercx","7","6","10","10 January 2014"," Under par Scorsese overacted by Di Caprio
","Three hours is simply too much of a half good thing. Scorsese probably wanted to emanate in the montage the coke fueled consciousness of stock broker Di Caprio who can't decide if he wants to portray the main character as a parody or as a biography.<br/><br/>How many drug and sex inspired scenes can one endure in three hours, without getting bored by the repetition? After the first amusing hour, the movie goes over the top and hysterical and one can't help to be relived of the ramblings. The Wolf of Wall Street wants to be dramatic and funny at the same time but only achieves half of both. You'll get a few laughs out of it (mostly out of embarrassment) , but if this wasn't announced as a Scorsese in big letters, one would probably not think it's a Scorsese movie in the first place.<br/><br/>Not 'bad' by any means, but under par for Scorsese."
"crimsontide12367","10","9","17","20 May 2014"," My favorite movie of all time
","Why Leonardo DiCaprio didn't win the Oscar for best actor, I will never understand. Matthew McConaughey must have put on an absolutely indescribable performance in Dallas Buyers Club. I have yet to see Dallas Buyers Club, so I can't say Matthew didn't deserve it.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is insane though! It is a very well directed movie by my favorite director of all time, Martin Scorsese. This movie shows what it was like as a stockbroker in a very unique way as a comedy. However, if it wasn't a comedy, it would be a very boring movie. Well done by the writers.<br/><br/>This is definitely my favorite movie of all time now. Even at 3 hours long, I wish the movie continued. I would recommend seeing it, but children should NOT see this movie."
"jasipe","10","9","17","14 March 2014"," Awesome movie, Bad reviews
","This review is more about all the negative reviews than the movie itself. I'm surprised at how many people are so easily offended and taken back by such vulgar behavior. First off the name of the movie should tell you everything you need to know. If your a weak person who can't take any sort of bad language, drug use, sexual activity, and other devious behavior than STAY HOME!! Your going to watch a movie about a major player on wall street back in it's hayday, I mean ""Wolf of Wall Street"", what did you people think, it was going to be some rich wall street guy giving his money to charity and talking about how we need to be responsible to our clients? Give me a break people, read about the movie and either say to yourself ""hey, I'm kind of a weeny, I don't think I can handle this"" or grow a pair and go enjoy the awesome roller coaster ride that is this movie. I actually seen reviews on here calling this movie boring. You can call this movie many things, but to call it boring is just absolutely ridiculous. This is probably about the least boring movie ever made. <br/><br/>For the movie itself, I believe the it does a terrific job of showing what it was like back then on wall street. Leonardo is brilliant in this movie and portrays the title to a T. For people who think it is too fictional and there is no way a person can do that many drugs, do that many crazy stunts, and still function, trust me in that a person can. I'm sure some of the movie is over-hyped or certain parts of the movie didn't really happen, but that's Hollywood. Every movie based on true events have some fiction. The good times do eventually run its course in the movie, the movie does a good job of showing the unraveling of the characters and the company. Nobody mentions anything about that in their reviews. Everybody acts like he did all this terrible stuff and things just stay on track and everything works out fine, but it doesn't, it all comes crashing down. <br/><br/>Anyway, I don't usually comment on movies, but I had to say something about all the negative reviews. This movie is nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. You must go into it with an open mind and not be a person who is easily offended. Some are calling it the worst movie of all time which is asinine. For a person to make a statement like that should tell you how credible they are, because everybody who likes to watch movies knows the absolute idiotic crap that has been made in Hollywood, which this is nowhere near that. You can hate this movie, but have some common sense.<br/><br/>One final thought, give me a break about the clients they were screwing. So many people complaining because the movie didn't go into more detail about the clients they were taking advantage of. Who cares, the movie was made to show the devious behavior of the brokers and the firm. We know people were getting screwed, I don't need to see them and know their names. I didn't go to the movie to see these people and feel sorry for them, I went to see the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" (again people, it's all in the title). So, if your going thinking your going to develop some kind of relationship with or feel sorry for the clients STAY HOME!! <br/><br/>Sorry if I offended anyone, but judging from the reviewers on this movie I'm sure I offended just about everyone."

","This movie was made for the young crowd who likes sex, drugs and money. The fact that it was laced with nudity/porn shows that it is cheap smut. While I understand this was the environment, it was too extreme. I especially dislike the raw anger displayed among characters, This was Scarface without guns meets Wall Street. Bad just bad. There was a great opportunity lost in making this film filled with so many possibles. No wonder the market is where it is today. I did not Leo and that is surprising for me.

","This was such a waste of my time and money. This movie is not R, it is NC-17 if not X rated. Boob shots were the norm, and somehow they managed full frontal nudity in dozens of shots, sex scenes were a bit too gratuitous and every other word was a curse word. I myself, am thinking every other word in a curse now for having had to sit through 3 hours of it. How on earth did someone think this was worth 3 hours? If you cut out the boob shots alone it could've been slashed down to an hour and a half. The objectification of women in this film was unbelievable, and what is almost worse is how they made it seem like all men are wild monkeys.<br/><br/>As to be expected from Leo Dicaprio, the acting was fantastic, there were some funny moments (though they were mostly funny due to slapstick humor) and as far as technicality goes, the movie was shot well, but if you're looking for anything more than a well shot porno with absolutely no solid plot, don't watch this movie. In fact, if you ARE looking for a porno with no solid plot, I still wouldn't recommend this. Save your money and watch your porn on redtube."
"suddenlysteve","6","18","40","19 December 2013"," A desperate Oscar grab
","It's unfortunate; I came into this movie with such high expectations that was sustained through the first 30 min of the movie, crashing right after in similar fashion to the stock market crash of the early 80s. <br/><br/>You see, it's very similar to Goodfellas in it's narrative format. That aside, the movie is loosely tied by a plot reminiscent of Casino, holding together episodes of pointless bantering and ridiculous debauchery. The debaucherous episodes are fun, but the gratuitous sex and drug scenes honestly get tiring after awhile, since it seems they ran out of any compelling plot points. <br/><br/>I expected Jonah Hill to be a little funnier. I sighed every time Leo was about to give a speech, I could see himself trying to hearken to Gordon Gekko's style of speech yet with a veinier more expletive filled delivery. Leo gave too many speeches. He hammed it up unnecessarily. At one point he went Daniel Day Lewis level type retarded and it became very clear this was the most disappointing ""try hard"" attempt for an Oscar I had seen outside of ""I am Sam""."
"monkyman347","7","21","48","6 December 2013"," The Wolf of Wall Street is among Scorsese's best
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a loud, flashy, and unfathomably vulgar movie populated by a wide variety of repulsive and narcissistic characters. In the hands of a lesser director, it could have easily ended up being unpleasant and unwatchable. However, thanks to acclaimed director Martin Scorsese's clever satirical touch and a witty script that surprises at every turn, The Wolf of Wall Street is a wild and uninhibited thrill-ride of a movie that's hard to forget.<br/><br/>The movie tells the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man who went from struggling to pay his bills to being one of the most wealthy but immoral and corrupt stockbrokers in the country. As he leads an increasingly reckless and dishonest life, Belfort quickly transforms from a law-abiding citizen to an uncaring white-collar criminal.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio may have finally found his Oscar-winning role playing Jordan Belfort. Although his character is far too selfish to be likable, DiCaprio's spirited performance makes Jordan endlessly fascinating in his depravity. Jonah Hill gives an equally impressive performance as Donnie, Jordan's best friend and the co-founder of his firm. Hill's loud-mouthed and often inconsiderate behavior as Donnie makes for some of the funniest scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>Although many of the scenes are far from light-hearted, The Wolf of Wall Street is ultimately a comedy. The characters' wildly reckless and irresponsible actions provide most of the humor. One particularly funny and memorable scene involves Jordan trying in vain to reach his car and drive home while under the influence of drugs he had taken. Unable to stand up and walk to the car, Jordan is forced to slide and drag his way across the floor, all the while yelling incoherent slurred sentences.<br/><br/>Running in at 165 minutes, The Wolf of Wall Street is not a short movie by any means. Although it's always enthralling, there are a few scenes that could have easily been cut to shorten the running time. One series of scenes that wasn't necessary involves Jordan Belfort getting into a dispute with a butler over $50,000 in cash that went missing. The scenes are entertaining enough, but they have no relevance to the story as a whole and aren't essential to the movie.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is not the sort of movie one would expect a 71 year-old man to direct. Director Martin Scorsese is far from an ordinary 71 year-old man though, and with The Wolf of Wall Street he has crafted his most lively, compelling, and outrageous movie in years."

","I admit that first, when I saw this, I was entertained. Despite being able to instantly detect that this movie is 100 % ""greed is good"" capitalist propaganda, I was entertained and I enjoyed this rubbish. Later, when I thought more about it, I was angered and disgusted. <br/><br/>This is why this movie is utterly vile. It's morally corrupting. It's like a toxic splurge to your moral integrity as a human being. It's like being visually raped with all the indecencies and debaucheries imaginable. You feel like something's wrong after watching this movie. You feel like taking a shower to wash away the radioactive feeling this movie left upon you. <br/><br/>It's an attempt to desensitize the viewer and make it accustomed to all ills of contemporary society. It is not by any stretch in any shape or form a critique, it's the opposite, a complete glorification. <br/><br/>I hate how they caricatured Belfort's first wife as homely and boring, just good to throw away like an used rag once you have enough money to buy yourself the new, improved, hot, sexy second wife.<br/><br/>I hate the scene where they shaved that woman's head for a sum of money so she can get bigger breast implants. Is there anything more atrocious and wrong than this scene? That scene portrays the ultimate degradation, as a woman who has been punished with a short haircut I can attest to that. <br/><br/>I hated that scene with Kimmie (I reckon), where she is given as an example of someone who ""made it"" and is able now to buy an Armani suit despite being a former poor single mother with a ton of debt. See, if Kimmie can do it, so can you! It's your fault if you're poor!!! It's the glorification of everything that is wrong nowadays with society. I believe that after this era has passed, people will look at this movie with disdain. I can't imagine what effect would this vile crap would have to young impressionable adolescents.<br/><br/>Please don't watch this, there is absolutely nothing to lose. Once you take away the drugs, money and (not so) soft porn there is absolutely no substance left to this movie."
"haosstoposto","9","5","8","19 June 2014"," Nice view behind the scenes in the world of business
","This movie is known for its many swear words and nudity, but rest assured it is all with a purpose. It is based on an autobiography of Jordan Belfort (played by excellent Di Caprio), stock market manipulator. I will not elaborate much of the story because it is simple, a story of a self made man from his humble beginnings to his downfall, after some criminal activity, of course. The movie gives splendid presentation of how things work in today's economy and stock market exchange. It is a worrisome and at the same time funny business when you see that many people who rule the economy world are primitive, greedy, lying, manipulative, sinful people with short tempers. They apparently try to enjoy everything life has to offer, without limits. They enjoy drugs on regular basis, alcohol and all kinds of sex. In short, they are in all aspects priests of hedonism. Wherever you have success and money, the face under the make-up is ugly. But the most important scene in the movie, which recapitulates the whole thing, is with Di Caprio and Matthew McConaughey at the beginning where things are explained in short. Everything is a game without any meaning. The only goal is to make naive people give your their money and in exchange they receive the illusion that this money exists somewhere multiplied many times. As long they feel rich, they are rich. When they try to cash this money, the moment has arrived to deliver them from their illusion. Go see the movie, it will be informative and you will not regret it."

The internet went out at about the hour and 45 minutes mark, ending the movie, and this might have been the single best thing that ever happened to me.<br/><br/>The damage was already done.

It ruined our evening completely.<br/><br/>I read another review about a guy who took his wife and kids (kids age unclear) to see this, and he ended up apologizing to them.

"neil-476","8","5","8","24 January 2014"," Good, but morally queasy
","Jordan Belfort can do two things extremely well: sell, and teach others to sell. Setting up his own stock brokerage, he proceeds to make vast amounts of money, which he then takes immense pleasure in spending on property, cars, trophy wife, sex and drugs. Lots of drugs. However, the facts that he is not concerned about the morality or legality of how he makes his money attracts the attention of the FBI. First of all, this is a film not to see if you object to nudity, sex, drug use or bad language on screen, because there is a great deal of all these things in this film. Seriously, if this stuff upsets you, stay away.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's film, fictionalised from Belfort's book, makes no moral judgment as to Belfort's activities: indeed, it goes out of its way to make him (as portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio) engaging and likable. Indeed, given that much of the activity here is either callously disregarding of others (much of the money made is at the expense of unseen people who can ill afford it), or dissolute hedonism, it is surprising that the film is often very, very funny (there is a particularly funny sequence showing that DiCaprio has a previously unsuspected gift for physical comedy). The last half hour or so becomes more serious.<br/><br/>There are some terrific performances here, and Scorsese's direction is stunning. At 3 hours it is overlong, and there are two sequences where Belfort delivers speeches to his assembled sales team which outstay their welcome, not to mention the fishbowl scene which has little point. But I remained interested and entertained throughout the film's length, notwithstanding some grave reservations about the lessons being illustrated."

","Didn't have the charm of a typical Scorsese Movie. Leo did great but everything he does and almost the entire move feels one-dimensional. It lacks the depth that leads to deeper thinking and reflecting, which I'm sure Mr. Scorsese would love the audience to have. People all say Jonah Hill is great, but I'm not sure he can hold up such a big supporting role against Leo, with all due respect of course. I loved his small roles across the board which were all absolutely hilarious, but in this one, again, I think his role lacks depth too. All said, Matthew Mcconaughey is absolutely brilliant in his short appearance. I'm glad he and Leo both won Golden Globe, but I'm gonna have to go with him for the Oscar even though Leo is long due for sure."
"akash_sebastian","7","5","8","10 January 2014"," A Hysterical Ride, But A Little More Depth Wouldn't Have Caused Any Harm!
","Scorsese and DiCaprio's fifth venture together, this might be their most mainstream attempt till now. This black-hearted comedy, filled with colour, glamour, parties, money, corruption, drugs and sex, oozes of energy throughout it's three-hour long run-time. I admit it's a fun-filled ride throughout, and it never gets boring. But after a certain point, the narration, the jokes and the parties get monotonous. For such a long movie, the character-development and character-exploration is very poor, and there are so many characters and scenes which don't have any special relevance or importance in the whole story being told. I can't believe it's Terence Winter (from 'The Sopranos' and 'Boardwalk Empire') who wrote the script. The main distraction while watching a biopic like this is that the things shown on screen (fabulous office parties, amount of drugs each of the them take within a day, their ability to function properly in such high, the money lavishly spent around, and so many other things) always make you wonder how much of it is accurate and how much of it is complete exaggeration; you don't get a clear picture of the people and lifestyle of that place and era.<br/><br/>But whatever you say, with whatever is given to him, Leonardo audaciously gets into the skin of the character and is fascinating to watch. Moira MacDonald from Seattle Times aptly says, ""DiCaprio is positively reptilian; he spits out his lines with a nasty glee. You're both horrified and enchanted by this creature - a monster in Armani"". And Jonah Hill is almost as integral to the movie as DiCaprio himself; he's hilariously terrific from beginning till end.<br/><br/>I like that the movie doesn't shy away from being filthy. Plus Scorsese's depiction of a modern tragedy as an epic farce works to its advantage. Looks like Scorsese was in quite a fun mood or pretty high (like the movie's characters) while making this. Though it's a hysterical and thoroughly-entertaining journey, I still don't understand why Scorsese and DiCaprio jumped into making this completely exaggerated alleged life of a convicted swindler. Anyway, the feature is good not great. With a little more depth, the movie could have been timeless."

"h890412722","6","8","15","23 January 2014"," The Truth About TWoWS: Cocaine In The Ass
","INTRODUCTION The Wolf of Wall Street invites you to experience the decadence of Jordan Belfort who during the 80s lived a life of astronomic excess.<br/><br/>PRO 1. Martin Scorsese employs masterful camera technique, bullet-speed paced scenes of typically 10-30 secs a piece peppered with typically engrossing avant-garde shots, eg. deliberate dis-continuity to represent Jordan's distorted view of reality (remember the never ending stairs?), sitting on the boat Jordan bathes in golden sunlight whilst the FBI agent's face is cast in shadow, incessant tell-tale extreme close-ups, sudden one-line inner monologues, mini-dolly inward tracking shots expressing paranoia (DRUGS?!), the bloody tear etc.<br/><br/>PRO 2. DiCaprio, as usual, portrays a fantastically eccentric and charming character that you can't take your eyes off for a second.<br/><br/>PRO 3. Refreshingly - if brutal, at times - explicit and liberal in content, sating our wild greed for materialistic desires perhaps like no movie ever has before... Strangely enough, Gatsby did that too but TWoWS just did it that much better.<br/><br/>CON 1. To use a particularly appropriate analogy, the film writes a cheque that is never cashed: parading endless drugs, prostitutes, luxury yachts, penthouses and aircraft was a great start but the REAL magic trick would have been to sour the experience and convince us that all that wealth and power is worthless in the face of genuine substance of character. Anything less is just a 3 hour music video. And there can be no doubt this was, to some extent, their intention as the line ""chickens come home to roost"" was used to signify exactly that kind of (ineffectual) moment in the story. *I accept that they achieved as much as making the experience giddy, spinning out of control with his sickening addictions. However, the victims of his crimes were never so much as acknowledged, the comeuppance was non-existent and what feeble attempts at self-destruction that were made(eg. crashing the car with child, his wife leaving him, Donnie snitching on him despite his example, the yacht capsizing, the plane exploding, the prison sentencing etc) failed to make anywhere near a balancing impact on the viewer, ultimately resulting in a film that WILL convince you greed can be good... as long as you get away with it.<br/><br/>CON 2. The final scene of the film, in which Jordan is shown to still be enjoying a life of luxury, abruptly sacrificed what little credibly it had established with a sudden, COMPLETELY CONTRADICTORY - if not equally intriguing - point about American capitalism being an injustice we all endorse. If this was the moral of the story - that Scorsese deliberately wanted to antagonise the active audience and promote a change in social attitudes through the offensive continuation of people like Belfort's undeserved success - it felt more like a footnote suggesting an alternative ending to a film that was otherwise already far down a completely different rabbit hole.<br/><br/>CON 3. There was no character progression, no transition, no evolution, no JOURNEY made spiritually. The characters are all exactly the same people as they were at the start of the movie and without that you really ain't got much! *Again, they knew this was happening as DiCaprio becomes a little morose in the last 20 mins, but again, it was just a grain of salt in the face of a kilo of cocaine.<br/><br/>A wonderfully entertaining film with superb production value and buckets of laugh-out-loud moments undermined by a cast and crew with little or no real experience in 'the dark side'. At least The Departed actually DID put you off being a gangster - which is more than can be said of Goodfellas or Gangs of New York - whereas this is a film which failed to prescribe to the only challenge its concept offered; to create a sense of disillusionment about wealth, rather than simply glamorising it and spinning a high powered electro-magnet next to a lot of young / naive people's moral compass. Boardwalk is infinitely superior. Breaking the rules is 'bad' for a reason and whether the criminals of this world have the grace to recognise it or not, they always lose one way or another. I wonder how likely it is that Scorsese or DiCaprio would have made this film if their families had been robbed by Belfort, resulting in their mother or daughter or son or brother dying from a lack of health insurance they could no longer pay for? Not very likely, I'd say..."
"sneaker-peeker","4","8","15","15 January 2014"," The Emperor has no clothes!
","Martin Scorsese directs the story of a man that reached fortune by becoming really good at doing illegal activities and eventually got in trouble with the law in part for his careless behavior and in part for the bad companion he associated with. <br/><br/>One of the few good things of the movie is how it accurately describes the aggressive and intense scene stockbrokers and sellers in general live in, unfortunately that had been done before and done better. Other than that, the movie is just a collection of depraved anecdotes set in slow-mo sequences with cool music (usually ""borrowed"" from other movies) and that makes it a genuine snore fest (literally, there were people snoring in the audience) <br/><br/>I really wanted to like it, but it turned out to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, and I've seen the 'English Patient'. I really don't understand why the movie tries so hard to rub in our faces Jordan Belford's excessive and decadent lifestyle, which btw wasn't as shocking as I was expecting. <br/><br/>It's funny how critics bash repetitive action and destruction scenes in movies like 'Transformers' or 'Man of Steel', but praise repetitive morbid scenes in movies like this one, when in both cases is a tedious experience. <br/><br/>For the first time ever I found myself attending a movie in which I wasn't interested in anything that was going on or cared for any of the characters and when that happens one starts noticing a lot of continuity and edition mistakes that not even direct to DVD movies have, like when a character is supposed to be speaking but even from a behind shot we can see the actor isn't talking at all or the infamous Leonardo Dicaprio ""magic pants"" scene. But the biggest sin of the movie is that it sacrifices the essence over the form, and by that I mean the pace of the story.<br/><br/>Once you get over the so called ""controversial"" scenes, you realize the pace is slower than grass growth, because the story didn't need a 3 hour movie to be told. The length of the movie was a consequence of the depraved overkill. Don't believe me? Take agent Denham for instance (the character played by Kyle Chandler) he was introduced 10 minutes into the movie, so we have a pretty good idea of his role in the story and where it's going, however the character speaks his first line 90 minutes after he's introduced (that's right, I was so bored I started timing things like that) <br/><br/>Grasp that for a few secs. Ninety minutes! I could have walked out, watched 'Gravity' (again) walked back in and the character wouldn't have yet said anything. And how does the plot unfolds in those 90 minutes? It doesn't, all we see is sex, drugs and partying over and over again. I haven't read the book but I believe Scorsese could've made the movie more engaging if instead of focusing so much on Belford's life would have shown how his actions affected people, I mean we're talking about lifetime savings that were robbed and that resulted in broken families,hundreds (if not thousands) of people losing their homes, their health and even their lives. It could've at least bonded emotionally with the audience. <br/><br/>But the fact is, if you've seen the 2 min trailer you already know 90% of the story and even worse, the remaining 10% has also been done before and done better when it was called 'Casino' (btw, the first paragraph of this review was copy / pasted from a review of that movie) which was an exciting story, however when seen in WoWS it seems wasted and clichéd and of course you may also take into account that even when their performances were good, Jonah Hill is no Joe Pesci, Margot Robbie is no Sharon Stone and unfortunately Leo Dicaprio is no Bobby Deniro. <br/><br/>So my recommendation is sneak in, wait until McConaughey's performance is over and then leave. <br/><br/>Don't believe the hype <br/><br/>4/10"

","I wanted to like this film, as I'm a fan of Dicaprio, but I didn't like his character from beginning to end, he lacks any moral compass, totally self centred and celebrates ripping people off to fund his drug fuelled life style. Stopped watching half way through, no gripping story line, lots of soft porn scenes, got boring, but then I'm not a bloke"
"filipemanuelneto","2","3","4","22 November 2016"," Journey to the center of immorality
","I confess I had some curiosity and some expectations when I went to see this movie. Scorcese and Di Caprio are two of the biggest names in the current film scene, and both have provided us with some nice films. So I wasn't surprised with the fuss around the movie but, when I saw it, I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>The film is based on an autobiographical book written by Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who quickly enriched, through financial maneuvers of high risk and zero legality. The book describes not only the business but the life of luxury, drugs and sex that he took, and the way he eventually paid for it. The film, as far as we understand, is quite faithful to the book's account, and the book also makes an apparently true story. The film resembles ""Goodfellas"" in many ways, but with great differences in which the gangster movie gets the better of it. The main problem of this film lies in three essential points: The first point is the apparent glorification of the fraud and Belfort's dissolute lifestyle. The message passed by the film is ""crime pays"". It spends more than an hour telling us, in detail, the outrages of Belfort and his team of bastards without any need, shocking some public, who leave the cinema with the feeling that the film passes an ethically wrong message, and society does not need to receive it because it receives enough bad influences.<br/><br/>The second essential point is the absence of a counterpoint to the scenes of excesses shown. Okay, Belfort is a swine, drug addict and corrupt who has gotten rich too fast and too easy. So? Where is the counterpoint to that? He committed crimes, but what are the effects of his crimes? Who lost out on Belfort's crimes? How can audiences truly realize the size of his mistakes? The public never gets these answers because the film gets too lost in the details of Belfort's scandals. The movie makes people think that Belfort never harmed anyone, and that he was just crazy, or smart.<br/><br/>The third negative point is the construction of the characters. They are black-and-white, without the psychological complexity and refinement that we find in ""Goodfellas"", for example. There's no such thing here. The characters are summed up as junkies, sex offenders, eccentrics, some bored cops and little else. DiCaprio was well enough in his role, but being such an abject role, it's impossible to like and enjoy his performance.<br/><br/>I think Scorcese thought this film as a comedy, but the truth is that it is not funny. The film is morally shocking, not funny. So, it was a bad idea. This film would have been excellent if it had been conceived as a drama and had behind it some moral balance. That was not the case. It is a mad journey through senseless immorality, without notion and without any pretext than easy laughter, and this is quite unpleasant."
"gnix1979","4","3","4","15 January 2016"," Rude and a bit funny, but actually boring
","I finally watched this movie on Netflix after years of people telling me to watch it, mainly specifically for the rude scenes. Those people who watch movies mainly for titillation movies may bring.<br/><br/>So when I got a chance I thought, ""what the hell"", its Scorsese, it has DiCaprio who I am starting to like especially after watching the Departed.<br/><br/>But my god this movie is awful, I mean if you take away the nude sequences and the comedic scenes following drug taking, this movie is actually boring. What is the movie's overall message? I don't think even Scorsese and DiCaprio knew either as it seemed that when stuck they through in more drug taking or nude scenes, probably to wake people up.<br/><br/>I get this movie may be about the limitations of excess, but so much of the movie made no sense and I am still scratching my head. The main one comes near the end of the movie when Naomi says she is filing for divorce. With this based on true events that moment had be bewildered. She knew him during his excessive moment, after all that's how they met. Yet once Jordan starts loosing it all she doesn't want to know even though he had gone clean for two years. Maybe it was the acting that made this scene poor but I couldn't get my head around what was being said.<br/><br/>Even the scenes with the FBI are dreadful, the acting is so poor that the actors especially Kyle Chandler look completely bored out of their minds. As for Jonah Hill, not a big fan but I felt like he was the idiot of the movie which may have been the point of his character, but he was more buffoon then a member of the professional guild of idiocy.<br/><br/>Over all I was extremely disappointed with this movie and I expected so much more. I was even enjoying the movie for the first 38mins or so but then it took a massive nose dive when it went farcical and then the constant introduction of naked women.<br/><br/>If you want a movie involving no brains and buffoonery and rude scenes to remove the boredom, this is for you. If you want a movie about excess that you want to concentrate on, then watch Wall Street with Michael Douglas, that movie is far superior."
"rdrift1879","2","3","4","14 November 2015"," Joyless, juvenile ride that's way too long.
","Hardly a masterpiece. Very uneven in terms of quality. Some good moments, and DiCaprio is at times very effective... at times. It can't quite decide what it wants to be. It can't really explain the central character's decline into debauchery and self-destruction, so it is instead a kind of celebration of decadence. The humor is truly juvenile and the constant parade of sex rarely reveals character or furthers the plot. It seems more an opportunity for the director to explore his own pornographic interests. It actually gets boring. Indeed, the film is at least an hour too long. Just when you think DeCaprio has reached the end of the line, another meaningless hour is ahead. A strange combination of long scenes of exposition and rapidly moving decadence. It doesn't work."

","Self-indulgent film that glorifies instead of satirizing the excess. 40-50% could have been cut and the movie would have been better for it. Endlessly repetitive and not even remotely believable party scenes, as if all the apparent idiots in the audience had not yet fully grasped the idea that these characters were a group of truly awful people incapable of evolution or redemption. No motivation to keep watching. I was done after the scene when Jordan was so loaded he could not walk down the country club's stairway. I was so looking forward to his being killed in a one-car accident after he crawled into his Porsche, and that would finally put an end to this movie. No such luck, but thankfully, there is a stop button on my remote. So glad I didn't waste my money going to the theater for this one."
"baddah","6","3","4","11 May 2015"," The wolf of anything but Wall Street!
","I was so excited about this movie when released, Scorsese and DiCaprio teaming up again, a story taking place in Wall Street, what else to expect. I don't know why but it took me two years to watch it. And I am kind of ""Gosh, it could have waited more"". The reason is it doesn't tell you anything from a financial standpoint. All we see is a greedy broker who suddenly makes lots of money, parties all the time, and too much sex, sex and sex. I think the name should be changed to ""Sodom and Gomorrah All Over Again"" or something like that. <br/><br/>The story doesn't clearly tells how Jordan Belford (DiCaprio) gets rich and climbs to the highs in Wall Str. We know he and his friends sell penny stocks and lead the IPO of SM women shoes, and that's it. It is never told how the penny stock mechanism works, or what happens to the people that trust Belford, and moreover he starts being ""Robin Hood for himself and his colleagues"" but are the rich that fool, do they just give away their money? Similarly, all of a sudden we see him lose everything, FBI investigation, wiring, everything getting out of hand, no story telling whatsoever. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill does a perfect job. DiCaprio too much, overacting again. The speeches he gives in the company, for me, are too emotional, it looks more like a cult religious ritual than an ordinary speech to employees. Maybe they are not ordinary, maybe it is that stealing other people's money needs that kind of encouragement. Lastly, I think, the name of Martin Scorsese makes us expect something great, and this movie does not fit and come anywhere close to that expectation. It seems to me that the fantasies of somebody was pictured."
"EmreBilge","3","3","4","30 April 2015"," Waste of a movie which in fact had had to much potential to be a perfect one.
","I just wonder what big deal it is shooting a movie as long as 3 long hours when you do not have much of a story to tell. Do they sell tickets with higher prices when the movie is longer, forcing 2 and even more time of debauchery scenes on people? By doing so, they end up having a boringly slow-paced movie without telling anything. One gets tired of going over and over the same thing again and again, waiting for the original story to start which doesn't seem to come until after at least one and half hour through the movie. And when you start to think it is finally there, it doesn't take much time to realize that the same crap comes back after only some minutes of a real story. That's when you lose much of your hope and patience for the movie.<br/><br/>The whole story is about a man, Jordan Belford (Leonardo DiCaprio) with little to no moral values becoming rich by stock fraud defrauding people of their hard-won money. They could have comfortably told that the men and his crooks are people without moral values at most in 30 minutes. They could have used the other time displaying how he grew up dreaming becoming rich, what jobs he had had before either out of the stock market or in it, but before having his own business, how he started the the stock broker business, what lows and highs he had in the business, the response of and impact of big stock broker companies, their competition, maybe threats, partnership offers and especially how he had the attention of law enforcement agencies, his trial, his defense, the verdict on him, how his victims financially suffered because of their engagement with him, etc.. Real parts from Jordan's real life and/or some fiction added on it.<br/><br/>The thing is the producer and the director seems to not have really felt like having a story with many interesting parts developed over time and flowing with an acceptable pacing. They must have thought that people just would expect to watch a lot of debauchery and would get excited about that only. I think the not deserved high rating of the movie is because mostly people who are interested in this part voted for it here. Yet, the rating of a movie doesn't give you much of an idea whether you will like it or not. Because your liking is shaped according to your own interests, not others' even if the others are a large group of people.<br/><br/>The bad thing here is they didn't have to have this movie title and this movie topic which reminds people of the stock broker and finance businesses to shoot this. If they had got a relevant movie title and movie topic, only people who are interested in lots of debauchery and vulgar language would have watched it and so much less people would have spoken negatively on it. When you have a financial feeling in your movie title and movie topic, lots of more serious movie buffs who are interested in a serious and interesting story on the business world would go watch it. Plus, they wouldn't have minded some humor in it as long as it supports and pushes the original story development and enables you to have some fun as well.<br/><br/>Now as for my rating; not 1, but 3 for two reasons: 1. Energetic and convincing acting from main protagonists starting with Jordan and his inspirational speeches to his employees (ignoring that he is inspiring not for a respectful cause, but fraud. 2. Even though limited, the questioning of Jordan by law enforcement officials and interesting conversing between the two sides including the one in his yacht.<br/><br/>Spoiler for such a short scene from here (no general insight on how the story goes): I would like to touch down on one short scene which is interesting and which tells a lot about fraudsters' minds. In the scene; during the interaction between Jordan and one of his female employees, Jordan tells her he gave her an advance a few times more than she asked for when she first started the job, because he believed in her. There appears to be good chemistry between the two there and both seem moved. And Jordan then turns to his crowd of employees and tell them all that he also believes each and every one of them. All of them seem moved and become emotional. Watching this scene, I could not help but think that there might be people in this world who so do not mind their illegal activity of cheating people of billions of their hard-won money to the extent that they are able to pretend they are not really even aware that what they are proud of and moved for is really nothing other than cheating and deceiving people, enriching themselves with average people's hard-won money. They pretend and can even delude themselves that they are decent working people with moral values. More and more of such scenes which would make you think about different aspects of life and the business, finance world would have made the movie much more interesting."

The great puzzle is how director Martin Scorsese with his track record could come up with this rubbish?

","The Wolf of Wall Street 75<br/><br/>This film as a whole was very good.

This did portray greed, power, and morality issues very well, but I was expecting a much more uprising of Leo's character in the end, which did not happen. Martin Scorsese, one of the best director's of our time, did bring a very interesting story, that did keep me intrigued for the most part, even at nearly 3 hours long, it just didn't go very developed into the harsh consequences of all of their choices. And as an entirety, the movie was kind of offensive, with 504 f- bombs, constant drug use, and casual sex.

Leonardo DiCaprio pulled off that ""rich young wide-eyed guy"" role quite well, in my opinion. I did think they overdid it with the drug use, although there were points where it became quite humorous. The ""antagonist"" if you could call him that, did come off in the way he should have: a devotee trying to do his job, even if he did take it to a boy-scout level of douchebaggery (is that even a word? LOL). I did not think Jonah Hill fit in his role though, I think they could have chosen another actor with a better persona of what his character was. Will this movie be the next Avatar or Lord of the Rings? No, by no means will it ever be. Will this movie win any awards? No, by no means will it ever win any awards (perhaps maybe a small nomination, but no wins). It is also quite long, almost 3 hours.

"1-0","7","3","4","18 April 2014"," Fast, loud and morally ambiguous: the Scorcese way
","Entertaining, fast-paced, funny and morally ambiguous -- in a lot of ways, very typical Scorcese, and as usual, it's tough to dislike despite generally despicable characters. When I first heard about this movie, I was surprised the director had chosen to take on the story, because Wall Street greed seems like one of the easiest things to hate these days, full of real-life ""despicable characters"" and shady behavior. That this movie was based on truth is almost beside the point: nobody likes guys like Leonardo DiCaprio's Jordan Belfort. In fact, most people hate guys like this.<br/><br/>Of course, Jordan Belfort is a real person, and the larger-than-life escapades of drugs, hookers, big money stock trading, and (many) more drugs make for easy eye candy in Scorsese's hands. He's done it before -- Wolf of Wall Street resembles nothing so much as the director's 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas, from the charismatic protagonist who worked his way up from nothing to obtaining huge power, the backdrop of glorified crime, the FBI investigations, the gluttonous vices, to the faithful wife who finally has enough, and the soundtrack full of classic rock, blues and punk. Some of these things are tried and true Scorcese hallmarks, while others do admittedly feel a bit retreaded.<br/><br/>There are two main differences between Wolf and Goodfellas: the first is that despite a breakneck pace (featuring more varieties of coke snorting and pill-popping than I actually knew existed), the film is too long. There is a lot of good (and truly funny) dialogue in the movie, but a couple of scenes simply seem to go on too long, slowing the movie down without adding much depth to the story. Wolf is three hours long, and had it been edited into a Goodfellas-esque two hours or so, it might have stood along side the earlier film as kind of a sub-masterpiece in a genre that Scorcese pretty much owns.<br/><br/>The other difference is that unlike Henry Hill, you never get the feeling that Jordan Belfort learned any real lesson. He eventually loses everything: his wife, his house, his company, money and friends (one of which is the monstrously and comically greedy Donnie Azoff, played by Jonah Hill) -- and at the end, though taken down a peg as far as monetary success is concerned, doesn't seem particularly emotionally different than when he started. He's a gifted (albeit slimy and terminally selfish) salesperson, and that's probably all he could ever be.<br/><br/>All this said, Wolf is very entertaining. There are lots of funny moments, and plenty more scenes that make your pulse race, if only out of suspense of when someone's going to have a heart attack from doing so many drugs. It does arguably glorify the lifestyle of these traders, but at the same time, it's hard to come out of it thinking you'd ever want to be a part of that world. Scorcese, perhaps better than any filmmaker in history, again demonstrates how success/failure and good/evil are nothing more than sides of a coin, and one's reaction to Jordan Belfort and the other wolves on Wall Street could very well be down to where one stands at the end of the trading day."

","I have not read the book, and after watching the film, I am really not interested in giving one cent towards the ""Belfort Enterprise"".I am really not sure if the reason I constantly got irritated during the film, would be linked to the fact that I just cannot comprehend people to be as void of any moral compass as Belfort and his gang.<br/><br/>This is probably why DiCaprio has been nominated for the Academy Award. His portrayal of this scum of the earth character is quite good, yet becomes quite predictable.<br/><br/>The thing that really bothers me about the Wolf of Wallstreet, is that although there are some hints of ""regret and rehabilitation"" from Belfort's point of view, it does seem like it rather glorifies the sickening business of pump and dump trading, prostitutes, group sex, chauvinism, drug abuse and general hedonism.<br/><br/>Although I don't have an issue per say with a hedonistic lifestyle, it is incomprehensible that someone who is entrusted with money from an already exploited public, could just throw it away with such ease and without remorse.<br/><br/>This is maybe why the film is quite a love/hate spectacle. You get furious with all the role players in this fiasco, especially Belfort as the film aims to portray the life of a ruthless young man who only has money, drugs and sex on his brain, while dragging dozens of others down the drain with him<br/><br/>At the end of the film, I had mixed feelings. I am sure that some of the scenes (for example the group sex and wild parties) were exaggerated either by Belfort himself or by the filmmakers. It really got a bit too much to see all these orgies, who I honestly believe is a figment of Belfort's imagination (or probably spiced up by the producers to make the film a bit more sensationalist). <br/><br/>Where the film succeeds though is the fact that it leaves the viewer hating what these people have done. There is nothing noble about Belfort, his pump and dump operation, or the way that he managed to get a slap on the wrist.The Wolf of Wallstreet made sure that we gain an insight as to where we should not invest our hard earned cash, and that the aspiration to earn millions comes at a high moral price.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, where Belfort appears at a Sales Conference in Auckland, I could only shake my head. There are some sins that should not be forgiven and some people that should never be trusted. This man is one of those that should be avoided at all cost. <br/><br/>To any aspiring business professional that walked out of the film feeling some form of adoration for this man, do a quick reality check and think of the stories that were not told in the film. The story of all those hard working people that lost all of their money due to these buffoons and their aggressive sales pitches and unscrupulous business practices.<br/><br/>Although the movie has moments of brilliance, the fact that it seems to try and portray Belfort as changed, and ignored the pain and suffering that his criminality brought to thousands of investors, left me a cold and annoyed. It seems like a glorified celebration of a wicked conman and his gang of useful idiots. This is why I can only score it a 4/10. <br/><br/>Probably one of the most difficult material Scorsese had to work with, especially given that this is a first hand testimony of an egotistical narcissist who probably will do exactly the same thing again should he have another opportunity. Yes, the film probably made millions because of this controversy, but Scorsese and DiCaprio should have probably taken the moral high ground and avoided falling into the trap of celebrating this conman. For some odd reason I feel like they are now, partly involved in the con, which is a sad thing to say for such an accomplished actor and director."

There isn't even much to say about the plot, because the plot is almost in-existent throughout most of the movie. It's the same over and over, one mind- and plot less party after the other, and it's so much of the same that I stopped the movie after a bit more than half the playtime to cut my time losses.

"Mobithailand","5","4","6","11 April 2016"," The film is a graphic riot of sex orgies and drug-enhanced mayhem - But what's the point?
","I was really looking forward to this film, given that it is directed by one of my all-time favourite directors, Martin Scorsese, and boasts a stellar cast including the ever improving Leonardo De Caprio who played a blinder in last year's Django Unchained. As you might expect from Scorsese, 'Wolf' is certainly a visual feast and much of it is quite entertaining to watch. It is in a different class to American Hustle, but like 'Hustle', it suffers from a lack of 'audience empathy' for the lead character.<br/><br/>There are endless films which have portrayed utterly unpleasant characters in leading roles and the trick of a good movie-maker is to know how to make us 'feel' for these 'bad' people – who might even be rapists or killers – as then we can understand, if not entirely excuse or forgive their transgressions. Sometimes we will see such villains get their comeuppance, which satisfies our sense of right and wrong, and occasionally the characters themselves become remorseful and change their previously evil ways. In some instances, 'baddies' continue their evil ways, but we are shown that even in the worst of people, there is something that we, the audience, can understand, that will encourage us to understand their horrific behaviour and to gain a modicum of our sympathy. Maybe they have severe mental problems, and so on. Hannibal Lecter is a good example as are Scorsese's movies, such as Goodfellas, Casino and Gangs of New York.<br/><br/>But Wolf is not one of these. How can we have any sympathy or feeling for someone who delights in cheating mainly poor, working class folk in Wall Street security scams; indulging in the most extreme, drug- fuelled sexual misogyny; horrific wife-beating, amongst many more dire acts of deprivation? We are somehow supposed to admire this venal slime ball, who lives a life that even Caligula would have envied. Eventually, he even betrays his closest friends in an attempt to save his own skin. Sure, he ends up in jail, but considering all the ordinary folk who he swindled, 3 years wasn't exactly very long and as the film closes he was back to his old tricks, albeit in a different country where there were still some innocent punters who hadn't heard of his malevolent and immoral ways. <br/><br/>The film is a graphic riot of sex orgies and drug-enhanced mayhem and there can be no better director than Scorsese to provide this kind of gratuitous feast to audiences presumably hungry for such soft-porn material. But much as one may be inclined to enjoy the scenes playing before our titillated and shocked eyes, we have to wonder whether it is all so necessary. What is the point? I for one do not believe that anyone could have been quite so outrageously reprehensible in his lifestyle as we are led to believe the Wolf was. If he was that bad, how in earth could he have ever got his act together sufficiently to cheat yet more people and run his huge, despicably corrupt organisation?<br/><br/>De Caprio throws everything but the kitchen sink into his performance, but to me, it was totally over the top and frankly, unbelievable and without credibility. I think his role would have been more meaningful, and would even have gained some measure of sympathy from us if he had been more laid back, and not quite so one-dimensionally, utterly heartless, selfish and evil. If he had shown us a little more about what made him tick, and what changed him from being a decent, hard-working married man, into this horrific, drug-addled, sex- monster, I truly believe it would have been a far more enjoyable and satisfying two hours of entertainment. But clearly the scriptwriters and director didn't want to go that way and it is a shame, as it could have been a much better movie if they had.<br/><br/>The very first two IMDb reviews say: Soul-Sucking Mind-Poison ""DON'T PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE!""

","This film might have been made the best way it could be made. Seeing as it was chronicling the real life of a stock market corrupt team. But it wasn't enjoyable to me at all. It might have served the role of informing us that Stock Market workers are corrupt. But I think most people going in were already convinced of that. My take is that the subject of stock market corruption could be better covered as a dark comedy in a similar style as Dr. Strangelove. Or the film could have been entertaining if the entire thing was covered from the perspective of the cops who took Belfort down. The way this film was made just makes me hate the world for producing such nastiness both in the real world and on the big screen. Not all films have to be happy. But there has to be some hope involved in the story somewhere. Sure the guy went to jail at the end. But his sentence was so small that it felt just like another defeat. Also, the film was REAAALLY long."

","There was a real opportunity here to make a powerful statement as well as a highly entertaining film but it got completely thrown out by the director & author of the screenplay. Instead of a stinging indictment and/or satire of Americann greed & lust we get an over- the-top presentation of sex & drugs as male pre-pubescent fantasy. Everything the average 13 year-old imagines his future to be. Not surprising given that the director Martin Scorsese gives the majority of his films the same blockbuster treatment: everything short of singing & tap dancing. The only other director using a similar approach is Baz Luhrman. Interesting that Dicaprio starred in this movie & Gatsby in the same year, highly miscast in both. Casting him is understandable: he's likable & cute & popular with the mainstream movie-going public. Here he basically replicates his performance in Catch Me If You Can. I don't say he's a bad actor, just wrong for the part. Here he reminds me of Bob Hope in something like Monsieur Beaucaire: likable but clueless as to what makes the character he's playing tick. Years ago there was a TV series called Profit in which Adrian Pasdar perfectly depicted a similar character. Ah well, gotta go for the biggest-paying demographic, I guess."

Despite that being the situation, my girlfriend, exercising better judgment that I, leaned over to me and whispered ""I can't sit here and watch this trash"". I was immediately moved by her moral gesture and decided to follow her out, with our friend staying behind to watch the rest. We had only gotten about 30 minutes in. But it was more than enough. I have never seen anything so raunchy from a Hollywood film, especially in theaters.<br/><br/>To be honest, I recently let my curiosity get the best of me and I watched a bit more of it on Netflix but it left me feeling the same way as before. I had to rate it at least 5 stars because after all, you can't rate every movie you dislike one star as though its the worst film ever made, nor can you rate every good movie a ten. I does have a lot of really talented actors and it was a visually well made, high budget movie so 5 stars feel fair. If they limited the F bombs to a reasonable level and left out the ""just short of porn"" sex scenes then I would have really liked this film.<br/><br/>However, it's just so filthy and raunchy, it's insulting. They can't go more than a sentence without saying the F-word. The over the top sex scenes and overall crudeness of the movie gets old very fast and your just sitting there like ""oh come on! seriously?!"" It seems as though Leo DiCaprio can't do a movie anymore unless he's playing a despicable foul mouthed pig. I'm not someone who won't watch a movie because of language or violence or nudity, but this movie is just so over the top that I can't sit through it and feel good about myself.<br/><br/>If you have no moral boundaries and no ethical compass, and nothing bothers or offends you, then this is probably a highly entertaining and enjoyable movie. I'm sure if I spoke like the characters in this film and lived a shameless existence like them, I would probably be writing a very different review.

It forced me to read enough comments written in native English and doing research in my Oxford dictionary in order to be able to fully describe its nauseating abomination. So here I go: It is a mind jarring experience, detestable at its best, utterly obnoxious and vomit invoking for the most part. The so called plot is an incredibly poor excuse to graphically display all sorts of what is supposed to be exciting porn for infantile teenagers but really is nothing more than a boring nerd boy's fantasy of what that would be like. So being insanely rich and completely void of all morals means...(I really hate having to call this a ""spoiler"") you can marry the blondest of all blondest bimbos and the hottest of all hottest babes at the same time? In one person? Wooow... Sorry for digressing into trying to actually make a movie sound more thoughtful than it deserves. It falls flat on all accounts, it is not worth watching except maybe for the list of people who produced it and the studio which spit it out so they and it can better be avoided like a toxin. I guess, toxins at least don't give you a feeling of comatose boredom which this movie did until I finally gave up trying to become a masochist and simply turned it off. A disgusting, atrocious, infuriatingly overrated, unnecessary and offensive movie. Scorsese and DiCaprio could have done the exact same thing by taking a dump into a bucket and asking the audience to pay money so they can eat it for three hours. They surely would have done it and succeeded if there weren't laws helping the mentally wrecked doing this kind of harm to themselves. The only credit I can give to this film is that the Internet spared me the embarrassment to waste money on it and I learned one word which completely sums it up: preposterous."

It is oddly like a drama by Christopher Marlowe, or one of the other lesser Elizabethan playwrights: there is no real plot line, no character development, but rather a constant and increasingly frenetic repetition of what has gone before. The self-indulgence of the whole is reflected in the performances. McConaughey's chest-thumping scene is painful to watch. Jonah Hill does his usual thing. Leonardo diCaprio smirks his way through the film, though admittedly that may suit the character. (But pity those early enthusiasts who referred to the 'lude scene as ""brilliant."") Bright spots are Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent; admittedly I may have liked him because I hoped he would arrest Jordan, and cut the movie short.

The movie is tedious, too much talking about nothing (and the dialogs aren't all that super either), predictable, drugs and sex seem to be an end instead of a means for the story to be told (and as I said, even the sex is boring).

","Wolf of Wall St. is a fascinating film by a master filmmaker, bringing 40 years of skill to the table; from casting, to shot selection, to how he pulls you into that world. And a guy who just plain having fun. The 3-hour film, traces the rise and fall of Wall St con man Jordan Belfort. A tightly constructed film, I wasn't bored for a minute.<br/><br/>There were some people who kicked up a fuss about the film and its glorification of these slimy characters, their materialistic lifestyle, and their treatment of women as nothing but sex objects. Some have said that the film glorifies that lifestyle, but to me, Winter (screenwriter) and Scorcese went out of their way to show the reality of it. The film focuses on how animalistic and primal people can become when greed takes them over. The obsession with money and power becomes a pathology. This, of course, is what many Wall St people will loathe about the film.<br/><br/>As for accuracy, I'm sure Jordan Belfort (who the film is based on and worked as a consultant on the film), embellished a few things, but according to one of the FBI agents who worked on the case, many of the more outrageous aspects depicted in the book and film were accurate.<br/><br/>The sad part is that even though there will will many Wall St workers and finance people who will watch the film and think, ""That's a bunch of crap. They're painting with a broad brush. It's not fair,"" there will be far too many young (and not-so-young) Wall St up-and-comers who will ignore the whole last hour of Wolf of Wall St., and simply look at the first 2 hours as an inspirational tale of the American dream."
"aquameanie","1","4","6","15 February 2014"," The Two Wolves of Hollywood
","I have never reviewed anything, but this was so bad, I had to start! How a potentially educative ""cautionary tale"" in the capable hands of a respected director could go SO wrong, I don't know. I came to watch hoping that financial literacy was going to be meaningfully imparted in the form of a cinematic cultural artifact. I left knowing that Scorsese ad DiCaprio are con-men shills of a gross, greedy system themselves. <br/><br/>That Wolf is nominated for 5 Oscars and highly ranked on this site just makes me suspect that much of the $100 M went to pay rate-farms in Indonesia because it sure didn't go toward making a film of any discernible quality. There is no other explanation.<br/><br/>This film was 3-hours of the most clichéd B-roll of snow blowing, hookers, suitcases of cash, implants, pool parties, peroxide etc. scrounged from the editing room floor of a rap video from the 90s. With white people. Only worse: it wasn't even entertaining! At least 2 Live Crew kept it down to a couple of minutes. The Wolf on Wall Street, with its lack of meaning, lack of character development, or plot beyond what was obvious, had no excuse to drag on as long as it did.<br/><br/>Like in a stripclub, one is desensitized to the in-your-face porn antics within minutes. But in this film, the viewer is psychologically bludgeoned with montage after montage of flabby bodied, unerotic, un-interesting party scenes because the filmmakers had no other creative tools to convey the trouble with excess or debauchery, except to literally show it over and over. As for the other parts of the film, my masochism musta been what got me through the reels of tedious un-funny, un-stimulating, dialogue, schticks and Jonah-Hill-isms. <br/><br/>Except maybe the little girl who plays the daughter, who is as exhausted, and confused as we are when DiCaprio wakes her up during one of his highs to go for a drive, there is no character to care about in the film. Two thirds into it, there was almost potential to perhaps care about a woman who DiCaprio singles out in a melodramatic speech to his staff as someone who had nothing, but climbed her way up to her current Mercedes-driving, $2000 suit-wearing glory. But, we'd never seen this woman before and never did again. DiCaprio's character's own climb to the top wasn't even interestingly laid out as to why we should care. None of the cartoonish con-men ever express any other dimension of their character, other than horny, greedy or high. Matthew McConaughey's character does the equivalent of read his own bio with a wink and a smile and then disappears. The trophy wife, who we do see in varying circumstances is NOWHERE nearly as interesting as the Sharon Stone character in Casino. Here, DiCaprio marries this chick when he's rich, and then she dumps him when he's poor. So what.<br/><br/>When an over-the-top autobiography gets put on the big screen, by the biggest names in Hollywood, with a huge budget, that is a non-thinking formula for box-office success. Scorsese and DiCaprio sacrificed any and all interesting artistic choices for this shiny turd of a film. And for this, they cannot be trusted as true artists again. Their motive was profit at the viewer's time and expense proving they are exactly the picture of meaningless greed they purported to warn us about in this film about Wall St. And you know what? This wasn't even really about Wall St. It was about a 90s infomercial dude who is as long winded as this film is."
"siderite","7","4","6","3 February 2014"," Even when you have everything, you still want more
","It is difficult to watch a movie that you absolutely know how it will end. Scorsese is known for casting Leo diCaprio as the young energetic underdog that gets the world, only to lose it wholesale. The other movies of this sort, though, were interesting because they featured the criminal underworld or some other bizarre and exotic environment. The Wolf..., in comparison, is a movie about spammers and thieves that get drunk and high all the time in order to keep up with their own fantasies about their lives. Really, you could make it about Romanian hackers and it would have been a much better and fun film, with the same general ideas.<br/><br/>Even worse for this three hour movie, Matthew McConaughey appears in a tiny role at the start of the film and explains it all: you don't want to make money for the client, you want to keep him betting on stocks, getting fabulously rich - on paper, while you get hard cash from commissions. The basic trade that we are supposed to empathize with is phone spamming and conning greedy and uninformed clients.<br/><br/>The money that gets generated for the stock traders ""more than we knew what to do with"" doesn't go into ""diversification"", doesn't go into growing the people that until then were hungry bastards looking to pay their mortgage, it isn't invested into anything. It just goes on expensive cars, yachts, prostitutes, drugs and trophy wives. And while I admit many people would sell their soul to get to the point where they can do that, the outcome of such a behavior is obviously not good if that is all you do.<br/><br/>And I am not being moralizing here. Hell, screw the bitches and snort the dope, but do something with yourself, plan for when the money will not be so good, make sure you will never get screwed over by technicalities, government agents, false friends or accidents. Instead the characters in the film act like there is no tomorrow. Literally they behave like the end of the world is around the corner. For three hours. It quickly gets old.<br/><br/>There is some value in the ending, when DiCaprio's character is terrified he is going to get to jail, only to discover than when you have money, it isn't that bad at all, but other than that I just wanted to see the film end. There is no cat and mouse game with the FBI, nothing comes as a surprise, it just goes on and on with how wonderful it is to have enough money to spend it stupidly when you earn it by praying on people even more stupid than yourself.<br/><br/>Bottom line: while DiCaprio makes a good role - after all, he is a damn good actor - the film itself is only mildly entertaining. Considering it is based on an autobiographical book, you might forgive the film for being too real and too boring, but there is still the matter of why someone would choose to make a movie on such a material. I watched the film with two other people and they were both awed by the opulence depicted in the film and the comparison of their own lives to that of the protagonists. I guess there is that; learn that if you are ingenious enough, hungry enough, you can make yourself have all the money in the world. Perhaps Scorsese wanted this, or perhaps he missed the point with me, because all I felt when the film was over is that I am happy with my life and I am glad the movie finally ended.<br/><br/>It is interesting to read about Jordan Belfort, that's a real person. Also, his story is told in another movie from 2000, called Boiler Room, with Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel. Might be worth a look."
"hudini669","6","10","20","9 January 2014"," Over-hyped but mediocre at best
","With all the hype surrounding 'The Wolf of Wall Street', I went to see it expecting something mind-blowing, but what I've seen was a mediocre biopic at best.<br/><br/>It is clear that Scorsese's intention here was obviously to make the new 'Goodfellas' or even the new 'Godfather', but most of the time 'The Wolf' runs flat and fails to engage. I couldn't really tell whose fault that was, because the the pacing was pretty solid for a three hour flick and the balance between comical and serious bits was just about right, but I somehow failed to care about pretty much anything going on in the film.<br/><br/>Everything that happens on the screen seems to just happen; there is no real plot, there is no real suspense and there is no real development of any kind. All character development happens in the first 15 minutes or so, and from that point on 'The Wolf' is just a steady flatland ride filled with gang bangs, drug abuse, cock jokes, cursing and generally bad taste, most of which serves the story itself in no way, but has somehow managed to create enough hype to be listed among 100 best films of all time here at IMDb.<br/><br/>I can understand all the hype about Leonardo DiCaprio, because he was really good, but the sea of mediocrity surrounding him might have made him look a bit better than he actually was. What I don't understand is the general word about this film being the best Scorsese's work ever. In my opinion, this one doesn't come even close to 'The Departed', not the mention the real classics as 'Goodfellas', 'Casino' or 'The Taxi Driver'. What I especially do not understand are the stories about Matthew McConaughey deserving an Oscar for supporting role... for a mere three minute long Christopher Walken cameo impersonation?! I mean, come on, people!<br/><br/>All in all, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is not a bad film, but it's far from good and it's far from being a classic. It has its moments, but most of the time it's far from excellence once made by Martin Scorsese. I wouldn't go that far to call it forgettable, but I have a strong feeling it won't be talked about this much in just a year or two. Time will tell.<br/><br/>6/10"

"chaos-rampant","Null","7","13","11 January 2014"," What we allow
","Okay, let's try from the start to escape the whole debate raging about this and find our way back to the crux of the thing. This should be a way of life, swim through swathes of unnecessary noise so we can gleam the fact that cuts through and illuminates.<br/><br/>We have not figured life and death after all, it shouldn't be so easy to say anything about this man one way or the other. To show this, we need to find a human moment in the film, pluck it from the fabric and pose to ourselves the question. For me it's this: at one point the protagonist, a Wall Street scam artist, has been invited up to the apartment of a sexy blonde and contemplates sleeping with her or going back to his wife and rich, comfortable life, when she steps out naked. No one has to know, it is there for the taking. What do you do?<br/><br/>This is the whole thing right there. What if you could pick up a phone and make boatloads of money as easily as he could sleep with that girl, and you never have to know, no one has to know, where they have been torn form? That's not to say there can be no answer, we just can't pretend it's an easy one that one way or the other wouldn't keep us up at night. <br/><br/>The film is this sale made to us. It has to be convincing, every sale does. It has to lure us with the appeal, all that partying. We see that it's easy when you don't have to know, when the knowing is at an abstract distance, but the good life can be enjoyed today. We would like it to be this way perhaps. The film ends with the man making this sale to an audience eager to learn the trick. <br/><br/>It falls on us to see that it's a scam. This is not because eventually he pays dearly for it with all he had, because even in the end he has it pretty easy. The real Belfort spent an obscenely lenient 22 months in prison and is out now giving pep talks on strategy. This shows that we have built a system as fundamentally ignorant as the man himself: common burglary without prior record gets you 2-4 years for stealing pennies to Belfort's dollars, because in Belfort's case it is a subtler manipulation at that abstract distance.<br/><br/>It's a scam because it trades all that ferocious spending of time and energy and gives no real happiness back, and it can only be deeply apparent as such when we have to swim to that realization against the current of self who is entertained by the partying.<br/><br/>No mistake, Scorsese gambled here more than say, Goodfellas. <br/><br/>He lost, because the choice of topic demands most of the artistry goes on this side of the telephone and the overkill of meaningless partying sticks much more than the glimpse of his daughter's face as she watches him stoned out of his mind. It is all of course adapted from a book by Belfort himself on that life, the unreliability is signaled early with the car switching colors to the narrator's whim.<br/><br/>There's one masterful moment I will carry with me though, because it casts light on a more ambiguous human nature, and this is the crux of the thing. How can I become the person that will make me and others happy? Money isn't the answer of course, we see that it merely substitutes the anxiety of not having with a different set. But it cannot have anything to do with simply sticking to principle either, any more than expounding on gravity can make you a good skier.<br/><br/>The moment is when Belfort and his friend are both stoned in his place to near incapacity, his friend is choking to death and a Popeye cartoon is playing on TV. It's all there so clearly, cutting through right and wrong. What happens there? An image that pops up and surrounds that incapacitated self, drawing him out of his stupor to do something for someone else. It couldn't work if the urge wasn't there, and if the image did not inspire that self to become a person worthy of the story. This is not poetry but how the mind works, we are the thoughts we allow. This is to see the desire for the girl or money palpably rise in front of us, instead of at a distance. Still no easy answer, but now we're on to something."

","The movie is a major disappointment to DiCaprio's fans. It does highlight the life of the famous stockbroker Jordan Belfort and the ease of corruption within the walls of Wall Street firms. However, the plot is very weak -superficial- and I am pretty sure it could have been done better. Martin Scorsese did nothing creative, no twists or even focusing on the main points. Sometimes you are lost in the events that you forget about the movie and what it represents. It could have been better by focusing on the process of corruption and its implications, but the director chose to focus more about Belfort's personal life, which is logical as the movie is based on Belfort's own memoirs ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Catching the Wolf of Wall Street."" As for DiCaprio himself, he did an awesome job as usual. His speeches were sincere -however sometimes overacted. Surprisingly, I will be disappointed if he wins the Academy Award this year for his role. DiCaprio was excellent and everything, but I will be disappointed that he won it for that specific movie. The scene when he was high on ""Lemmon 714"" is unnecessarily elongated, and for sometime I felt like I was watching a low-budget comedy movie. Overall the movie is good, but not as expected. I would advise you to watch the movie just to have an idea about how corrupted financial firms of Wall St. can be, and how ugly it can get drowning in your lust and greed."

","The Wolf of Wall Street; a three hour long masterpiece. When I started it, I didn't know how long it was.

It just continued to get better as you watched. I was glued to the screen all the way through and was mesmerized by Leonardo Di Caprio and his deserved Oscar winning role. I applaud his talent of multi genre acting, and how he managed to fit that all in one movie. He did so well I started to believe he was actually a filthy rich stock broker. Also Margot Robbie did an astounding job as Jordan Belfort's wife Naomi. Martin Scorsese deserves another Oscar. Him and Leo make the best team in many movies. Plus one that is based on a true story (and at the same time a book) is always promising. There was no way this movie could have gone bad, every way you look at it, its got the best actors, narration, camera work, and script and screenplay.

I found myself enjoying his uncomfortable performance. Not so good things: Wow, this movie disturbed me. Excessive drug use. Hard to believe he didn't kill himself from an overdose. Or that he was able to function at all at such a high capacity while being so wasted ALL the time. Excessive sex and nudity. We get it. Belfort was a drug, sex and money addict. This was the late eighties/early nineties. One wonders if he hadn't contracted or spread HIV/AIDS or some other horrible STD without even knowing or caring if he did. To me in my world, the orgies and sex scenes, even with his wife, were very nasty and disturbing. I often wonder why the Long Island, NY accent is alway so hyper-exaggerated by actors who are putting it on for their role. But this is my pet peeve as a born and raised Long Island girl, although now living in the Southwest. I also really enjoyed learning about the world of stocks and stock brokering. Lead to good conversation with my husband who does dabble in stocks from time to time. I do recommend this movie. However if you have extreme sensitivity to foul, awful language, sex and drugs I would skip it. I'm F, 52yo"

","This movie wants to show excess, but they should have gone way, way further, I mean into minute, subtle details. I just realized they showed excess but very little disregard, so there's no point of reference for any of it. It's like watching a car supposedly racing, but there's a white background behind the car. Where is this all heading? How can I tell it's even moving? What else is there to give me any faith in what they are presenting? In this movie, nothing.<br/><br/>I didn't believe it was indicative of anything, only an amped up story of one person's life.

What FBI agent would say ""Can you say that again, exactly as you said it"", as his partner moves closer to the person he's talking to?<br/><br/>I wanted to title this review 'I could go at any time', because I am such a huge Leonardo diCaprio fan. And Jonah Hill, too, really all the recognizable names involved.<br/><br/>I saw an interview on TV with Matthew McConaughey, in which he said that they had incorporated one of his own pesonal gestures into the movie. He described it, and yes, it was there, twice. At the time of watching the interview I thought, oh dear, they really don't have much to work with do they, if they are resorting to this. And it's true. This is really a ""hey, let's do that!"" kind of movie, except what made them giggle on set doesn't work on screen.<br/><br/>The guy who made Goodfellas and Casino made this?

"alonesomeexplorer","1","6","11","2 March 2014"," Ridiculously boring
","I was intending to say a lot of things about this movie (my first review on IMDb and it turns out the spell checker on here thinks I've spelt the word 'movie' incorrectly....it also thinks I've spelt IMDb incorrectly and for some reason won't let me change the 'b' to a capital no matter how many times I edit and Preview) but it seems like luci1977 (and a few others) have already covered most of what I was going to say.<br/><br/>So rather than re-iterate what luci1977 already said (and I encourage you to read his/her review), I shall simply add to it.<br/><br/>3 hours for a movie should in theory be long enough to cover a lot of things but unfortunately for this movie, so little was. Now at this point, I must admit that I only watched the first one hour of this movie. I simply couldn't bring myself to watch the rest and here's why. Within the first 5 minutes, the movie paints a reasonably good picture for the viewer in terms of what it's about, namely drugs, money, swindling and prostitutes. Between the first 5 minutes and the first 60 minutes however, nothing new happens. There's barely a plot and little or no character development. So does the movie get better after the first one hour? I obviously wouldn't know and moreover, that's irrelevant. For most movies, the plot would be thicker than a milkshake after the first one hour and the story would be heading towards some sort of climax. For all I know, this movie could very well have become interesting after the first one hour but I couldn't forgive it for wasting an hour of my life and I didn't allow it to (possibly) redeem itself.<br/><br/>The narration is another thing that gets on your nerve. Clearly it was important to have constant narration to provide extra information to the viewer. Clearly, 3 hours of screen time was not enough. But does it in fact provide additional information? No. The narration is as pointless as the movie itself. Every now and then, you might hear the voice of Leo say something along the lines of ""we were having the time of our lives"". One would think that snorting cocaine with a 100 dollar note off the body of a high class prostitute would be quite self-explanatory but I suppose the makers of the film obviously thought otherwise.<br/><br/>There was however one thing this film did well with its long run time and constant narration. It brought back memories of another one of Martin Scorsese's movies: Goodfellas. Unfortunately, The Wolf of Wall Street lacks one key ingredient that Goodfellas (and any other half descent movie) possesses: a point."

","I'm not sure just how far into ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" that the realization finally hit me that Martin Scorsese had made this movie before. It's ""Goodfellas"" with different criminals, and it's not as good. This film is longer, and raunchier -- I wished my soul could take a shower fairly early on -- and while it's certainly lavishly made, with great acting, this restatement lacks the charm that the mob movie had. The artifices that were so novel in 1990 (the narration, playing to the camera, the long steadicam shots) now look derivative, and you cannot root for these characters like you might have before, even though both casts are replete with lowlife, scum criminals. At least Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy were likable lowlife, scum criminals. Jordan Belfort and his partners are simply reprehensible.<br/><br/>I expected the cursing and didn't mind it, even though this film probably tops both seasons of ""Deadwood"" in uses of the f-word, because many New Yorkers do talk that way. I must admit that I was a bit taken aback by the gratuity of the sex scenes, which made ""Caligula"" look tame by comparison, and I can't imagine that people could possibly take the amount of drugs depicted in this film and still live, much less function. Perhaps I've lived a sheltered life. But this film is not for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I very much enjoyed the performance of Rob Reiner as Belfort's father, loved Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent, and thought it was a great touch to have Bo Dietl play himself (plus that he appears in both ""Wolf"" and ""Goodfellas""). There are many faces you've seen before, and I'll probably spend a good deal of time surfing the IMDb to see all the connections. And I hope that we see more of Margot Robbie -- meaning seeing her in more films, since we will have already seen all of her in this one -- as this is her meatiest role since ""Pan Am,"" and she proves here that she has some real acting chops.<br/><br/>In short, I would say that you should save your money on this film, and buy the DVD to ""Goodfellas,"" that you many enjoy it in its brilliance over and over, instead of this rehash."
"pauldbwatkins","9","7","14","12 January 2014"," Excessus Mentis: A Defence of Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street.
","Martin Scorsese's latest offering The Wolf of Wall Street has divided audiences into two camps: those who praise the work as a masterpiece of cinematic verve, and those who say it glorifies white-collar crime along with the film's antihero, real life penny stock criminal, Jordan Belfort. While not quite the magnum opus some call it, I think The Wolf of Wall Street is an inspired parable and cinematic opera about greed, excess, and the perversion of the American dream.<br/><br/>Hollywood, like the stock market, is big business, netting profits in the billions every year. In many ways, Hollywood is emblematic of the American dream; certainly the cinema is a place where we exchange money to watch our dreams, fantasies, and even nightmares unfold on a big screen in a dimly lit room. Scorsese, who often challenges Hollywood sensibility, continues to be one of American cinema's great dream makers and storytellers, gifting the world films like Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990), and The Departed (2006).<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street continues Scorsese's fixation with crime, identity, and machismo, as well as his Roman Catholic concerns around guilt and redemption. However, unlike Scorsese's other gangster films there is hardly any graphic violence in Wolf, although there remains, perhaps more than any of his films, his liberal usage of profanity. It could be argued, and probably should, that Belfort's obsession with controlling women's bodies, as well as his betrayal of his victim's trust, is violence. The narrative techniques and do-it-yourself rise to power in Wolf parallels Goodfellas, but instead of mob bloodshed and revenge, Scorsese focuses his lens on robber baron, capitalistic sociopath, and real life penny stock criminal/self-made multi- millionaire, Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>For me, the film was a little like travelling through Dante's fourth circle of Hell (greed/avarice) for three hours, although I do admit that I laughed a fair bit, which is sort of the point of the grotesque parody. The Wolf of Wall Street is an irreverent and potent satire about greed, excess, and the perversion of the American dream. The writing is spot on, Scorsese's directing is inspired, providing lots of room for his actors to improvise, and DiCaprio gives the most dynamic performance of his career. Matthew McConaughey, who also gave a great performance in last year's Dallas Buyers Club, steals a scene in the movie. Some might feel the film glorifies greed. Jordan Belfort glorifies greed. America glorifies greed. The film does not. In some disturbing ways, Belfort was simply being American. As Belfort belts out in one of his many excessive speeches in the film: ""This right here is the land of opportunity. This is America. This is my home! The show goes on!""<br/><br/>My full review available here: http://pauldbwatkins.com/2014/01/12/the-wolf-of-wall-street/"

Most recovering addicts that I have met have tried to honestly reflect their past and turn away from it. Mr. Belfort has found a new drug in reveling in the hangover of his past.

He was convicted of fraud crimes related to stock market manipulation and running a penny stock boiler room, for which he spent 22 months in prison.' In The Wolf of Wall Street Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort, a Long Island penny stockbroker who served 36 months in prison for defrauding investors in a massive 1990s securities scam that involved widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, including shoe designer Steve Madden. But neither of those capsules prepares us for the outrageously humiliating debauchery of this film's presentation. It is noisy, unremittingly loud and crude, has a script that basically consists of expletives, and in the end makes us feel embarrassed to be a member of the human species.

","Controversy has surrounded this movie, for good reason. It's about Jordan Belfort, who sold tons of worthless stocks to tons of investors, who lost tons of money. The movie is adapted from Belfort's book, so it's from his perspective, all about him. And, so it's largely an insane celebration about him and his perverted life screwing people over. He's doing great at the beginning of the movie, and he's doing great at the end of the movie, out of prison after a slap on the wrist. He screwed over those he worked with, wearing a wire so he could cut a sweet deal with the Feds.<br/><br/>The actors and filmmakers want to be held blameless, as if they are shocked! that the guy they did a movie about actually existed, and actually did what he did. But, they are complicit in Belfort wanting to celebrate his own life. Yeah, it's a relatively good story. But, the movie is all about real criminals, and it completely ignores their real victims. I doubt that's of any concern to anyone who made this movie.<br/><br/>As far as the film goes, it's well made, and the first hour plays to all of Scorsese's strengths. But, the following two hours show where the film starts to get long in the tooth. The writer is Terence Winter, who writes for TV. There, you have hours and hours to tell a story, and that's what he's used to. So, brevity isn't his skill. And, Scorsese most likely gets absolute Directors' Cut on everything he does. And, there's a reason why directors rarely get that. It's because directors can get self indulgent, and Scorsese does here. Big time!<br/><br/>We get it. Belfort and company did tons of drugs and had tons of sex with tons of women. I'm no prude. Not at all. If the material justifies it, no problem. But, once the point is made, it's made. So, do we need a dozen scenes of the characters doing tons of drugs? Do we need a dozen scenes of women having to do full-frontal nudity so they can get movie work and get to be in a Scorsese movie? No. Plus, all of that must take a half hour of the three-hour running time. And, it's 100% unnecessary. It's just excess for the sake of excess.<br/><br/>Can the movie be separated from its subject matter? To me, no. The same goes for me more and more with movies like Scorsese's ""Goodfellas,"" etc. Real criminals hurt real victims with no remorse. In an objective view of those films, are they good? Yes, they are. But, those making those films know what they're doing. They know they're glorifying their subjects. Is that a problem? It is for me.

","The Wolf of Wall Street tells the story of Jordan Belfort's life in stocks. It depicts a world of rich people who are daily flooded with money but do not know what else to spend on other than their excess. That is just one side of the story, but that is what the audience is wholeheartedly focused on. It's not exactly only about a man who had done wrong choices then eventually learn by his mistakes in the end. It's more of a raucous portrait about rich people being petty, having way too much fun on their lust, never realized that they actually look terrible by it until they eventually become the worst of themselves. The overall film is enormously entertaining. It may bring relentless filth on screen, but the awareness comes right when things really get out of hand.<br/><br/>There is nothing more important in their world other than money, sex and drugs. It is ought to be satirical, but one may think that it is taken too far, only when they take the comedy too seriously. The real plot here is Belfort's actual crimes in Wall Street. The film doesn't make those acts look much of a big deal. His victims are never shown because apparently the viewers should be rooting for him. It's almost just a series of outrageous parties, and schemes that will keep their fortune and pleasures going. Despite of their behavior, we are still obligated to care about these ""good guys.""<br/><br/>The film somewhat comes close to Martin Scorsese's other film, Goodfellas. Aside of the throughout narration, the story has some similarities: a man who love affairs with a job that betrays both of his marriage and any moral standards, however the guy lacks the sympathy which defines the character's humanity. The main character's human figure here is all the negative sides. Compare him to the other goodfella, his motivations and striving are much petty, because of course, he has it all.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese makes it feels like a comedy which is kind of appropriate. It's swift and energetic, which thoroughly provides endless entertainment. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply terrific, from unhinged crawling to spilling charisma, he has made Belfort an effectively awful yet magnetic cinematic character you'll encounter in recent memory. His co-star Jonah Hill shares the same feat as his twice the arrogant, profane and half-witted pair. Also notable strong performance from Rob Reiner and Kyle Chandler. And for only few scenes, Matthew McConaughey steals all the ones that he is in.<br/><br/>Everyone might think the ending is as much as inconsequential than it suggests; the point can probably be the ugly price of the person gets in the end is within himself, a perfect life won't fix a broken man, or misusing cash and power will always cause a lot of trouble. There is many suggestions about its themes. But in the end, Jordan Belfort is just a another man in the community who is blinded by the typical extreme lust and fortune, and for sure anyone would get the same condition if they ever get to taste its pleasures. In spite of treating everything as a joke, the film suddenly becomes compelling. That's the kind of trick it has. Anything else, The Wolf of Wall Street is just insanely fun. Even for its lengthy runtime, it's able to be very enjoyable every minute of it."

Massively bloated, zero narrative tension, embarrassingly rip-off style to Goodfellas - good performance from Di Caprio of course who is a fine actor though this must be his 19th film on the trot playing some rich guy; seriously Leo, you need to start picking scripts ala Clooney cos you're chucking away what could be a fine career on *pointless* stuff such as WoWS and the awful Gatsby ...<br/><br/>5/10 - nothing in it to hate but hardly anything in it to really like (other than lots and lots and lots of T&A and drug taking but you can't have a film consisting of that and virtually nothing else and WoWS proves it ...)."

","9.1 of 10. It's hard to criticize a film about it's length that is great and part of its greatness is its satirizing of excess, making the length part of the story. Length, however, and a few other things that could have been cut or given more thought prevent this from being perfect. For example, McConaughey, either just before or just after his award-deserving performance in another award-deserving film, Dallas Buyers Club, is miscast. He doesn't need to be in this film and he looks like an underfed, homeless man in a suit. That said, if you can ignore his appearance and misplaced accent, he, like all the cast, does give a wonderfully amusing performance.<br/><br/>I definitely won't complain if this gets awards.<br/><br/>For DeCaprio, this is a wonderful complement to his role in The Great Gatsby. In fact, he fits into this character far better. It would be wrong to call it ironic, but his role here is an inversion of essentially the same character he played in Gatsby.<br/><br/>As for capturing reality in a film based on true, possibly somewhat enhanced, story, it's nearly impossible to find flaws. Because of the lack of cutting, there is at times some sympathy developed for characters that shouldn't be getting any empathy. I would have also made some different soundtrack choices for a film set in the late 1980s/early 90s.<br/><br/>Overall, however, it's an exotic use of time that captures aspects of lesser films this year (I'm thinking Blue Jasmine and All is Lost) all into one masterpiece so you don't have to watch them. If you haven't seen American Psycho, however, be sure to see that. That will help you enjoy the truth is bizarrely similar to fiction elements of this film."

","The Wolf of Wall Street is a superbly acted bombardment of excess, not limited to just money, sex, and drugs. However, in its conquest to wow audiences with the real life tale of Jordan Belfort, Scorsese and those involved completely ignore the real life consequences of Belfort's actions. In DiCaprio's own words: <br/><br/>""We purposely didn't show (Belfort's) victims. We wanted the film to be a hypnotic ride the audience gets on so they get lost in this world and not see the destruction left in the wake of this giant ship of greed. ...What he did was deplorable. But I do respect anyone who's going to be forthright about his mistakes. He's not the way he was anymore.""<br/><br/>But why leave out a key part of the story, aka. the moral? In the Hollywood of old, the bad guy always got his comeuppance in the end - not a movie and public speaking deal, and a possible reality TV show! When did being downright bad become so cool? <br/><br/>In real life, Belfort is a criminal sociopath who cheated vulnerable people out of their life savings, wrecked families, turned on his associates to save himself, and much much more. If he is truly remorseful, then why has he not paid full restitution to the victims, despite profiting hugely from his book and other ventures since prison? Remember, this is a man who only told the truth to escape 25 years in prison, not because he grew a conscience. Has our society come so far in such a short span of time that we now praise the wit and ingenuity of cheats and bullies? That we must show our children what they too can have, if only they throw away their morals and prey on those less intelligent or forthcoming than them? It's a new kind of Hollywood that perpetuates this story, and I'm not certain that it's healthy. <br/><br/>Still, it is entertaining. But, then again, I like some movies about serial killers and terrorists too... I lump The Wolf in with them."

","The Wolf of Wall Street is indulgent, bogged down with exposition, and in the end offers very little finality in terms of final message. Why make a film whose position is to exploit an explicit story of addiction, gluttony, greed, and complete narcissism, and not make choices of the moral significance of living such a life? Scorcese, for all he has done in film, makes films that center on violence, sex, and money. He loves gangsters and criminals because they are the greatest examples of the rough edges. However, Wolf of Wall Street is more interested in vanity rather than showing the end results of vanity in the financial market. Anyone with any knowledge knows that the people in this film were at the base of creating the environment that would eventually destroy the American economy. It is hard to ignore the impact of the sickness portrayed in this film because it is thrust upon you with little regard to overload (there was so many exploitations of women in this film sexually it was almost pornographic). <br/><br/>Scorcese, wanting to overstate how disgusting this wall street environment was held nothing back, but he spent so much time doing so, NO CHARACTER IN THE FILM FEELS REAL. In regards to addiction, it is irresponsible to make a film about drug addicts living sick whose rise is emphasized without the fall. The film is three long long long long long hours, and you feel it. Scorcese may be getting old and may be falling under the Kubrick spell of making films where he just wants to work for nine months on a shoot with naked women everywhere. At least in Casino, Goodfellas, The Departed, the texture of the films was a bit layered. Wolf of Wall Street was as disgusting as spoon feeding yourself whipped cream for three hours. The first few bites are delicious, but after the first hour you start regretting indulging in guilty pleasures."

No magical,interesting content about make money. just like Martin Scorsese said us It is movie about a rich man but story about his business is a bit complicated then let's see how he fucked girls,which drugs he used,how he enjoyed freetime.

However the pace was snappy, Christian Bale's early cameo as a coked up trader was amusing, and I thought I might be in for an entertaining ride.<br/><br/>That all stopped about 20 minutes in when the whole thing decided to become a crude, unsubtle, endlessly shouty, unfunny, painfully obvious, overlong mish-mash of nothingness that (much like its own protagonist) absolutely reeked of having too much money thrown at it. Pure overkill. There is no magic of cinema in this film, just endless repetition of a theme. It's not even clear if the whole wall street lifestyle of excess and selfishness on display is being lampooned, celebrated, or neither. And it needed to be clearer, because TWOWS simply isn't anywhere near sharp or clever enough to successfully tread that particular tightrope of contextual ambiguity. It turned into a case of what am I watching and why should I care? The only stars this gets are for the promising first 20 minutes or so, after that it's a self indulgent mess that never ends."

","The main reason for me to vote this film only 2/10 because ,<br/><br/>1. Hard to believe story. I know right? We shouldn't or even try to believe movies as they are works of fictions mostly but, Its already stated as a true story. And its too hard and even very disturbing (If u are a sensitive person) to actually believe or even try to think these things in this movie were actually happened. (Spoiler) In whole 3 hours, only what I saw was Jordan Belfort was a complete animal with lots of mental issues, When he ruined many peoples lives by his hunger for money , cheating on his wife and then cheat on his second wife , beating her , doing drugs all day all night, not caring about his only daughter ....actually can a human live like this..But IF, ONLY IF Jordan Belfort wasn't leading a life exactly as the movie says...life behaving like a complete animal ..then by saying this is a true story the film makers are doing a horrible wrong to the original persons character.<br/><br/>2.Wasted 3 hours for absolutely nothing but regret for watching this. I really wished that i didn't watched this and instead of that i should have two movies with 1.5 hours run-time with better PLOTS. This movie has a very poor plot and sometimes i questioned my self asking were these incidents actually film worthy? Im pretty sure they wasted their money trying to sell this poor story to film fans.<br/><br/>3. Bunch of guys performs on this movie led me to actually hate them even in real life. This movie is way too offending and way too disturbing. <br/><br/>4.R rated???? Kidding me? This movie is definitely an adult only movie. Like NC-17 Or stronger restriction is required to describe this movie. Lots of explicit content , sex and nudity , drugs, corruption, very abusive language and surely giving out a very bad image about rich guys. Lots of pornography related content is included and i strongly recommend this movie is not to be watched with your whole family unless you want to be questioned by your elders or your kids which will set you speechless.<br/><br/>5. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Poor plot,poor character representation etc.<br/><br/>Actors did their job but that fact was never able to cover up this movies' fails"

","The movie is about scummy Wall Street businessmen that make a lot of money. Except for the main character, almost everybody else is worthless: the men aren't interesting or funny or original or important or inspiring or good looking. They are aggressive, uneducated scum who spend most of the time snorting coke, falling over, and yelling YEAAAAH !!! and FUUCK !! The women, if in a speaking role, are gold-diggers. The rest are prostitutes.<br/><br/>Why do we need three hours of their orgies is beyond me. Who cares about these people? The aunt and the FBI guy are the only potentially interesting characters but they get very little space, I guess because the director needed to spend more time on depicting yet another senseless orgy or yet another detailed depiction of effects of drugs.<br/><br/>This would be a total disaster if it weren't for DiCaprio who gives a captivating performance of the main character. He's energetic and convincing. Too bad his talent is wasted on a character of a money- embezzling, drug-addicted salesman surrounded by human trash."

Over time we have seen that he has a fascination with the American experience, specifically with the lives of Americans who make their fortunes outside of the law. I get it. Martin is doing just fine. The Wolf Of Wall Street is well directed well acted well written and worthy of whatever praise and accolades it can gather.

The least of the movie's excesses was the profanity. I found the scene where Jonah Hill's character urinates on some subpoenas to be excessive. I especially found the scenes involving drugs and sex with hookers to be excessive. Worst of all the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler was stuck living in a modest house and riding a subway while the greed head main characters lived in big, fancy houses and drove high end sports cars.

"mishmashmoo","9","4","7","7 April 2014"," Wall Street Exposed
","The Wolf of Wall Street is exhibition of excess, greed and the perversion of the American dream, it's deeply honest and darkly humorous story of the rise and fall of the infamous Wall Street stockbroker Jordan Belfort. DiCaprio comfortably steps into the shoes of the ruthless wolf 'Jordan Belfort' he quickly transitions from a naive intern to a ruthless, amoral Wall Street tycoon. He goes for lunch with a senior stockbroker to learn that the industry is really just a zero-sum game. No one really knows which stocks are going up and down and no one wins but the broker - all that matters is whether you can sell. Jordan Belfort is the poster boy for everything Wall Street doesn't want us to know.<br/><br/>Wall street is depicted to be a world of animalistic instincts where only the ruthless survive. The employees at Stratton Oakmont are often beating their chests like monkeys, chanting in a ritualistic manner, having sex in front of each other and pissing in the offices. The office truly is a wolf pit, where man is enslaved by his primal instincts. Testosterone is in the air, fueling aggressive confrontation and impulsive behavior; in one scene Jonah Hill's character eats another employees goldfish in front of him to assert his dominance. Belfort and his co-workers increase their wealth in equal measure to their hedonism and quest for instant gratification. Cocaine and sedatives called 'Ludes' become as commonplace as coffee, a seemingly necessary part of life as a stockbroker in the 80s. The film is laced with moral questions; even more pertinent in today's economic climate Scorsese makes us ask ourselves how much is too much?<br/><br/>The film often feels like a series of darkly humorous anecdotes. At times it can feel like it is missing a direction or any real plot. Only in the last third of the film does a solid plot start to develop with the long awaited arrival of an antagonist. However, the plot is not what makes this film great - it's the depth of the characters, The Wolf of Wallstreet should be viewed as a character study of a man corrupted by wealth and in that respect it excels. <br/><br/>I was expecting DiCaprio to blow me away with a performance worthy of an Oscar, but instead I found myself pleasantly surprised at the intensity of Johan Hill's performance. My previous experience of him playing a similar version of the same character led me to believe that he was a one trick pony and made me question whether he could pull off such a complex role However, Jonah proved his diversity as an actor and brought the character 'Donny' to life with a powerful performance, sparking intensely funny scenes with his natural comedic flare. He was reportedly only paid $60,000 for his supporting role, choosing to work on the film because of his respect for Scorsese. Despite being paid much less than DiCaprio, Jonah arguably gave a better performance and deserved to win an Oscar for best supporting role. <br/><br/>9/10"

We learn nothing about business or how it's done, all we get are mentions of how good some people are at doing so.

"AudioFileZ","6","4","7","9 January 2014"," Debauchery As Entertainment
","Scorcesse must be in his element relating a sordid tale of Wall Street criminals because he cloaks the massive amount of depravity as entertainment as only he can do. He gets maximum help by a stellar performance by Leonardo DiCapprio who easily makes the amped-up story of Jordan Belfort more than palatable.<br/><br/>It's not easy to admit this film is enjoyable entertainment because at the end of the day it glorifies some of humanities worst possible turns. As if gobs of money makes evil somehow noble. Obviously, this was the goal and to that Scorcesse has perfected it. Simply put, without DiCapprio's likable persona this may have been too dark to stomach. Way too much illicit sex, drugs, and stealing glossed over to readily accept...Except there's DiCapprio's way with the viewer which somehow makes one watch in spite of what you know is all wrong. Though in a year of lesser movies this could give DiCapprio an Oscar there is some justice in knowing this year a caricature of white collar evil, no matter how good, won't achieve that glorification.<br/><br/>Yes, there is gallant stabs at real comedy relief here. It works, along with DiCapprio's role, to keep the disgust guarded. But, in reality there's a sordid tale here that is shown in horrific grandiosity with soft porn and drug glorification hovering. In the end it leaves the viewer feeling dirty as slight justice was served and so much bad seemed to be made light of. One question remains...Whatever happened to Steve Madden who likely profited from his mass sell-off, but disappeared???"
"souvikmeetszeus","6","4","7","4 January 2014"," Not his best.
","The Wolf of Wall Street. Before entering the multiplex, I had heard so much about the film and so many diverse opinions that it was impossible to have any preformed mindset and thus I went it only with the expectation that one would normally associate with Martin Scorsese. But after the movie I felt Leonardo Di Caprio had carried his role much better than the great director. I did not love the film, I did not hate the film, I just about liked it, let's say, just to indicate, a 6.5/10 probably.<br/><br/>And I absolutely loved certain things about the movie. For example, the entire crawling sequence was a master-work; I loved it to bits, right till the choking part. I loved Leo's first encounter with the FBI on his yacht, especially him throwing the lobsters. Pure quirky pleasure. I loved how they showed Jordan's relationship with his employees. I loved the use of 'Mrs. Robinson'. I loved the showdown between Jordan and his wife, and the way it gets physical and cold. I loved Jordan's training call for his first employees. I love the sequence when he got arrested by the FBI and how that was shot. But that's about it.<br/><br/>Scorsese has a tendency towards biopics or part-biopics, as evident in most of his major and minor works like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Hugo, The Aviator, etc. and this is definitely another, but I would like to call it a part-biopic as it does not do justice on many accounts. Scorsese focuses himself on the hedonism exclusively and goes on a wild ride through the exuberances and extravaganzas of Jordan Belfort et al. It is true that it is remarkable that at 70 the man can still make such a potpourri of a film that has insane drug abuse, universal fetish for money and addiction to sex (to a very mild degree, though they state it as that, it's more American than addiction), it does pack a lot of energy, but at the end it fell flatter than it should have. I will now talk about what makes me say so but before that let me say I felt 30% of the movie was excellent, 40% just about there and the rest misses the mark completely.<br/><br/>Before anything else, I had major issues with the screenplay. What was that scene where Donny and the tough guy fight over a briefcase full of laundered money with a police car behind them, and the tough guy keeps looking behind (to add insult to injury) ? That entire sequence was horrible and reeked of stupidity. And then Jordan's and his father's conversation? The content was not bad, but the way his father spoke, it seemed like he was very uncomfortable doing it. And then the lame sequences between Jordan and the Swiss banker? What was that, humor? Felt like Hangover material. The actors majorly disappoint, with Donny, Jordan's second wife, tough guy with Slovenian chic, the FBI agent, the Swiss banker, all putting in poor performances. Leonardo was the standing figure in the ruins, delivering a sparkling and energetic performance as Jordan Belfort or Wolfie. I couldn't understand Donny, because he acts too dumb for a right hand man to a money laundering institution. And speaking about money, trust me the topic of how Jordan's company earned money was never shown! Only a few hazy clues as '20 million in pink leaflet shares', 'Steve Madden's IPO is being inquired', 'Choke them with Steve Madden's share' is just not good, the movie never even once suggested that Jordan was doing something that amounted to such huge sums of money. It is not logistically possible to sell such huge number of shares worth cents to generate so much revenue. It is too much of superficial movie and probably that was the point Scorsese was trying to make, and I do feel he put Jordan's life into a positive perspective to baffle the audience, and make them sympathize and enjoy with him, thus making them realize that all of us are hedonistic in a way or other.<br/><br/>There are two purely subjective points also that made me zone out of the film. Firstly, it was a drag towards the end. Sequences were stretched, and strangely, the insignificant ones, which made it feel very ordinary at times. And secondly, I too am of the opinion that Scorsese left his take on Jordan's lifestyle a bit corrupt, and I don't mean that it should have a moral compass, but considering his idea was always to focus on the hedonism to generate mass aversion towards the ugly excesses, his treatment ends up doing exactly the opposite, it glorifies hedonism just a little bit extra than that would sit well with me. And I cannot agree with it for the sake of entertainment or twisted subversion.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this doesn't come close to the eccentric electricity of Taxi Driver, the uncompromised rage of Raging Bull, the power addiction of Goodfellas, the chaotic humor of After Hours or the paradoxical hypocrisy of The Age of Innocence. This is, in my books, only funny and sometimes brilliant, but as a movie, really not Scorsese's best or even a very good film, for that matter."

With that said, pretty much every single one of Martin Scorsese's movies are so hard to watch. They're dark & sinful! What? Does Martin sell his soul to the devil every time he makes these?<br/><br/>If it's supposed to be ""REALITY"", we get it, but leave the reality-telling to the professionals if you PLEASE!<br/><br/>What is going through Martin Scorsese's HEAD? Frankly the only film from him I have liked from him is HUGO (2011). A film almost anyone can watch & be mesmerized. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. THIS film is putrid garbage, filled with vulgar language, sexual perverseness, and quite possibly the most unlikable characters ever put on-screen.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is quite possibly the worst actor since Jim Varney's coffin - all he can do is shout & swear. How's that ""acting""?? Is the F-word the only word in his dictionary?????? Cursing & swearing is a degenerate sarcasm for those who have lost their decent vocabulary. DiCaprio should have RETIRED perhaps after Titanic. There are some exceptions to the rule of course, but most child actors grow up to be talentless hacks; no doubt DiCaprio's one of them. Apparently, why didn't he die, instead of Paul Walker?<br/><br/>It's really sad that the real Jordan Belfort is Jewish. Jewish people are the original chosen people blessed by G-d. Blessed through Abraham, they were given amazing wisdom & intelligence. And a lot more Jewish people got involved in this movie (ie. Jonah Hill, Rob Reiner, Jon Favernau, etc.) It's just SAD that a lot of people are born into this world with a G-d-given intelligence, but they use the totally wrong way for the totally wrong things. They just ruin themselves & other people!<br/><br/>Throughout history, Jewish people have turned out to be incredibly smart & intelligent people.

"goodfella479","10","11","27","29 December 2013"," What to think of this film
","I watched this film, and laughed my ass off in certain parts. It brought me to tears occasionally. From a comedy standpoint, this movie is gold, and why I gave it a 10 rating. I went to the theater to be entertained, and was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal. Every actor/actress played their part to the hilt, and should be the film that finally lands DiCaprio his first Oscar. Jonah Hill played his role to an Oscar worthy standard as well. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie is reminiscent of Boiler Room, with undertones of Wall Street and Glengarry Glen Ross thrown in. I suppose if you are looking for anything positive to come out of this movie, you would be disappointed. There is definitely no redeeming qualities of any of the characters. That being said, I think that's the point. We live today in a world of greed, where those who have want more, and will continue to satiate their thirst of the dollar by any means possible. Belfort said as much in the first 15 minutes of the movie, that money was the drug that compared to no other, and demonstrated for the remainder of the film that indeed he would go to all ends to earn whatever he could. The final scene of the audience of his seminar, all Joe Schmoes looking on with that hint of greed in their eye, hoping they too could be that one person to live it big...its what the world has come to. Scorsese's message is clear: you all want it, but this is what it costs - so is it worth it?<br/><br/>For those of you who walked out or decided that there was not enough happiness to warrant a decent review, I suggest you take a look around and let me know where the almighty dollar isn't ruling a part of your life. Ask yourself, if you had the means to change what was wrong, and go beyond, would you not?"
"goerge12344","Null","9","21","2 January 2014"," Not funny enough, and not serious enough. A mess.
","I'm a fan of crude--I've got no problems with nudity, sex, drug use, foul language, etc. But this movie tried to be two things and failed at both. It's listed and well reviewed as a comedy, but it's not very funny. It tries too hard because it's simply not witty, almost throughout. The writer, Terrence Winter's funniest contributions to culture were Sister, Sister and Xena: Warrior Princess (4 episodes combined). That's fail #1.<br/><br/>The attempt at being a cautionary tale is fail #2. Most people walked away amused, maybe disgusted. But who walked away with any genuine anger or sadness after this movie? Maybe a handful of people. The duped investors, and society at large are the victims of the crimes shown on screen, but you never see them, never feel their pain. There isn't even a character to develop on screen in that respect.<br/><br/>I would've rather they'd gone all out with glorifying the crimes on screen, with actual funny dialogue and creative scenarios--that would've require another writer for sure. I would've been thrilled by that. But this movie wasn't funny, and it wasn't cautionary either. It was just a hyped up mess of a movie.<br/><br/>This was a painted up trollop version of Boiler Room. Go watch that instead."
"ElMaruecan82","10","5","10","19 March 2016"," ""Goodfellas"" in ""Wall Street"": Wolves in Armani's Clothing...
","""Why don't you boys go down to Wall Street and find some real crooks?""<br/><br/>This is Tuddy Cicero speaking to the FBI men while they arrest his brother Paulie near the end of ""Goodfellas"". It's very revealing when 'ordinary' gangsters believe they don't hold a candle to the Wall Street guys. And after the 2008 financial crisis, the Goldman Sachs and Madoff scandals, it's hard to prove them wrong. 23 years later, Martin Scorsese, the greatest gangster movie director, finally did justice to Cicero's words and took on the 'bigger players', through his adaptation of Jordan Belfort's autobiographical book.<br/><br/>Jordan Belfort is a guy who, as far back as he could remember, always dreamed of making money and found an easier way than being a gangster: he became a trader. He wasn't more handsome or charismatic than Henry Hill (as portrayed in the films), he just studied and got the passport to Wall Street. He could do what Hill did in all legality proving Al Capone's quote that ""Capitalism is the legitimate racket of the ruling class"". In fact, he almost made the Goodfellas look closer to Robin Hood figures, at least, they bribed a few working-class men.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" was craftsmanship compared to what these 'wolves' in Armani's clothing did: elevating theft to an industrial level, about making millions in a few hours, and money out of virtually nothing, which is the essence of finance. It reminded me of these courses in business schools teaching how to make risk-less money through arbitrage. What Belfort makes is more straightforward, he sells worthless action to blue-collar people and then, it's the traditional supply-and-demand rules, the more people buy, the more others want to buy, the value increases and when it goes high enough, you sell. What then happens to your client is besides your concerns.<br/><br/>Call it unethical, cynical or criminal, but this is the world's holistic system. And the only talent that can make you rich quicker than talented and deserving people is being a good salesman. Because, when you have to sell ****, just sell dreams. A good trader sells securities and buys capital, he sells promising values and makes real money, and it takes some communicative skills to make that possible. And that's the key to these characters' ""likability"", by cinematic standards; they know how to communicate their appeal, that's the 'Gekko' syndrome.<br/><br/>The screenplay, written by Terence Winter, is full of these pep-talk speeches echoing the famous ""Greed is good"" tirade and we have such motivational ones as ""there's no nobility in poverty"" (also borrowed from Oliver Stone's film). ""Wall Street"" set the tone for the financial-themed movies, and there's a reason these films fascinate us: we all love money, we all dream of being rich, if we dream of something else, it's liable to have wealth in the process. There's no potential dream that doesn't involve in a way or another, sex, money or power, these movies speak to us, in a very personal level.<br/><br/>I often found myself thinking that an average guy must make money to have sex with a beautiful girl, and a beautiful girl can get a rich guy easier than an average one. The film made me understand why: basically, a man's main currency is the money he makes, even if you don't dream of banging hot girls, you won't earn your nagging wife's respect if your pockets are empty, and a woman's currency is her beauty, her body and her willingness to use them. Not only Margot Robbie's frontal nudity is not shocking, but it's also a necessity. When you have these guys indecently throwing lobsters, wiping their ass with paper bills or harassing flight attendants, it's just their money language, they can get away with it. Full nudity is the woman showing her best asset in that decadent world, it's a fair trade.<br/><br/>And only Scorsese could have portrayed such loathsome and amoral characters with that flamboyant, dizzying and electrifying style. The characters are sleazy, have nicknames as pathetic as their intentions, as if behind every trader, there was a crook sleeping, but they strangely appeal to us. There Scorsese's obligatory morally corrupt protagonist rising high to fall hard, a multiple-time sinner who's given a few moments of redemption but won't go until the sun really burns his wings. Leonardo Di Caprio finally brings a performance where he can show a wide range of emotions, be charismatic and pathetic within the same five minutes and the credits also go to the gripping realism of the portrayal of cocaine, crack and Quaalude uses.<br/><br/>No movie ever portrayed drugs and lust, and the combination of both in such a straight-forward way, and that was essential because there's got to be a catch behind such a dreamy lifestyle. This ambivalence goes further as the title was borrowed from an unflattering portrait of the young yuppie go-getter, yet it gave him the perfect publicity to build his reputation. Did things change much? After he cooperated with the FBI, he served a few years in prison and became a motivational speaker. In the film's closing scene, you can see people looking at him with respect and adoration. The joke is on us.<br/><br/>From Leo to the surprisingly good Jonah Hill as his right-hand man Donnie Azoff, from Matthew McConaughey as his first tutor, Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent or Jean Dujardin as the suave and crooked Swiss banker, the film is some actors' finest hours, and that includes Rob Reiner as Leo's father and the promising Margot Robbie. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is Scorsese back to his roots and one of his best.<br/><br/>And what a cruel injustice that Roger Ebert, Scorsese' number one fan, who loved every single film he made with Leo and adored ""Goodfellas"", didn't live up to see the culmination of the actor/director's duo and the film in the same vein of greatness than its glorious predecessor."

","There's nothing worse than being trapped in a place you can't get out of and this is how I felt when I watched this film. A brilliant director, fantastic acting and an unlimited budget should make for a triumph but I felt that I was trapped for three hours in a Big Brother house with a bunch of morons. There wasn't one character to sympathise with, nobody to like and the concept of stealing money from people, though occasionally funny, was like watching a bunch of vandals smash a bus shelter. I was persuaded to see the film by my lovely girlfriend and I was determined to try my best to overcome my misgivings, but it pans out exactly as you'd expect; from the first attempts at thieving to the inevitable climax. If De Caprio's character walked into my house today I'd punch him."

","Sometimes, more is not necessarily better. This is one of those. The Wolf of Wall Street draws and shows the evil side of stock markets from different angles, but in the end, it turns out excessive. The picture some people had in their minds, about those stock brokers throwing money to the wind and blowing cocaine, resulted insignificant. This plot could have been better fit in 100 minutes. Yet , the actors perform very well, especially Di Caprio, who seems to have been born for this kind of scripts where the lead role has to walk the line between two sides, the fake world, made of lies and miseries, and real one."

"burger1124","5","5","10","31 January 2014"," Excessive but Lacking
","The Wolf of Wall Street is undoubtedly one of the funniest films ever made by director Martin Scorsese. Unfortunately, it is not one of his best. Clocking in at a whopping 180 minutes, Wolf is too much of everything: sex, drugs, profanity, laughs, dialogue, improvisation, narration. <br/><br/>If you've been following the development and release of Scorsese's latest, chances are you know all about the four-to-five hour, NC-17- rated cut that had to be trimmed down hastily for a Christmas day release. While legendary editor and Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is certainly not lacking in imagination, she and Scorsese let scenes run on entirely too long, cutting back and forth between actors who are clearly making it all up as they go along. Most of the time, the actors appear to be having a great time with the freedom they've been given by their director. Leonardo DiCaprio, in particular, gives an absolutely fearless performance, and he is clearly enjoying himself. If only the audience had such a luxury.<br/><br/>For its first hour or so, Wolf acclimates its viewers to its brisk pacing and no-holds barred storytelling. For the next hour and a half, however, the story falls victim to a ""rinse-and repeat"" method of constantly regurgitating its themes, scenes, and dialogue, until the inevitable ending provides some relief from its relentless pace.<br/><br/>Wolf tells the story of Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street con artist who dreams of being a rich broker like Henry Hill dreamed of being a gangster in Scorsese's Goodfellas (more on the similarities between these two films later). After losing a promising job in the recession of the late 1980's Jordan learns the tricks (literally) of the trade at a small operation selling penny stocks. Whereas larger, more regulated stocks yield a much smaller commission, ""penny stocks"" provide a 50% commission for their brokers, who in turn sell an inferior product to gullible investors. Jordan's bright idea is to sell these cheap stocks in huge quantities to much wealthier clients, reaping a huge take for his new front-of-a-firm, Stratton Oakmont.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the plan works for a while, and Belfort and his partners, including Donnie Azoff (played by a joyously weird Jonah Hill) become unfathomably rich. The remainder of the film is basically a visual orgy of gratuitous (and I mean ""I-can't-believe-they-got-away- with-this) sex and drugs, set against the backdrop of an FBI investigation into Belfort's dubious business practices. <br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest issue I had with the film is just how gratuitous the edgy material was. Let us compare to a movie like Goodfellas, for instance. That film shows multiple murders, often with characters meeting their demise by gunshots to the head. It also features copious amounts of cocaine consumption, along with about as many f-bombs as you'll ever hear. However, one could make the argument that for the sake of the story, all of these elements are necessary in their fullness. When Henry Hill dabbles in unauthorized cocaine and arms dealing, especially after his best friend gets bumped off, the stakes become raised: one has the very clear understanding that in this world, one wrong move can result in death.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street, on the other hand, shows relatively little in the way of consequences. For all the laws broken, all the drugs and hookers used up by the male characters, the biggest threat facing the supposed protagonists is possible jail time. A film that mimics the structure and feel of Goodfellas would do well to up the ante a bit, but Wolf falls woefully short in this regard. <br/><br/>This is not to say that there are no consequences. Belfort's unraveling is spectacular, particularly in a late scene in which he tries to leave his mansion with his young daughter in tow. But after two and a half hours of debauchery, a small portion of comeuppance seems like a lack of balance—or poetic justice. This lack of justice is exactly Scorsese's point: for the vastly wealthy, there are often no tangible or justified consequences. Scorsese does a great job of not condemning or judging his characters—he simply shows them as they are, rather objectively, and they condemn themselves with their frat-boy antics. However, the director's overlong dive into a world of excess at times seems a somewhat unhealthy fascination.<br/><br/>The debate over The Wolf of Wall Street is currently raging online. Variety is now running two pieces debating whether the film glorifies its characters' depravity. Some say this is Wolf's genius—an ambiguous presentation of both the temptations of sin and the obvious consequences of those who give in to it. Others would argue that people are giving Scorsese too much credit for what is ultimately an uneven tale with no dramatic drive. I count myself among the latter.<br/><br/>There's a classic sequence toward the end of Goodfellas in which Henry lives in a constant state of paranoia—first as the result of his drug use and later because he has agreed to rat out all of his friends to join the Witness Protection Program. These scenes are key for the arc of the story—both to illustrate the dangerous stakes and to drive the narrative toward its conclusion. The Wolf of Wall Street should have had such a sequence. Instead, we were given just another scene with cocaine and sex."

","In 2024 we'll ask: What was the name of that movie ten years ago that was ""Good Fellas"" with DiCaprio & stockbrokers instead of gangsters? In fact, 'Wolf' would be high plagiarism had it not been Scorcese self-aggrandizing: The sound track parallels GF identically to set mood and time frame. The martini lunch with McConaughey attempts an analogy with the GF ""whadda mean funny"" scene in its ""over the top"" script, but comes up short, far from 'the top' without Pesci's superior ad lib performance. Bad guys with poor educations laugh a lot, do drugs, cheat on their wives, eventually do themselves in with the feds' help. Whoddathunk? Why did that '90 ticket to GF cost me so much less?"

","The one good thing about this film is Di Caprio - as usual he is excellent and never fails to entertain. The film itself is fatally flawed; the characters are very one dimensional and the leading character, brilliantly played by Leonardo Di Caprio, is a sleazy and obnoxious parasite for whom it is very difficult to develop any sympathy whatsoever. Scorsese is used to handling such individuals from his gangster epics but depicting Belfort as some kind of financial gangster somehow fails to convince me. Sure, there are some very funny scenes, but most of the story gets lost in over the top shouting, swearing and general hysteria. You can't help thinking that the main characters all belong in a lunatic asylum even before the film really gets going. No doubt the many Scorsese fans will praise him to the hilt, but this effort is a disappointment when compared to his many previous successes."

","The Wolf on Wall Street has some noteworthy scenes, and was entertaining to a certain extent, but somehow the filmed lacked to come together to one cohesive film. Belfort, seems to become a ""criminal"" practically overnight. I believe this was too sharp of a turn for a three-hour film. Belfort become ""hooked"" on Wall St early in the film, creating somewhat of a disconnect between him and his new wife early on. This ""disconnect"" caused the movie to be overly focused on DeCaprio throughout the entire film. I felt like his business partner and friend, Donnie Azoff, was a miscast, and, although enjoyable to watch, he doesn't look or seem like a stockbroker, or someone involved in this type of business. Although DeCaprio provided a stellar performance, the development of his character was only partial, and I felt like I was left hanging in the air. What happens to his ex-wife? What does she do? What does Brad do? What does the FBI agent do? <br/><br/>These characters are not ""strong"" enough to ""stand up"" against DeCaprio. There should have been like a Robert DeNiro FBI agent, or someone that would challenge DeCaprio. The fact that the ""weak"" antagonist made the suspense leak out of the film. So what happens if he is caught? There were a few friendship moment with his partner. I felt like there were only a few moments of that I was engaged in the movie. And, then he rats them out? Totally against the character, this inconsistent character makes the story just seem inauthentic, even for a drug addict."

"Meven_Stoffat","10","9","22","28 December 2013"," Certainly NOT all bark and no bite
","I can't remember the last time I've had as much fun at a movie as The Wolf of Wall Street since The Departed. In recent memory, only The Avengers comes to mind. But what makes The Wolf of Wall Street such a success is that it shows Martin Scorsese doing what he does best. He takes the tale of Jordan Belfort, an intelligent yet mischievous stockbroker who was very skilled at swindling stocks, manipulating the stockmmarket, and turns it into the cinematic equivalent of an injection of coke, meth, heroin, codeine, aderall and a number of uppers and downers- all at once. In other words, it's a crazy, wild ride. And if this were any other filmmaker, it wouldn't have turned out as well as it did, nor would I have been able to sit through it for two hours, let alone the three hours that The Wolf of Wall Street runs. But this is Scorsese, folks. His films are famous for effectively blending in substance and style in equal parts, and this film is no different at all.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most memorable thing about The Wolf of Wall Street is, and face it, you saw this coming, Leo DiCaprio's performance. You probably already knew DiCaprio would give an amazing performance, but here he gives his best yet. He completely snaps into character and gives a bravura performance that's completely real. From the opening scenes alone, where he gives an almost Patrick Batemanesque introspective into his life and career, his cars, his home, his past time pleasures such as excessive drug use and drugged out chaos, sex with hookers and what have you, you're in the palm of his hand. The scenes where he talks to the camera about certain subjects is where you can see the amount of confidence he has bursting at the scenes. His David Tennant style delivery of his speeches to his staff at Stratton Oakmont just shows he was born to play this role. It's a tricky role to take on too, as his character is involved in tons of debauchrous situations; but the aforementioned confidence of DiCaprio is what keeps it believable.<br/><br/>And in general, just how well the essence of the story is captured is unbelievable. The film runs a mammoth 3 hours, and is a lot to take in. However, it's so entertaining that you could sit and watch and be entertained if it ran an hour longer. In fact, I'm pretty amazed that they even fit this all in in three hours. A lot of things happen in the story, and they're all tremendous. In fact, direction wise, Scorsese's DNA is splashed all over this film too. The scene where Belfort is caught for his crimes mid-commercial filming is absolutely hilarious; the slow motion shots with narration about things such as how certain drugs work are charming, in a sort of filthy and debauchrous way too. There's funny scenes a- plenty, such as a long gag involving a high from an extreme drug made with lemon extract (how DiCaprio and Hill managed to hold it together in the face during these scenes is amazing, even). And the trademark ""Scorsese timing"", where scenes are swiftly paced and smartly blocked is on full display as well. So it goes to say that Scorsese has made yet another substantial and directorial masterpiece.<br/><br/>In short, The Wolf of Wall Street is without a doubt a late must-see and contender for ""best of the year"". Of the last batch of movies to be released this year, this sure drew the year to a satisfying close, and we can only hope that this will get the academy awards it deserves. Do yourselves a favour too and see this on the big screen, with a packed audience. I saw it this afternoon, and the packed crowd was one of the best audiences I've experienced- much like my first time seeing The Departed. It certainly benefits from the big screen experience. And just one more thing: Academy, if you're reading this review, do us all a favour and give Leo his Oscar NOW! He's truly earned it with this film."
"luisbunuel-880-937067","Null","9","22","26 December 2013"," Not La Dolce Vita
","The emperor's new clothes, the elephant in the middle of the living room, whatever you want to call it, but the uncomfortable truth must finally be faced--the DiCaprio-Scorsese teaming has never been all that cinematically, and WWS is no exception. It would be a fool's errand to point fingers, saying who's to blame, etc. Who can say? And it hasn't all been mediocre. The Departed was to die for--but there was a lot more than Leo. Shutter Island was grand. And it isn't that pre-Leo Scorsese didn't have his egregious stumbles--think the all-star teaming in Casino. But Gangs, Aviator, and now this film, are all terrific demonstrations of something that doesn't work--brilliant filmmaking surrounding so-so acting and a very so-so script. In WWS, we have exquisitely filmed excess that must be leading to some big moral revelation because otherwise why have such a gargantuan build up, no? But not really. Dolce Vita this is not, and yet one feels that Scorsese, like Fellini, wants to go there with this material. We even get a tiny tribute to La Strada in the bedroom scene when Belfort's wife keeps provoking him by throwing water in his face. But it ends up being more of a throwaway--like many scenes in the film. You wonder whether some offscreen financier was occasionally slapping Scorsese on the hand, saying, ""More spring break, more spring break."" Like Casino, it's a series of funny, opulent, overly long scenes strung together chronologically than a real drama with complications experienced by a main character undergoing a moral struggle. Its sexual situations and language are also surprisingly frank given that's it's a mainstream film, but this may just be part of the pornographication of mainstream life. The fatiguing amount of drug use and drunken sex, Belfort's inability to experience anything without being high--all of this seems to be leading somewhere. In the middle of a storm at sea, while Belfort's helicopter is getting swept off the deck of his yacht, Jonah Hill is ordered to go below deck to get the quaaludes out of the flooded stateroom. That's a pretty meaningful action. And it required some heavy duty filming. But nothing really comes of it. Weird. It's easy to suppose that this a vision of a lower-middle class character becoming corrupted by the excesses of the '80s. But the guy is such an empty vessel to begin with that you really only end up with empty vessel + drugs + booze + sex. You can't even say he's a hypocrite because he never stood for anything to begin with. Surely there was more to this guy than that. When the Lemonheads' version of Mrs. Robinson plays you get that a feeling of complete spiritual emptiness. But that passes quickly because the film is so overbusy and needs to bounce to the next outrageous situation. It's a highly watchable film in a voyeuristic way, but even then it has so much Leo narration that fully admits to the insanity of what's going on that you never even get the chance to feel dirty from peeping Tom-ism. He is very reliable narrator, so there's very little irony. There's not that much to actually say about the film because it doesn't say that much. The only reason it gets this much ink is because this is the director of Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, etc. These are major movies. But this is more Scarface meets the Hangover. It's a guy's film, make no doubt it. No woman is going to like it because it revels in the adolescent antics of grown up men that women find repulsive. Party!"
"ryderjacob","10","6","13","24 March 2014"," 'Wolf of Wall Street' Is Brilliant For All Three Hours!
","One of my all-time favorite movies is ""GoodFellas"", one of my all-time favorite directors is Martin Scorsese and one of my all-time favorite actors are Leonardo DiCaprio. I enjoyed ""Gangs of New York"", ""Shutter Island"" and ""The Departed"", but this movie knocks those out of the park.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is Jordan Belfort, a young broker who starts scamming people into buying penny stocks and eventually becomes one of the biggest names on Wall Street. That is, until, his life comes crumbling down.<br/><br/>I could sum up the movie in one word: Brilliant. This movie is disgusting, sexist and offensive, but it is also down-right hysterical. In fact, there is one scene with Leonardo DiCaprio reacting to the side effects of a drug that had me holding my sides because I was laughing so hard.<br/><br/>DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career in this movie. He is funny, interesting and completely over-the-top as Belfort. Also giving the best performance of his career is Jonah Hill, playing Donny, Belfort's right-hand man. He is just as funny and interesting as Belfort.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great, too, with Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Ethan Suplee, Christine Ebersole, Jean Dujardin and Matthew McConaughey in small, but interesting and well-performed roles. In fact, Matthew McConaughey steals the scenes he's in, too bad he's only in the first fifteen minutes of this 182-minute film.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is over three hours long, and sometimes that bothers me. Did it bother me here? No, because I was into the story, which is actually a true story.<br/><br/>A fair warning: This movie is rated R, but frequently pushes the boundaries of how far an R-rating will go. I have no idea how Scorsese escaped an NC-17. I mean, for the love of God, there's two graphic scenes of an orgy (One is a gay orgy), a man's genitalia, DiCaprio doing cocaine off a hooker's ass and almost every female in this movie is either a drug dealer, prostitute or a naked, blonde girl.<br/><br/>Despite that, I loved this movie. It's brilliant, awesome, hilarious and now, one of my all-time favorites. See it, in fact, see it twice, if you are willing to watch a three-hour movie."
"Zaffy-1","2","6","13","18 January 2014"," an uninspired copy of the Good Fellas
","What I really hated in this movie wasn't the hysterical douche bag characters. It wasn't the Long duration, nor that DiCaprio was playing like a ""master of ceremonies"" in Cabaret. It wasn't even the repetitive drug party scenes nor the sexistiest of uses of women.<br/><br/>What I really disliked was that Scorsese blinked an eye at all this and. For more than 2 and half hours we were ""celebrating"" with the greedy scums and their joys. For 30mins or so, we were supposed to feel the fall of the greedy bastards. I didn't feel a thing. And that scene with the FBI agent inside the miserable metro... oh dear...<br/><br/>I can only grade this movie as a bad copy of Good Fellas. An overrated flat film that it is interesting only if you watch it as a docudrama."
"Fanboy218","Null","7","16","25 December 2013"," On par with Goodfellas!
","Scorsese has created goodfellas of the new generation. It's his longest film but it's never boring, and this movie's shockingly very hilarious. For me, Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better in a film before. The screenplay by Sopranos' Terence Winter was perfect in every way. As a conclusion, this movie is full 3 hour of enjoyment, minute by minute, and it's definitely better than another Scorses's classic Casino. Whether or not this movie is better than Goodfellas I'm not sure yet, but Goodfellas is one of the best movies EVER MADE, and this movie's on the same level to that. In 71years old, Martin Scorsese's surely back on that level, that's how incredible he is."

","Let's just start of by saying, why didn't Martin win oscar for best director and picture of the year, obviously Leo should've won for best actor and a leading role and Margot Robbie definitely should've won best supporting actress. This is a very fun ride, my sides were aching from all my laughter, the comedy is consistent throughout the whole movie, definitely my favorite film of the decade (no doubt). Jonah Hill's first role that made me realise this man can act, he is hilarious and adds to the film's greatness. The sex scene between Naomi and Jordan is comedy at its' peak, Margot has my favorite female performance of all time. SPOILER TIME: There's a great scene where Jonah Hill's character meets Jordan, claims that he lives in his apartment with two kids and the ""ugly wife"" and this sets up his character, from then on he's absolutely brilliant. One scene which made me laugh so hard I coughed was when Jordan deals with the side effects of ludes and jeez is this scene excellent.<br/><br/>Hands down one of my favourite films of all time! Grade: A+"

","I am so glad I rented this from the library and didn't waste one red cent on it!<br/><br/>This ""movie"" is basically Girls Gone Wild on steroids in a corporate office setting. I suppose they intended to make an updated version of Wall Street, but one that was ""edgier"" and ""harder"" for contemporary audiences, loaded to the gills with profanity, full frontal nudity, and endless obsessive drug use. Unfortunately, all of that extra shock and titillation came at the expense of any plot or storyline.<br/><br/>Belfort himself starts off as apparently trying to be an honest stockbroker, but is instantaneously seduced to the dark side by Matthew Mcconaughey, and with that, his character development is done. Literally. For the next three hours, you get to see him and his equally irredeemable cohorts do drugs and hookers, drugs and hookers, more drugs and more hookers.<br/><br/>You're never told how he makes his fortunes. Actually, he starts to tell you how his nefarious schemes worked, and you actually start to pay attention for once, but then he literally stops mid-sentence and says awww you're not interested in that, it's too complicated anyway (seriously!). Along the way, you are treated to at least 3 or 4 Gordon Gecko pep rally-type speeches (but not as good), which eventually just become repetitiously boring. Literally, if you story-boarded this ""movie"", it would look like: drugs and hookers - speech - drugs and hookers - speech - drugs and hookers - speech, et cetera.<br/><br/>In the end, he gets caught, but you're not sure how, or for what, but at least you can breathe a sigh of relief that the ""movie"" is almost over. In the last scene, Belfort becomes a Zig Ziglar type, not only not ashamed of what he's done, but exploiting his past to keep on exploiting the present. The guy is a convicted fraudster, and yet people supposedly pay money and pack lecture halls to learn from him how to ""sell""? I seriously hope the filmmakers just made that part up.<br/><br/>There's no story to remember, no lessons to be learned, no characters that get their comeuppance, no victims who see justice done. If you watch this ""movie"" all the way through, you'll feel as used up as a hooker and as wrung out as a drug addict. If this ""movie"" is a comedy, the joke is on us the audience.<br/><br/>Post-script: Scorsese is supposed to be a great director, but I'm sensing a theme of his 'greatest' films: constantly upping the shock factor. Whether it's blood and violence like Taxi Driver or Goodfellas, or now this soft porn garbage, I'm starting to see this guy as nothing more than a self-absorbed shock artist."
"Leofwine_draca","6","3","5","4 April 2017"," Exploration of excess
","You could be forgiven for experiencing a little deja vu when watching THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, Martin Scorsese's true-life tale of an innocent stockbroker who rose through the ranks to become one of the most notorious figures of the 1980s, a man whose name was synonymous with excess and devious money-making. In essence this film could be described as WALL STREET with added sleaze, or SCARFACE with a Wall Street backdrop.<br/><br/>The familiarity of the story, and the chronological approach it takes to telling it, is very familiar to anybody who knows Scorsese's gangster classics such as GOODFELLAS or even CASINO. The whole rise-and-fall thing feels extremely predictable me, so much so that Scorsese doesn't really have much to say here. Instead, he goes all-out in his depiction of 1980s excess, filling his film with profanity (nearly 600 uses of the 'f' word), explicit sexuality, drug-taking, and general bad behaviour. As with the rest of Scorsese's films, the end result is entirely watchable, if superficial in this instance.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically good performance as this film's protagonist, successfully convincing us of his transformation into a jaded, drug addicted figure. Jonah Hill is his second-in-command, although I found his performance one-note and he was trying too hard to be funny throughout. The best performers, like Jon Bernthal, have smaller parts although they do stand out in them. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is certainly well-shot and entertaining enough, and there are some stand-out sequences, like the bit where DiCaprio is unable to walk. In the end, though, it feels very slight, a comedy with a lot of laughs and general outrageousness, but nothing we haven't seen done before, and done better."

"pefrss","1","3","5","9 February 2015"," This must be the most misogynist , vile movie in a long time
","When the Wolf of Wall Street was in the movie theaters I read the reviews and decided that I did not need to see it. Recently I developed an interest in seeing more movies with Jean Dujardin in it after I saw a movie called Moebius . I had also seen The Artist, but nothing else with him. So I searched on IMDb which other movies Jean Dujardin had made and found that he had a part in the Wolf. I took the Wolf of Wall Street out at the library (thanks for that, so at least I did not have to pay for that trash) and when I started to watch it I remembered why I did not want to see the movie in the first place. I have to admit that I fast forwarded through it because there is a limit of how many times I want to hear the f word, or watch a bad dye job on Di Caprio or see unsexy naked prostitutes. I get that Scorsese want ed to paint the guy as repulsive and he was successful in doing so, but three hours of repulsive without anything interesting happening is just too much. It also reminded me never to wear anything from famous designers again because that would put me in the company of sleaze balls. When I see movies like this the only fear I have is that some young stupid impressionable person may actually think that this kind of life is a good thing. Otherwise I can only recommend this movie to women, You will never want to be with a man who drinks or takes drugs again after watching that and you will never trust your man going on a business trip again. I live in Las Vegas and I have heard from people working in the big hotels that they have to take the hose to some rooms which have been used by immature drunk males on drugs, but I highly doubt that any airline would allow their customers to behave like these pigs. I did not need to see this movie to know that this kind of men are lousy lovers and husbands. There was really nothing I liked and again I realize that this was the intention. . It was no fun to watch, I have not learned anything new. I thought that DiCaprio was too old for the role and the hair and eyebrow dye job was so distracting that I was always waiting to see the color drip. <br/><br/>The movie left me completely and totally depressed, it is so demeaning to women and so so sad that Scorsese and DiCaprio thought that this is the right way to make money. Actuall I cannot really remember a movie from Scorsese or DiCapria I really enjoyed, so maybe I should never watch one again either one has anything to do with."
"erculef","9","3","5","9 December 2014"," The Wolf of Wall Street
","I've always thought that there must be a very good reason for a movie to last 3 hours. "" The Wolf of Wall Street"" is definitely one 3 hour long movie that makes you resist the urge to want to go pee during the movie. I watched the movie at the cinemas last year when it was out, recently I got bored of the 2014 redundant movies and wanted to watch something thrilling and impacting to cheer myself up. The first movie that came to my mind was "" The Wolf of Wall Street"". This movie is a thrilling unorthodox Wall Street movie with a comedic and pulp twist which is also based on a real story. The movie is an epic comedy that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America and the lunatic lifestyles on Wall Street.<br/><br/>"" Can you sell this pen now ? "" The same question appeared twice in the movie. The first time was when Jordan and Donnie persuaded their team of drug dealers to sell their financial product. At that time the sales answered remarkably, he asked Jordan :"" Can you give me your signature?"" The second time was at the end of the movie, Jordan was released from prison and was doing a Motivation Speech to a roomful of confused people. The people who answered this time only foolishly described the pen visually or said how good the purpose of the pen was. Well what is the best way to sell something? The answer answered by this movie is to create a need. On the base of this idea the movie is about Jordan Belfort, a con-man, a Wall Street broker, and a billionaire. The story starts about, a young ambitious Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, with splashes of drama. Initial comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like American Pie, 21 Jump Street and Pulp Fiction. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. <br/><br/>Leonardo De Caprio is the heart of the film, playing as a daredevil whose motivation seems to be a misguided desire to acquire as much money as possible. After his remarkable performance in Shutter Island, The Great Gatsby and Inception. Leonardo plays again as an intelligent knowledgeable flexible public speaker. 30% of the film is watching Leonardo speak or explain to the audience what he is trying to express. Leonardo truly played this role remarkably true to life. Jonah Hill playing as Donnie Azoff Leonardo's partner in crime, did an incredible job playing as the usual roles that he performs. As everybody should remember Jonah Hill from the movies Superbad or 21 Jump Street, Jonah is this humorous silly sometimes dumb overweight guy which always gets himself in trouble. In this film there was no exception. Jonah's performance truly sprinkles the movie with humorous splashes, and makes the movie more appealing and shocking. Jonah personally gained an Oscar nomination for being the best supporting actor from his excellent performance in this film. He made a lot of sacrifices, for example showing his personal parts to the public, but at the end it was worth it. <br/><br/>What I liked about the movie was how shocking and influencing it is. This movie was like nothing I've ever saw before, it literally introduced a new world to me. For example, when Belfort was opening up his own company in order to sell Penny Stocks, the speeches and marketing techniques that he taught his employees were very educational. Another reason I liked it was because it was could make you laugh all the way through the movie. What I didn't like was that it was a little too vulgar, it had a lot of sexual contents and a lot of drug using contents. Half of the film was about people doing stupid yet meaningful things when they were dosed and drunk. So this film may not be a film that you would watch with your family on a Sunday evening.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to adults who likes American comedy films. This is a comedy film with a twist of Wall Street, and as it is written according to a true story, it is much more meaningful and some yet educational. If you are under 18 and pulp comedy movies make you feel sick and disgusted, please do not watch this movie. <br/><br/>Overall I'd give this movie a 9 out of 10. It was definitely one of the best movies of 2013, and personally one of my favorite movies of all time. I'd hope you to enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>I am presently a University sophomore studying in China. I like watching interesting movies, documentaries and books. I also love investing and gambling and Japanese food. :)"

We hoped it would be a well-acted, intriguing depiction of corruption on Wall St. Basically, it's vile, exaggerated, over-the-top and monotonous -- not to mention awkward.

I do not understand how this movie can be entertaining in any way. The scenes are mostly disgusting and it's length could be reduced to an hour at most. The plot is a rehash.<br/><br/>This is basically 'Good Fellas', but with Wasps instead of Mafiosi. Do whatever criminal behavior you want, steal anything you want, use as much drugs as you want, abuse as many women as you can. But, at the same time, ""Don't you think I'm cute?"" ""Don't you wish you could be my friend?"" Success has allowed Scorcese to amp up the debauchery to a ridiculous level. What's next for him, actual film of disembowelment? The main difference is that Goodfellas had a somewhat satisfying ending: they mostly got what they deserved, especially the guy who got shot in the head.<br/><br/>Scorcese now appears to be repeating himself (come to think of it, the plot isn't much different than 'Gangs Of New York' either).<br/><br/>It happens to most of the great directors: their originality runs out, the studio bosses don't rein them in because of their prior success, audiences continue to buy tickets for a while. <br/><br/>So long, Marty, it was good while it lasted."

","This iconoclastic, black with a capital b comedy is the best Hollywood satire since Showgirls. A jocular epic that bitingly indicts excess at its highest level possible within contemporary society. DiCaprio kills his performance as the titular Wolf, an abominable creation that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as De Niro's finest collaborations with Scorsese. Formally the veteran director is as inventive and unruly as ever, hyperactively deploying muscular tracking-shots, aspect ratio shifts and unconventional compositions like it ain't no thang. Stylistically the result is marginally less dazzling than say Scorsese-opus Casino but the tonal command throughout is masterful. One criticism is that the film is less engaging in its third-act comedown but that feeling quickly dissipates as Scorsese uncannily saves his pièce de résistance for WOWS' final shot."
"lasttimeisaw","8","3","5","12 June 2014"," Fifths is not a charm for Leo
","After dumping his longtime companion Robert De Niro for the hey-day Leonardo DiCaprio in the naughties, Martin Scorsese embarks on a series of ambitious enterprises to earn his overdue Oscar statuette, finally third time is a charm, THE DEPARTED (2006, 8/10) achieved that goal, but poor Leo is still Oscar-less, so their fifth teamwork is THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, an excessive satire of Jordan Belfort's autobiography, a former Wall Street stock-broker's rise and fall from 1980s to 1990s, which grants Leo the uppermost leniency to embody this corrupted, decadent and indecent character with inordinate excess and extravaganza, unfortunately, Leo's time has yet arrived. <br/><br/>Running around 180-minutes, the film is ultra-snappy and the camera faithfully acts in accordance with the doped delirium where Jordan (DiCaprio) and his cohorts habitually reside, it is an out-and-out wealth-flaunting satire, periodically overreaches its boundary with benumbing and slightly off-putting repletion since Jordan's hollow life perpetually orbits around money, sex, drugs and drug-addled misdemeanors. Marty doesn't trouble himself to go deeper than that, the trenchant point is, Jordan is no more than an eloquent salesman and a shallow opportunist, luck is on his side at the right time, but he fails to apply a failsafe mechanism to get away with it, ironically, it is the American judicial system let him slide, all the more it incites audience to detest the hypocritical political body of democracy, which is inadequate in its wealth distribution and justice upholding. <br/><br/>Leo's performance is voraciously full of vim and vigor, he devotes every effort to light up the screen with incredible body language and pitch-perfect accuracy with beguiling pomposity, but, an indelible impression is that with every gesture he poises, every line he delivers, simultaneously he is thinking of that damn Oscar, he even makes Jordan lovable and immensely watchable, it is his charisma, not his character's, which may bar him from winning in the race this year. <br/><br/>Two-times Oscar nominee (alas!) slash red-hot comedy actor Jonah Hill, not a fan of his performance in MONEYBALL (2011, 6/10), there is no big stretch for him to showcase his prowess as a serious thespian here, he is uproarious and cheeky as Donnie Azoff, Jordan's best buddy, like in his other more coarse comedies, the only difference is this is a Marty's film <br/><br/>Having said that, a preciously meaty part is when Donnie is choking and Jordan tries to save him, but we can vicariously detect in one blink Jordan thinks it might be good to let him die. This is one of Marty's masterstrokes to reflect the complexity of human's intuitive caprice. <br/><br/>New starlet Margot Robbie consummates her big screen breakthrough as Naomi Lapaglia, the second trophy wife of Jordan, she intermingles her utterly stunning sex appeal with aggressive fervor, which might bring to mind Sharon Stone in CASINO (1995, 7/10). Coincidentally, Leo's Oscar rival and eventual winner McConaughey (DALLAS BUYERS CLUB 2013, 7/10) has a ten- minutes screen time as Mark Hanna, the one who remarks on the golden criterion in the Wall Street business, McConaissance is irrepressible even for such a small role. It could be Leo's idea to curtail the role of Mark in the film in order not to lose the spotlight of his own. Also I must extol Spike Jonze's unexpected cameo which offers some imaginable salaciousness with his tacit smirk. <br/><br/>Marty has already risen to a lofty echelon of a cinema maestro who can apply himself to manifold genres with top-notch dexterity, which his recent works HUGO (2011, 9/10), SHUTTER ISLAND (2010, 8/10) all potently bespeak. At the age of 72, the night is still young, may his outstanding creativity will never peter out, which is a tremendous blessing for all the children of cinemas."

","Review: I really enjoyed this epic movie which keeps you on the end of your seat from beginning to end. Although the film is about serious issues, there is some really funny scenes, especially between DiCaprio and Hill who had great chemistry. The storyline goes from one extreme to the next, which is what made it hard to believe that it was based on a true story. The amount of money that the traders go through is ridiculous and the whole care free attitude had to come to a halt at some point. At nearly 3 hours long, the director done well to keep the movie interesting and a joy to watch. I never thought that I would say this, but it is in the same class as the original Wall Street which was a tough act to follow. A Great Watch!<br/><br/>Round-Up: DiCaprio really showed that he is a top class actor with his performance in this movie. He really needed to dig deep to make this character believable because of the amount of drugs, cash and women that him and his friends went through, under the eyes of the law. Jonah Hill was an excellent choice to play DiCaprio's partner in crime who also showed that a different side to his acting skills. Even Matthew McConaughey was brilliant, with his weird expressions and phrases which were a great way to kick off the movie. Anyway, it's very hard to find anything wrong with this film, although some of the speeches on the microphone did drag on, but that's just me being picky. Its definitely worth a watch! <br/><br/>Budget: $100million Worldwide Gross: $390million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there witty dramas about the crazy world of a stock trader who works hard and definitely parties extremely hard. 8/10"
"alex-kirkby","8","3","5","24 May 2014"," At last a Leonardo DiCaprio film that makes me laugh in so many ways
","DiCaprio is an actor that I have been very hear and there with. He is a fantastic actor but he has made some very bad films in the past and I will have to say The Departed was the last good film I have seen of his and that was made 8 years ago. If you don't agree with my choice in films I don't really care I just haven't liked his films that much. This film delivers a fantastic story full of laughs, sex, drugs and a whole lot of money. This film does have its ups and downs. The first is that the film is to long and it could of been shortened down by at least 30 minutes even an hour. And the second is that there is just too much swearing in the film come on there are times when I fort they could of said something better then F this and F that. The good thing about the film is that it does deliver on almost every scale. First is the story the film tells a very interesting story which fells almost lubricous when you think about. However this film can not be interrupted firstly you got to completely sit still and watch it because if you are playing on your iPad or doing some work on the computer then you will lose track of what's going on and you may become bored with it in some way trust me I did. Second is Jonah Hill, I hate this actor and he is the reason to why I hated 21 Jump Street but I have to say I did like him in this as he was the only actor that could play himself, OK maybe that's the way the character acted in real life but Jonah Hill plays him like he plays every other character he plays childish, stupid and completely perfect plus he never shuts up and I thanked god when Jon Bernthal knocked him out. Next is the sex, this film is full of it and I am really surprised it wasn't classed as pore movie in some places. I will have to say sex is what made it a bit over the top OK it was great seeing all the hot naked women but I have to say there is a line and this film stepped over it quite a through times and this is where it links in to the story line for example with the plane full of hookers and everyone is getting laid. Nice idea but come on its a bit hard to believe that someone can hire a huge plane and full it up with hooks and turn it in to a whore house. The next bit is the drugs, I am not a big fan of films based on drugs, however with out them in a film like this it may become a little doll and as this is based on a true story they can't leave something like this out and we all know or we can all guess that most of the people in Wall Street take drugs because for some of them a good nights rest and a hot shower in the morning won't help them in this line of work. The last is the cast, Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor he's not the best but he's not the worst ever, Johan Hill is OK in this in my opinion I would of chose someone a lot better for role like Jim Carrey or Steve Carell as they are fantastic actors and they can play many different characters and would of delivered a much better performance then Johan Hill. Lastly is Jon Bernthal, this actor has come quite far since his time in the walking dead and he has worked with many Hugh actors like Andrew Lincoln, Sylvester Stallone, Robert DeNiro, Dwayne Johnson, LL Cool J and of course Leonardo DiCaprio. This film has it's ups and downs and it is differently worth a try and if you like everything I talked about above then this will be a film for you."

Specifically what happens with the first wife? did they have any kids? same thing, they just killed the story without showing what actually happened to fat Danny and the other cronies. Would have loved to see less tits and more action (i.e. the Wolf closing business deals). The humor is so so too, not good enough to laugh out loud but bare good enough to make the 3 hours enjoyable. I have the impression that something was left, maybe a part 2? Things rushed once the Wolf & Danny were on the yacht in their way to Switzerland and had the accident. What happened with the Wolf's mentor? Did he just disappear from his life, it would have been nice to see him being headhunted by the Wolf's firm later on the film.

"A-Train9830","9","3","5","18 April 2014"," The Wolf of Wall Street keeps you engaged the whole time
","I've been waiting since around October to see the new DiCaprio movie called ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". But then I was angered and disappointed when I learned that the local theater wasn't going to show it on Christmas or any other day. It wasn't until a few days ago that I finally received a copy of the Blu-Ray for my birthday. I knew it was a long movie, and I spent the whole three hours watching it after school the next day. And . . . what a movie it was.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is about a young and wealthy stock broker named Jordan Belfort. Leonardo DiCaprio plays this wild, drug-crazed broker in a truly great display of acting. This movie had great acting everywhere, and I think the whole cast should be proud of their work. The movie takes a long time, three hours, to tell the true tale of Jordan Belfort. And the filmmakers weren't afraid to clearly display the madhouse that went on in Belfort's life and brokerage. The Wolf of Wall Street definitely deserves its R-rating, and there is tons of language, lots of drugs, nudity and revealing sexual content. It's not a movie for kids in any situation, but I don't think there's anything wrong with letting a mature enough teenager watch it. I've heard of a lot of people saying and writing that it's just a constant party through the whole movie, and I definitely don't think that's the case. This movie does show the beginning and progression through Mr. Belfort's wealthy endeavors, and there is a lot more to it than excessive partying. Don't get me wrong, there are some wild, over-the-top party scenes, but there is a lot more to the story. <br/><br/>This movie has a like-able, fun style to it that portrays Jordan Belfort's life in an interesting way. It shows the events through Jordan's eyes, showing his life and those around him. It doesn't really go into the damage he does to anonymous people he takes advantage of, and I think that just goes along with how this movie was made and how they decided to tell the story. This movie does not glorify drugs and crime at all in my opinion. This film was made very well and it was entertaining throughout the whole three hours. The Wolf of Wall Street is definitely not for everyone, but it is a pretty decent movie for people who can handle the content and style."

"agmoldham","5","3","5","5 March 2014"," A bit disappointing
","I have to confess that I was really looking forward to seeing this movie on the back of a lot of critical acclaim. Personally I found it somewhat of a disappointment!<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Jordan Belfort(DiCaprio) who was a Wall Street stockbroker. He was not satisfied with the amount of money that could be made through legitimate trades, so he he used illegal methods to make more money. It follows a lot of the themes familiar from Wall Street, but focuses on the lifestyle that Jordan leads.<br/><br/>For me the film was a little too long and completely ignored the consequences of Jordan's actions. It would have been interesting to see the effects that his actions had on other people and I'm quite sure in real life he would have had a few confrontations with people he swindled. There is no doubt that DiCaprio gives a great performance in the lead role and the film certainly made me consider whether happiness and money have any relationship whatsoever. It could be argued that watching the film may well lead people to the conclusion that money and happiness are inversely proportional. I guess you can't really argue with a film that leaves you with that feeling!"
"brett-donald","4","3","5","3 March 2014"," It's a con
","Didn't live up to the hype. Yes, Leonardo DiCaprio puts in a great performance, and yes, we get transported into a zone of debauchery and obscenity which we would never have imagined could really exist. But for what purpose?<br/><br/>In some ways this is a non-story. Jordan Belfort cheats a lot of people, gets filthy rich, then gets caught. But he doesn't change ... at least he's not portrayed in the film as regretting any of his actions. My point is that the main character doesn't *develop*, so it's a non-story. Which I guess proves that the guy is a good salesman, considering how many copies of the non-story of his life that he's sold.<br/><br/>So although the movie works on the voyeuristic level, and to some extent the comedic level, it's fairly base entertainment. It's certainly not a movie which appeals to the mind or the heart. The one highlight is an incredible couple of scenes towards the end when Jordan and Donnie are off their faces: Jordan has to get to his car and drive it even though he can't walk, then he fights Donnie for the telephone.<br/><br/>I would have rated the film lower, but for the good work of DiCaprio, the inclusion of Margot Robbie, and her good work also."
"jbacks3","4","3","5","18 February 2014"," Marty... please stop with the voice over narrations already...
","Wow, WoWS is getting critically mauled on these user reviews! But indulge my 2-cents: What works: The level of acting is terrific. I'm not a Jonah Hill fan and I'll give his chops (rumor has it he was paid a paltry $60K in what's purported to be a $100 million production--- if true, he was robbed). His Donnie Azoff (aka in real life as Danny Porus) is a difficult character, having no redeeming qualities to draw from. DiCaprio also manages to pull off a convincing Jordan Belfort and as he possesses a face that has refuses to age, we see Belfort as a hungry 23-year old through about 1998. DiCaprio has a firm grip on the guy, and there's one outlandish scene involving a fistful of Quaaludes that kick in at an inopportune moment. Watching Leo chemically melt on a pay phone and throw his body like a mangled Slinky is the one best scene in the film. What doesn't work: The script is pointless. There's no moral center, not a single redeeming character to empathize with. The inevitable outcome happens with no great surprises, no clever plot twists, nothing. These people are all scumbags. A lot has been said about the nudity. I'm no prude and find it sadly amusing that we Americans don't bat an eye at catastrophic body counts in mindless action movies but howl at skin. But okay, WoWS has an unusually high amount of nudity, sex, raunch and Marty seems perfectly willing to give us what he wants. And I will agree that it should probably have been more correctly released as an NC-17 (the fact that this received a R at all makes me question the rating board itself). Another criticism: I've grown tired of the Scorsese narration. It worked in Goodfellas and Casino but without a tighter script, listing to a voice over pieced out over 3 hours weighs the film down. Although I enjoyed it more than most people here, it would've been greatly improved by whittling 25 minutes off a better script."

","I had been looking forward to this movie forever, I watched it as soon as it came out on mega share as I could not watch it at the movies. Leonardo Dicaprio was one of my favorite actors until I watched this movie that is. Most of the acting in this feels like they were making up all the lines up on the spot (which in fact they were I found out), most of it was improvising. Just because Leo and Jonah are big celebrities now, does not mean they can muck around like this. Yes Jonah has had lots of movies like this, but they still had scripts and were actually funny. <br/><br/>I found I was getting my phone out during the movie and playing games and stuff because it was that boring. I reckon the best actor in it was Margot Robbie (Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!!)."

","This film is going to divide people. I don't think I've seen as many leave the cinema during a showing for so long (around 7-8 people from what was a relatively small cinema screening).<br/><br/>Be warned that this ain't no date movie. It may have ladies' favourites Di Caprio and McConnaughey but it's basically a script as if written by a bunch of 1990s testosterone fuelled lads from Maxim, Loaded magazine or the like. It's brash and bold, or crude and vulgar depending on your viewpoint.<br/><br/>It's three hours long, and comprises of long gratuitous orgies, drug fuelled escapades and very misogynistic behaviour. It does grow wearisome at times and I think they made their point early enough.<br/><br/>I'm no prude but I still found this uncomfortable. The characters are anti-heroes, and I found it impossible to enjoy the ride all the way through. It's lewdness from the get go and uncompromising with no real redemption at all.<br/><br/>There's actually little storyline, and the filming style (especially the ending) is mirroring aspects of Goodfellas but doesn't come close at all in quality terms or interest.<br/><br/>It's a mish mash of Goodfellas (without gangsters), Wall Street (without the finance) and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (without the journalism). There's also frat party nonsense too. Don't expect that you'll learn anything about finance from this film. You won't, that's a smokescreen. 'Boiler Room' was a better expose of that part of the industry.<br/><br/>Okay, some of the comedy can be very funny. The lead two lap the whole script up well. It wasn't enough as I wanted a stronger storyline and sat there wondering where is this all going. You could say what made this interesting for the actors were the humorous episodes the leads get themselves into, which in isolation can be hilarious. Collected all together for a three hour viewing gets to be a bit much.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy it. It's a disappointment when you look at the director and lead actor. Nothing much more I can say on it."

","There is a phenomenon in music broadcasting called ""The Loudness War"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war): In order to attract maximum attention, music is compressed to constantly play at maximum volume. Alas, this reduces the dynamic range, leading to music that sounds flat as it lacks any variation. This is exactly how ""Wolf of Wall Street"" felt to me: Three hours of (almost) constant shouting at maximum volume. If you're fine with this, Wolf of Wall Street is probably an entertaining movie. It is certainly well done and has its own style. If you appreciate variation and complexity in the pace and style of a movie, however, you better avoid this one."

Maybe something different happened in the last hour but both my husband and I were so tired of the same thing repeated that we didn't care how it ended. It is hard to imagine this movie (or the acting for that matter) is in the same category as 'Dallas Buyer's Club' or '12 Years a Slave.'

"towhomitmayconcern91","6","3","5","30 January 2014"," We've seen the this story before, but it's lost it's emotion
","Martin Scorsese has always been the Jewel of New Hollywood, he hasn't burned out like Coppola & Cimino, or softened his image by making giant block busters and family films like Spielberg and Lucas. Even his 2011 film Hugo, while a departure from his normal dark crime films still contained his trademark love of all things cinema. So how did his new film ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" ad to his legacy? Well quite frankly we've seen this story before, actually we've seen it twice before in his crime masterpiece Goodfellas, and his chilling biopic (and possible greatest film) Raging Bull. The story of a young hot headed male ( Jordan Belfort, Henry Hill, Jake LaMotta) who starts humble while sinking deeper in their respective world (the corruption of Wall Street, the Italian-American Mafia, or Boxing title fights) is a world Scorsese can tell about growing up in the Machismo rich culture of Italian-American New York. But while each re-telling has seen Scorsese improve his technique and the art of the camera, each successive film has become more sterile. Viewing Raging Bull to this day still is a cinematic art piece that shows the negative consequences of the brutal male psyche, and then in Goodfellas, while Henry Hill follows the same path his character is not one to be sympathized much with, and then finally Jordan Belfort, a character that is as smug and unlikable, but is un-noticed when placed in a film with even more unlikeable characters (looking right at Jonah Hill). None of the characters in this film through the plot even allow you to empathize with them draining the film (with a run time of over 2 hours) of any compassion and only leaving the audience in disgust (especially in the current economic recession, not too many want to see the hubris of Stock Brokers). A Dark comedy, the film offers very few actual laughs, and for all the sex going on the background, none of it is actually sexy, just extravagant and over the top. If it were not for Martin Scorsese being the director I probably wouldn't be rating this film as highly . Not to take from Scorsese as I personally love many of his films (Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino) and with a resume like his he's allowed to make a few good movies opposed to great ones, which is exactly how to describe The Wolf of Wall Street."
"j-schilli89","8","3","5","20 January 2014"," Highly Entertaining, fast paced and funny... but exactly that's the problem!
","No question the film is awesome because it's a huge entertainment, it has hilarious moments and both DiCaprio and Hill bring the characters to life with a great performance.<br/><br/>BUT <br/><br/>that is exactly the problem...<br/><br/>In my opinion the movie falls massively short in showing the reality of this story. The movie shows the insanity of his life, it shows a man that gives in to every pleasure seeking impulse he has and that is arrogant and selfish, that's true. But it shows it in a way that is so entertaining and funny that you tend to forget to realize that his life was totally f***ed up and he ruined not only himself but his family and tens of thousands of other people, whom he betrayed for their hard earned cash. <br/><br/>You leave the cinema and you think that being a drug addict who bangs every wh*** he can bang, does illegal trades, and is a f***ing asshole to the world is the best way to live your life. Why? Because it's so damn fun!!! Because yeah in the end he get's a three year conviction and goes to jail but the people in his company still love him, he's still rich and smart and at the end everything is good because he now has the chance to teach other people how to be like him. All the 18 year old young men in school now think that being a con man and stock broker is the most awesome way to live your life... <br/><br/>Scorsese had a big opportunity to make a great movie (which he did) and change the mainstream way to look at Wall Street and the whole monetary system by showing it in its brutal reality and absurdity. Instead he made an entertaining Hollywood story out of it that keeps the myth alive. Seeing post production interviews with the director I get the idea that they had the right intentions but did not realize that making it so fast and hyper entertaining will not stimulate the people to question what they see but rather find it amazing."
"nilson_carroll","9","3","5","19 January 2014"," Not epic enough for a 3 hour film
","I went into the theater practically shaking with excitement. DiCaprio leading with Jonah Hill supporting, that sounds great. A three hour film directed by Scorcese, sounds even better. Scorcese has never made a bad film, but I feel like he's never quite achieved the zeitgeist bending iconic director position of some of his peers (in particular, Francis Ford Coppola). Still, he's got a great list of films under his belt, and The Wolf of Wall Street, from the commercials alone, seemed like an over the top, epic romp. Flashy and Fellini-esque, the commercials depicted a wild and raunchy character study of Jordan Belfort, a real life Wall Street trickster. And with three hours of film time, I knew I was in for something grandiose, a film that captures an entire lifetime.<br/><br/>I was only half right in my predictions. <br/><br/>The film starts off at something of a wonky pace, as the film sifts through events in Belfort's initial flirtations with the Wall Street money game. An American Psycho version of Matthew McConaughey tells Belfort (DiCaprio) to masturbate twice a day and does cocaine in a restaurant. Belfort loses his job during a stock crash and winds up some morbid Long Island penny stock boiler room, which he quickly takes over with his wit and pseudo sincerity. He meets Jonah Hill, who plays this great greedy Long Island goofball who married his cousin, and the two decide to start playing the stock market in an underhanded manner to get rich quick. <br/><br/>The plan works, and then the movie starts. The first act of the film feels too much like a prologue, whereas I thought it would be more like The Godfather (two plot arcs in one film, which it isn't). Nothing in this first act is boring, and DiCaprio is convincing in every scene, but it meanders, which will probably turn a lot of moviegoers off. <br/><br/>There's also a LOT of nudity and sex. It's over the top, yeah, and sometimes even disturbing in that black comedy kind of way, but most of these scenes are jarring and unfulfilling. The party office scenes are usually disturbing (especially the one where they pay a woman to shave her head), but I wasn't sure how funny they were supposed to be. <br/><br/>The tone is all over the place, and the climax, a cartoonish drug episode, feels out of place and without weight despite how funny and well acted it is. The characters, even when faced with dire situations, never seem to care, and the high stakes never feel very high. There's little tension, yet the elaborate scenes and tone are never extraordinary enough to pass for ""style as substance."" DiCaprio's character just kind of meanders throughout scenes, being an attractive jerk, doing drugs, having sex, spending money, breaking hearts. And it all looks good, it's shot very well, and I personally was never bored, but it's ultimately unsatisfying. It just doesn't push the excess enough to be crazy (Fellini Satyricon, Spring Breakers), and the script is average.<br/><br/>What saves the film is DiCaprio and Hill, what a strange and wonderful pair. Scenes with just the two of them bickering and doing drugs are the highlights of the film. Definitely for fans of those two, but there's not much for anyone else. Not a lot of plot, not a lot of style, it just does not feel epic enough to be three hours. <br/><br/>If anything, American Hustle was the better sort-of crime dramedy of 2013, just because it had a tighter script and more cohesive tone (and Jennifer Lawrence)."
"drojan","7","10","26","19 December 2013"," Good direction, bad editing
","It is always difficult to properly review legendary directors. There always comes a point where movie-making trends and styles have passed them by or the creative juices have simply stopped flowing. This is the case for Scorsese, at least by judging The Wolf of Wall Street. <br/><br/>All of his hallmarks are put to good use in the film. The immediacy and visual assault of the cinematography in particular was exceptional. The dark comedic touches are put to the forefront to great effect. I don't recall ever laughing out loud at Scorsese film before, but there are many such moments here. <br/><br/>The story itself is one of the oldest movie clichés, man overcomes humble beginnings, becomes wealthy, is seduced by money and power, is consumed by his excesses and ultimately redeemed. <br/><br/>The performances are intentionally bombastic and over the top and greatly add to the theme of excess. Jonah Hill especially loses himself in the role and delivers a lot of laughs and some depth to an otherwise shallow and one dimensional character. DiCaprio, while convincing as charismatic and flawed Jordan Belfort, grew tiresome over the course of the film as his character flies directly into the sun and then spectacularly crashes and burns. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the theme of excess extends to the length of the film as well; it is simply way too long. I felt like I was watching a director's cut in the theater. I know the general trend in movies today is longer run times, but at almost 3 hours it is just too much. What should be a highly entertaining two hour wild ride just drags in some places. The outlandish action and comedy scenes lose their bite in the last half of the film as the viewer is just numb from the assault at that point. The dramatic scenes are not well thought out and did not establish an emotional connection with the characters and their downfall as I should.<br/><br/>All in all, a very enjoyable, exciting film but it misses the mark in characterization and left me wanting less bombast and more meat in the story. I see an aging director trying to stay relevant and not wanting to make compromises this movie badly needs."
"writers_reign","5","9","23","17 January 2014"," Loan Wolf
","Against my better judgment I gave this one a whirl and though it passed the time that's really all it did. By and large Scorcese is a one-trick pony and that one trick is not just celebrating but building a monument to excess; nine times out of ten the excess takes the form of violence often with Robert de Niro mistaking psychotic ranting for acting, no doubt encouraged by Scorcese. This time around the excess on display is more or less everything except violence by which I mean sex, drugs, booze and leave us not forget excessive money-making, or, to put it another way, making more money that it's possible to spend so that the addiction is just to the physical act of making money not by digging ditches, punching a clock, selling haberdashery but by conning already gullible people into parting with money for shares in joke companies. You can lay out the premise in one sentence, let alone a whole paragraph so why they devoted three hours to it is anyone's guess unless, of course, they had an image of Oscar pinned up on the set."

Glad he received the Golden Globe and hope he receives the Academy Award. He is probably among difficult competition but he surely will be in contention. The foreign press gave him the Globe for best actor in a comedy. I was surprised about the comedy part but after seeing the film, my sides hurt from laughing so much. Does it glorify Wall Street? NOT from my perspective. I think it makes fun of Wall Street by its never- ending Roman orgy like spectacle. If one is offended by bad language, tons of sex, tons of nudity and drugs galore than this is, perhaps, not the film for you.

From the quick-fire clips it seemed like this would be a funny movie with plenty of serious sides with a good-natured sprinkling of sex appeal (i.e women in skimpy lingerie or even perhaps topless).<br/><br/>Within the first fifteen to thirty minutes of watching it, I came to realize just how incredibly wrong I was. Now, I can appreciate utilizing sex and drugs to make your point in a movie, such as Scorsese did with Good Fellas and Casino, but what he did with this movie was go light years beyond overboard. I don't think it's any kind of an exaggeration to say that 3/4 of this movie is about absolutely nothing other than doing extremely copious amounts of drugs, acting like a bunch of lunatics from an insane asylum, and having sex with anything that possessed the right biology. Oh, and of course, let's not forget the fact that the male leads are completely disrespectful and disgusting to every single woman that enters their lives, including their wives. Someone mentioned in an earlier review that this movie was reminiscent of the ancient Roman orgies, but I honestly think the Romans would have far better decorum than this film. All it seemed to do was showcase the absolute worst kind of sociopaths society has to offer without them being psychopathic serial killers. They even come close to doing that when the lead character decides it's a grand idea to snort a half a ziploc bag full of cocaine, put his four-year-old daughter in the front seat of his car, and go screaming out of the garage in reverse before slamming into a brick light post. Let me just say that thankfully the people who made this film did not depict the little girl being injured despite what looks to be an incredibly painful whiplash. If they had, I would have simply shut the movie off and never watched it again, regardless of how it might have ended.<br/><br/>Let me just say this movie has no redeeming qualities to it. The sheer volume of quite graphic full-frontal nudity, sex, and drug use would probably be enough to make even the raunchiest frat boy look at his buddy and ask, ""Is this all there is with this thing?"" The fact that this movie received so many accolades, award nominations, and even wins, makes me truly despise how pathetic of a turn our society has made. To glorify this kind of completely insanity, to make heroes out of complete sociopaths and psychopaths, to say that everything they did is just fine because it's entertaining is all the more reason for me to justifiably feel that the way our society currently operates needs to end."

","I believe the intention was to show that the real life character had learned from his over the top past and was now doing the right thing but from what I've seen of Jordan Belfort that is yet another con.<br/><br/>Having said that the sheer scale of the excess is funny enough to sweep most viewers along in its wake. Who actually gets to trash a helicopter, yacht and a super luxury car in one film? <br/><br/>So I have very mixed feelings about this. Yes there were lots of funny scenes but the denouement is very unsatisfactory. The ""wolf"" gets a slap on the wrist with a wet bus ticket and promises to pay $110m to his victims.<br/><br/>He also gets a promo for his real life business at the end of the film. It very much looks like he is selling the same questionable sales techniques to a new generation - many of whom will use those skills for harm rather than good.<br/><br/>A telling moment in the film is when Fortune magazine writes an article about the Stratton Oakmont firm and says they are shysters. The Wolf thinks this bad review will sink the firm but instead he is swamped by dozens of young staff who all want to work there.<br/><br/>That moment - unfortunately seems to be what the film is about really. The firm are crooks but enough people are prepared to look the other way to continue the charade. Like the audiences for this film - we come with high expectations - this is Martin Scorsese but instead we get an actor driven film where Di Caprio wallows in the excess for laughs.<br/><br/>Granted he is a fine actor but at least I didn't pay to see this one. I had been given a free pass.<br/><br/>I see in real life that Jordan hasn't been paying off his $110m and until he does better on that front I think he is just another con artist. Now though he has added all of those who watch the film to his tally of victims.<br/><br/>Note: I have watched the real life Jordan on video and there is a striking resemblance to Bobby Cannavale. I wonder if having someone other than Di Caprio in the title role would have been less distracting."

It is definitely a movie which would grab a lot of Awards..Oscar...golden globe because most or all of these Awards are rigged and they cater to ONLY the WOLVES Pack namely USA, UK...Rest of the world that may be dreaming to hold such Lollipop Trophy should change their nationality to American or just Simply Dream ON with Stars and Stripes in your Eyes !!

","Has Scorsese lost his grip or is it just that he can't make comedies? This is about the Wall Street-wannabe who makes lots of money. Sometimes by fooling common people, sometimes not.<br/><br/>But the moral protests here are more about his behaviour with drugs and prostitutes, than a real attack on the system. Scorsese has his unhappy relation towards the bad and makes it more exciting than disgusting.<br/><br/>Of course the narrating is effective and Scorsese has never made a dull second for the screen. But three hours of showing somebody who is just grotesque, isn't good enough anymore. And the worst thing is that this comedy isn't funny."
"rooee","5","4","8","19 January 2014"," How much is that doggy..?
","Martin Scorsese's latest retains all of the energy that is his signature, but fails to fill its overgenerous duration with enough substantial content. The emptiness and lack of ethical backbone holding up U.S. capitalism in the eighties is explained in the first fifteen minutes, with Matthew McConaughey's Mark Hanna telling us it's nothing but ""fairy dust"" - empty promises - to the unknowing customer, but hard cash to the stockbroker. Half an hour in, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a multimillionaire... and we're only a sixth of the way through the movie.<br/><br/>The rest is an uneasy mix of gross-out and slapstick humour and bellowing domestic drama. In Goodfellas, we cared when Henry's and Karen's marriage was collapsing because we empathised - we'd seen Henry's rise from brutalised child, to errand boy, to made man. Belfort starts as a self-confessed greedy misogynist, and then we watch him swell his turgid aspiration, with all the coke and hookers this entails. Belfort isn't a million miles from DiCaprio's Gatsby - except there's no tragedy here. He's repellent from start to finish, with barely a mote of humanity for us to cling to. Unfortunately, in terms of character and theme, this greaseball and his greed are all the movie gives us. Terence Winter's script is full of incidents, most of which are drawn out and light on significance, and only occasionally funny.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is brilliantly broad yet nuanced as Belfort. Jonah Hill is amusing as his horse-toothed sidekick, Donnie. Scorsese's style is in abundance, the camera rarely still, like a living creature snuffling in the muck. But Thelma Schoonmaker needed stricter instructions in the editing suite. Do we really need to see another tiresome orgy? Is the sight of DiCaprio crawling into a Lamborghini really funny enough to consume five minutes of screen time? It would be okay if there was some profound moral conclusion awaiting us at the end, but what we actually get (or appear to get) is the cheeky verification of Belfort's assertion that deep down we all wanna be richer, right now. If it's Winter's and Scorsese's intention to make me feel indignant at this, and make me hate investment bankers more, then fine. But it's a tough watch for such an easy target."

","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" was an incredible cinematic experience. I appreciated the rags-to-riches story (despite the method to leave the ""rags"" behind). ""Wolf"" gave a great insight into the stocks world for those of us not a part of it. It moves you to the point of being compelled to learn the Wall St. world and becoming a force of your own within the financial stratosphere. ""Wolf"" was also inspirational in the sense of depicting how you have no excuse to not succeed or not reach the top of your dreams. Such an unfortunate ending too; you really are brought to root for the underdog. DiCaprio truly impressed me, even after all these years. I'm disappointed for the fact Leonardo was left empty handed at the Golden Globes and he honestly deserved to win the gold for this, hands down!"
"darius-azadeh","9","6","14","19 January 2014"," How many uses of the F-Word? 506?! F**k, that's a lot!
","It's a shame that January is usually known as 'bad movie month"" (e.g Movie 43 last year), because this movie is most certainly not. It really is a unique piece of Scorsese's and DiCaprio's track records. <br/><br/>I've gotta start of with the humour. This movie is so hilariously funny. Like, my jaw was aching when I came out of the theatre. At least every 4 minutes pretty much everyone in there burst out in humongous laughter. There was a guy next to me literally howling with laughter (maybe he thought the 'Wolf' mentioned in the title was literal?). I think the reason it was like that, though, is because it was so effortless. I've got to say, it was funnier than 50% of the comedies I've seen in the past year. It was so effortless because regular comedy movies just try to hit one emotion: Laughter. So they need to really try, because that's it's purpose. This film hit so many other levels of emotions that everything about it felt so organic and the humour was placed so perfectly. Even the scenes where the story got deep were full of so many emotions and were hard to watch. You could feel it. It was obviously down to the script (there are some parts where you can tell the actors are about to crack up), but also the editing. It had such great comic timing, and was so subtle that it felt completely natural.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that Jonah Hill is that same actor that played the goofy kid in 'Superbad' way back in 2007. It's the best performance of his I think I've seen. It went past the point of seeing Jonah Hill with all his Jonah Hill-isms playing a character that Jonah Hill always plays. For those 3 hours he genuinely was Donny Azoff, and played the role perfectly. He even managed to develop the character through the acting so subtly but so effectively. <br/><br/>You can't not mention DiCaprio when talking about performances in this film. Aside from being the brilliant talent he already is, he worked so hard at the role and it defiantly paid off. The parts where he broke the 4th wall while narrating were so seamless, and when his character fell on hard times, he portrayed it with so many different emotions that his character was becoming so complex it was believable. He could have fallen into so many clichés trying to do that, but seemed to have no trouble side-stepping them. I mean, those scenes where he's 'under the influence' show that this guy is prepared to go above and beyond for his roles. Also, even though he was only in it for a short while, McConaughey deserves a shout. I've only seen him in as trailer for 'Ghosts of Girlfriends Past' as one of the ads on my copy of 'Quantum of Solace' (I think. Anyway, beside the point), so had no idea what to expect. But boy, he can defiantly act. It's because Scorsese knew what he wanted to get out of his actors. <br/><br/>He was definitely the genius behind all of this. His direction is another thing you just can't flaw. Everything little thing added so much to the story or the humour or the characters. His way of making everything so surreally extravagant was an incredible medium into a real life situation. To some it probably seems that the amount of profanity and sex was unnecessary, but I think if there was any less the film wouldn't have been as powerful. <br/><br/>A 3 hour thrill ride of hilarious eccentricity and amazing performances, this is a film to be experienced. You'd think that during 180 minutes the pacing would start to drag, but just when you think it does, it'll suck you right back in with underlying comic genius or subtle character development. <br/><br/>In a way, it felt nostalgic. And in a word, it was incredible."

The directing was amusing, di caprio rocked in this movie, matthew mcconaughey at the start was amazing, and I really loved the dialogue that they had. Credit had to be given also to Jonah Hill, who proved that he is a well-respected actor. I am very angry with people, who say that it was more like soft-core. IF YOU can't stand nudity then Don't WATCH IT. Stop acting like a baby. If you are watching movies just to pass your time and feel happy about it, don't watch Martin Scorsese movies. He is different and he is amazing. I believe that people who didn't like this movie are stupid and they do not have a good taste of movies. The build up was amazing.

"ptb-8","5","5","11","2 February 2014"," The sad new low in cinema.
","I am going to amend my review below, as I have had several days to mull over the tragic depth this to which awful movie has taken us. It might be clever 'Scorscese' film making, but really it is a horrible excessive movie about utter pigs. Yes I get the 'haha they are drug animals without consciousness' but really. Hasn't Marty just also steamrolled right over the line of what can be put on a mainstream movie. I think this film is filth. Just depravity and a sad new low to what can appear on a multiplex cinema screen. Leonardo is so well liked and to see Marty excess the reasonable acceptability by having this young man and all other actors just degrade themselves so they can appear in a 'Martin Scorscese film' ... well it is a hollow victory. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is a degrading sad film made by an old man who likes to see good looking young people degrade themselves for his own gratification. He has insulted and degraded the entire film making system and those who participated in this ridiculous ugly mean film by being willing to undress and make ugly naked faces of themselves. It is horrible and a new low, the lowest since HOSTEL 2 in mainstream American movie making and nothing to admire or be proud of. I am sad for US film making and Scorscese needs to retire. It's grubby and Marty has grubbied young admirable talented Leonardo. Bad Bad and sad. <br/><br/>Martin Scorscese had outed himself as a defiler. A defiler and corrupter of youth. <br/><br/>My previous statement: Yes it is a very clever film, well edited acted and written. However like that 10th line of cocaine, by the third hour of WOLF OF WALL STREET there is an overdose imminent. Some films can be too clever for their own endurance test, and whilst there is much to guffaw at and much to be faux-shocked at, after 120 minutes and before 172 minutes I just became bored with the whole thing. Again we get the hyperactive Scorscese swooshing narrative and the pantomime of men-without-a-conscience and the terrible things they do to each other, their women and the audience. It is all colossal and then after it is over, I am glad I will never feel like watching any part of it ever again. Three hours without story suspense, a bit of character build, just episode after episode of CASINO/SCARFACE/NY blather, and yes we have seen it all before. How poor Thelma ever edited this bombastic overload of brute force money avalanche greed etc etc and not lost her mind having to watch it over and over and over again whilst tweaking it into its releasable shape, to me is another more interesting story deserving of an Oscar. I admired the production more than I liked the film."
"sandlynn2","Null","5","11","20 January 2014"," Great acting but terrible editing
","An hour and a half in, I couldn't believe how bored I was. Sex, drugs, general debauchery, yes, we get it. Maybe if you're going after the 18-24 male demographic it makes sense, but for people wanting a film with a plot line, it is excessive. A half hour would have gotten the point across just as well. Had we not known it was up for an Oscar, we might have just walked out at that point, but we figured that it must improve at some point. Right after my husband and I were whispering about how shockingly bored we were, the plot line finally moved on, and it was OK from there. The acting is all first-rate. Can't believe that it is up for an Oscar though; it's a good hour too long."
"Ser_Stephen_Seaworth","10","9","24","25 December 2013"," The master is back.
","Bacchus, Roman god of wine and debauchery, is alive and well and has been brought to raunchy life by Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese's latest film ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". His human incarnation is Jordan Belfort, a fast-talking financial kingpin whose balls-to-the-wall lifestyle of sex and drugs and rolling in dough would make Gordon Gekko take a step back and reassess his lifestyle.<br/><br/>And for what seems to be the first time, Scorsese's decade-long collaboration with DiCaprio has finally paid off. Because ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", written by ""Sopranos"" scribe Terence Winter, is a far cry from the polished but lifeless films that Scorsese, master that he is, has been pumping out of late. It is perhaps his most energetic film since ""Gangs of New York"", his cleanest (in craftsmanship, though certainly not in content) since ""Goodfellas"". Instead of wise-guys and low-rent mobsters, ""Wolf"" is about the sharks that swam in the seas of the 1%, ripping into their prey with gusto while coming at them with smiles.<br/><br/>Set in the '80s and '90s, Scorsese depicts a glitz-and-chintz world ripe for the taking for any ambitious youth who wanted to make a name for himself. Enter Belfort, a fresh-faced twenty- something who starts on the bottom rung at one of the many firms in Lower Manhattan. He quickly becomes the acolyte of the head honcho (Matthew McConaughey, who in only a few short scenes manages to give one of the performances of the year), and in doing so learns the tricks of the trade, which involve indulging in any and all sins of the flesh.<br/><br/>But when the market goes belly-up, Belfort (not wanting to go out on his ass like all the other Wall Street schmucks) realizes that he can take advantage of ""penny-stocks"" that no one cares about, pitching them to anyone gullible enough to buy them. Soon, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oakmont, with a merry band of miscreants, including his right-hand man Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). Soon, Stratton Oakmont becomes a major, major player in the stock world, luring huge clients in with the hopes of paying out big-time. Except all that Belfort, Azoff and the others care about is their own gain, and the more they make, the more they want. And of course, absolutely none of what Stratton does is legal, so obviously the feds (represented by a dogged Kyle Chandler) seek to rain on Belfort's parade.<br/><br/>But before that, the parade roars in full orgiastic force. Scorsese's film is an epic, three hours of every kind of cardinal sin short of murder, with characters both repulsive and entrancing, in a hysterically funny and painfully horrific saga of depravity as only Scorsese can bring. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing never once makes the film feel its length, and Winter's script is jam-packed with colorful moments and almost surreal hedonism. There are so many drug-fueled sequences that anyone who goes in sober will come out with a contact high.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most impressive thing about the film is that, at long last, DiCaprio has learned to loosen up. ""Wolf"" allows him to finally sink his teeth in a full-on comic role, and he makes it work impeccably. His energy crackles with every single actor, and he even shows an adeptness at physical comedy (there's a scene involving a 'luded-up Jordan trying to roll himself down stairs that might be the funniest moment of the year). But the rest of the cast is equally up to the task to match him. Jonah Hill is in rarest form here, giving an excellent performance and displaying grand chemistry with DiCaprio. There are guys like Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal, even Spike Jonze in a small role that are absolutely wondrous to watch. And I do have to give special shout-outs to Jean Dujardin and Joanna Lumley, both of whom stole the show in playing characters that end up as part of Belfort's scheme to hoard his riches. (If ""Wolf""'s cast has an Achilles heel, it's Margot Robbie as Belfort's bride, who I feel tries so hard to be on Lorraine Bracco's level but comes off as a second-rate Sharon Stone.)<br/><br/>Even as the film draws to its close, there's not a single moment where ""Wolf of Wall Street"" wants to relinquish its hold on us. We're in it for the long haul, as Belfort's protégés must have been. And for Scorsese and Schoonmaker, hardly spring chickens, to revive the decadence of the gods in all of its party-hearty glory is something to behold. ""Wolf of Wall Street"" had me flying high, and I'm still waiting to come down from it"

","Three hours of typical Martin Scorsese knocking you sideways, sweeping you off your feet and blowing your fuse are what you get with this film. Every scene excels in bringing the animal in all of us and every other scene or so is a giddy whirlpool of unmitigated profligacy and orgies that make you question how true the story really is. Jordan Belfort is a character that can't stop plumbing the depths of depravity, drowning in wads upon wads of banknotes and seizing every opportunity he eyes, and the magnificent Leonardo DiCaprio delivers perfectly as always.

","A stylish, exhilarating film to experience (although hardly - despite the incredible 'quaaludes' sequence - three hours worth). Nor is it the first to be called 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. That distinction belongs to a long-lost early talkie starring George Bancroft that opened a few months before the original Wall Street crash of 1929. And the new 'Wolf of Wall Street' amply demonstrates that the United States of America has learned absolutely nothing in the intervening ninety years.<br/><br/>DiCaprio acknowledges at one point that the life that he and his cronies lead is unsustainable in the Real World, ""but who wants to live there?"" This is of course an option denied the colossal army of poor working stiffs (many of them women) with their feet planted firmly on the ground working long hours for peanuts working as waiters, domestic staff and nurses; as well as manufacturing the sharp suits and industrial-strength quantities of drugs consumed by the leads ""sailing a boat fit for a Bond villain"".<br/><br/>This army remains as invisible throughout most of this film as the consumption by the masters they spend their lives servicing and cleaning up after is conspicuous; which graphically demonstrates the harmfulness of giving the predominantly white male parasites who populate this movie ""more money than you know what to do with"".<br/><br/>Billionaire conservatives meanwhile continue to sanctimoniously demand where the money to create adequate universal health cover in the richest nation on Earth would come from."

Why is that? Because Belfort is not stupid and although he did scam people my estimation of the man is not really the same as Leo's character.<br/><br/>Of course like all true stories the characters good and mostly bad characters are exaggerated. But this guy is such a piece of crap and so is his sidekick and the wife. Hot yes, but horrible as a person.<br/><br/>Like I said I don't want to point the finger at the real life Belfort because it is possible he has turned his back on this stuff.

","Martin Scorcese seems to have a penchant for creating films about loathsome characters. That being said, the low-lifes in this film make the gang in GoodFellas seem like a bunch of guys you'd really like to hang with.<br/><br/>If you can like a film about dislikeable people, then the director of that film has really achieved something (GoodFellas, for example). This movie however left me with an excruciating three-hour urge to strangle someone. In fact, the only thing I found myself applauding was the piece of ham that got caught in the throat of Donnie Azoff (played to the nth degree of irritation by Jonah Hill).<br/><br/>Speaking of ham, the entire cast was guilty of histrionic hysteria, including the usually reliable Leonard DiCaprio. They all seemed eager to show the audience just how pleased they were to be in a Scorcese movie. And Scorcese himself seemed eager to show the audience that he can still make a film that is not even near as good as, but is kinda, sorta, almost like GoodFellas (hadn't he learned anything from Casino?)<br/><br/>This is the 2nd time I've panned a Scorcese film on this site, so I decided to look at his body of work and see how many of his films I've truly enjoyed over the years. There aren't many. GoodFellas, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, The Last Temptation of Christ, The Last Waltz, and After Hours are my choices for his best efforts.<br/><br/>I wouldn't suggest that Mr. Scorcese is not a good director.

While I can respect that as an artistic choice in this case it just seemed like they added a half cup too many boobs, and a tablespoon too much coke to the film recipe and no one had the heart to tell them. After an hour I started watching the clock, wondering how much longer they could stretch this story out. It's very, very rare that after a movie I have that feeling of frustration at an evening wasted. In this case I can resoundingly say that I wasted my night on this particular movie."

","I had heard some negative things about the movie, but finally ended up seeing it on a flight. its a long movie but doesn't feel like one. dicaprio acts brilliantly yet again. the movie is a true story of a wall street guy, and depicts his journey to the top; its a telling commentary on human greed. the fact that it was a true story somehow made a bigger impact on me. a valuable insight i got from the movie was how most of us are suckers as far as aggressive salespeople are concerned. they can cheat us, and yet keep selling to us again and again ! such is our greed and meekness ! scorcese is great at making biopics"

","The wolf is brilliant with its fangs; however it veers sometime from the main drama of Wall street; too much sex and drug abuse gives an undesirable image of Wall street; Caprio and Scorsese are brilliant; I felt the single concept of Stone's Wall street to be more riveting; the film is too long and at times repetitive;...on the whole a valuable experience of human traits. 'Money brings in all kinds of comforts as well as problems' has been brilliantly portrayed. The ensemble acting is very good. Martin known for his gangster films tackles the financial racket with equal poise and is in total control. it gives at times a little bad taste with its explicit immorality in the money market; however the human greed is well brought out."
"excavator","8","2","3","3 June 2014"," Great, not perfect...
","I've always been a fan of Martin Scorcese's work. He's had great cooperations with Leonardo Dicaprio before, so for me, this was a must see. However, I have some mixed feelings about the result.<br/><br/>On the upside I thought the level of acting was great. I have always been a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio's work, and, even though I didn't feel that much sympathy for his character, he portrayed Jordan Belfort beautifully. Jonah Hill did a solid job as well, and I liked the absolutely gorgeous Margot Robbie very much (and not just because she didn't leave much to the imagination). As you can expect from Martin Scorcese, the movie is very well made, the photography was great, and the music supported the scenes very well. As far as atmosphere goes, you could really feel the madness. And last but not least, I was happy there was room for some humor.<br/><br/>On the downside, I felt it was a very superficial portrait. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how close the storytelling of the movie is to the book, but at times the movie felt like a giant collection of moments out of Jordan Belfort's life, rather than the story of his life. Even though the movie lasts for three hours, there's little or no room for character development. The focus was also continuously on Jordan himself and his side of the story. For example the whole fraud aspect was shown as his big success. There was no room for his victims in the movie. The investigation by the FBI was also rather non existing, as is his relationship with Naomi. After he gets to know her and marries her, she almost completely disappears to the background.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's a good movie, with a powerful portrayal of Jordan Belfort, for which I'm still giving an 8/10. However, the story could have been told better, making it more of a story, allowing characters to develop and showing more than just one side of it."
"cguldal","7","2","3","3 June 2014"," Great fictional work from Hollywood
","This is one of those films that will make the smart consumer think about what it means to ""like"" a piece of art work (if you can call Hollywood filmmaking that). Is the film glorifying the horrible crimes that Belfort and his cronies committed, and if so, can one still judge the film and the actors based on their performance and not on the morality of its subject matter? It's difficult, and I respect both types of opinions. <br/><br/>Just looking at the film as a fictional story (which I am sure it is, mostly, since Belfort seems to have a knack for embellishing the truth and making a seemingly uninteresting thing the most exciting thing in the world to sell it as best as he can), the plot is rather formulaic for Hollywood standards. Character development is not the main point here, as the characters are larger than life caricatures, even down to the ""boy scout"" FBI guy who has it in for the bad guy (whose motives and story are almost entirely unknown to us, since the story is narrated by Belfort). DiCaprio is in top form, but the rest of the actors and actresses take the prize in genuinely thrilling performances. The acting is probably the best aspect of the film (apart from the glimmer and shine), as every single main and supporting role is played to full potential and perfectly to fit the caricature written out for it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting character is Belfort's number 1, Donnie. We see more character development here, where the nerdy and greedy guy rises to the top and lives a very large life. His morals seem even more lacking than Belfort's, but this is perhaps because Belfort is telling the story. <br/><br/>The other interesting, though not novel, part of the story is the role of drugs in Wall Street. Drugs and inevitably sex. It is perhaps alarming that the markets that can ruin our lives by crashing, etc. are run by people who abuse drugs all the time. Belfort is not the one to say this first, and I am sure he won't be the last, either.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is ""entertaining,"" if not cringe-worthy. Some moments that are absolutely hilarious in their absurdity can make you cry if you lost a lot of money in the market or lost your job in the recent economic crisis, because in reality, they are not funny. That a company can make billions within hours of a launch, well, that is just sickening no matter what your world view is, unless you are the guy who is making all the money (in which case it is kind of sickening, still, but in a different way).<br/><br/>Moralistically, the film is like any art work that deals with humans who commit crimes. I did not find it more glorifying than mafia films where the godfather orders people's deaths ""for the family."" The truth is most humans have a moral understanding and ways to justify their actions according to some moral structure, no matter how twisted or unorthodox the rest of the people might think their structure is. Belfort justified his actions in some ways, and his actions hurt people (including his family), like any other criminal. I did not come away with a message from the film that said ""What Belfort did was awesome!"" It was certainly something more like ""Belfort was successful. His success hurt other people and helped some others. In general, he was an asshole, who did not care much about anyone, but himself and for anything, but getting rich.""<br/><br/>The real message is: don't invest your money in the stock market unless you are filthy rich. And even then, don't invest too much of it."
"blagomeni","7","2","3","26 May 2014"," Some movies simply have to be pleasing
","Some movies simply have to be pleasing. They have to provide a certain amount of satisfaction to movie goers because they are directed by a renowned director or they cast actors who give their best in each and every role they play. The Wolf of Wall Street should have been one of these movies. This feature gets off to a strong start. For a while this initial putsch keeps you moving forward, expecting something to happen, something that would make you think, ""Yes! This is the movie I've been waiting for so long that I've forgotten what a good movie feels like"". Sadly, it does not get to be this movie. While getting to know the plot and the main characters something creeps into the mind of the observer. The nagging in the background becomes slightly louder with each new scene or dialog. In the end, the nagging becomes so loud that one can only shout, ""Shut up! , I want this to be a good movie, I want it to make me feel good."" Still, despite excellent performances by the actors and Martin Scorsese's best efforts, it fails to be this movie. Perhaps I'm spoiled, accustomed to certain probably unfairly high standards and expectations from the names of DiCaprio and Scorsese in the credits. Even if it were so, this movie is still full of much of which is unnecessary. So many narcotics floating around in the scenes that I ask myself, how is it even possible that these people could stand on their feet every morning. There are also a couple of scenes where there was no reason to show nudity. Don't get me wrong, I love nudity in movies. I do, honestly, but I also expect it to be a part of the story, a part that independently and harmoniously knits the plot together with all other elements of the story telling. In this feature, some of the nudity is simply embarrassing. Margot Robbie did not need to bare it all. All compliments to Ms. Robbie, but she should have thought harder before agreeing to the scene. Jonah Hill's pleasure trip during the party scene was also a bit over the top for me. What I liked best about this movie is Leonardo. I do not want to sound like a broken record, but the man is an excellent actor. He gave his best to this movie and it is simply not his fault I did not enjoy the movie as much as I wanted to. Fortunately enough there is one scene in the movie which alone makes it worth seeing. After taking more than a few Quaalude Lemmon 714 pills, DiCaprio's character looses the use of his speech and of his legs. This is when we get to see DiCaprio give one of his best performances I have seen since he portrayed Arnie Grape in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. In these few minutes he shows us what a great actor he is, and how little is required to make a masterpiece of a short sequence. This is not a bad movie by any standards. I did like it, but not to the extent I wanted to. I expected more. I would still tell you all to go and see it. Perhaps we can compare notes? Cheers."
"elgabote","7","2","3","10 May 2014"," A fun movie, no much more than that
","I'll start saying that I liked this movie, is fun and doesn't have the typical Hollywood filters and censure, that makes it authentic and explicit (sometimes that's good, or at least fun). It reminded me a lot to ""Fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" which I love. That said, I don't think it is the masterpiece that most of the critics are proclaiming. DiCaprios acting is undeniably good, he's being growing up as an actor for many years and he has made very clear that he can make a movie good on his own, and this is one of those cases. The support actors are good in their roles (especially the short but excellent part of McConaughey) but the irreplaceable here is Di Caprio, he steals the show. Not much more than a showcase of fun events involving a group of drug addicts enjoying excess in every way possible, and how they go to hell for what they do. From my point of view, not a great story, and it could have been shorter too... Photography wasn't anything exceptional neither. But the good writing (even if it's a bit repetitive as a consequence of being so long) made me enjoy this movie a lot.<br/><br/>Very good acting and writing, good/average photography and story.<br/><br/>The movie is really good fun, if you have 3 hours to spend watching it!!"

","I'm very far to be an expert, so my opinion is just the one of a ""common person"" who watches movies in the night to have fun / enjoy some time. My opinion is that the movie is very attracting, it's fast and you don't get bored. There is a good plot and when you can get lost or bored, there are some scenes that make you laugh or, anyway, catchy enough to catch again your attention. Anyway, after 2 hours, I have to say that I've started to look at the watch, because I was tired. That's it. It was absolutely enough, without removing anything special to the plot, to have a 2 hours movie. Di Caprio is absolutely great, but the other main characters are great, too. My vote would have been 9 without doubts."
"sunshinebeachcinema","8","2","3","18 April 2014"," Leo strikes back with his latest Scorsese collaboration.
","The fifth collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street tells the true story of the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), a New York stockbroker who made it big in the wake of the financial crisis of the late '80s by shady and frequently illegal means. More interesting is what he does with his new found fortune: what follows is a heady tale of excess and debauchery based on Belfort's own memoirs.<br/><br/>Despite the more recent financial turmoil, or perhaps because of it, the image of the '80s stockbroker has resurfaced for a new generation. Belfort's story strays into the early '90s, but the general aesthetic of the era has the same nostalgic feel, and the messages seem to be the same. Even if we openly loathe bankers, there's a voyeuristic fascination in watching their decadent lifestyle – or what we imagine such a lifestyle to be like: high stress, fast living, dubious morality and plenty of drugs and sex to boot. The Wolf of Wall Street gives its audience a welcome window into this world.<br/><br/>The story begins when Jordan arrives in the city as a bright eyed, newly qualified broker; having already achieved his youthful dream of working on Wall Street. After an initially unwelcome brief induction into a life of cocaine and lunchtime cocktails by his new boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) the rug is pulled out from under his feet, and he soon swaps blue chips for penny stocks, trading shares worth a fraction of a dollar from a Long Island brokerage on a strip mall.<br/><br/>Upon realising that these unlisted stocks can fetch a much higher commission than blue chips, he decides to go into business with a bunch of unscrupulous buddies who know a thing or two about sales, using their silver tongues to make millions by trading them on a massive scale, all the while trying to stay one step ahead of the law. For in truth he is committing outright stock fraud – the details of which are fairly complicated; even Belfort himself chooses not to bore us with the details with his tongue in cheek narration.<br/><br/>The stellar cast is rounded out by players including Jonah Hill, as Belfort's toothy associate Donnie, Rob Reiner as his complicit accountant father Max Belfort, and Jon Favreau as lawyer Manny Riskin.<br/><br/>The movie treads a thin line between satire and glorification, but Jordan is undoubtedly the hero of the piece, and the FBI agents on his trail the antagonists he must outwit. As an audience, we are invited to his party, and we witness nothing of the effects that Belfort's deceptions have had on those who were duped into buying his shares – bearing in mind these 'customers' are average people parting with their savings, not huge companies dealing in huge sums of money. This disconnection effectively puts us in Belfort's shoes: much as they must have appeared to him, they are mere voices on the end of a phone.<br/><br/>But Jordan is not portrayed as completely heartless. No matter how large his company grows, swelled with a never-ending number of skilled and promising applicants, his loyal gang of hometown reprobates are never left behind, and maintain high-ranking positions until the end. Even when arrested, and forced to wear a wire by the FBI, he attempts to warn Donnie, rather than let him incriminate himself.<br/><br/>Gratuitous drug use and sexual content aside, the film's vulgarity can perhaps be summed up by its smashing of the record for the most uses of the f-word in a mainstream non-documentary film, at the rate of around three a minute. The only film scoring higher is a documentary devoted to the word.<br/><br/>Much of the decadence is played for laughs, or at least as a showcase of extravagance, but coupled with the basic shock value of the actions themselves. One memorable sequence sees Belfort snorting cocaine to counteract the effects of a powerful sedative, paralleled with the Popeye cartoon playing on the television in the background.<br/><br/>The film does little to condemn Belfort – although his lifestyle unravels, and he is ultimately incarcerated, any true comeuppance is minimal. This is a reflection of the truth: Belfort's sentence was just four years, of which he served less than two, which, if the film is to be believed, were in a comfortable minimum security environment for white collar offenders.<br/><br/>These days, he still makes a handsome living as a motivational speaker lecturing on sales technique, and of course, anyone who gets their autobiography made into a Scorsese picture starring Leonardo DiCaprio must have lucked out in the long run."
"benniekro","8","2","3","13 April 2014"," Sex, Drugs, and Money
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that depicts the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort who, through greed and corruption, established and led his own brokerage firm to success in the early 1990's. After losing his job at an established financial firm on Black Monday, Belfort fills a position dealing penny stocks in Long Island and subsequently partners with his new friend, Donnie Azoff, to found Stratton Oakmont. Belfort's aggressiveness in the market earned him the nickname, Wolf of Wall Street. Jordan and his team lived high-profile lifestyle full of parties, sex, and drugs (primarily cocaine and Quaaludes). Eventually Stratton Oakmont becomes a very well known firm and facilitates the IPO for Steve Madden, which instantly earned Jordan $20million dollars. Jordan decides to hide his money in an offshore account in Switzerland under his aunt-in-laws name. The FBI begins heavy investigations into Stratton Oakmont, and after ducking and dodging them for a couple years eventually one of his associates gets arrested, spills the beans about the operation, and Jordan is sentenced to prison for 36 months. <br/><br/>I was thoroughly entertained by the film, and found most of the humor in good taste. The comedic aspect of the film is in my opinion is strongest suit. I would have liked to see more character development, and less predictable debauchery considering it was a three-hour film. Although some of the scenes felt repetitive. Leonardo DiCaprio and cast did a great job of building anticipation and suspense. I enjoyed the use of long cuts in certain scenes of the film such as the scene where Jordan Belfort punches his wife in the belly and attempts to take their child from their home ultimately crashing the car in front of their property. There were many memorable moments in the film, and I took from it interesting quotes such as, ""The only thing standing between you and your girl is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it,"" which Belfort said during one of his speeches. <br/><br/>I believe a different approach to the film would've been to include characters that were negatively affected by Jordan Belfort's exploits. Without showing the effect Belfort's schemes had on his clients the film seems to glorify scamming people out of their money. There were many scenes in which Belfort's clients invest a serious portion of their savings with him only to be conned and lose it all. It would've been interesting for me if within the three hour time slot they included a few scenes depicting this tragedy."
"nairtejas","7","2","3","13 April 2014"," A Maddeningly Ferocious Genre Of Cinema. ♦ 70%
","This is not black comedy, this is utter boldness. It climbs on your body and takes hold of your whole damn face and then barks on your ears, flashes on your eyes & talks sitting on your mouth. This is cinema at its most vulnerable phase, harnessed to tell a story which cannot be told in any other possibly charismatic way.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has fascinated me with his themes and not his works themselves; he finds details in the simplest story & barfs it into hell of a script. With The Wolf..., he does the same. Telling a story was not enough, so he extrapolates. The life & times of a maverick stockbroker told from all points of view. There is nudity, sex, drugs, porn, society, money, business, animals, wild human beings and genius. 3 hours of maddeningly extraordinary tale of a person concludes to a magnificent climax and that is what I loved about it the most, the climax.<br/><br/>The performances are immense and intense. Leonardo DiCaprio is hands down, a phenomenal actor. Jonah Hill has catapulted his power & career to the space. Supporting cast is excellent. The music is good but I am not happy with the editing, which could've been more tight had they given attention to the post-processing.<br/><br/>But, the question is do we need such hybrid boldness to depict something so simple? It solely depends on the watcher. I for one got bored at some point in the film with all the shenanigans the mischief machines do during the second half, but the humor kept me hanging there. It also is factor to consider that when you observe closely, it talks nothing new as such. So, with a brilliant screenplay, what does it achieve? Maybe send a message? Nope. The message is already conveyed by some other movie. All it does is imbibe audacity into the themes of power, money, corruption & sex. But I appreciate what the makers have done to give respect to the talent of Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Everyone should give this a try & think for themselves how it can be analyzed as a cinema & where it stands aesthetically & culturally. For movie buffs, this is a good 3-hour noon show. Nothing more.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO (It has all the things Indian parents don't approve of; so it'd be better if you don't even utter the title of the film. It is also the film with most use of the F word, FYI.)"

"mrrockey","8","2","3","5 March 2014"," A Funny, Energetic Ride That Will Keep You Glued to the Seats till the Very End
","It's always funny to me how, so many people think that Scorsese only makes mafia and gangster flicks but when you actually look at his filmography, only like, 10% of his films revolve around gangsters or the mafia. Scorsese's recurring theme in his movies doesn't seem to be crime, but characters dealing with guilt. Whether it be Charlie from Mean Streets, Jake LaMotta from Raging Bull, Henry Hill from Goodfellas, or even Frank Pierce from Bringing Out the Dead. Since he's explored this theme so many times now, can Scorsese still deliver? Let's find out!<br/><br/>The plot follows Jordan Belfort, a rich, highly successful stockbroker who starts out working a low-level job at an established Wall Street firm where he quickly becomes attracted to the world of stocks but loses his job due to Black Monday. Then, he starts his OWN brokerage firm titled ""Stratton-Oakmont"" with his new friend, Donnie Azerto and from then on, the company skyrockets to the top by doing pump and dump scams and they live in a world full of sex and drugs while the FBI is hot on their trail.<br/><br/>The thing that surprised me most about this movie was how FUNNY it was. When you think of Scorsese, you usually don't think of things that are funny but this movie is so over-the-top, it's hilarious. Every character in this movie is portrayed in an over-the-top fashion, they all do things you don't expect any normal human being to do. They have sex in the office in front of everyone, they get their dicks sucked in public, and they do more drugs than you could ever dream of in your wildest imaginations. This makes for a very funny and entertaining film because as you watch it, you can't help but laugh at how absurd it is but also fantasize about living the life these guys are living in.<br/><br/>But while this is a comedy film, it also has a lot of heavy drama in it. This movie has a bit of a bipolar tone to it, one minute you might be laughing hysterically, and the next minute you might drop your jaw from being incredibly shocked at what you just saw. For example, there's a scene where Jordan gets so overwhelmed by the huge amounts of Quaaludes he took, he falls right down to the floor and can't walk and there's a lot of physical comedy in this scene as Jordan tries to make it down a set of stairs and we're laughing and enjoying ourselves for a while but then, all of a sudden, we see Jordan's baby daughter walk into the room, seeing her dad all high on Quaaludes and to quote RedLetterMedia, it feels like a punch to the gut and that's what the whole movie felt like to me. One minute there's laugh-out-loud comedy, next minute, there's heavy, intense drama that might get hard to watch. I'd have a problem with this if it felt very schmultzy and heavy-handed but Scorsese depicts it very raw and brutal so it feels natural and we don't find the shift of tone too jarring to watch.<br/><br/>While Jordan Belfort is definitely a douchebag, DiCaprio surprisingly makes his character very likable for a lot of the film. He has this magnetic charm and confidence to him that makes the audience like and root for him even when he's doing terrible things and there's moments where we see essences of humanity to him such as when he gives his employee five times the money she needed to support her kids which are really important to make his character be at least SOMEWHAT sympathetic but at the same time, he never loses the douchebag attitude that makes you WANT to hate him, but you don't because deep down, we all sort of want to do the things he does throughout the film. Everyone else in the cast was strong too but the only real standouts were Jonah Hill as Donnie Azerto and Margot Robbie as Jordan's wife, Naomi. In this film, I didn't see Jonah Hill at all, I saw Donnie Azerto, THAT'S how good he was. And this has GOT to be the breakthrough for Margot Robbie, who seems very real and natural as someone who tries to TOLERATE her husband's wild behavior, but ultimately gives up as she realizes throughout what kind of man he is.<br/><br/>The editing in this film is incredibly frenetic and energetic. There's a lot of slow-mo, freeze-frames, jump cuts, and there's a lot of moments where they'll make you think nothing went wrong for our protagonist, next thing you know, they cut BACK to show what REALLY happened and this really helps get you into the mind of Jordan Belfort as he's constantly on drugs and not always aware of what's going on.<br/><br/>But despite how good those things were, there are some problems with the film. I've noticed that the script has a habit of spoon- feeding everything to the audience. Now, I understand that not everyone understands how Wall Street works so we need to explain it in a simple way for them to understand but I don't like how there's so many scenes where the visuals speak perfectly for itself but yet, they still have to narrate it for us. Come on Scorsese, we're not that stupid. I also felt that outside of Jordan, Donnie, Naomi, and Jordan's dad, Max Belfort, the rest of the characters just sort of came and went without us knowing them a whole lot. I wished we could've spent more time to know them a little better.<br/><br/>But overall, this is a funny, energetic film that will keep your eyes glued to the screen by either making you laugh your balls off or by making you gasp at what's happening to our characters. If you are a Socrsese fan, or even just a fan of good cinema, you'll love it. 8/10"

I saw lots of parallels between that movie and the movie Goodfellas (1990) from the same director - Scorcese. The same kind of voice-over, the same kind of characters, plot movements, etc. Scorcese was copying himself, which I thought was really really weak from such a renowned director. Like no original ideas in this one, just a lot of naked women added to it. I think the naked women shocked American audiences and made the movie be more remarkable here, but it's really not that good of a movie. The crooked shenanigans that the traders were doing on Wall Street stock exchanges to make tons of money so fast were phony and faked-very unrealistic and exaggerated. DiCaprio's acting was over the top, which I liked a lot that he could do that. That was the best part of the movie for me, was watching him."

And usually a film that I'm happy to watch to the end gets a minimum of six stars. <br/><br/>But at the end of three hours, I felt a bit cheated. This film needed a plot. As it stands, the story is: self-assured character (Jordan) sets up a corrupt brokerage firm and gets rich, he can't cover his crimes successfully and the authorities send him to prison, then he becomes a motivational speaker. And that's it. This story is bulked out by great scenes, but scenes that don't give any depth to the film. <br/><br/>How could this have been a better film? There was a potential storyline in the treachery of his friend that leads to Jordan's imprisonment, but it's never explored. Or the resolutely incorruptible cop - he was an interesting character, an utter contrast to Jordan, but only appeared for a few minutes. <br/><br/>With nothing that would enable the characters to develop, this film ultimately failed to satisfy."

Jordan isn't a hero or a role model whose life should be celebrated or emulated. He made tons of money illegally, disrespected the law and the system, abused drugs and had multiple sex partners. There is no reason to why he did it and nothing extraordinary about how he did it. The movie is about Jordan having no limits. He did whatever he wanted and how much he wanted. There is no greatness about his life or a lesson to be learned. Sure, the movie is filled with fun, humor and brilliant performances, but for a biopic, it could have been about a hero."

There's no memorable quote, scene or something that make me think ""Maybe I can buy the BRay or DVD because I want see it again sometimes at home"" ...and it lasts three hours!!! The whole movie is kept up by DiCaprio, he's a proved first-class actor but alone, in this movie, can't do miracles. McConaughey character was not developed at all and we can almost consider his role as a cameo. He disappear in the first half hour. Probably he deserved the role of Donnie Azoff, a character that Jonah Hill is unable to boost to his real potential. DiCaprio an McConaughey together could have been a more interesting duo. DiCaprio would have been a solid shoulder and McConaughey could have been achieved a performance to remember.<br/><br/>But the real problem in this movie is the story.<br/><br/>Jordan Belfort story is nothing else that sex, drugs, and steal money cheating investors.

I laughed through whole of the drug/alcohol/prostitute circle that this movie was. Maybe it was a little to long for me. Some scenes were pretty repetitive and could have been deleted to make it thirty minutes shorter. If you want to laugh and entertain yourself it is certainly movie for you. If you liked other stock- oriented films like Wall Street or Boiler Room you certainly won't be disappointed."
"HelenMary","7","2","3","31 January 2014"," brilliantly acted and directed; not for sensitive viewers
","This is a superb film, but it definitely deserves it's 18 rating; it is gratuitous, the language is very ""colourful"" and there is a lot of nudity and drug use-a-plenty. Usually I'd not particularly go for a film like that but it is a biopic and based on the book by Jordan Belfort (played by DiCaprio). It's a man gets super-rich by nefarious means and goes a bit crazy kind of film; women, drugs, big boy-toys and all the trappings of the nouveaux riche, and then his downfall. It's a sort of morality tale, his lifestyle is meant to be seen as depraved and excessive (in a bad way) not admirable and the Director (Scorsese) and the writers make that clear as Belfort (and the other men too) unravels.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Hill were superb; DiCaprio was horribly good and Hill has in one film jumped his way up from a comedian to a serious character actor. It has, however, a good lot of humour as well as stressful points and also scenes in which you are incredulous. For all the nudity and sexual content, it isn't titillating just bawdy and sordid. It still astounds me that men behave in that way - Boiler Room's extended cut had a few similar scenes but not so bad as this. Boiler Room is actually a good comparison for plot although - as I said - Wolf of Wall Street is way more over the top. For all the scenes where you think ""oh goodness I shouldn't be watching this,"" there are plenty where the actors show their grit and the Direction is so superb. It is the sort of film where you almost forget you are watching a film, you are so engrossed and just ""there"" absorbed in the action. I did think it was a bit too long in terms of duration, some of the scenes went on a bit, and certainly the debauchery was too much. Yes it was a (watered down, apparently!) telling of a life story but the viewer doesn't need everything spelled out. Jordan Belfort was played as a horrible man who got his just desserts but that didn't detract from the humour and superior production of this film. I would be very careful who I recommended it to given it's content, certainly NOT those of delicate dispositions or under eighteens. Brilliant film though."
"cinematic_aficionado","7","2","3","30 January 2014"," An insight into the mentality of the finance industry
","Welcome to the world of unadulterated greed and decadence. The premise of this movie, is 'if you are part of a multi-billion dollar industry that produces nothing, why bother with moral values?'<br/><br/>Jordan started from nothing and became a multimillionaire. He defeated the odds, bent the rules and made it big. However, with success he grew even more greedy and nothing was enough. To overcome his urges he needed to binge on drugs and sex in order to cope.<br/><br/>The film is a satire and we observe a man who has it all, yet nothing. Rich yet nothing more than a common junkie. The quest for more and more is never ending and he has to resort to even bigger risks, more law breaking in order to somehow tame his insatiable appetite for more wealth.<br/><br/>The intelligent, witty individual will initially gain our sympathy and liking but soon he is nothing more than a pathetic figure.<br/><br/>This delightful film is ultimately an insight into the world and mind frame of finance and given that it is people like Jordan that caused the crisis the world is currently in, we better take a good look in order to decide how to deal with such attitudes especially when they are so influential."
"richcarter1962","7","2","3","26 January 2014"," I Enjoyed Most of It
","The varied reviews of this movie with rating from 1 to 10, from garbage to Oscare nominee and best of Scorsese, amused me, and I have to say I found some truth in most of them. Is this movie entertaining, definitely YES. Is this movie too long, in my opinion, also yes. A lot of the naysayers say that the movie glorified the excesses of drugs, women, money and just about everything that can be abused. I wouldn't say that it glorifies it but rather that it presents a pretty honest view of how these times in the market were. I loved DiCaprio in this role. He doesn't play a lot of characters that are just completely unlikable and here is no exception, the charisma and charm of Jordan Belfort is played well here, but it also shows the fall that ultimately come from the deceit.<br/><br/>If you ever saw the movie Boiler Room, with Giovanni Ribisi, then you know the basic plot and what Boiler Rooms are. Wolf is tremendously better written, directed and acted, but the general plot is the same.<br/><br/>In the end I enjoyed this movie, though I think 30 minutes or so more editing to get the movie down to a more reasonable 2 1/2 hours, would have helped. I agree that this is Scorsese's best movie in years. I enjoyed this movie and I think you will too, just don't expect a morally uplifting theme here, it's not Frank Capra."
"AvinashRatnani","10","8","21","26 December 2013"," From the genius that brought you Taxi Driver & Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese is back with Leonardo DiCaprio in the most fun you'll have in a theatre this year.
","I'll start off by saying that this movie is hilariously funny throughout the whole film. Leonardo DiCaprio is outstanding in the film, he knows exactly who to portray any character & The Wolf of Wall Street is one of his best performances ever (up there with The Departed & Inception); I really hope he wins an Oscar for his performance, he really deserves it. Jonah Hill also surprised me at how good he can act, his character was very funny as well. Also, Matthew McConaughey & the rest of the cast brought amazing performances to the table. Martin Scorsese at 71 years old, still has plenty of stem left from his golden days, his directing in the picture is top notch with an heavy eye for detail. The script was amazing, very fast witty, smart, funny dialogue and another amazing screenplay from Terence Winter. The film's trailer showed what looked like a Goodfellas on Wall Street & boy did it deliver, the films plot starts to kick in after about the first hour where Jordan & Donnie meet & they start to form they're company Stratton Oakmont, with a lot of partying in the 2nd hour, and the end of Jordan's empire in the last hour. The only thing missing is how empty you feel at the end of the 3 hour epic, wishing you knew more about what happened to Donnie's character or even just a bit more about Jordan or the rest of the characters lives in general. But the film is still very, very great & among my favourites in recent years. With lots of sex, drugs, & fast talking stockbrokers; The Wolf of Wall Street is one of Scorsese's best films & by far it was Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance ever!!!"
"blanche-2","4","10","28","29 March 2014"," disappointing
","I asked IMDb to show male versus female reviewers, and though I can't say I studied it with a magnifying glass, it seemed to me that men in general liked this film and women hated it.<br/><br/>I'm a woman, and I hated it.<br/><br/>Here's why. It's too long. I don't think packing a film full of nudity, sex, and foul language make a film important. Let me say right up front, I don't have a problem with any of it in a film, but to me, this film wasn't much else. And if I can be blunt, Martin Scorsese's presence doesn't make a film important either. He has done some films that are magnificent and some that leave me cold. This leaves me cold.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the finest actors of his generation, and I love him in everything, including in this as Jordan Belfort, a high living stock broker and con artist. He gives a fabulous performance. All the performances are good, and the cast is top notch. It includes Matthew McConaughey, Jonah Hill, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, and Joanna Lumley, to name a few.<br/><br/>I loved a few things in this movie, though it did not hold my interest for three hours. The scenes trying to get the money into Switzerland were priceless, the infomercial was fabulous, the scene in the boat during the bad weather, fantastic. Scorsese builds a lot of humor into this and views the chicanery of these jerks through a lens where they look like buffoons.<br/><br/>This is based on a true story, so Jordan Belfort keeps on making money. He got a million for the film rights and paid back $21,000 to his investors who are owed $200 million. He isn't paying anyone back. But I guess he has the Midas touch, and he can count Scorsese as his latest con."

","When Martin Scorsese makes a film, he makes a film! Nothing could ever go wrong with the products he chooses to come up with. After a long wait, here comes a legendary filmmaker's latest offering with his favorite star cast DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Based on a memoir written by Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street speaks about the rise and fall of an American stockbroker. Although the movie shared similar story craft with The Departed and Goodfellas, what made the movie very interesting was the black comedy genre. As usual, Scorsese's trademark of profanity enhanced dialogues worked big time. Under his direction, the screenplay was faithful to the memoir; cinematography was classic and scenes execution was incredible.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is the one man who breaks his own record each movie he performs. The man surely seemed aged a little, but his performance proved otherwise. He is a director's actor and with that being said, it was very evident that he gave his heart and soul for the success of this venture. And it proved worth it. This deadly combo of director and actor provided massive entertainment to put it short.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is strictly an adult product. The only flaws could be the slow-mo effect that certain scenes had and slightly overdosed nudity enhanced scenes, unlike in previous Scorsese's masterpieces. Nevertheless, if one could successfully render a 3 hour long movie and at the same time engross audiences for the entire duration, that person could only possibly be Martin Scorsese."

Leonardo DiCaprio leads an all out cast in one of, if not, the best performance of his career. Jonah Hill also gives a fantastic performance, as well as Margot Robbie and even smally from Matthew McConaughey. The film is shot with great style and care, and there is no doubt it is one of the best crafted films of the decade. The film is full of humor, heartbreak, and can be at times surprisingly exciting. The film does seem to go on a bit too long for certain scenes, but even with the 3 hour runtime, the film is still able to be massively entertaining. Shining with every frame and taking action every chance it gets. In the end, The Wolf of Wall Street may be a long journey to sit through, but it is far more than worth it.

"juanantoniotobar","10","1","1","13 March 2020"," WOLF OF WALL STREET
","The wolf of wall street is a movie starred by Leonardo DiCaprio. This is a famous and great movie because of all the action and situations that happen along the story. It shows how at a moment the character is in a great moment and in seconds he is passing a really hard time. All the action and scenes in the movie is amazing.<br/><br/>The movie is about Jordan Belfort(Leonardo DiCaprio), a man who is a middle class but who wants to get glory. He starts working on a big Wall Street company but the company goes broke so he has to go to a really small stock market company. In that small company he discovers that selling really bad products and telling the people that the products are great, he will get a really big profit. That's how he begins to win a lot of money and starts his own stock market company and gets really rich. But while all this happens, he lives some situations that makes his goal and life difficult.<br/><br/>All the action that happened in the movie show how Jordan reacted to all his situations, how he could get wild and rage, how he spent and enjoyed all the money he won and also how he was intelligent to do really big things. Also all the action made the movie interesting and made you watch all the details. All the action made me concentrate all the time in the movie, also it showed me how an eccentric and really rich man lived his life and spent his money. Also it showed me how the richs enjoyed their life in the 90s.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite movies because it is really interesting and it tells a really great story, also shows that you need to make the right things or you will lose everything. I recommend it because it has really good actors, action, locations and is a really good and interesting theme."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","18 January 2020"," Best Scorsese-DiCaprio Film To Date
","A downright hilarious, unabashedly entertaining & riotously fun ride that presents both Martin Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio in prime form, The Wolf of Wall Street is a masterly directed, sharply scripted & expertly acted biopic that chronicles the remarkable journey of Jordan Belfort from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption & federal government.<br/><br/>Stylishly directed by Scorsese in what's his 5th collaboration with DiCaprio, this is arguably his best film to date and certainly the most enjoyable of them all. A tale of debauchery that's consistently high on money, parties, sex & drugs, the picture is gripping from the get go and sustains its manic energy & irreverent humour for most of its runtime but what keeps it alive is the auteur's assured craftsmanship.<br/><br/>Further uplifting the viewing experience is the excellent production design, sharp camerawork, neat editing, breakneck pace, fab costumes, dynamic score & stellar performances. Leading from the front is DiCaprio who utilises every bit of his on-screen charisma & acting prowess to deliver his career-best work. Jonah Hill is a revelation too, playing Belfort's sidekick with elan. And they are well supported by the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Overall, The Wolf of Wall Street is an endlessly funny & deliberately unrestrained exercise in excess that promises 3 hours of non-stop extravaganza and finds both the master & his protégé delivering on all fronts. An infectious & intoxicating film that's high & hyper from its opening moments yet continues to snort more white powder every 5 mins, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the finest films of its year, one of the best examples of its kind, and certainly the most memorable one from Scorsese & DiCaprio so far."

Plus points are Margot Robbie - a fabulous performance - and some very funny lines/situations. I am normally left totally cold by depictions of drug experiences, but the scene where Belfort's quaaludes belatedly kick in is hilarious. Belfort being eviscerated by his first wife, then his second (Robbie) also raised a belly laugh, and the fact that the movie honestly addressed his ""rat"" status was refreshing. It actually didn't feel too long to me at almost three hours - but sometimes it does feel like drowning in a vat of Tiramisu. Everything is turned up to 11."

Yeah kind of I guess. I mean it was wickedly funny and the acting really was convincing,Oscar-worthy even. But to say it was overrated is a bit of an understatement. The negatives were that firstly, it dragged and dragged- in fact, it could have been half as long and still achieved everything. Secondly, I felt that it glorified this disgusting, greedy and hedonistic behaviour. I know this sounds really lame, but I like a movie to have a message at the end. But you didn't get that with this one. Finally, I felt that nothing much happened. They had tons of sex. Did tons of drugs.

","An unapologetic celebration of mean-spirited excess and the depths of human greed. It's entertaining as hell, wildly indulgent and more off-the-wall than the craziest Jackass movie, but at the end of the day there really isn't much more to it than that. Leo DiCaprio is effective as the drug-powered, decadent master of ceremonies, even showing us a glimmer of internal conflict behind the hazy fog of those unfocused eyes, but his rare moments of shame are quickly washed away with all manner of intoxicants. The film's purpose is puzzling. Are we to pull for this loathsome figure, the very embodiment of the ugly American 1-percent stereotype? Shall we root for his comeuppance at the hands of the law? Merely observe, jealous but just, as he squanders our relatives' retirement funds on a perpetual hunt for fleeting ecstasy? In any case, we're in for disappointment. After an hour, the novelty of this lewd dash of A-list voyeurism begins to wear thin. At two, it's long overstayed its welcome. Thirty minutes later, it begins to deal with repercussions, but those too are impermanent and flimsy. I'm torn. On the one hand, it's a savory experience, looking over the shoulder of giants as they splurge on a lustful life of luxury. On the other... did we really do more than spin our wheels? A glittery, contemplative experience that misses its shot at excellence, I've decided, and one that really doesn't need to be half as long as it is."

If DiCaprio and Scorsese are not getting the Oscars for The Wolf than this whole Oscar thing is a huge piece of pure cr*p. I don't know if the whole movie is entirely a true story, maybe they exaggerated for a fact, but that doesn't make it any less good. I have never been to a movie at the cinema where the whole audience was laughing that hard. <br/><br/>Bottom line, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best movies i have ever seen, the best performance for Leonardo DiCaprio, best collaboration between Leo and Martin Scorsese, the most hilarious movie i have ever seen and it's worth every minute of its 3 hours."
"joe16vind","8","9","25","24 December 2013"," Better than American Hustle
","Wolf is concerned with one thing and one thing only:excess and at 3 hours it could have been a tighter film if it had clocked in at 2 1/2 hours. At 3, there's a lot of repetitiveness as if Marty thought the audience needed Thor's Hammer to drive the point home. If Hill pushes Rush's exceptional Bruhl or Hustle's heartbreakingly terrific Renner out of a nom, I will be so mad. <br/><br/>This isn't Leo's best performance for me but he was dependably solid. That he wanted to bring Belfort's story to the screen is commendable indeed. He doesn't sugarcoat the man's excesses and for the audience is more of ""Hey people really live these kinds of lives!"" Belfort as Leo portrays him was alternatively defiant, occasionally sympathetic but always boisterous. Wolf can be seen as a complementary piece to American Hustle;just the methods to achieve such differs. <br/><br/>Because Leo and Marty have corroborated many times in the past, their bond/ trust is palpable here. Leo is/was comfortable in doing certain scenes here for Martin that he otherwise would not have done. To put it simply, white collar crime as depicted in Wolf is rendered OK in the sense this is how one man chose to lead his life and his cohorts who merrily went along with it. But Scoreses does show the downside; perhaps not as much as he should have.<br/><br/>For myself, Wolf is highly entertaining and noms are mostly likely for Best Picture/Best Actor/Cinematography/ and perhaps Best Director."
"LeonardoCleto","10","6","15","11 January 2014"," Scorsese and DiCaprio Deliver Again
","First of all, Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio are both movie geniuses. There, I said it.<br/><br/>Scorsese is arguably the best director of this era, and Leonardo DiCaprio one of the most consistent actors of all time. He is always great, and it's a shame he is yet to win an Academy Award.<br/><br/>They've collaborated in four movies before ""The Wolf of Street,"" all great. But ""The Wolf,"" is definitely the best one.<br/><br/>There is not a single boring moment in this 3 hour-long movie; not a single one! The characters drag the viewers in their crazy, drugged world of Wall Street, dropping us in a movie that is at times hilarious, and at others extremely dramatic, much like the recent ""American Hustle.""<br/><br/>The screenplay is terrifically written, and the music amazing. The acting is off the charts, starting with DiCaprio. Jonah Hill is one of my favorite actors, and he does not disappoint; Matthew McConaughey is another bright spot. The rest of the supporting cast delivers as well.<br/><br/>The directing is just superb. The usual Scorsese elements are there, such as narrations and genius shots. Breaking the fourth wall just added to the director's large repertoire of both bold and rewarding moves.<br/><br/>Yes, it is extremely sexual and at a lot of times downright offensive. But in the same way ""Family Guy,"" makes us catch ourselves laughing at what we shouldn't, ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" does the same.<br/><br/>All in all, the film does pretty much what Jordan Belfort did: hooks us, flatters us, and takes us down with it. This is one for the ages.<br/><br/>On a final note, I am certain Leonardo DiCaprio will win the Golden Globe, as he is under the category of ""Comedy or Musical;"" but it would sure be nice -- especially after being snubbed of even a nomination last year for ""Django Unchained"" -- for Leo to take home the Oscar."

","Marty you did it again. First of all I never write reviews but this movie made me do it.<br/><br/>Personally I am big fan of Scorsese's movies. Casino is one of my favorite Scorsese's movies (watch it) and for me it's very similar to The Wolf Of Wall Street. This time narrator is Leo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and it's about money, trickery, good friendship, alcohol, drugs and sex of course. There are points in movie where main character rises to the top and points where he falls down because of his success and stubbornness. I am not going to tell you more I don't want to spoil it.<br/><br/>Story is great. The characters are well displayed. Conversations have never been more dramatic. Great camera shoots. Lots of hot ladies and swearing. Great sound effects and music. Directing at finest. Lots of different locations. Leo was brilliant,(he deserves Oscar) other cast too. The list goes on.<br/><br/>One of the finest movie of 2013. If you like movies go and see it, you gonna love it. 10/10"

","This excellent true story comedy of a wall street hotshot downfall is laugh out loud funny. It's well written, over the top at times about the drugs sex and excess but it's comically so and relevant to the story. The way the dialog is written and the way the scenes played out is fresh and witty. The scene with the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler on the boat is hilarious. So is the drive back from the country club. Doesn't feel draggy even though it's nearly 3 hours long because the story moves along and the characters are sympathetic.<br/><br/>The casting is terrific. Leonardo demonstrates some good comedic delivery without overacting even if the scenes and dialog are a bit exaggerated at times. It's good he isn't playing a more familiar person so you don't have to deal with him not looking much like Howard Hughes or J Edgar Hoover. Jonah Hill has some hilarious moments that he pulls of well like the cousin conservation. Margot Robbie is quite good as the poster second wife. The European supporting cast is perfect - Jean Dujardin as a sleazy Swiss Banker is spot on as is Joanna Lumley as the English aunt. Wonder why Matthew McConaughey is skinny and haggard for this movie as well.<br/><br/>Liked it more than American Hustle. Good to have a comedy about Wall Street crooks to contrast with the more serious Wall Street 2 and the recent documentaries. It doesn't glamorize drugs rather it shows the effects. Good warning about the dangers of penny stocks."

","There is a reason this is called Wolf of Wall Street and not Lion of Wall Street. This is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. And therefor it was important to make this a comedy. When I watched it, I didn't think it would qualify as comedy. Thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in.<br/><br/>The way it starts should indicate if this is something you want to watch. Never forget, as someone else also stated, this is supposed to be entertainment and does not take itself seriously. If you are not on that level with the movie, you will call it names.

"Misterberto","10","4","9","8 May 2014"," The Party's Over
","Jordan Belfort is a dangerous man. The kind of dangerous that allows for simultaneous smooth-talking and first-class hustling. In Martin Scorsese's 22nd feature film, the audience is invited to 180 minutes of uninterrupted lewd extravagance – all told from the perspective of its narrator – Belfort himself.<br/><br/>In The Wolf of Wall Street, we see Scorsese return to familiar styling. Reaching back into the vault, Marty combines the narration dominance of Goodfellas and Casino, with the dark humor of The King of Comedy and After Hours. The melding of these two elements present the perfect foundation for a group of Wall Street brokers hellbent on watching the world burn one mouthful of Quaaludes at a time.<br/><br/>Belfort is typical in how we think about corruption and excess, particularly in the sense of a Wall Street executive. We see Belfort (Leonardo Dicaprio) rise from the ranks of a low-rung smile and dial broker eager to impress his boss and clients, to a master of riches as the leader of his own wolf-pack, starring most-notably Jonah Hill. As the flies on the wall to this never-ending orgy of a life (so they think), we get a taste of the mindset at work here with midget tossing, naked marching bands in the office, and a steady stream of recycled prostitutes. For these purveyors of deceit, this is only the tip of the iceberg in their ocean of absurdity.<br/><br/>It's easy to peg this film as simply another anecdote to the evils of Wall Street, but such a reading would be a mistake to what's going on under the surface. Sure, we have Belfort telling us his first-hand account of a life of debauchery (sex, drugs, manipulation, lying, stealing, cheating, and oh yeah, more sex and drugs). The thing is, we don't need Wall Street to tell that story. Wall Street is the backdrop for something facing us all: how does one deal with temptation? How many of us would love to live in the fast-lane like the movers and shakers of Stratton Oakmont? How many of us would do questionable things to get there? Jordan Belfort is an unreliable narrator (the self-impressed narration where he changes the color of the car). Through this, we're given an honest look into the psyche of always wanting more. In his version of events, no one can deny their temptations. The only course forward for these people is more drug benders and offshore bank accounts. Only more money and partying will quench that insatiable thirst for glut. In Wolf, they're all gaming their clients in the stock market with worthless penny stocks, but they could just as easily be in real estate, banking, insurance etc. It doesn't matter, because we're dealing with a fundamentally human problem.<br/><br/>Belfort is unflinching in telling the world his ineptitude in conscious. The picture painted is one of unflattering negligence, including many moments that make him look pathetic. The list of violence, indulgence, and corruption is almost as long as the list of people left in the wake of his storm. His wife is tossed aside for the eye candy of his future trophy wife (Margot Robbie). He builds an empire through breaking every rule in the book, while peeling the naïve bystanders off the bottom of his 1,000 dollar pair of shoes. He puts others in danger through his overabundance of drug and alcohol use, including driving while having almost no control of his limbs. Belfort eventually hits rock bottom when he punches his wife in the stomach after the threat of his daughter being taken away. He then puts the child in the passenger seat of his car, only to recklessly back it into a post in the driveway. At the end, Belfort cuts a deal with the feds and serves some prison time as a country club prisoner.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what makes this film so special gets back to that floating question: how does one deal with temptation? In The Wolf of Wall Street, no one is actually innocent. Not even the people getting duped on the phone by Belfort himself. To see the real victims is to look in the mirror. The point of this film isn't Wall Street; it's about the negative aspects in which society maneuvers. There's a soul-searching effect to see where we fit on that spectrum, how we come to grips with our own inner cravings. This isn't a case of glorification like so many have pointed out. This is a case of a savvy director putting all the cards on the table. Scorsese is letting us decide how we feel about a society we've helped mold; a society that lends itself to this behavior.<br/><br/>In three hours of laughs, gasps, and head-shaking, we receive a film that doesn't hold our hands by telling us what to think, rather a human story that demands self-inspection. The last images are of a poignant scene in which Belfort is now a motivational speaker at a seminar. As he walks to the front row, he tells a few gentlemen to ""sell me this pen!"" They stumble along with untrained pitches, as the rest of the audience looks on with wide-eyed stares hungry to learn the secrets of the universe. In this moment, the cycle continues. The joke is on us."

","I usually really enjoy Scorsese movies, mainly the classics such as Taxi Driver and Goodfellas. The Wolf of Wall Street was such a disappointment... this was just so boring and praised lack of values. At 1hr and 30min, I was incredibly bored, and annoyed at the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is simply glorifying a decadent and hedonistic lifestyle. The characters are dull, even worst that they are based on a true story. They have no core values or morals, can only think about sex, drugs and money. Money is made by praying on the vulnerability of others, specially working class people. Women are treated as objects, including the wife of the protagonist. (Not to mention the domestic violence she suffers in the end and nearly sexually abused before she actually consents!)<br/><br/>At a time in which worldwide economies, e.g US and Europe, are in shatters. As so many people are being affected and have been affected by this badly managed financial system, this movie is just a take the pis* out of the ordinary citizen, i.e most of the worlds population!<br/><br/>What is really upsetting as well, after doing a bit of reading, is that the Jordan Belfort guy, actually has not paid all he owes to his victims! and is making money out of this money, and is making money out of ""motivational speeches""! What a joke of a human being!"

","I first saw this movie about two months after it was released into theaters. I was very skeptical as I heard from some people where they said it was the 'worst piece of crap' they've seen and some saying it was the 'best movie ever'. So I really did not know what to expect except that both sides could agree that there was a lot of sex and drugs. After seeing the movie, I found that it a very good movie overall. Leonardo DiCaprio is yet again very good and is 20 years overdue for an Oscar. He did a very good job portraying Jordan Belfort, the drug abusing stock broker. I did feel a little uncomfortable with he many sexually explicit sex scenes. I did also feel that the movie was very repetitive. For three hours, we watch Leonardo DiCaprio abuse drugs, have sex and look like a jackass. That is about it. But Scorsese finds a way to make it work and to make it entertaining. I was very entertained by this movie."
"FugitiveAmoeba","8","4","9","10 January 2014"," An obscene, excessive and over-indulgent romp
","If you've seen one Martin Scorsese film, you've seen them all. Perhaps this statement only when applied to Scorsese can be construed as a compliment. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is quintessential Scorsese, overflowing with greed, ambition and excesses.<br/><br/>The heart and soul of the film is Leonardo DiCaprio, adeptly playing the protagonist Jordan Belfort to whom ambition is the air he breathes, no excess excessive enough and playing the game alone is reward enough - at any cost. And at what cost! The film portrays the struggle of a single man to preserve everything he identifies himself with, even when faced by the inevitability of succumbing to the game. The film ends with a hint of poignancy, as if to suggest that the life ordinary is almost not worth it, and to trudge alongside people who ""don't get it"" is punishment enough.<br/><br/>The performance of DiCaprio perhaps can entice the elusive recognition from the Academy Awards, as meaningless as they are, this time around. For it is truly a career-defining performance and he shines bright in a film that's all about his character. Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey deserve a special mention too for their supporting roles, and the film is an obscene, excessive and over-indulgent romp. Just what we've come to expect from a Scorsese film. 8/10"
"TheMovieDiorama","5","3","6","20 September 2019"," The Wolf of Wall Street opulently howls for the insipid apotheosis of money laundering.
","Well, might as well deliver my soul to the slaughter for my apparent blasphemous opinion of this acclaimed ""masterpiece"". Ready? I don't like The Wolf of Wall Street. I don't. I just can't. I've endured this three hour mental exhaustion twice now, and each time it crawls further under my skin. The blatant irritation Scorsese causes me to suffer with, is enough to make me question the validity of this adaptation's existence (more on that later...). For now though, just let my unmistakable opinion settle and ready yourself for battle. Recounting the memoirs of stock-market manipulator Jordan Belfort, we witness the rise and fall of his Wall Street career as his susceptibility to corruption destroys everything and everyone around him.<br/><br/>Well, apparently that is what the film is heavily implying. Yet, for three bloody hours (six if you count the initial watch), I tolerated explicit sexual nature, drugs being sniffed off of breasts and abnormally juicy buttock cheeks and an extreme amount profanity that unsurprisingly set a Guinness World Record. For what? No, seriously. What's Scorsese's purpose here? There's no insight into corruption. No moral implications for Belfort's actions. No substantial development for Belfort's arc. Nothing. Scorsese literally consumed a hundred million dollars for the glorification of a criminal who is now considered a role model for many businessmen.<br/><br/>The absolute reason why this is so beloved, is because of how ""hilarious"" his shenanigans were. Launching midgets onto a scoreboard. Summoning strippers and a marching band to plague his office. Shaving a full head of hair off for cash. Sure, Scorsese's frantic antics accompanied by Schoonmaker's rapid editing kept the buoyancy afloat during these hellish moments. But what's the purpose here? To depict the maddening behaviour of stock brokers obsessed and driven by money? Negatory. Scorsese was too nonchalant about the depiction of fraudulent activity, that it consequently held no groundwork. The foundations were built entirely around excessive dark humour, and essentially collapsed in on itself.<br/><br/>Where I take issue though, is with the development of Belfort himself. A man who slides into the decadent lifestyle of drugs and prostitutes. A wannabe jerk becoming an actual jerk. His character arc, although predictable given any film regarding Wall Street, should've concluded on a note of reflection. The natural realisation of the erroneous behaviour he had demonstrated. Alas, he was forced to change. If he hadn't pleaded guilty, he would still be slapping asses and performing drug angels in mountains of cocaine. That's not development. At all.<br/><br/>What doesn't assist is Winter's inconsistent screenplay. Shifting frequently between actual plot and explicit shenanigans, whilst embedding an array of supporting characters that are deemed useless in the grand scheme of the film. Granted, it was DiCaprio's spotlight, and Scorsese was mindful of that. But the likes of Chandler, Favreau, Lumley and Dujardin were under-utilised. DiCaprio gives a tour de force performance as Belfort. He really does become the man by obnoxiously screaming, erratically laughing and fake tanning his way to awards season. It's an absurd performance that must've destroyed his vocal chords, and really is the only reason why I would endure this again. Hill on the other hand, I despised. Bland as per usual, and DiCaprio chewed him up real good. Robbie was used to spice up the sexuality, not for her acting ability. And McConaughey, who garnered the most memorable scenes, was in and out quicker that saying the words ""alright, alright, alright..."".<br/><br/>I shan't go on anymore. You now know where I stand with this endurance test. Whilst technically a proficient film from an inspiration director and commanded by a captivating central performance, it's entire purpose reeks of self-indulgence and ill-fated devotion. If Belfort asked me to ""sell this pen"", I know exactly where I would stick it..."
"MartinHafer","5","3","6","4 August 2019"," Super crude and nasty....so is it worth watching?

After seeing it, it WAS indeed sleazy, crude and nasty from start to finish and it seemed typical of many of Martin Scorsese's films. And, like his films, it's was well made. But for me, it was relentlessly awful and unappealing. Sure, it was nominated for a bunch of Oscars...but despite this I found myself turned off by such a downbeat and unlikable story.

"andrewnmiller","10","3","6","8 October 2018"," Excess to the extreme.
","My first exposure to The Wolf of Wall Street came when I saw a trailer for the film attached to World War Z and while I certainly thought the movie looked interesting, I wasn't sold on it due to the content I was seeing so I avoided the movie when it first came out and didn't watch it until earlier this year and while I was taken aback by the sheer amount of explicit content in a few scenes, I absolutely loved the movie. From it's solid directing and fast-paced humor to its incredible acting and story, The Wolf of Wall Street is another cinematic home run for Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>The film starts in 1987 where a young man named Jordan Belfort gets a job working as a stockbroker for a stock company called L.F. Rothschild where he is hired to work under Mark Hanna who introduces Jordan to the drug and sex-fueled broker culture and plants the idea in Jordan's head that making money for one's self is a stockbroker's ultimate goal and that enough is never enough. With these words in mind, Belfort goes to work but following Black Monday, his career is terminated and gets a job at a small brokerage firm company. Thanks to his combative pitching style, Jordan begins to profit but soon forms his own investment broker company with a few friends called Stratton Oakmont. After posting an ad, hundreds of young brokers come flocking to Belfort's company. As a result of the business profiting, Jordan and his entourage profit handsomely from it and soon descend into a life of drugs and women with Jordan even cheating on his own wife. Meanwhile, the FBI and the SEC begin investigating Belfort's firm and start to clamp down on the corporation which leads Jordan to try and find a way to keep his firm and his money from collapsing while also dealing with his own personal issues.<br/><br/>Given the unsubtle condemnation of the Wall Street stockbroker approach and lifestyle in Oliver Stone's 1987 movie, Wall Street, it would seem to clarify the basis of The Wolf of Wall Street, a movie that makes all of Oliver Stone's most barbarous neutering of the overindulgence on the stock exchange look like a walk in the park by comparison. Truly, the movie all but instantly endorses this in an early scene where an editorial is advertising a colossal uptick in job applications at Jordan's firm. So, with the need for the movie to go much more larger and colossal in terms of showing the decline of a character like Belfort, the movie shows him literally snorting cocaine out the body of a women and yet by some means continues to go downhill further and further until he is waist-deep in self-indulgence and extravagance. Despite the movie feeling endlessly long and overly bouncy sometimes, it's also a film that is grueling as well as intoxicating to watch and while it may feel less like an organized story and more like an almost three-hour decadence agenda, it still nonetheless carries it's own cinematic weight and gives the viewer a masterpiece of storytelling and character drama not seen since The Godfather. <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is easily one of the greatest directors still working today and The Wolf of Wall Street just keeps on showing us why he is such an incredible director and storyteller with an almost absurd amount of excitement and passion for the art of filmmaking. In a lot of ways, The Wolf of Wall Street feels like something of a follow-up to two of his most beloved and acclaimed movies, Casino and Goodfellas even though the movie takes place in its own universe and Jordan Belfort is a professional convict who does more harm with a pen than a gun in the film. Despite that, all three movies survive as Martin's own disembowelment of the cynicism of the American Dream and much like Goodfellas, The Wolf of Wall Street grants the viewer entry into a symbolically glittering world. Much like the casinos of Las Vegas in Casino or the Irish Mob of Boston in The Departed, Wall Street is depicted as a bona fide playground for those people with no moral high ground. Sex, drugs, and money are all here and are frequently shown on screen, sometimes even in the same scene which can be a bit unsettling for some viewers but is necessary to progress the story and the characters. Much like several of his other movies, Scorsese feels less concerned with the methods Belfort makes his money and more with how money and power can corrupt a person no matter their social background. Early on in the film, some of the characters are having a conversation about tossing short people at targets for their own delight and going through what can or can't be done in terms of entertainment. Selfishness and fraud are depicted here as wide-ranging and irresistible as Jordan's decadence is nothing short of outlandish but it also encompasses every single last inch of his company so much so that there have to be sighs in the bathrooms outlawing lovemaking and even Belfort's butler gets dragged into the cycle of sex, drugs and cash driving home the point that even the most cultured people can become contaminated by power and greed. Of course, the movie is quite honest about it's leading character, Jordan Belfort who may seem like your typical lawbreaker and scam artist but is also an erratic storyteller. The film engages interest to this continuously, most noticeably in the contrast between his interpretation of a drug-hazed drive home and what actually happened along with the ramifications of that drive. In lieu of presenting an accurate and fair depiction of Jordan's behavior, the movie cleverly allows him to give his own account of what is happening onscreen. As such, The Wolf of Wall Street gives Belfort small apologetic moments sprinkled within his flashes of harshness, antipathy, sexism, anger, and cold-bloodiness. Easily one of the best film characters ever to grace the silver screen. <br/><br/>While The Wolf of Wall Street may feel like a heavenly accomplice to some of Scorsese's earlier movies, it's obvious with this movie and later with Silence that Martin has matured greatly as a filmmaker and a storyteller. This movie, however, feels more like a bigger step for Scorsese and company as well as a much more adventurous and unproven with Scorsese continuously pulling the viewer's leg with how phony the movie really is. Masterfully aided by Terrence Winters' wonderful screenplay, Martin crafts a hazy impression of hyper-reality around the movie's events, making it feel like something in a drug-fueled fog. Of course, Scorsese constantly pulls the viewer's attention to the fact that the movie they're watching is, in fact, a movie as the aspect ratio always seems to continuously alter as the film progresses as even the boundaries of the screen change from scene to scene which fits with the story that the film is trying to show us. Marketing also plays a high part in The Wolf of Wall Street such as when Belfort fills the viewer on the facts surrounding a crazy money laundering scam or when the FBI arrest Jordan while he's filming a commercial but the agents don't stop with just apprehending Belfort as they also process to directly interrupt the entire shot-on-camera scene making for easily one of finest apprehension scenes in film history. It's also one of the boldest and divisive storytelling ideas in the movie. Also effective in the story that The Wolf of Wall Street is telling is how Scorsese grants Dicaprio free rein over the movie's plot. At one point, Belfort's voice-over straightens out the movie over the color of his car, giving the viewer an awareness of Jordan's preferences in telling his own story through the narration rather than just explaining what is happening to us as the movie certain enough to let Belfort to show us his story unfolding on the screen rather than just dumping explanation dialog on us like some other movies have a tendency to do. <br/><br/>At its heart, The Wolf of Wall Street is in essence penned as a cavalier endeavor at self-defense by a calculating maniac as he goes through various stages of decadence and self-indulgence as well as having to deal with the government breathing down his neck at every turn. Unlike directors like Paul Feig or Michael Bay who often insult the viewer's intelligence, Martin Scorsese trusts us enough to allow us to use our brains in order to realize that Jordan can't be trusted which might seem like a massive jump for a movie director of Scorsese's caliber but taking into account the movie has generated debates about how it portrays Belfort much like how Pulp Faction has kindled similar disputes, it would seem that Martin has misjudged filmgoers and, yet the movie never once makes any sort of sympathy pea for Jordan or even paste a convenient moralistic accusation over the end credits as it simply isn't essential for what the film is showing us. Any person watching the movie who can't even use their brain to figure out how disgraceful Jordan is, regardless of his efforts to justify his behavior, would have to be very improbable to be convinced by a corny afterthought or a condescending honest condemnation. The film is continuously harsh in its judgment of Jordan, so much so that the FBI agent that is questioning him seems to find Belfort notably repulsive due to there being no justification for his extreme excess as Jordan wasn't born into this lifestyle but rather chose to live it which in turn makes the story all the more complex and compelling. <br/><br/>Given how the film is adapted from the book by the same name, The Wolf of Wall Street gives Jordan the freedom to create his own protection. During a pep talk scene, Belfort discusses to his employees how he gave a struggling single mother money to help her family and while the movie counts on the viewer to consider that this is a self-directed act of generosity as a counteract against his sexist demeanor over the course of the film. Jordan's firmness that he will do anything to ensure his families' safety is counterbalanced by disregard and irresponsibility and his esteem for allegiance is"
"dipeshjangir","10","3","6","3 April 2017"," Loved the uncensored version
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler.

"Kingslaay","Null","3","6","17 March 2017"," Great film and worthy of a few Oscars
","The Wolf of Wall Street takes an interesting look at the life of Wall street broker Jordan Belfort and his rise and fall. The film had and used some its ingredients to make a wildly entertaining film which included exceptional acting, great plot, narration, addictive soundtrack and the rise and fall of the central character in world of Wall street and finance. These elements have been used masterfully by Scorsese in former classics. <br/><br/>Leonardo definitely deserved an Oscar for his performance as he lives the role of a shady Wall Street broker that is corrupted over his tenure as a stockbroker. The first person narrative works brilliantly as we are told Jordan's story. The portrayal of brokers is interesting as cut throat and money grabbing who use on it on all the vices life has to offer. The film excels at showing this lifestyle in excess from hookers, heavy drinking to living in mansions and sailing on yachts. Jonah Hill and the other cast and crew also hit some home runs to make it enjoyable and humorous at times. The achilles heel when it comes to the cast is easily Margot Robbie. While some of the world seems infatuated with her, she was unimpressive and mediocre. She was very annoying and Leonardo had to carry most of their scenes. The film would have benefited from another talented heroine who brought the best out of Leo and could meet his intensity in the scenes. <br/><br/>While this is a great film it also had a few issues that stopped it from being an absolute classic. Scorsese can be creative when he makes his films but in this one it appears his creativity got the better of him and got ahead of itself. So instead of making a carefully coherent film like he has done before it is a film that incorporates unnecessary scenes, dialogue and screen time that distracts from the story. The result is a film that is 3hrs long and scenes that add no value to the plot. Scenes could have easily been reduced in length, the gay orgy scene could have been cut as could the scene with Brad living at his mothers and the list goes on. Cutting these scenes would have made this films great plot richer and less distracting. When I started watching this film I thought this was going be the greatest film Scorsese has ever made but the additional and unneeded scenes changed that. In my humble opinion this is what makes this a great film but not an Iconic film. An entertaining film but not legendary. A strong 8/10 that should have earned a few Oscars."

","Two and a half hours into the film and I was non the wiser on where I was being taken. Character and storyline development was sidestepped for a vulgar expression of the American psyche - overt sexuality, the glorification of the abuser with no reference at all to the abused, excess without meaning.<br/><br/>Many seem to believe that this is the crowning achievement of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio clearly lacks the depth of character that he has shown in many of his previous movies. He seems to have taken a step backwards, yelling, screaming and over-acting at every instance. As for Scorsese, more and more over time I am missing the point of his movies. They are - dull and lack the intelligent treatment of characters that he had in his early films.<br/><br/>There are times when you seriously question why directors going off on major tangents in their careers, and why some wonderful actors continue to follow those directors. It is certainly time for DiCaprio to get out from under the shadow of Scorsese who seems to be slowly losing the plot.<br/><br/>I did not enjoy the film in the slightest."

","I was really excited to go see Wolf of Wall Street, because I absolutely loved Catch Me if You Can. I could not have been more disappointed. Both movies feature Leo DeCaprio playing a real-life criminal genius. In Catch Me if You Can, the clever details of his schemes are explored to the point that you can really identify with him and other characters while learning some history and party tricks. Leonardo's character in Catch Me if You Can was also a genius criminal mastermind in real life, but you'd never know it from the movie in which his flat character does nothing but make interminable uninspiring speeches, get high, and mistreat women. Occasionally you think the movie is about to tell you some interesting details about what sort of trading actually happened, and then Leo's narration stops abruptly with some lame line like ""oh, but you don't want to hear about that, you want to hear about midget tossing."" There is no opportunity to learn any facts from this movie whatsoever. The director's complete disregard for integrity of the true story could not be more clear than in the ""helicopter falling off the boat"" and ""exploding plane"" scenes. Worst of all, there was a real opportunity to expose the horrific treatment of women that occurred in this story, but instead it is glorified. As a 27-year old male, I enjoy beautiful female bodies, but the women in this movie were used as nothing but the butt of the director's jokes. None of their characters had any depth, and the movie did not even come close to passing the Bechdel test. I almost walked out halfway through, and I wish I had."

The ONLY good thing that I can think to say for the film is that it gave a chance (and an income) to LOADS of young men and women but they earned their cash in some very lewd ways! I am amazed that Martin Scorsese made this film! I am amazed that it was nominated for any Oscar let alone won other awards! I am amazed that Leonardo DiCaprio (and even more Joanna Lumley) took the part(s)! In fact this film just amazed me in all regards, and NOT in a good way! There was a lot of full frontal nudity - note only the girls; a lot of drug taking – in fact I am amazed that they all survived – which is not a good thing to show our young people! There was a lot of sexual acts, bi and homo, lots of bribery and corruption and there was a lot of lying (on the phone) and directly; the main character was, they (in fact them all) were GOT in the end which I suppose was the best but shortest part of the film but 'good' DID NOT triumph – the film ends with the main character surviving prison! I know that this is based on a book and that is possibly not too close to reality BUT if it is anywhere near to the truth then I feel for all the normal people who suffered at the hands of these guys and lost money; in a smaller way I feel for those who suffered sexual assault as I guess many of them did under the influence of the drugs – I have no sympathy for those who suffered from the drugs – buyer beware and hopefully many of these people DIED as a result!"
"thinker1691","9","3","6","29 March 2014"," "" There is no prestige in being Poor ""
","The greatness of a memorable film emerges from an exceptional Director like Martin Scorsese. This film entitled "" The Wolf of Wall Street "" was written by Jordon Belfort who's malicious deceptive practices eventually earn him a stint in Federal Prison. Taken from the excessive exploits of Jordon Belfort himself, it tells the story of a unemployed Wall Street executive who was abruptly lay-ed off but despite his fall, landed on his feet. Despite falling, he arose quickly to create a new financial institution which not only netted him millions, but created a whole new way to acquire further riches. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, an enterprising salesman with a golden gift of gab. Inspired by Matthew McConaughey and his own convincing talent, Belfort take a converted Garage, added an exceptional sales crew, transform them into a sea of voracious financial sharks like Rob Reiner. Belfort then creates a lucrative financial institution which nets them untold millions. Achieving his ultimate success, he continues onward and upwards attracting the attention of Wall Street itself and of course agent Patrick Denham of The F.B.I. In addition, Belfort also seeks out and weds the love of his life Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) who brings romantic security and domestic headaches as well.The movie is fast paced, money, drug and sex oriented along with the life style of the rich and famous. DiCaprio is in his element in this movie as are the talented actors of Scorseses' cast, who showcase what can happen when unbridled greed meets unrestricted wealth. This film will rank as a Classic in time and will become a milestone for Scorsese and Decaprio. Recommended, but with definite warning to one and all. ****"

I knew what this movie was about, corporate stoke broker who have lavish parties, lots of sex and involved in drugs. The trailer made it looked liked there would have good comedy and some nudity. The trailer showed every funny part and the only parts with no nudity. It was really shocking. Why so much female nudity. I didn't laugh once. I left feeling like the movie was some guys wet dream and wrote a movie about it, instead of a real life Wall Street documentary. I understand that this happened, but the movie had to make sure you seen all the female nudity to get the point across? Leo might wanted to get away from the romantic young man from Titanic and did so by the ""Miley Cyrus"" route. Will not watch him again.

At 3 hours, the movie could have been cut to a 2 hour movie, and I believe it would have been a much more enjoyable movie.

","Scorsese has made some of the all time great American films and many are my favorite films of all time . The Wolf Of Wall Street has many similarities to his 90's masterpiece films Goodfellas & Casino with much action and fast paced storytelling. Also he has borrowed some black humor from his 80's offbeat films The King of Comedy & After Hours. <br/><br/>It's a magnificent performance by Leonardo Di Caprio but it's his Jordan Belfort character I don't like at all. I have adored other Scorsese male leads roles such as Henry Hill (Goodfellas ) , Ace Rothstein ( Casino) , Travis Bickle ( Taxi Driver) in controversial and violent movies they all are portrayed with an element of coolness and all you also have some compassion for.<br/><br/>Belfort is really a smart arse cocky guy you can't stand and I have trouble liking . <br/><br/>The Wolf Of Wall Street also lacks class and at times thought I was at a friends Bucks Party getting cheap thrills. I understand the direction is deliberately over the top for this over hyped character. There will be young film goers that will see this film thinking it's the baddest film of all time.

"Balthazar-5","5","3","6","3 February 2014"," Meaningless catalogue of grotesques
","I have seen thousands of films in my life, but I cannot remember one in which every single character was a disgusting example of the worst elements of humanity. At last I have found one. Is this the 'truth' about Wall Street? I have no idea, but it corresponds almost exactly with my own beliefs. So I should like it? Right? It panders to my prejudices. It tells 'the truth'.<br/><br/>Oh, no. That is not what makes for great cinema. Great cinema surprises you, it opens new vistas, it invites one to question things that had been assumed.<br/><br/>All of Scorsese's films - even since 'The Big Shave' - have featured characters who exhibit aspects of masochism, or self-destruction. In 'The Wolf of Wall Street' it is moral masochism writ large that is on display. That is not necessarily a problem, but this is a film without a moral compass. If it could be reasonably described as a 'cautionary tale', it might have some merit. But it isn't, because the film is seen through the eyes of a human cockroach.<br/><br/>Scorsese knows the cinema well. He knows that the audience will identify with, and try to rationalise the actions of, the character who is on- screen for the most of the time. Thus it has been since the cinema began. And, without a shadow of a doubt, an enormous number of people whose own personal avarice is well advanced, will see the film and rationalise it as a series of errors of judgement by the eponymous Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>Of course, there are some positives - the visual catch-line to Jordan's miraculously fortunate drive while stoned with his drugs raises a laugh, and certain ironies emerge in the final quarter of the film, but it is Jordan's story and it is clear that he thinks he was justified and just made mistakes (viz the final scene).<br/><br/>If it were possible to get all of the right-wing finance ministers from around the world and lock them in a cinema that showed this non-stop for a few weeks, it might just change their mind about the thrust of economic policy that encourages unbridled avarice, but that is a vain hope.<br/><br/>In the end we see Jordan all set to make the same mistakes in another territory. He evidently hadn't learnt a thing. And what is a thousand times worse is that he had evidently benefited financially from the film - it being based on his own book.<br/><br/>People who know me and my philosophical approach to cinema will probably find this review strange. In general, I detest the idea of judging the moral stance of a film. But this film doesn't, it seems to me, take a moral stance in a story that concerns itself with a subject that most blights the lives of the majority of our species - inequality, and one man's efforts to increase it. And it doesn't provide us with psychological or cinematic insight into its subject either... the film is inhabited by a bunch of grotesques that are barely human in their blind avarice.<br/><br/>Avarice is the most evil of the seven deadly sins, because it leads to all of the others. This is not something which emerges from either this film's form or content."

","Martin Scorsese matching again with Leonardo Dicaprio to display a biography filled with elements like romance, suspense and some funny scenes surrounded with an excessive environment with greed as the main character. As usual, with Scorsese's movies the photography is well-done capturing the essence of the locations without mention the chemistry between the cast. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, if I review this according to the script, I've just found one fault, with the time on the screen there were plenty important facts omitted, like the sudden change of Mr. Jordan after the Italian rescue or Donnie's dealing process after the senior head of the company decides to abandon the business.<br/><br/>Finally, I found a deja-vu with the yacht scene under the storm, I don't know if it was meant like a joke but it utterly reminded me of Titanic."

","A TMG rating of 6.0 is being generous with an emphasis on this movie could have, and should have, been a whole lot better. How? Listen to an editor and cut about 1.3 hours of pure crap and meaningless scenes from the film. Tossing a pile of hundred dollar bills on top of naked women is funny and outrageous once, but unless you are the guy getting to do it, it is one and done. After twenty scenes of butt, booze and debauchery on film, you pretty much start thinking of just a good beer, a brat and reading the Wall Street Journal.<br/><br/>This film was Wall Street (1987) on Geckko steroids and quaaludes. It was less about the corruption or inner workings of Wall Street and much more just about unbridled Hedonism. It was a more The Hangover Part III (2013) outtakes meets Catch me if You Can (2002). Basically, it was a cheap film with bad writing, marginal acting with lots of cash, drugs and T & A---not meaning tax and accounting.<br/><br/>The only real bright spot was the always fun and ingenious acting of Matthew McConaughey. His role was priceless, but all too short.<br/><br/>This mostly misguided attempt to make an epic was as badly executed as DiCaprio and Scorsese's effort in Gangs of New York (2002)---a film that made my pet squirrel fall asleep on a pile of acorns. If you have not seen this film yet, skip it. Go home. Have a quaalude yourself. Pull out a Penthouse magazine and throw some dollar bills in the air. You will pretty much get the same experience. And if not overly obvious, don't take your kids or Mom to this one."
"PacificHeights","Null","3","6","4 January 2014"," Excess Is A Good Thing in The Wold of Wall Street
","Martin Scorsese's latest epic, The Wolf of Wall Street, delivers in true Scorsese style. The Wolf of Wall Street tells the real life story of Jordan Belfort, Wall Street achiever who cheated his investors to gain incalculable riches for himself. The movie is lush, large, high-energy, aggressive, and highly entertaining.<br/><br/>Scorsese is still at the top of his game. Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a stockbroker who is rising quickly at his first Wall Street position. He is intelligent, ambitious, and motivated. His manager, Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), gives Jordan some advise that he takes to heart. Always remember: you work for yourself, not your clients. And, always persuade your clients to reinvest their earnings. There are no commissions to be made if your client withdraws his earnings. Unfortunately, Mark Hanna's company takes a dive and goes out- of-business after the October, 1987, crash.<br/><br/>Jordan is forced to find another Wall Street position. This time he lands at a small, ""churn mill"" where the salesmen con their clients into buying penny stocks. The clients are persuaded by the manipulative salesmen that, through the advise of their brokers, the clients will become rich. Things get bigger and grander. There is more of everything. More money, more sex, more hookers, more drugs. ??Jordan's partner in crime in Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). Donnie's character provides frequent, hilarious, comic relief in this whirlwind tale.<br/><br/>Scorsese brings us money, money, and more money. Hookers, sex, orgies, drugs, success, excess. This movie is frantic and in-your-face. It never lets up. Jordan Belfort conducts spell-binding motivational speeches that put Billy Graham and Dale Carnegie to shame. Kyle Denham plays the role of FBI Agent Patrick Azoff. He and Jordan are good assessors of human nature and quick to discover the motivations behind the men they meet. This provides exciting opportunities to watch the two men size each other up, get into each other's head, and have fun doing it. The scene with Agent Azoff on Jordan's yacht is one of the films many highlights. The contrast between Jordan's ""rules are made to be broken"" attitude and Kyle's dedication to playing by the rules could not be greater. ??In The Wolf of Wall Street, Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance to date as Jordan Belford. Jonah Hill's timing, as well as his comedic expertise, make him perfect as sidekick Donny Azoff. Kyle Denham delivers a first-rate performance as nemesis, tenacious, obsessed, FBI Agent Patrick Denham. And Margot Robbie turns in a convincing performance as social climbing, volatile, disloyal, second wife, Naomi.tr??The critics have given mixed reviews for The Wolf of Wall Street. I find this puzzling because it is an excellent film directed by one of America's most talented directors. The script is solid, the actors first-rate, and it has a masterful director, Martin Scorcese. The criticism has been odd. Too much sex, too many drugs, not enough punishment and redemption for Jordan. Forget all of that. This is an over-the-top movie, about a larger- than-life character, with big dreams and high hopes. He lived life fully, unapologetically, and excessively. This is The Wolf of Wall Street."

Long movies tend to get dull at parts, but this three hour journey through the eyes of a self-indulgent egomaniac captures the audience's attention and intrigue for the full one hundred eighty minutes. Some scenes might be excessive and go on for too long, but they do not lower the greatness of the film and only contribute to character development. Speaking of which, the characters are what make this movie. Every actor is appropriately charismatic and exactly on point with their performance.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio transforms into the self-loathing stock broker Jordan Belfort, as this is arguably his best performance. If there is any time Leo should win the Oscar for Best Actor, that time is now. I honestly will be shocked if he doesn't get it. The rest respectively give top notch performances. Jonah Hill is just flat out the most entertaining person to watch in the film. His chemistry with DiCaprio gives the film a legitimate comedic dimension to the captivating story. Margot Robbie shines in her breakout performance as Belfort's trophy wife. And although he was in the movie for a limited amount of time, Matthew McConaughey's Mark Hanna was my favorite performance hands down. His character is what influenced Belfort's ambitions and his overall demeanor. <br/><br/>In short, you will not have the desire to go see any other film in theatres right now after you see this masterpiece by Scorcese.

","In Wolf of Wall Street Scorsese has made a masterfully engaging and entertaining film (we laugh at its characters, not with them); it's also moving in surprising ways. It delivers the blaring wake-up call a drunk hears when cops stop his loopy drive down Sunset Boulevard.  Is it great? Seems so to me. It certainly is terrific. <br/><br/>Wolf is about excess - the real excess of the real world of Wall Street high finance and of the perverse American dream its siren call draws us to.  Those who walk away offended (ask who isn't) should direct their anger at ""the masters of the universe"" ... the real people the movie portrays  along with the people we see in the mirror each morning as we prepare to march along feeding the dream.   Do we condemn Bosch for painting his nightmares because they lure us into the pits of hell? <br/><br/>Denying Wall Street's reality is like believing that steroids didn't propel baseball's batting surge -- and all the complicit claims of ignorance up to the top of MLB's food chain. Filming Wolf from a moral high ground to judge its characters would be a comparable denial; it would surrender to the culture of High Finance by buying into the fantasy that we need a big daddy to wag fingers at the perps and change the bad boys' minds.  <br/><br/>Wolf simply announces: this is the real Wall Street -- if you want change, be that change ... yourself. <br/><br/>DiCaprio is powerful and  persuasive; McConaughey haunts the movie throughout in a tiny role; Hill is excellent, and Margot Robbie is perfect."

We both discussed the film later but she said that she did not have the stomach to see it again because although she was far beyond being naive enough to disbelieve what was on the screen, she was not prepared to watch the bottom-hugging activities of the film. I too was not surprised by anything that I saw on the screen however, I just wanted to see the parts that I probably missed the first time; although the film is about three hours long, it moves so quickly that it would easy, at least for me, to miss not only the dialogue but some of the visuals.<br/><br/>I have nothing but praise for the acting, the script, the direction and the set direction; I saw nothing in the film to criticise. The enormity of the evil played before our eyes was nothing less than staggering. It would be easy to say that the film exaggerated the events but the limited amount of time I have spent socializing with business people leads me to believe that the events in the film could easily happen given the people making the decisions.<br/><br/>The old saying, business is business and nothing personal meant can be blown up into the visuals on the screen. Once a person believes that screwing another person is just how business is conducted then it takes little imagination to see how that mental palate can be adjusted to the extent that virtually anything can be allowed.

He spluttered all 'Old Liberal' into his green tea as he let rip in his Guardian review that this was essentially overlong, vacuous sensationalism. <br/><br/>I couldn't agree less. It's an absolute blast from frame #1 to frame #4,475. <br/><br/>Clocking in at 179 minutes you might expect this to be turgid and variably paced, but ace veteran editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, makes sure it keeps cracking along. <br/><br/>It's Scarface meets the Goodfellas in an extended Bacchanalian orgy of sex and drug-taking that Joanna Lumley must have mischievously approved of, given her amusing cameo role.<br/><br/>Has DiCaprio ever been better? <br/><br/>Well, he was very good in The Departed, Revolutionary Road and The Aviator but this is surely his greatest (fourth time Oscar nominated) role in which he dominates the screen with a highly enjoyable supporting performance by Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>The tale is about a stockbroker, DiCaprio as real life trader Jordan Belford, who begins his career on the day of the 80's Wall Street Crash and earns his nickname, and the movie's title, soon after in a Forbes Magazine article when the journalist profiling him names him such for his outrageous duping of America's working classes (""Postmen, why are they always postmen.?"") selling them worthless penny shares on the promise of unimaginable wealth.<br/><br/>Far from exposing him, as the journalist hoped, it opens a floodgate of demand, not just from investors but from wannabe stockbrokers too.<br/><br/>The movie is electrifyingly shot and edited.

All of it female and most of it full frontal, including that of DiCaprio's Trophy second-wife, New Yorker Naomi , bravely played by long time ""Neighbours"" cast member Margot Robbie who really couldn't have made much more of a career leap. She's great.<br/><br/>At 71 Scorsese has never had more fun. <br/><br/>And the movie, throwaway as it is in many respects - it has no 'message as such 'other than 'this is bad' - takes its place near the top of his 'best of' CV, alongside the Departed, Cape Fear, Goodfellas, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Not because it has the sheer weight of these incredible movies but because it is made by a master in total control of his work. <br/><br/>He ekes out a horrible, unsympathetic but spellbinding performance from one of Hollywood's most starry actors. This is something for DiCaprio to be proud of. Indeed, he may yet pick up his first best actor award at the Koodak Cinema in March (but, of course, there's Christian Bale and Mtthew McConnachie to contend with).<br/><br/>Sadly, I think Scorsese will have to settle for an outrageous ninth losing nomination as best director as he graciously applauds a fellow director (this time Steve McQueen) the same night. That's as maybe. Put your PC sensitivities to one side for 179 minutes and just enjoy the ride. <br/><br/>It's an absolute blast."

"Srujana","9","4","10","8 January 2014"," Marty and Leo's combination is awesome as always!
","Martin Scorsese has delivered another masterpiece! Another beauty added to his collection. He did it with the movies like Goodfellas and The Aviator(Both being biographies); And, he has done it again with the biography of Jordan Belfort! Absolute beauty! No one can ever direct a movie based on true stories like this genius. Though the movie is nearly 3 hours(2 hours 57 mins to be precise), there's not a single moment where you will feel the story is going out of context or boring. Another highlight is the comedy. It is brilliantly taken care. And, he could have taken care of drug abuse of couple of characters which looks very unnatural and unrealistic; not even a super human can handle such high dosage of substance and survive(This is the only flaw in the story-line apart from the regular goofs). Now, coming to Leonardo DiCaprio's acting. Sheer perfection! He has delivered another Oscar Winning performance. I still wonder why haven't they given him an Oscar!(Hope he gets it for this one) He fits perfectly to the titular character. Amazing performance by Leo right from the very first scene till the end of the movie. Jonah Hill really surprised me with his performance. He has done justice to his role. Another important aspect of the movie is the music. Selection of songs for few scenes is simply superb and the background score as well. Movie is full of awesome one-liners and great speeches. This movie is not about gangsters or the mafia but more about the pursuit of success, money and how it all goes wrong when you're living the American dream. And, one cannot simply escape from the American judiciary system :p"

"Goodfellasz","10","5","14","19 January 2014"," goodfellas meets Casino
","Let's start by saying that this movie isn't for everyone. Like usual in Scorsese's movies, this film is also filled with explicit scenes, explicit language and explicit everything, however the tremendous difference between this movie and most other explicit movies is that the wolf of wall street is not just a movie, but a piece of art.<br/><br/>Starting with the first scene I had an instant flashback to Casino, in which Scorsese also used the unique narrator-technique throughout the movie. Ironically Casino also had a hard time when it first came out in theaters, because just like TWOWS people were shocked by the explicit language and the amount of violence used in the movie. And yet nowadays Casino is seen a one of the greatest movies in the oeuvre of Scorsese. And I think this is also a bit the problem with this movie. Most people are surprised by how the movie is filmed and by the many nude scenes because of the fact that most people expect to see a biographical crime drama. But just like many of Scorsese's films this movie is a mere reflection of today's society and moreover it is a direct attack to the how Wall Street abused the people and money they had and how this lead to the many crisis the world is face with today. And this is were the protagonist of The Wolf of Wall Street meets the characters from Goodfellas and Casino. Like them Dicaprio's character doesn't want to be saved, he doesn't want to be a good guy. In fact he even chooses to remain bad when he is offered a deal to avoid jail time. And that is were TWOWS encounters Henry Hill (from Goodfellas. Hill also didn't want to be a hero, he wanted to be a wise guy, but in the end he had to cooperate with the FBI, just like in this movie. And this is why I believe this movie is without doubt a Goodfellas-Casino mix without any of the weaker point these movies had.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is definitely Oscar-material. Like usual it starts with the cutting and editing. Only one director in Hollywood has been so obsessed with the editing of his movies. Like Raging Bull The wolf of wall street has a number of scenes were the editing is just phenomenal. Also the soundtrack is once again perfectly chosen, Scorsese knows where to put certain songs and places for instance the happy song ça plaine pour moi in the dramatic rescue scene. And this is only one of the many examples. And then there is the acting, Leonardo Dicaprio performs at his best. This movie is once again an example of just how big an actor he is. But it must be said he is accompanied by none other than Jonah Hill, which was I must say an extremely dangerous choice as Jonah is not the star actor Leonardo is. Nonetheless Hill gives here a performance that will literally blow you away. And last but not least there is the directing. It is funny how even now no one asks himself is the new Scorsese good are bad? Instead you just ask yourself how good is he, because well, he doesn't make bad movies.<br/><br/>In conclusion it can be said that this movie is without doubt not for everyone, but it cannot be argued that this movie will without doubt be one of the greatest movies released in 2014."

","There is probably no other movie you could find that better captures decadence in the world of the extremely wealthy quite like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". A film that might not stand among the ranks of ""Goodfellas"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Departed"" or even ""Gangs of New York"" as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, but stands among the very best of 2013. Its a mess, but what an exhilarating mess it is. <br/><br/>A 3-hour epic of gluttonous drug-use and explicit sex as documented by a truly repulsive human being. The fact is, this is how the workplace functioned back in the early 90's. The fact is, Jordan Belfort consumed more Quaaludes to make Hunter S. Thompson blush and engaged in enough ravenous sexual escapades to make Caligula faint. It seems almost unbelievable to assume that these events actually occurred, but to some degree, they did. If that is the case, then Scorsese truly crafted a masterful biopic. <br/><br/>DiCaprio embodies Jordan Belfort perfectly. He soars far beyond any performance in film this year. Jonah Hill is also mesmerizing as Jordan's partner in crime, Donnie Azoff, who is a certified pig. Matthew McConaughey especially steals the show as Mark Hanna, a meticulous master of the stocks, with a strange habit of beating his chest to something similar to an Indian tribal chant. The female love interest Naomi, played by Margot Robbie, plays it sexy and cunning as a really charming tramp who mothers Belfort's child. <br/><br/>The rest plays out as you would expect. Its a long, dizzying journey of T and A with copious amounts of cocaine sprinkled on top. But its a journey that is worth taking. Bravo to Scorsese, DiCaprio and everyone involved in the creation of this masterpiece."

"trublu215","7","5","14","30 December 2013"," Goodfellas meets Wall Street, its one helluva ride.
","To say The Wolf of Wall Street isn't the best Scorsese film would be accurate, it doesn't even crack the man's top five films. But, with that being said, Scorsese is THAT good that saying this isn't his best film just means it is the best of the year and not of the decade. This film is insightful, poignant, and downright hysterical from start to finish. It leans more towards Scorsese's comedy genre, much in the vein of After Hours with a little smidgen of Goodfellas and Casino added to intensify the film high you get when you watch this. The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring film with energy to spare and performance to marvel at. Martin Scorsese directs yet another unforgettable performance from DiCaprio and gives Jonah Hill a high point in his career. Between all the Quaalude, cocaine, and hookers, there is a Greek tragedy playing out before our eyes. Belfort goes from being the top broker/criminal at his firm to being a drug fueled, yuppie with high minded ambitions that always seem to have a funny and hysterical way of falling through. The film is a chronicle of his rise and fall and clocking in at 3 hours, you barely feel it. The film is so energetic in telling this story that it is hard to look the other way even when we are exposed to characters smoking crack, popping Quaalude like Skittles and snorting more cocaine than Tony Montana along with banging every hooker north of Manhattan. This film is pure entertainment and worth seeing in the theater. Go and see this film, you won't be disappointed."
"Rebel_With_A_Cause_94","10","5","14","27 December 2013"," Another Masterpiece From Scorsese
","Martin Scorsese has once again brought us another masterpiece with one of the most fun and entertaining viewing experiences I've ever had! An outrageous 3 hour drug and sex filled and darkly hilarious romp featuring the best performances I've seen all year.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio is one of my favorite actors and even knowing his talent, I was still shocked just by how fantastic he was as Jordan Belfort. Despite being a huge fan, I almost couldn't believe I was watching the same Di Cpario I'd been seeing for years as he carried the film with such charisma and energy! It's by far the performance of the career and it he should more than deservingly receive an Academy Award for Best Actor (although he will probably be snubbed). Leo is not the only one fantastic here, Jonah Hill also gives the performance of his career here as well and Matthew McConaughey also shines in the brief amount of the film he appears in.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese who has directed some of the best films ever made brings his magic touch in telling this bizarre true story. Despite being 71 years old, he still knows how to have fun telling this story bring a wonderful visual style and fast pace at which the films 3 hour runtime fly's by. But it's not only Scorsese's directing that makes the film work so well, Terence Winter's writing just as equally plays a role in the films brilliance as well with his script filled with dark humor and excellent dialogue that will be quoted in years to come. On top of that, the two hold no bars on exploring Belfort's wild lifestyle refusing to shy away from the excessive amount of drugs and sex involved. This is one of the most graphic mainstream films I have seen in quite some time. But it's pervasiveness only favors the film making it all the more fun and entertaining.<br/><br/>Even though it's long length, graphic content, and dark humor will turn some off, The Wolf of Wall Street ranks up as the best film I've seen all year and one of Scorsese's best!"
"prameetkumar","9","8","27","19 December 2013"," Despite indulgences in morality and filmmaking, one of the best movies of the year.
","Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" adapts the autobiography of Jordan Belfort, a high-rolling stockbroker selling penny stocks and committing securities fraud. It's an excellent movie, but I imagine most conversations about it will undoubtedly center around two things -- its length (clocking in at about three hours) and its obscenely gratuitous displays of moral depravity (much of the three hours revolves around sex and drugs).<br/><br/>Fresh from his portrayal of Jay Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby,"" Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Belfort, a very similar character in many respects. Both are self-made playboy millionaires engaging in shady business dealings, living on Long Island's Gold Coast, and throwing wildly extravagant parties. But Belfort can perhaps best be described as Gatsby taken to the extreme of hedonism -- with a penchant for hookers and blow, battling an addiction to Quaaludes. DiCaprio gives a ferocious performance as the figurative wolf on Wall Street (the savagery of his speeches to his employees and the intensity of his drug-addled rampages both border on having almost animalistic fury), and odds are high that this is the role that will finally earn him his Academy Award for Best Actor.<br/><br/>While Belfort allows himself indulgence upon indulgence with his lifestyle, so too does Scorsese with his filmmaking. There are countless scenes of sex-crazed stock brokers, cocaine-fueled orgies, and naked blonde bombshells. The novelty of the debauchery wears off quickly, and it veers toward becoming boring and repetitive over the course of the three hours. Despite the film featuring so many orgasms, there is no climax to its narrative arc. There is no moral or psychological growth in Belfort's character. Don't expect repentance; there's just more and more degeneracy.<br/><br/>But these concerns don't get in the way of how entertaining the movie is from start to finish. The black humor of screenwriter Terence Winter's script adds constant hilarity to even the most morbid situations and helps with the pacing of the film. Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie give stellar supporting performances as Belfort's business partner and wife, respectively.<br/><br/>""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is easily one of Scorsese's most ambitious films, one of DiCaprio's most memorable roles, and one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>9/10 stars."

","This marks the fifth time Scorsese and DiCaprio have worked together, and this time we focus on real life man Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), who wrote his biography on his time on Wall-Street, and how he conned many people out of millions and millions of dollars through his illegal operation and tactics. <br/><br/>We follow a young early 20 something New York kid from a middle class family who hits Wall-Street and immediately falls in love with everything involved in the stock broker business. His boss (Matthew McConaughey, amazing), tells a young Belfort the two keys to be successful in the business over a hilarious high-end lunch in the skies of New York. Those keys to success are copious amounts of drugs and tons of sex.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Wall Street life comes to a halt for everyone on Black Monday, which was a giant stock market crash in the 80s and the firm that Belfort was at, closed down, leaving him out of a job. But hell bent on making money and devising a life style fit for a Roman God, Belfort opens up a stock broker firm with a good name called Stratton Oakmont in Long Island inside an abandoned car garage, where he enlists some shady friends who seem to only deal drugs and turns them into cold-calling salesmen with suits and ties. Among these men is Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), a person who Belfort met by chance. Donnie is Belfort's right hand man and close friend through these few years.<br/><br/>Belfort's goal was to get super wealthy people to purchase penny stocks, meaning these wealthy people would give Jordan and his company thousands and millions of dollars for a company that was either non-existent or was being run out of someone's home, and had no chance of making any money. Meanwhile, Belfort and his employees reaped the benefits. Along with that, they fixed market prices, forged documents, and lied, cheated, and stole from their clients. But that's just the surface of the film.<br/><br/>The real meat and potatoes of the movie are watching Belfort and Donnie tailspin out of control and hit rock bottom. From a two million dollar bachelor party for Belfort for his second marriage to Naomi (Margot Robbie, beautiful and great here), to mansions, yachts, a helicopter, and enough drugs to satisfy an entire small country, life is not slow, nor modest here.<br/><br/>And what Scorsese does here, is make this entire situation laugh out loud funny, even doing a parody of a drug induced sequence that might be one of the best drug related scenes I've seen in cinema history, where we have DiCaprio take a bunch of long lost Quaaludes to which he narrates that he skips directly ""to the cerebral palsy' phase, and has to crawl out of a country club and drive his Lamborghini home, only to have a near death experience while watching Popeye eat his spinach. It's one of the best scenes in a movie in a long time, and DiCaprio is just magnificent here as he uses his body to fumble around in a drug-fueled state.<br/><br/>From all the criminal activity that the real Belfort did, he only got a two year or so sentence in a country club resort prison where he was roommates with Tommy Chong from Cheech n' Chong, and now he is a motivational speaker, and I'm willing to bet his fee to speak will skyrocket after this month ends. Scorsese and DiCaprio show us just how brutal it was for Belfort to make his decisions to take on the FBI and eventually rat out many of his partners in turn for his shortened sentence.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill is simply amazing here. With his fake giant teeth and hilarious dialogue, you can't help but like yet hate his character. This is truly Hill's best role to date, as he has a lot of room to go crazy here. Margot Robbie plays Belfort's wife with a certain class and crass,a s we clearly see she is beautiful, but also loves the lifestyle, but is quick to move on if the money runs out. McConaughey is brilliant too, but is only on screen for a few minutes, but for those few minutes, we are in the palm of his hand. And playing Belfort's dad is Rob Reiner, who turns in a hilarious performance as a dad who has an opinion on everything, even though he and DiCaprio look nothing alike.<br/><br/>And then there is DiCaprio. I've never seen him let loose the way he does here. Well maybe for a few seconds on screen in one of his earlier movies, but the amount of physical comedy, and the use of his body here is over-the-top, and grand in all the right ways. If DiCaprio doesn't win an Oscar, then something is wrong with the entertainment business. His long monologues on pepping up his team of 1000 employees are riveting, and he delivers each line with a surge of chaos and was always one step ahead of everyone.<br/><br/>Scorsese uses some elements from 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas' here as far as certain shots go, as well as the whole narration aspect is concerned. Throughout, DiCaprio/Belfort is telling us this story, and we are forever charmed by his presence, even though he is doing something very wrong. After all the violence, drugs, intense sex scenes, and criminal activity, Scorsese wanted us to see the rise and fall of a young man who was an addict to money and drugs, and eventually got off very light, considering his crimes.<br/><br/>Basically, Scorsese made another gangster movie, but instead of the mob guys, we have super rich white guys in $3000 dollar suits, working on Wall-Street. And it works perfectly here. This is the best film of the year and I can't wait to see it again and again."

But if you come in preparing your eyes for total and utter craziness, it's not so bad. <br/><br/>Beyond all the constant drugs and sex, is a complex main character (Jordan Belford played by Leo) with as many flaws as talents. In the end, it was his innate ability to motivate and sell that brought him to the top, but his demons that brought him down. Isn't this true for anyone? We all have our talents, but we all have our struggles. And no matter how much money and power you have, you can be brought down by your weaknesses. In Belford's case, it was drug-abuse and confused moral compass that ultimately crumbled his empire. <br/><br/>From what I understand, much of what happened in The Wolf of Wall Street stays true to his memoir of the same title. However, it can be debated how much of the details in the memoir actually happened considering how much he was under the influence of powerful drugs during his ""peak"" years. What cannot be debated is the millions and millions of dollars he and his company, Stratton and Oakmont, swindled form the pockets of naive investors.

Sound familiar?? <br/><br/>This film is a sad attempt to play on the envy of people as well as the media's unflattering and grossly inaccurate portrayal of finance. Most people who wanna be in finance don't wanna be brokers, and most who are actual players are NOT brokers. Martin also calls McConaughey's character a ""trader??"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? He was also a SALESMAN. Salesman=/=trader, just like paralegal=/=lawyer or nurse assistant=/=doctor. My other big problem is that when considering that this is a ""cautionary tale"" based off ""truth,"" the use of artistic liberty, like midget tosses, goes a lil too far. The acting at best is mediocre. Leo was great in Titanic and Shutter Island, but this (and Departed too) really is just the showcase of the fact he cannot be a believable bad guy.<br/><br/>If you want a good Wall Street movie, see Wall Street.

The theme here is excess, but not just in the story, in the movie making. Did Jordan achieve because of his excess, or did he fail because of his excess, or was it both? Hard to tell when everything was presented in such an extreme way. Hardly a great acting performance from any of the cast since they all seemed to have lived at least part of their lives in this manner. If the excess movie-making technique was used to further illustrate the main characters flaws, it was used too excessively. I left the movie 1.5 hours in and I missed nothing."
"rzajac","6","3","7","8 March 2014"," Great in many ways, but a bit interminable... and could backfire
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a fantastic showcase. It showcases all the artists who create and inhabit the world depicted, including the tech (set/prop/etc.) folks.<br/><br/>The writing/direction is good. Expressionistic/over-the-top, fun; effective at what it does.<br/><br/>The only problem I had was that the flick seemed to be a kind of ""The Hangover""-with-money. In other words, it's this interminable expose of a hollow man; and that's not enough to take the film to the next level. You are treated to this cavalcade wild ride of big money adrenalin and bizarre drug abuse, and wind up sort of lost in that kaleidoscopic maze... for a long, long time. Then the film ends. It was a great vehicle for all the people involved, and I enjoyed it, as such. But bear in mind that, in the end, it's a kind of hollow snack.<br/><br/>How is it hollow? Let's think about the moral dimension for a bit. It seems like Scorsese is trying to lay bare the amorality (at best; immorality at worst) of high finance. But doesn't this flick really just wind up scapegoating an over-the-top talisman of Wall St. excess? Aren't we supposed to chase the Wolf over the cliff, and then feel cleansed of sin? No: That wouldn't work; not with folks who think about the hard implications of Mammon worship. Which means, actually, that I'm wrong: ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" would work just dandy, at a deep, subconscious level, with altogether too many people. And that is an unfortunate key effect Scorsese's approach to this story that actually bothers me.<br/><br/>I like to think of Scorsese as a complex, challenging voice of moral conscience; but he seemed to have sort of lost his way with this flick. I think its effect is a perverse inverse of what a ""voice of social moral conscience"" would intend. I think, for all the out-of-it, abusive, egregious affronts to decency, that the downstream effect is an apologetic for those affronts.<br/><br/>I often think of one of my fave, direct, cinematic expressions of this kind of moral inoculation: THX 1138. There's a scene where one of the denizens of that underworld are flipping around the TV, and encounters a 24/7 channel which shows robocops beating up citizens. The idea is that, after being exposed to so much overt abuse, you speedily go through your cycle (rage, bewilderment, internalization) and then can get on with your passive role as a cog in a system. That's how I feel about the depiction of excess in ""Wolf"". Sadly, I think Scorsese missed the boat: We're already inoculated. Wall Street has long, long, long been disassociated from human value, and we have long, long internalized that disassociation as ""business-as-usual"". Do they really need Scorsese's help?"

"blufrog49","7","3","7","3 January 2014"," Mixed Bag
","First, DeCaprio is magnificent and it was nice to see Rob Reiner again, in a ""meaty"" role (no pun intended). Not knowing much about Belfort before the film, it was educational and at the same time quite unbelievable, but then these people are genuinely larger than life.<br/><br/>I soon became quite tired of the constant use of the ""f-word""--not surprised to read in the Trivia section that this movie ranks second for the most use of that word. That, along with so much nudity and fornication (NONE of it was ""making love"") was a real distraction from the story.<br/><br/>There is also a lot of drug use, and I CAN believe that went on, but I was uncomfortable that so many people in the theater laughed throughout the segment when Jordan and Donnie get dangerously high. I don't think Sorcese's intent was comedy at that point, but I could be wrong.<br/><br/>I think this could have been an excellent movie with a little more depth and a lot less f---ing. Women are portrayed poorly, and we see very little of the damage done to personal relationships in the wake of the greedy climb to the top. Leo deserves an Oscar nod but the film itself needs to go under the (editing) knife."
"krupa-824-719240","6","3","7","3 January 2014"," MPAA a bigger joke than Wolf of Wall Street
","The MPAA has opened the doors to huge scrutiny on how movie ratings are determined with the rating of Wolf of Wall Street. Before I express my opinion, allow me to say that, yes, the movie had great potential to be amazing and most of the actors were exceptional. First, the MPAA, in my opinion, is a joke. The Wolf of Wall Street has more graphic nudity and graphic sex than any NC-17 movie in recent years. In fact, more than one scene shows penetration. Another scene graphically shows a male doing drugs from a female genital-anal area (this scene was so intense that several people left the theater...and this is only the first ten minutes of the film). The amount of graphic drug use and graphic talk of sex does add to the uncomfortable and intense feelings throughout the film. Mind you, this is a three hour long movie that has an intense, continuous, and vulgar amount of graphic sex, orgies, nudity, language, a scene that can be considered rape, and drug use. I could understand if there were 3, 4, or 5 scenes. However, when you consider the entire graphic nature of the film, I don't understand only a R-rating. Second, several NC-17 films of recent years have less graphic nudity, sex, and violence. Look at Killer Joe that was rated NC-17 because of the ending. The ending was considered too violent, graphic, and realistic; and included a scene of simulated oral sex with a chicken/drum stick. Wow, that is not even close to the amount of graphic and realistic ""stuff"" in Wolf of Wall Street. There are more examples, but the point I am trying to make is this...I felt awkward and embarrassed to watch several scenes of Wolf of Wall Street; whereas, I did not feel that way while watching NC-17 movies like Shame, Killer Joe, Anti Christ, Enter the Void, Requiem for a Dream, and even The Last Tango in Paris ( originally was rated X in 1972, but re-rated NC-17 in 1997). It seems to me that the MPAA has less tolerance for movies made by independent sources, and has an anything goes attitude for well-known directors. Lastly, the acting and script. The acting was amazing, except for Leonardo. Leonardo seemed to be overacting and unbelievable. Noah and the rest of the cast were exceptional...so I don't understand why Leonardo seemed to be poorly acting to me. He is usually really good and over looked at the Oscars. I feel that Noah and the others will be up for nominations, but not Leo. The script was great overall, but lacked a lot of explanation of the scheme and how it worked and why it was illegal. Maybe more time explains the con and legalities would have been better than filling the scenes with sex, drugs, and nudity. So, allow me to leave you with a question. Would you want your 14-16 year old to watch a movie that glorifies sex, drugs, and money in an extremely graphic way? Well, the MPAA say yes."
"cholmes58","6","3","7","2 January 2014"," The Wolf of WS's Biggest Excess is the Film Length
","The excesses in the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, the true story of the wealthy stockbroker told in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, is an essential element of this movie. However, the biggest sin of the filmmaker is that he stretches out of the debauchery, greed and decadence over a three-hour film that is ineffectively countered with only an infinitesimal amount of moral and rational content.<br/><br/>The acting of Leonardo DiCaprio is not in question here; nor, for that matter, are the performances of his supporting cast, most notably Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, who play his business partner and second wife, respectively. Strong performances abound by those three actors and others as well in this cinematic effort. In the case of DiCaprio, one could argue that this could be one of the top movie portrayals of his career.<br/><br/>However, save for the very brief moralistic beginning of the Belfort character, the other 98 percent of the movie leaves you with a protagonist that offers nothing for viewers to root for, unless you are a fervent worshiper at the altars of Gordon Gekko (see Oliver's Stones' 1987 Wall Street), Hustler's Larry Flynt and the Allied Brotherhood of Drug Dealers Incorporated.<br/><br/>Yet, this is apparently the true-life story of Belfort. Thus with respect to his rise to making millions of dollars, all the drugs, sex and abject degenerate behavior that went with it, along with his eventual fall from the illicit pinnacle he built up for himself and his company, it is what it is.<br/><br/>However, when the audience is required to endure the long drawn out corruption and comeuppance without giving it any reason to care about the outcome of the arrogant central character, it makes for an unsatisfying cinema experience. Just a little bit of redeeming character (even if invented), such as that afforded to cocaine magnate Tony Montana (Al Pacino) in the 1983 Scarface, along with about 30-60 minutes of editing cuts would have made The Wolf of Wall Street a more enjoyable movie experience."
"nekoudacreative","7","3","7","1 January 2014"," What's missing in what should have been a masterpiece
","Given the filmmaking skill, amazing cast, excellent performances, directing, editing, and photographic talent that went into making this film, it should have been a masterpiece. However despite some often entertaining moments, the film leaves you feeling there is something missing.<br/><br/>First of all, Leonardo Di Caprio is too soft an actor to take on a roll like Jordan Belfort, the Wall Street wannabee who scammed millions. While he had some great moments and obviously was fully committed to the lead role, there just wasn't the hyperkinetic quirkiness he should have had. If you don't believe me YouTube the real-life Jordan Belfort, on whom the character is based and watch him. Then imagine him high on cocaine and you will see what I mean.<br/><br/>Secondly, the script utilizes the same story telling approach as Goodfellas particularly in the use of voice over. I believe this was a smart choice in principle as Belfort's depraved but relentlessly honest voice is important to hear. However, the VO is excessive and throws you out of the scene, frequently distancing you from the greater emotional potential that remaining in dramatic action would have provided. Voice over thus becomes a crutch here defusing the torque the same technique provides Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Like in Goodfellas, Scorsese takes the VO strategy a step forward by breaking down the fourth wall and having Di Caprio talk directly to the audience. It works in Goodfellas because it takes place at the end of the film when Liotta's character breaks out the world of gangster and migrates into his new lackluster life. In Goodfellas it also occurs with an energy that matches what comes before and after. Here the same tactic takes place in what seems to be a random manner that makes no story sense at all while it also jars you out of the drama by defusing the intensity of the scene which it interrupts.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the distancing of the voice over narration enhances the fact that the film is just too long. Its was clearly a difficult beast to wrangle in editing but it could have lost 20 minutes easily. A shorter edit would have undoubtedly punched up the structure, increased tension and smoothed out some of the few awkward moments. <br/><br/>Fourthly, Scorsese who in my opinion is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time gets cute with his own trademark devices. His slow motion moments seem mechanical, his eery silences that usually scream loudly sometimes fall flat here and his score which he usually edits from popular music better than almost anyone else just doesn't work. The Howling Wolf and Muddy Waters selections are great in themselves but he doesn't seem how and why and where to cut them in.<br/><br/>Thankfully the film does support some masterful work by all creative participants (it is after all a Scorsese picture). The performances are excellent and even Di Caprio achieves much despite what I feel is a case of unfortunate miscasting. Jonah Hill is amazing as are all the other smart ass hustler guys. Margot Robbie could have stopped at being beautiful but she showed depth, sensitivity and moxie as Di Caprio's second wife. Cristin Milioti also was excellent with big brown eyes that break your heart when they tear up. Rob Reiner was a great surprise and Matthew McConaughey's hilarious and off the wall but unfortunately his very short appearance in the beginning of the film makes it clear who should have been cast in the lead."

"InMatiasWeTrust","10","5","15","28 December 2013"," The Wolf Of Wall Street a.k.a Scorsese back at his finest
","The Wolf Of Wall Street. The Wolf Of Wall Street is the latest film from the one & only Martin Scorsese & stars Leonardo DiCaprio & tells the true story of the rise & then fall of wealthy stockbroker Jordan Belfort, he was making millions upon millions but as he said, ""Was all this, legal? Absolutely not"".<br/><br/>The Wolf Of Wall Street is everything you'd want & like from a Scorsese film. This movie at it's core is a Martin Scorsese 'comedy' & a very hilarious & well done one, that's not afraid to get GRAPHIC & not to mention it's 3 hours of fresh & very well done writing, script & storytelling. I went into the film w/ very high expectations, since I was already on board learning it was a Scorsese film & that Scorsese was partnering up w/ DiCaprio himself again & i'm happy to say I left theater very very satisfied.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's performance portraying Jordan Belfort is NEARLY his best film to date, nobody would blame you if you put the case that it's his finest to date & w/ DiCaprio being my favorite actor I'll say this has to be my favorite role of his personally. He's so invested in this role, he sells Belfort so well that even thought he's essentially a douche, he makes you want to grab a #1 foam finger & cheer for him like none other. Jonah Hill delivers the best performance of his career, as he's so so good in this role as Donnie Azoff, in my opinion it blows his performance in money ball out of the water & Margot Robbie isn't only wonderful eye-candy on screen, but also delivers a good performance. & last but not least w/ the screen time Matthew McConahay got he did a good job leaving his unique mark on the film. The whole cast from it's main to supporting being all invested in the rolls, hit it out of the park.<br/><br/>As I mentioned the film isn't afraid to get graphic, w/ many sex/nudity scenes, a WHOLE lot of drugs & I mean this is probably the movie I've seen that's had the most amount of drugs & cocaine ever, blows Scarface away, & fun fact this movie holds the record for dropping the most f-bombs in a film. This film really does push the boundaries. Do know what you getting into when seeing The Wolf Of Wall Street.<br/><br/>At the end of the day The Wolf Of Wall Street is an amazing well done movie from Martin Scorsese, one of his best ranked up there w/ such as ""Good Fellas"" & ""The Departed"". From beginning to end, from scene to scene this is a long entertaining/fun/party/thrill ride, & the most fun I've had this year in a movie. Not only is the Wolf Of Wall Street, fantastic. But my favorite of 2013. Must See."
"rjsf96","10","4","11","3 March 2014"," Scorsese on Top Form
","Although I would like to say I'm a Scorsese fan, in all truth I can't. Having only seen three of his films from his long and much talked about career, it would not be right for me to say so. But, having watched 'The Wolf of Wall Street' I already feel like one.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street makes a strong case for the best and most enjoyable film of the year. Leonardo DiCaprio owns the role and it feels like he was born to play Jordan Belfort, the real life character on which this story is based. The film is set between the 1980s and 90s, it sees Belfort making his way up in Wall Street from only able to sell penny stocks in a small building to making his own company and working with hundreds in a large office. <br/><br/>DiCaprio gives it his all, sniffing, shouting and screeching with all his might and emerges with a performance like no other. Many have argued that Belfort is a character that is vile, repulsive and vulgar. Granted he may be at certain points in the film, yet it is the voice-over that truly gives the film an impact and makes us care about his character (not too dissimilar to the one used in GoodFellas by Ray Liotta). It enables the audience to relate to Jordan Belfort in a way that would not be as powerful or poignant without it.<br/><br/>The minor characters, played by Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie are an unexpected welcome. Especially when I doubted Hill would be able to pull his role off, yet he does a marvellous job of it as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's right hand man. Always funny and excellently acted by Hill, there is no one else who could do a better job. Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Belfort's eventual wife brings sexiness and believability to her role and appears to relish every scene she is in.<br/><br/>At its core it is a film about excess and how this can be our downfall, wanting, more and more. Belfort spends his earnings (gained illegally by misguiding customers, therefore making it almost impossible for them to gain a profit) on drugs, women and among many other things his own private yacht with a helicopter, as you do. In most points of the film his humanity is driven alarmingly close to the edge.<br/><br/>Yet, Scorsese and his screen writer Terence Winter fill the film with jokes that we cannot help but laugh, almost entirely throughout its three hour run time. Many of the laughs are unexpected and that certainly helps, with an odd moment involving Belfort and Azoff completely off of their heads and a telephone cord led to me crying with laughter!<br/><br/>All in all this is a perfect film with spectacular performances from the cast. It sees Scorsese at his best bringing the characters to life and even in their most questionable moments making them people that will still care about. At three hours the film never drags or lets up, there are always neat little touches that Scorsese provides – deliberate continuity errors when Belfort is high. The non-stop humour helps and guarantees the audience a good time and the most avid film fan left in waiting for the next Scorsese film."
"rowser2468","10","4","11","2 February 2014"," The best movie I have seen since Goodfellas
","The best movie I have seen since Goodfellas, The Wolf Of Wall Street tells us the story of Jordan Belfort, a man addicted to many things including alcohol, drugs, prostitutes, gambling and money. He is hungry for power and greed. The movie not only gets the theme spot on but also gives us an inside look of Wall Street in the 80's and 90's. Leonardo Dicaprio gives the best performance of his career and Martin Scorsese adds another masterpiece to his collection. The supporting actors also shine in the movie such as Jonah Hill, Jon Berthal, Rob Reine and Matthew McConaughey. The leading actress Margot Robbie also gives a shining performance as Jordan's wild and strong Dutches of Bay Ridge Brooklyn wife. The movie is a must see with exceptional acting and extraordinary directing."
"GenericBadGuy","10","4","11","2 February 2014"," It's like Wall Street, except on Lemmon 714 Quaaludes
","In the time that The Wolf of Wall Street was approaching its UK release, it had been accused of glamorising and promoting the lifestyle that was or is being led by these corrupt Wall Street types. The Wolf of Wall Street is however a cautionary tale of excess that never becomes heavy handed and keeps you 100% hooked for the three hour run time and all this adds up to make The Wolf of Wall Street Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is full of sublime performances. DiCaprio is utterly captivating as Jordan Belfort in what is arguably the best performance of his career, possibly even topping his powerhouse performance in Shutter Island, ironically another Scorsese film. Co- stars Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Jon Bernthal and Matthew McConaughey are equally as good, with McConaughey delivering a hilariously absurd performance as Belfort's mentor Mark Hanna.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is essentially the most unconventional horror film ever made. The horrors of greed and how it distorts people are expertly shown by Scorsese in a darkly comic yet truly terrifying way. There is no questioning that Wolf is dark, possibly Scorsese's darkest yet due to the fact that it is a comedy which leads me to what I thought would be the biggest problem with the film, the tone. Despite the fact that Martin Scorsese is a master director I thought that even he would find it hard to overcome the tonal issues he would more than likely encounter when trying to adapt this surprisingly dark story into celluloid. However, I am happy to report that Scorsese balances the tone with expert precision and is possibly the most impressive feat that Wolf achieves. <br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is definitely not for everyone and I would totally understand if someone doesn't like it for one reason or another, like the fact that some may think that the 3 hour run time is over kill. Despite the hefty run time (which is filled up perfectly), in my opinion The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese best film in 24 years and one of the most biting, unflinching and daring films ever made. This is a story of how even the mightiest of people can fall from grace done in the best way possible. If you want the definitive film about financial corruption that is clever and hugely entertaining, then look no further."

We watch the rise and fall on one of the most prolific and glutenous individuals in the world of stock trading Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). Director Martin Scorsese goes to no expense to grab your attention and hold you through the rise to Mount Everest and the fall to the depths of the Mariana trenches. Watching our leading man was like watching a real life cartoon character who escapes serious injuries and drug overdoses and always comes back in the next scene minty fresh. Belfort's second Wife Naomi (Margot Robbie) with eye popping sex appeal despite the heavy NEW YAUK accent makes you think twice about the significant your with now. Love the scenes with the Naomi holding a cup of water ready to splash it in Jordan's face during a morning argument. Other characters in the film are Jonah Hill (Donnie Azoff) as Jordan's second in command at the brokerage house. Jonah portly and known for his reserved demeanor in most of his works shows a completely out-of-control character who is a Quaalude addict and gold fish swallowing spontaneous lunatic. Pratt falls and chocking scenes show the demanding physicality of that role as your waiting for Azoff to have a massive heart attack at any minute.Another example of a cartoon figure who after every death defying scene bounces back and always regains normalcy in the following scenes.Another player in the film is the suave Swiss banker Saurel played by Jean Dujardin who is sweet as Swiss chocolate at the beginning of the film but at the end throws Jordan under a Swiss bus. Finally we come to another surprise guest in the picture as do my eyes deceive me?

Jordan takes a shine to her but only as beard to deposit money from the firm in a Swiss bank account under her name. Joanna looks like a fine aged wine despite the years. lovelier than ever with an elegance to match. Great direction in a make out scene between the very young DiCaprio and Lumley.

But it is really just an accurate portrayal of the events (as confirmed by the real Jordan Belfort) that drives the message home.<br/><br/>Scorsese and Dicaprio condemn Belfort's style of living, and not directly. Instead, they convey their message by showing what actually happened (as well as the consequences) and are able to powerfully convey their point of view while making an entertaining and amusing film."

","In 1987, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes an entry-level job at a Wall Street brokerage firm. By the early 1990s, while still in his 20s, Belfort founds his own firm, Stratton Oakmont. Together with his trusted lieutenant (Jonah Hill) and a merry band of brokers, Belfort makes a huge fortune by defrauding wealthy investors out of millions. However, while Belfort and his cronies partake in a hedonistic brew of sex, drugs and thrills, the SEC and the FBI close in on his empire of excess. This movie is perfect view of biography that show how you can success!!! I love it! I show it more and more! And i not bored!

"justbusinessthebook","6","2","4","30 July 2016"," No moral compass here
","Okay. I confess. I watched this movie in a period when I am writing my own book about how 'business' greed has destroyed any premise of credible democracy. Therefore, while I found the acting good and the film entertaining, I am sick of Hollywood's hiding of its own guilt in this corruption.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, I am one of those, I suppose, who found the focus on the sex and drugs a little overbearing. These scenes should not be censored. They are 'fictionalized, for the purpose of dramatization', scenes.<br/><br/>That I get. It is necessary for the producers of films to make certain that the audience does not fall asleep in what could be a boring documentary about how a Wall Street wannabe became rich off of corrupt practices. Apparently that means that we should watch lots of nakedness and drugged madness? Because it was based on a book written by the 'real wolf of Wall Street'? Ironically, I had watched the HBO film Spotlight hours before this one. That film I will eventually write a review for and give it a 10. Why? Especially when the friend who watched Wall Street with me also watched Spotlight and found it 'rather slow'.<br/><br/>Ironically, she had to abandon watching The Wolf with me because its focus on the depravity bothered her so.<br/><br/>I found Spotlight powerful because it had good acting and exposed a story of corruption with an attempt to stay honest to the duty of a documentary movie.<br/><br/>Oh, I know that movies are 'the right to make art' out of even 'real events'. It is sad, however, that, two decades after the Belfort case began to evolve, Wall Street remains responsible for bringing down international economies, on the basis of greed. Watch the movie Too Big to Fail that is based on the 2008 Economic Collapse. The same confession: that financiers and stockbrokers of 'America' get blind to moral duty when they are faced with big money, appeared.<br/><br/>What becomes more sickening is the research to the background story to Belfort's history. On July 30, 2016, the day after I watched the movie The Wolf of Wall Street, I stumble across this: Vanity Fair has a a July 26 report that is just starting to be 'picked up' by other media rags ['Wolf of Wall Street' Scandal Casts Wide Net of Suspicion]. Evidently a film corporation involved in making this film took public funds from Malaysia, on the basis of a loan for the film's production.<br/><br/>The article alleges that even Leonard DiCaprio was part of a gambling spree with Red Granite company officials in Malaysia. Investigating over a million blown on gambling? An amount of up to a billion of Malaysian, loaned public funds, are under investigation? I was already cynical about this movie. It insists that it is 'based on real events'. It falls into the depravity of too many modern films from Hollywood that claim to be 'solely for entertainment'.<br/><br/>Sorry. IF anyone is going to portray 'real events', then the events have to be real. Oh, show the level of depravity that Belfort and his gang of misfits fell into. But, the message of daily moral responsibility is lost in this film by its focus on Belfort's lustiness for good times.<br/><br/>Honestly, there are moments when the characters allude to the immorality of the main character. Belfort's 'first wife' raises this issue in a number of pieces of dialogue. And there are other moral challenges made.<br/><br/>However, what is missing here is the alternate side of the whole story. Oh, we see a concerned government agent enter the scene and we see the Belfort character eventually trundled off to jail. But, the difference is that HBO's Spotlight and Too Big to Fail also draw in the stories of the poor who end up on the street or suffering addictions that are brought on by the physical and immoral abuse of power gained.<br/><br/>Hollywood crows that DiCaprio acts very well in 2013. He and most others in the film do. The problem becomes that the film becomes one of the richer films of 2013. That means that a lot of people around this planet 'liked it!' The reality, therefore, becomes that many of those viewers will take in that final note that this film is 'based on real events'. To too many, it becomes a documentary film of real events.<br/><br/>That makes any subsequent honest record, one that challenges Belfort's version of events, something that will not be a necessary watch for the majority of citizens in our nations. Which means what? The Wolf of Wall Street? Watch it for its entertainment value. Cringe at some of the overblown focus on sex and drugs. But recognize that it is art reflecting on a sad man's life.<br/><br/>The greater message this movie fails to make full register of is in one sickening scene. Eager wannabe employees simply want to get what Belfort has: a super rich life style. They push into Belfort's building. They did so after Forbes magazine published a scathing article about Belfort's company's corruption.<br/><br/>Will the movie goer really reflect on what happened to the schmucks who lost their life savings in this farce? This is not even raised in the film's concluding graphics. Instead, we see a 'reformed' Belfort pushing his pen selling techniques on more sales suckers who want to get rich.<br/><br/>Question becomes: will the movie goer muse on the moral obligations or merely become one of the schmucks who so eagerly serve the agenda of the greedy for the sake of their own greed?"

","Let me start by saying I love Martin Scorsese' work as a director - Mean Streets, Taxi Driver even his Boardwalk Empire episodes! But, and it's quite a BIG but, he has made the same film THREE times. <br/><br/>#1 Goodfellas; man starts from nothing rises through the mob, becomes wealthy, marries a nut-job woman and ultimately rats out his close friends.<br/><br/>#2 Casino; pretty much the same as above but set in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>#3 Wolf of Wall Street; exactly the same as the other two but with Leo as the lead instead of Ray Liotta/De Niro and it's set in New York (more or less).<br/><br/>An enjoyable watch but I found myself drawing parallels with his previous outings almost straight from the off, although unfortunately it is nowhere near as successful as the other two. It glamourises ripping people off and the use of drugs (which I have no issue with in films) but in this instance the volume of numb nuts who will watch this and think it's ""amazing"" only because of the drug use, cos drugs are cool kids.<br/><br/>Apart from the previously stated my underlying annoyance with this film is the dumbing down of how corrupt, evil and disgusting the snakes and pigs of Wall Street actually are and turning them into cool, hip and funny ""lads"" that I'm afraid is wrong in my eyes.<br/><br/>Despite all of the negativity I've discussed it serves it's purpose as being an entertaining film but be warned if you have seen Goodfellas and Casino you will find nothing new here whatsoever and if you haven't seen either of them I beg you, just watch Goodfellas!"

","This is a pretty good movie, simply because I've not seen many like it, and what it offers is a good mix of raunchy comedy, and business crime. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a charming and cool character and Jonah Hill fits in really well as his buddy among the rest of the crew that you will see in the movie. Still, it doesn't score too high simply because of how long it is and its extreme over reliance on debauchery to try and balance the length. It's as if the screenwriters were so scared of people falling asleep that they had to stuff in as many bare tits to keep the crowd attentive. I get it, it's a long film, but come on.<br/><br/>Wondering if it's worth watching? If you are here for Scorsese, go ahead and watch it. I think it's one of his best. If you are here specifically for a business drama, watch it. If you are here for Leonardo DiCaprio and/or Jonah Hill, watch it. If you are here for anything else, then you will probably not enjoy it too much."
"adam-whitmoyer","9","2","4","15 December 2014"," The Wolf of Wall Street
","Spoiler Alert<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is another excellent production put together by Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio. The film is well directed, telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a real life stock broker who got involved in drugs and questionable trading strategies during the 1980's and 1990's. I believe this film is one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best performances of his career.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street was released at the end of 2013, directed by Martin Scorsese from the Warner Brothers studio. The film was rather long totaling 180 minutes, with an R rating. The cast consists of a number of recognized actors and actresses. The main characters consist of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jordan Belfort, Jonah Hill who plays Donnie Azoff, and Margot Robbie who plays Naomi Lapaglia, Mr. Belfort's second wife. A few other big names with smaller roles in the film are Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, and Rob Reiner. The movie is based on a true story of Jordan Belfort, which follows his life when he starts working on Wall Street, becomes a wealthy stock broker, and finally is shut down by the federal government. <br/><br/>After Jordan Belfort loses his job on Wall Street after only a few weeks, he teams up with Donny Azoff and they started their own brokerage firm, called Stratford-Oakmont. The company started with a small staff and quickly grew in excess of 250 employees while Jordan trained his core group to trade penny stocks to uninformed investors, a process known as pump and dump. After Stratford-Oakmont was established, the company started filing initial public offerings. Some of the company's strategies and techniques come into question as their profits are through the roof. I was really drawn to this movie, as I'm a big Martin Scorsese fan and a bigger Leonardo DiCaprio fan. In addition to the director and big name actors I was familiar with the story of Jordan Belfort. However I never realized the lifestyle he lived during the 90's. He was comfortable selling individuals junk stocks, which he knew would not make them any money and taking that money to live a lavish life. Another movie with a similar theme is Boiler Room, a Ben Younger film which shows a similar main character, a youngster who works as a broker and makes some not legitimate moves in order to gain personal wealth. The motif of each of these films circles around greed. <br/><br/>I would certainly recommend this film, it's well directed with a star studded cast of actors. There are some extremely funny parts of the film and some serious moments, which make you think about greed and morale."

","The worst sin of this movie is that it drags along, self indulging in drugs abuse scenes and unsuccessfully trying to depict sex scenes with some more meaning than soft porn. At some points it just plainly goes overboard to a ""fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" style and zero-meaning scenes. The filler about drugs, sex and testosterone takes the stage away from the real movie, ending up probably pleasing just those who we're looking for it, and not much more. <br/><br/>In fact, there's actually something more to the movie, but while it's well depicted by a good director and actors, in the end it results quite thin and uncertain, leaving a sense of emptiness for how the movie evolves.<br/><br/>Just like most of Scorsese movies, good premises, excellent technique, but a vacuous result.<br/><br/>Feels more like a long video clip."

"badajoz-1","4","2","4","10 March 2014"," Excess, excess of Everything, so Ultimately BORING
","Another Scorsese movie - another over-praised piece of film making. This film is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street stockbroking huckster, who used legitimate and illegal tactics to sell bad shares to mugs in the boom years of the nineties. Not only that he spent money to excess, and squirrelled it away illegally in Switzerland. His personal life would make that of a debauched Roman Emperor look like a Puritan - cue hookers, strippers, full front nudity, and drugs galore! So, excess is shown.... over and over again. In fact, this three hour pic should either have been a mini series or just two hours of hard hitting condemnation. But Scorsese indulges himself hoping to ping the great US public to reform themselves and their greed - some hope! But he is brave enough to try and attack the self-righteous hypocrisy that stands at the heights of the US financial and industrial power. But basically the main fault of the film is that it is a rerun of his other movies, eg 'Goodfellas.' The character of the FBI agent represents the ordinary Joe who lives on a normal salary and catches the subway home, while Belfort indulges in the American Dream unfettered by ethics or the law. Cue Ray Liotta at the end of 'Goodfellas' bemoaning living in obscurity when he once had the excitement of the high life of criminality with the Mafia.<br/><br/>The character of Belfort is another Elmer Gantry or TV Evangelist Huckster, who can rally the troops to sell anything. And lots of ordinary people follow him from rags to riches by adopting his script and exploiting their fellow Americans. Leonardo Di Caprio fills the role convincingly but remains too one-note to successfully overcome the view that other actors would have invested Belfort with that bit more. the support is good, but not required to do much more than lay back and get a b*** job. The script is terribly repetitive and shallow. While the nudity and sexual intercourse is at times played for real, at others looks prissy which jars. And the drug taking unfortunately does look real and is barely condemned by the director! Too many faults and slowness detract from the bold theme and treatment of excess - a great pity."

"kevin-ktob","7","2","4","18 February 2014"," A tale of rags to riches and ending up somewhere in between.
","The Wolf of Wall Street tells the story of Jordan Belfort: a man who built an empire just to watch it crumble. The movie was directed by the critically acclaimed Martin Scorsese and Jordan Belfort is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The Wolf of Wall Street is a memorable movie because of the authentic acting and the roller-coaster of a plot, but has some problems.<br/><br/>The cast is led by DiCaprio who shines as a power hungry, arrogant, and impulsive Belfort. DiCaprio sets the tone very early in the movie when he nonchalantly explains his staggering daily drug use with a smirk on his face. He also gives captivating line delivery while addressing his trade floor; some would call it over the top but I feel it is appropriate for the scenes. DiCaprio also handles physical humor in a way no one has seen from him before: whether rolling down a staircase in a drug-addled state or petting Donnie (Jonah Hill) to calm him down from his high. Hill also has a memorable role showing us his physicality. He displays this ""lackey"" behavior by shying away from Belfort and other powerful figures in the movie, while ""walking taller"" when around people below him. Mathew McConaughey even gives a short but memorable role as Belfort's mentor (both in business and debauchery) Mark Hanna. I think ""fugasi"" has become a permanent part of my vocabulary because of McConaughey's delivery. No major role comes across as wooden or hyperbolic. Overall the acting helps move the plot along and keep the viewer interested.<br/><br/>Although the cast helps the plot, not much help is needed. From the very first scene we see how indulgently and carefree Belfort and his associates live. After introducing us to the lifestyle of Belfort, we are taken back in time to when he was struggling to be taken seriously or even pay his rent. Just as the viewer starts to feel bad for Belfort, he figures out his con game, strikes it rich, and dumps his loyal wife for the first piece of eye candy he finds. From here on out, there is continually escalation of both partying and scamming people out of their money. Finally the conflict is introduced in the way of a FBI agent named Patrick Denham (Rob Reiner). He and Belfort play an enthralling game of cat-and-mouse that involves Swiss bank accounts, attempted bribery, and sunken yachts. By the end of the movie the viewer has seen many highs and lows that are held together well and overall make sense.<br/><br/>Even with the superb acting and exciting plot, there are some noticeable problems with The Wolf of Wall Street. Scorsese spent too much time detailing the adventures of Belfort and his associates in the way of parties, strippers, drugs, and sales pitches. While these activities were obviously important to the characters, they did little to help develop the characters. We never see any remorse or reflection from any characters until the very end, and this only comes from Jordan Belfort. Another problem is that we never see the victims, as in the people buying the worthless stocks. The victims could've added another layer that this movie is lacking.<br/><br/>Even with these flaws I believe The Wolf of Wall Street is worth watching. There is a reason Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio had a bidding war over this script. The movie is entertaining from start to finish, and depending on your point of view it can either be inspirational story or a cautionary tale."

","The film does go on a bit. I mean how many drug-fuelled orgies do I want to see in 2/3 hours? One or two would get the (depraved lifestyle) point across but you see a lot more than that. The shock factor wears off and seeing people having sex in an office setting ends up as just boring. You know Jordan is doing wrong but you can't dispute his energy and enthusiasm and what he achieves. And then you wonder if so much energy and enthusiasm is fuelled by living in a moral vacuum.<br/><br/>I left the cinema curiously energised and hating myself for having too many morals. I will never have a yacht with a helipad. I will always have debts. I probably won't ever have a Rolex and Chanel suits. I will never go to prison and hurt people though and I can sleep soundly at night.<br/><br/>Scorsese says this film doesn't glorify Jordan's lifestyle but he's a pretty remorseless character. When I Googled him - there he is in real life, living his new life, bragging about how he is a changed man but somehow I think it may be his (highly enchanting) sales patter that we are seeing rather than real feeling. Would a truly sorry person want to show his face to the camera if he realised how duplicitous he had been? Probably not.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth watching though, just to see what Leo does with the character and he really does do a good job. I think it's an Oscar-worthy role for Leo. The film just goes on a bit too long with too many tacky scenes but I guess his life was tacky so what else could Scorsese show us? Leo is the best thing about this film. He nailed the character and in my opinion, he's one role closer to an Oscar."
"bob-the-movie-man","7","2","4","7 February 2014"," Awesome performances, but not for the prudish
","The old student adage - ""better a bottom in front of me than a frontal lobotomy' - was never truer than in Martin Scorsese's new film ""The Wolf of Wall Street"".<br/><br/>The film tells the bizarrely true story of Jordan Belfort (based off his autobiography): a rags to enormous riches story of the ugly side of stock-brokerage. Starting off young, naive but ambitious in a 'standard' Wall Street company, Belfort (Leonardo di Caprio) is taken under the wing of wild-duck maverick Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), who teaches him some of the ropes as well as introducing him to some distinctly bad habits. Following redundancy on Black Monday, and picking up sidekick Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) on the way, Belfort focuses on selling dodgy penny stocks to blue chip customers, with astonishing success. His success draws him to the attention of an investigating FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) who gives him and his team hell in trying to convict him of wrongdoing. Around this general plot line drives the alcohol and drug-imbued love life of Belfort: a steady stream of absurdly beautiful women normally wearing nothing more than a smile, led (notably) by Australian beauty Margot Robbie (About Time).<br/><br/>This is definitely not a film for the prudish. The nudity and sex is (if you'll excuse the pun) definitely in your face. The drug taking is extreme and prolific: the very first scene of the film shows Belfort ""doing crack""Â… (this is in fact a killer joke, copyright my son George Mann). And there is limited albeit distressing violence (of the marital abuse variety). All in all, this is not the film to take your favourite maiden aunt to see on a Sunday afternoon. But if you can stomach all of this (or, perhaps more appropriately, snort cocaine off the stomach of all of this) then this is a gripping story with fantastic performances throughout. Nobody - but nobody - can talk to the camera so grippingly as Leonardo di Caprio. He does it in style in this film, particularly through a tour de force walkthrough of the dealing floor whilst explaining the ins and outs of trading to you, the audience. Overall, di Caprio's performance is - quite frankly - astonishing. He has never to date won an Oscar and that is a crime. (Perhaps with this performance? But with the likes of Christian Bale (American Hustle), Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyer's Club) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) up against him, this might not again be his year - we will see).<br/><br/>There are actually many similarities about this film and his earlier film, The Great Gatsby. Both have him starring in an hypnotic and totally over the top role, with both emphasising the debauched limits of acceptable behaviour, albeit 60-odd years apart.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are also fantastic: Jonah Hill is standout (in lots of sorts of unpleasant ways), adding both humour and pathos: his acting at the point where Belfort is about to discover his terrible mistake is just superb. And Rob Reiner, as Belfort's long suffering Dad, and Jean Dujardin (""The Artist""), as a dodgy Swiss banker, are also both standout performances.<br/><br/>You might from this precursor think I loved this film. You wouldn't be completely correct. Firstly, it was long - way too long. I hate to think what happens if Peter Jackson and Martin Scorsese ever go out to dinner together. Waiters hanging around 'til 3pm in the morning, getting increasingly irate about inconsiderate diners not allowing them to lay up for breakfast and go to bed! Some of the monologues in ""Wolf"" - whilst brilliantly scripted - were 50% too long. The whole film could and should have been condensed to at least 75% of its length.<br/><br/>And I also had severe reservations about the morals of the film. The film shows the rise and fall of Belfort. But then you see Belfort's successful later life and you never get to really see the misery of the poor investors - many of who were ordinary working people - who funded his revolting lifestyle through their investment of their life savings. As someone who has personally been on the sharp end of this type of practice (via property investment), I felt this both glorified his dodgy practices and made marital infidelity and drug-taking seem normal and acceptable. For this lack of balance, I knocked a point or two off the rating.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, ""follow the Fad"" at http://bobmann447.wordpress.com... thanks)."

","A young man gets power drunk on money, and the drugs and sex it affords him, while manipulating stocks and shares.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is in one sense Goodfellas transported to a different arena. Adrenaline junkies do bad things to achieve their high, abuse drugs and women along the way, and then give up their erstwhile allies to avoid a harsh prison sentence, all the while regretting not their bad deeds, but the fact that they have to live like ""ordinary schmucks."" <br/><br/>This parallel narrative has its good points, as The Wolf of Wall Street has the same outrageous behaviour, quiet malevolence, and absurd comedy as the gangster flick. Where is falls down is that it over-indulges those excesses in repetition - every time they sell stocks it is basically the same scam. There is too much speechifying; Jason says the same thing, and too much of it, in every speech. The film also fails to show the social ramifications of Wall Street malfeasance. Scorscese is drawn to characters who live in excess, and in doing so both enthrall and appall. Unfortunately, he seems taken in by Jordan, when a little bit more objective distance might have layered this narrative in a more satisfying way. There is a small flavour of this at the end, with the FBI agent's gaze on the subway train. However, it is a fleeting moment of an element that needed to be laced in more. Notwithstanding the fact that Jordan's amoral deeds are laid bare, we are to a certain extent invited to sympathize with him, by virtue of the amount of time he spends on screen and the exclusion of time given to the consequences of his actions.<br/><br/>With Goodfellas Scorscese re-invented the mafia film, but The Wolf of Wall Street, while being an entertaining ride, does not give us anything that Wall Street, or even Rogue Trader, has given us already, except with less pomp.<br/><br/>In short a good, but not great addition to Scorscese's oeuvre."
"TimMeade","8","2","4","1 February 2014"," Morality? You Be the Judge
","It has been a major criticism of The Wolf of Wall Street that its main protagonist, the anti-hero, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Dicaprio) is not seen to truly get his come-uppance. There has been a suggestion that the film is a glorification of his lifestyle and practices, that it, through not outwardly condemning them, tacitly supports them.<br/><br/>Such moral condemnation of literature and film is hardly new. The now largely forgotten Somerset Maugham – the most popular writer in the English language for much of the first half of the Twentieth Century - often faced similar criticism. Maugham's response never wavered. It was not his job as an author, he would state, to set the world to rights. He based his characters on people that he knew. He wrote of, and embellished, their faults and shortcomings. It was for his readers to make their own judgements and determine what was right, and what was wrong.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese and scriptwriter Terence Winter seem to have adopted a similar line. They have simply told their version as they saw it: the story of a man corrupted by greed whose habit was fed by those who were only too keen to invest greedily in schemes where they thought they could make a quick, easy buck. It is ironic that many of those who now complain Belfort is portrayed too sympathetically were those investors prepared to do anything to get money apart from work for it. If Scorsese's film has a moral lesson, it is that people should not be seduced by the thought of soft profit. I suspect also, that Scorsese is of the opinion that nothing much has changed since the balloon went up with the GFC, that the fault lines remain in place for history to repeat itself. Wasn't it Sir Winston Churchill who stated that the only thing history ever teaches us, is that nobody ever learns from it.<br/><br/>So I would recommend you go and see The Wolf of Wall Street and make your own judgement as to its morality – don't rely on others to make that judgement call for you. It is a great piece of film-making which runs solidly for three hours during which the pace never slackens or dulls. It fascinates for its whole duration. Direction, script and cinematography are all spot on and the acting complements it well.<br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio is always at his best when playing larger than life characters and here is no exception. His charisma oozes from every pore and is essential to his characterisation – what conman was ever successful by being dour and self-deprecating? His skillful piece of acrobatic acting as he opened his car door with his foot when out of his mind on Quaaludes was laugh out loud funny.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also rise to the occasion and there is a wonderful comic cameo from Joanna Lumley, as Belfont's aunt by marriage, whose major scene with Dicaprio is great fun, very much a highlight. Special mention also to Australian actor Margot Robbie as Belfont's second wife who holds her own opposite Dicaprio and never lets her accent slip.<br/><br/>Two criticisms – one more serious than the other.<br/><br/>The debauchery and female nudity were overdone. The solitary scene of a musical band of bare torsoed men seemed to be a contrivance and inserted simply to deflect such criticism. Much of the female nudity seemed only there for male titillation.<br/><br/>And a minor criticism of the otherwise excellent Jonah Hill, as Belfont's sidekick Donnie Azoff. Azoff was clearly a near chain-smoker. Yet Jonah Hill never looked comfortable holding a cigarette and was obviously faking the inhalation. Smokers (and ex-smokers) easily pick up on this and it's a distraction. Odd that the many, many scenes of coke snorting looked wholly realistic.<br/><br/>I have my doubts as to whether The Wolf of Wall Street has the gravitas to become a classic, but it is a highly enjoyable romp giving a good snapshot of the 'greed is good' culture which remains with us and is surely lurking, ready to bite with even greater effect next time round."

","Overdone. Overemphasized. Overstated. An orgy of ridiculousness. Leo does not deserve an award for playing himself: a portrayal of a rich, despicable character. It was also way too long. If you like T and A and excessive drug use, then this is for you. If you do not care that a story does not have a plot, then this is for you. If you do not require a hero element in your film, then this one is for you. If you have an extra three hours you will never get back, then this one is for you. I liked ""The Departed"". To me, it is the Scorsese standard. Good acting, good story, good twist. The ""Wolf"" lacked all of that. Don't waste your time. Or check it out but don't be afraid to turn it off or walk out. It's not worth it."
"eonbluedan-1","7","2","4","29 January 2014"," Scorsese gets ballsy again
","After a flight into ""general audience"" land with the excellent 'Hugo', Martin Scorsese collaborates for a fifth time with the ever more dependable Leo DiCaprio, playing his second real life figure for the legendary film maker. Jordan Belfort came from nothing and built a Wall Steet empire like a true Gordon Gekko by, essentially, screwing over any sucker he could. The man did time, paid his dues, wrote a confessional, cautionary tale, and now performs sales seminars. None of this is spoiler; assuming you are at all interested in the topic, this should be unsurprising knowledge. It is also par for the course with this sort of Scorsese movie; you've seen the ""rise and fall"" riff from him a few times before now, right? <br/><br/>For the actor, everything he touches turns to gold right now; here he gives what is probably his most energetic performance, often invoking a young Jack Nicholson. Certainly an extraordinary, extended sequence involving the results of a narcotics overdose is due to be considered classic in no time! For Scorsese, the obvious touchstone here is 'Goodfellas'; the style of building momentum and ""bad guy"" narration is back, but again, the gangster epic remains the superior film. For both men as a team, 'The Aviator' is their obvious high point.<br/><br/>That said, there is much to be admired here: The excellent look of the film, the superb performances from Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey, the latter of whom only has about ten minutes screen time but leaves a huge impression; the fantastic use of music, again reminding us of Scorsese's ability to compose excellent montages, which drive us forward without much plot, and a masterful ability to turn the tone of the film on a dime, if only for a moment. This latter point results in unexpected laughs and gasps of disbelief; a sense of comedy arises from what is frequently a simultaneously rather obscene and absurd set of circumstances and behaviour, which leave you feeling quite horrified and/or disgusted.<br/><br/>On the downside, there is no excuse for its length and, toward the end, an upset rhythm. Up to a point we are completely on board, but as the film enters its third hour and is only then truly exploring the repercussions of Jordan's actions, along with his humiliation, we become painfully aware that with some more intelligent and brutal editing, there was probably a good forty-five minutes of the previous couple of hours that could have been easily expunged, leaving room for more of the final act and bringing it in at an easy 135 minutes. Perhaps we should turn to Leo as producer here and ask, ""Why didn't you say no to a three hour cut of this?"" <br/><br/>'The Wolf...' asks for a lot of investment in a set of characters it is pretty tough to care much for, and with ultimately little reward. The film is an impressive effort, and undoubtedly Scorsese's most ballsy film for some time, but it is also disappointing; looking at his career, we all know that this should have been a five star film! The sense that this master of cinema could have done a bit better is not easily ignored. Nevertheless, there is enough here to make it worth your while when it leaves the cinema."

","The wolf. The wolf is a beast who has no pack and is a wolf till his end. In this sense he do not loose. There are few movies with the same plot but when DiCaprio is here that is not taken in mind. He made some bright roles recently but I may say strong images, strong personalities.<br/><br/>The-movie-story have action moments, moments of narrative and protracted explanations. Also unnecessary deviations. It shows the human ambition for self-creating and freedom but also of Greed. The price which is paid in such cases is almost equal to never being born. The extreme experience of the body are not enough to overcome ""the horror of being sober"" and to lose your love ones, twice.<br/><br/>The-movie-story is very long. It is hard to me to imagine such life but I believe that everything is possible. Very good supporting role. I think always supporting role but always very good.<br/><br/>The-movie-story is provocative.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","4","21 January 2014"," Scorsese follows the pursuit of carnal appitites . . .
","The constant theme of Martin Scorsese's best work are the temptations of the flesh, never more aptly seen than though the prism of real-life subjects. He's explored this through Jake LaMotta, Howard Hughes, Henry Hill and Jesus Christ, but in his new film The Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort may have the most savage appetite of them all. Here, Scorsese turns his camera to the greed and avarice of the stock market boom of the late 80s that he sees in almost the same way as his great film Goodfellas, with a kid from the middle class who finds a short-route to riches and unapologetically enjoys the anything-goes lifestyle. He wants anything and everything and gets it, no matter what. Then, as Scorsese's subjects always do, must suffer for it. Jordan races through life as fast as he can, acquiring anything and everything he can get his hands on. Anything? How about his own yacht with a helipad? Of course, you'll need a helicopter to go along with it.<br/><br/>Like Goodfellas, which followed the personal real-life story of an outsider into the world of New York gangsters, The Wolf of Wall Street follows the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, who narrates his own story with the energy of a runaway bullet train. At 22, he is a nice kid from the middle class who gets a job with a legendary Wall Street firm L.J. Rothchild under the tutelage of Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) a wiry drug-addict who not only trains the kid, but lets him in on the secrets of quick success. ""The name of the game,"" he tells Jordan,"" is moving the money from the client's pocket to your pocket."" This is a mantra that Jordan takes to heart, even if the client doesn't make a dime.<br/><br/>Then, only weeks after getting the job, Rothchild hits a brick wall on October 19th, 1987 – Black Monday – forcing the grand old lady to close its doors after 90 years. Without a job, he starts from the bottom at the only firm that will hire him – a meager penny-stock firm that works out of an auto parts garage. Jordan makes himself a superstar by proving how easy it is to scam the client to make money fast. He takes over the business, building it from penny stocks to Blue Chips to IPOs born on the backs of screwing their clients. He finds a small patch of money hungry brokers ready to follow his lead. Most visible is a pudgy Jewish kid named Donnie (Jonah Hill) who is a glutinous yin to Jordan's yang, an otherwise nice Jewish kid who throws off that moniker by dressing as WASP-like as he can.<br/><br/>In no time Jordan has turned the tiny boiler room brokerage firm into Stratton Oakmont, an operation built on crooked investments from which flows money, money, money leading to mountains of drugs, rooms full of naked women, and every expensive toy under the sun. He feels guilty about nothing, taking Gordon Gekko's mantra of ""Greed is Good"" and making it into a religious sacrament. Jordan is a modern-day Caligula, a Roman Emperor who makes no apologies for his gross avarice, his drug addiction, his sex addiction or any other morally reprehensible machination that allowed him to get it. In no time at all he has be biggest house, the biggest boat, the best sports car, the fastest plane, and mounds and mounds of drugs. He even trades in his supportive wife (""How I Met Your Mother""'s Cristin Milioti) for a gorgeous blonde trophy wife (Naomi Robbie).<br/><br/>In our minds, possibly not to Jordan, there always hands the dread that the party will come to an end. We feel that, but the movie always sees Jordan skirt disaster, especially late in the film when he desperately needs to get to Switzerland and takes his own boat instead of a plane. The plane explodes in mid-air and Jordan comes to believe that he may be invincible. We feel that too, even when a boy scout FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) start snooping around Jordan's books. The scene at sea, incidentally, is a not-so-thinly veiled call-back to DiCaprio's role in Titanic when his boat is caught in a violent storm and it looks like The King of the World won't make it out of this one either.<br/><br/>The rhythm is familiar to anyone who has seen Scorsese's films before, what is amazing is that it's always infectious. What Jordan and Donnie are doing is morally reprehensible, but there is something attractive about their behavior that makes us privately hope that they won't get caught. In our own way we like these guys, and that may come from our familiarity with their other films. DiCaprio, in particular, gives his best performance, throwing away his good-guy image as a man who lives by appetite alone. There are notes here that DiCaprio has never been able to display. He isn't afraid to look like a jerk. Here he is able to display his talent for slapstick in a scene in which Jordan ingests a 15 year-old Quaalude that sends his body into a fit very close to cerebral palsy. That's no good when he desperately needs to get to his car to stop Donnie from making a fatal mistake. What is surprising is that this scene is played for laughs and it works! The energy is charged by the pacing and by DiCaprio's narration. This is a raunchy, messy, exciting film about one guy who desires everything and gets it. If it seems a bit too long, that's only because it is playing to the theme of wretched excess. The end of the film sends Jordan on a toboggan slide that seems somewhat inevitable, causing his reign as king of the world to end with a whimper instead of a bang. Does he learn a lesson from all his sins? What do you think? **** (of four)"

I couldn't have asked for a more perfect cast. If it were up to me, I'd nominate a lot of people in the cast for an Oscar in this film, because the performances were like you've never seen. DiCaprio, Hill, Robbie, and Chandler were amazing.<br/><br/>Going into this I had my doubts about Jonah Hill because I'm used to seeing him in these comedic roles and I didn't think that he'd fit in well in Scorcese's movie next to people like DiCaprio. Going out, I was thinking Scorcese has got his new Pachino, just like DiCaprio is his De Niro, because he was honestly was the second best part of this entire movie (Obviously Leo was #1). I will NEVER underestimate his acting skills agian. In fact, Hill should take on more roles like this, cause he's amazing in them.<br/><br/>Look, as a biographical movie based off the real life events of a scumbag, I thought it was gonna be boring. This movie NEVER failed to catch my attention. I had my eyes GLUED to the screen. Everything from the screenplay, the acting, the directing was just captivating. It was supposedly 3 hours long, but I felt like I was sitting in my seat for about one hour because I couldn't feel any tinge of drag. Even from the get go at the start I was intrigued. Just jumped right into it. This movie didn't hold back any punches. As a comedy it hit EVERYTHING. I lost my near  in so many times. I don't know exactly what scenes are meant for the laughs, but I was laughing a lot. So the humor is A+.

nudity, crude nature, and language in his film, but geez. It's R rated for a reason people! Don't get too much on your high horse for it.<br/><br/>The one thing that I hate about this movie was the after effect of it on the real world. Jordan Belford, the guy who this movie is based off on, gets more attention for being a complete jackass and for his past criminal deeds of tricking a lot of people into going broke. It doesn't sit well with me that he gets a positive end from it. But that's just me. He deserves a whole lot worse for his past abuses.<br/><br/>This has gotta be one of my favorites movies of all time.

"zeekwunlau","8","0","0","6 May 2020"," Elite balance
","It took patience to watch the movie for nearly 3 hours, but I think the essence is all in the lunch chat between Jordan and his first Wall Street colleague at the beginning.<br/><br/>To work in a world financial center and at a high price, you must be energetic, understand the overall situation and manage every detail. The money you handle every day ranges from millions of dollars to more than hundreds of millions of dollars. You must also be proficient in various trends, various model predictions, various legal regulations ... Such high-intensity and high-pressure work requires everyone to devote themselves to it. When working, everyone must lower their emotional level and carefully study every detail. However, the body and spirit are always in a state of hyperactivity, but the mood is low. Therefore, every elite must learn to balance and do things that can easily release stress: flying a plane, drinking alcohol, looking for prostitutes, taking medicine, and throwing money. Of course, maybe not everyone will do everything to promote the release of dopamine.<br/><br/>Many people will set up a self-discipline plan for themselves, and can't stick to it for a few days, even if they can get the expected benefits from those things, such as getting positive feedback such as better results. However, the average person can't hold on for long. Because the road to self-discipline and the end point have to be happy to be long, no one can avoid the simple road of dopamine.<br/><br/>Your desire is very strong, you want to get a lot of money, get a high reputation, get a lot of power. At the same time, you are energetic and clear-minded. However, you let yourself be a saintly gentleman, let yourself be poor and indifferent, and let yourself be a moral role model. Congratulations, depression will visit you sooner or later.<br/><br/>However, excessive dopamine release also damages the prefrontal temperament of the brain. Addiction to dopamine makes you lose your judgment and is in danger but unable to escape the danger. If you indulge in this simple excitement, you will end up with nothing. Just like Jordan, he couldn't listen to his father's words to confess guilt and pay a fine, because he was already addicted, and the corporate culture he created was his biggest source of addiction.<br/><br/>Life is balance-not afraid of your own desires, solving your own desires, but not letting yourself indulge in desires.<br/><br/>What do people pursue in this life? The ghost knows that it's okay to live really."

","The Wolf of Wall Street, was directed & produced by my favorite director in Martin Scorsese, who's directed popular titles like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Departed, Shutter Island, and more! Scorsese did it again! By taking authentic source material, while slightly deviating it from the truth, for enjoyable film making purposes, he created this masterpiece, inspired by Jordan Belfort's real story, and his autobiographies. With Scorsese having a background with Leonardo DiCaprio, and having an excellent reputation directing crime/drama's, this movie was assuring to be great. Terrance Winter & Martin Scorsese did a phenomenal job telling this narrative. The screenplay by Terrance Winter was super creative & conniving, and I feel it didn't get enough credit. The script was so vulgar, yet very witty, while still being ridiculously funny. The story has so many memorable scenes, well known across the world. The US alone did over 110 million dollars at the box office, and the other 160+ million coming from other regions (392 million in total). Not only was this the best paced out, 3 hour film I've seen, but probably one of the greatest paced movies I've seen, in general. I was so intrigued from minute one, all the way to minute 180, I even sat through the whole ending credits. Maybe because I have a high interest in money, but the first act was one of the greatest openings acts I've seen, that actually holds up, and is not just an attention grabber. Even though Martin Scorsese & Terrace Winter flipped some of the names, and some being made up, due to secrecy reasons, this A-list cast had such inspiring charisma, and displayed all the real actions, tremendously. After watching countless videos on the true story, and what the real Jordan Belfort (who was also on set for the production) thought; all of these seemed to be fantasy's, were almost all true, and pretty accurate. According to Belfort, Scorsese & Winter dumbed things down. I have seen A LOT of movies, and a few Dicaprio movies, but this was, hands down the best acting I've seen across a cast, but giving tremendous credit to Leonardo DiCaprio, who got snubbed for an Oscar for his performance. His anti-hero swagger, with such an engrossing personality, brought an abundance of charm, wit, and tons of comedy, to this movie. Dan Porush, named Donnie Azoff in the movie, played by Jonah Hill, is Jordan's second in command. Jonah Hill put on a FANTASTIC performance; definitely my favorite performance of his. I also thought Jonah Hill was snubbed for an Oscar, by Jared Leto of all people. Jonah Hill embodied Dan Porush to a T, down to his wife, his ambitions attitude, and everything else. Only narrative nitpick I have; the way Donnie & Jordan meet in the movie, and their outcome was tweaked. Jordan's love life was also nailed to a T, other than the name changes. Cristin Milioti did a great job for her small part in this 3 hour movie, but THE ABSOLUTE, DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, TALENTED, Margot Robbie was the main squeeze to Jordan. Her character development in the third act compliments the tone it was going for. The way Scorsese displays their relationship was pretty accurate, almost all the way down the line. As far as the strattonites go, in Alton ""The Otter"" Cufflberg (Henry Zebrowski), Cherter Ming (Kenneth Choi), Robbie ""Pinehead"" Fineburg (Brian Sacca), Brad Bodnick (Jon Bernthal) & Nicky ""Rugrat"" Koskoff (P.J Byne), they had the most chaotic roles out of everyone, on the side of Leo. Every character knew their role, and played it to perfection. I loved Rob Reiner in this film, even though he wasn't that important. His crazy dad attitude was displayed more than clear, and was a great addition. Matthew McConaughey had another small, but important role in Jordan Belfort's come up. After doing further research, McConaughey had a lot more of an impact than his screen time allowed. One of my lowkey favorite additions to this movie, was Bo Dietl, playing Belfort's PI. Bo Dietl was the actual PI of the real Jordan Belfort. His character was just another small, but necessary addition, with such an effortless performance, due to Dietl playing himself. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, was shot beautifully, with a lot of great takes, but the visual effects were hit and miss. I appreciate the tone they were trying to set, placing the effects nicely, and not overusing them, but I don't know if it had to do with the large sum of people on the crew, or what, but the visual effects weren't the greatest, and had room for improvement. The editing by probably one of the most credible editors in the game, in Thelma Shoonmaker, who edited Casino, Shutter Island, Goodfellas & The Departed, had a tough task at hand. This movie was 3 hours long, so I can only imagine how many deleted scenes there were, and what the run-time would've actually been, without so many cuts, and mashes. Shoonmaker did make some scenes a little obvious that they were two scenes mashed together, or shot at different times, but it's hard to fault someone with that much on their plate, with that much of a hefty resumé. In conclusion, as you can tell, I had a lot to say about this movie, but that's only because it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I really wish I could give it the 10, but because of some tweaked scenes, and some choppy edits, I have it as a solid 9. Anything less than a 7, is absolutely disrespectful."

","This film is based on the book by Jordan Belfort, a white-collar criminal who engaged in stock market fraud during the 1990s in New York. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the fifth collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>There is a guilty-pleasure element in watching this film where we witness absolute debauchery without having to face the same consequences as the participants. The addiction to greed and money is easily met with addictions to drugs and sex. Scorsese is a master in many engaging techniques including a fast pace, quick scene changes, managing crowd scenes, and giving what some would call a ""dirty movie"" the appearance of satire, mocking real-life hooligans who should not be given the time of day.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is superb in a very difficult role. There are other brief performances who shine as well. Matthew McConnaughey stands out in a very short performance as a sleazy mentor. Rob Reiner has an opening scene where he reacts angrily to the telephone ringing at an inconvenient time. This scene alone should go into a Hilarity Hall of Fame. I could hardly stop laughing at it.<br/><br/>This movie had the potential to be great but its effect is diluted partly due to its excessive length at three hours. While all scenes were great, the constant sleaziness becomes unwelcome at a certain point. The film was given a rightful rebuke for insufficient portrayal of the victims of Belfort's scams. Had there been more of this portrayal and less debauchery, the film would have been a more complete and greater work. Nevertheless, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" deserves credit for rightly trashing one of the worst collectives of recent times: the relentless sales and marketing culture of the 1990s."

","One of Marty Scorsese's lesser films in my opinion, but maybe it's the subject that I find uninteresting. Based on the real life travails of Jordan Belfont(Di Caprio) The wolf of wall street is made well but suffers from an excessive run time, and whilst I know that this was probably meant to be seen as dark comedy, the fact that not one character is likeable makes it sort of a chore to sit through. Leonardo is good although I only seem him playing a character. Jonah Hill steals the show in many scenes he is featured in and argot Robbie looks great, with and without clothes. In the end I am unsure if the great reviews are being given after looking at the marquee- would a similar film, made by someone other than Scorsese garner so much plaudits? I am not sure. Still, if you happen to be a fan of the director or the lead actor Wolf of wall street is a nice diversion, but not much more."

","Second only to Tim Burton-Johnny Depp, the DiCarpio-Scorsese partnership is the most well-known in Hollywood, dating all the way back to 2004 with Gangs of New York. So while The Wolf of Wall Street may not be their best collaboration, it's definitely the pair at their most playful, which shows in every scene. The actual subject matter is anything but. In the late eighties, stock broker Jordan Belfort (whose autobiographical book is the basis for the film) managed to sell millions of stocks at premium prices. And when the stocks crashed (as planned), Belfort and co. reaped the rewards while the buyers suffered financially. He left dozens almost penniless. But hey, he had millions upon millions, a hot wife, a fancy car, and a multiacre mansion, so who cares? The FBI did, incidentally. Though they should probably have gotten involved sooner, rest assured that Belfort does eventually get what's coming to him, though this is admittedly the least entertaining part of the film. I'll put it this way: this is the most hard-R movie I've seen in a while. But in spite (or perhaps because) of this, it is also hugely entertaining, with enthusiastically flamboyant direction and what is perhaps DiCaprio's finest performance yet."
"Dello_","8","0","0","22 July 2019"," The sickness of excesses
","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a great movie, with some excellent acting performances (DiCaprio in particular gives one of the best acting piece of his career), a perfect direction from Scorsese and very well made in general. The story is about Jordan Belfort, a broker which becomes rich and starts to live by excesses. This film is indeed a critic to this lifestyle, which is shown attractive and satisfactory at first, but it destroys who live this way and their families and friends with the passing of time. The movie makes a great job conveying a nauseating feeling through the noumerous scenes about drugs, alcohol and sex which are excessive and make fun of this people.
The only criticism I have is that I found is it a bit too long. This length is justified by the willingness to tell the story of Jordan Belfort without rushing anything but I felt like something could be cut, like 15-20 minutes, but it's not a big deal because the film is well made. And also a little thing about the editing: there is a scene near the 20 minutes mark in which it is so bad beacuse two characters are talking to each other and everytime the camera changes to frame the other its position is different and it is confusing. Fortunately it lasts like one minute.
""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a great movie but it requires some time, so you have to watch it with no urgency to fully enjoy it."

"edgardavalos","10","3","8","15 April 2014"," One of the Best American Greed films!
","Martin Scorsese has done it again hands down! ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" starting Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio is an accelerating and thrilling film contributing to the American dream or should we say American Greed. This is the exact representation of the American dream fueled up by corruption, money and power.<br/><br/>Scorsese offers the story of Jordan Belford played by Leonardo DiCaprio where Jordan Belford a New York stockbroker and self made millionaire runs a scheme out of his own brokerage firm. Belford focuses on selling penny stocks and telling his customers that these have great potential. Belford commits various federal crimes in the early 1990's. The film starts off with naive young Belford working at a brokerage firm on Wall Street and is eager to make a name for himself. He eventually gets sucked into a crazy lifestyle full of drugs, sex, and corruption all contributing to his power and wealth. Leonardo a very well known and respected actor has provided us the audience with spectacular performances from Titanic to his role in the film Django. He has always played more serious and action filled roles. In this film Leonardo lets his comedian side come out and he's not bad at all. He is actually very entertaining. Wait, Leonardo is spectacular and at his best performance ever! Leonardo starts off as a straight edge broker protégé; he then quickly progresses into a ""degenerate"" stockbroker with unattractive yet hilarious sex and drug issues. In this film Leonardo dresses more appropriate for the business world by wearing dark suits and always looking clean cut one would say he looks like a walking million bucks. As the starring actor and also the narrator of the film he keeps the audience awake by instilling comedy throughout the movie. Leonardo gets to live the so-called American dream of extravagance and lavish lifestyles, but at a very high cost. He literally plays the role of ""robin hood"" by stealing from the rich and giving to the needy, in this case the needy being himself and his colleagues which he wants them to ""want to live like him"" and the rich anyone who is dumb enough to give them their money. Throughput the film he participates in unethical conduct but that's what makes the film so great! <br/><br/>Jonah Hill (Donnie Azof) playing the part of Belford's partner or should we say partner in crime brings out his best as a comedian. Jonah Hill has been known for his comedic appearances in films. Jonah seems to be more of a follower than a leader and dresses very liberal with colorful suits; it doesn't help his case that he happens to wear enormous glasses that gives his persona a funnier look.<br/><br/>Both actors are outstanding throughout the film. They win the audiences seat tipping attention by providing comedy and action wrapped around a world of corruption and prostitutes. Director Martin Scorsese did an amazing job with the camera. There were various scenes where the camera would mainly focus on Belford as he would speak directly into it talking to the audience. This made the audience feel more in touch with the storyline. There were also a few scenes where Mr. Scorsese used the camera and lighting effects to provide the audience with a visual representation of how intoxicated the actors were.<br/><br/>The film is disgustingly amazing. Although it is 3 hours in length, you can't help but keep your eyelids wide open for as if you shut them for a second you might lose an epic moment. At the end, the film leaves you satisfied and pumped, but you still want more. Many Americans can relate to this amazing film since most are also looking for the similar opportunity to obtain power and gain money."

","THE WOLF OF WALL STREET WOW! It seems to me that when you mix excellent writing with Leonardo DiCaprio,I end up feeling like I've been abducted,entertained within an inch of my sanity, and dropped into my bed to wake up in the morning thinking ""did I really just watch that?"" Matthew McConauhey's character sets the tone, or so it would seem.I can't remember much about the settings at the beginning of the movie, as McConauhey had my undivided attention from the start. As the plot moved forward, I found myself thinking ""wow, and it's just getting started."" It never ceases to amaze me when an actor that I've seen in several roles can make me believe his or her character, in spite of their superstar status. Leonardo delivers this consistently. I am old enough to remember ""ludes"". DiCaprio's rendition of ""wasted on ludes"" is simply spot on. His focus is evident, and the entire cast seems to fall in around his character as if there was only one way to play it. This is a must see movie. congrats to the cast and crew of this one for a masterful job well done. Bravo.<br/><br/>Thanx Y'all"

","Decaprio is at his ruthless best in this realistic Wall Street con story. You would think that this horse has been flogged to death over the past few years but every time they find another villain we are powerless to ignore the well worn plot. You would also think that the great unwashed would have cottoned on to the brokerage scam that is the engine of the industry but it's not so. There's still a sucker waiting to step over the body of the previous victim and hand over their money to a good conman.Suckers don't have to be working class either , they come from all levels of society and every one of them has the same motivation... they all want something for nothing. This movie homes right in on this motivation and portrays the sleazebags who take advantage of it perfectly (although it leaves the blue chip guys unscathed) I was disappointed in the acting of Jonah Hill and felt they overdid it with the coke,the ludes and the chicks, simply because a business wouldn't last that long with so many screw ups running things. I've worked with many of these types of characters so I can speak with a little bit of authority. At about two hours you start to fidget in your seat and wish they'd cut to the chase, but they string it out for another hour with meaningless fill, fill which dilutes some good performances. It's always fun to watch such displays of excess end up with razor wire in the final scenes. The Trump Tower in the background of one of the scenes confirms that there's many more plot lines to be mined."

"DKosty123","8","3","8","1 January 2014"," Decaprio A Con - Boomers Beware
","It is obvious after watching this one some things fit very well. Leonardo DiCaprio can play a charismatic con man like Jordan Belfort perfectly. His narration and acting dominate this movie. His acting shell works very well. This movie (and story) are chock fill of sex, drugs, and obvious myth building by Belfort. As the real guy contributed to the script it is obvious this is the case.<br/><br/>Now that this is established, the Charisma of the con man is brought successfully to life, and if in real life he had been married to the young lady portrayed by Margot Robbie he would have been a very lucky man. There is no doubt she can act here and on camera without clothes she is a sight to behold. That is really an advantage of the 3 hours this saga takes to unfold, lots of skin.<br/><br/>In support- Rob Reiner in a limited role shines in his moments as Mad Max Belfort. The rest of the support is good though limited. This is really a one man film in a lot of ways as telling the ""true"" story is centered here. The film has some funny moments and many 4 letter word moments and one of the harder R Rated films there is.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is very careful here not to mention too noticeably that there really is a guy the story is based on. His direction shows in the frames of the film. The PC people will be offended by the humor/ making fun of homosexual characters in the film but those are consistent with when the movie is set. It is only recently that these types of references been taboo. <br/><br/>Jordon Belfort is obviously a man who lives on the edge in that era. What is interesting about this portrayal of Wall Street Brokers as Cons is that with Baby Boomers trying too retire with nest eggs, brokers right now have more pigeons than at any time in history in the United States. That is because in this generation of boomers, they see politicians who are ripping off the system for 6 figure pensions and are dreaming of finding a real Jordan Belfort to try and catch up with their peers in government who retire at full income while the average boomer is going to retire at less than 40% salary because of poor government policy for many years now.<br/><br/>Boomers should watch this movie to learn not too fall into this trap."

","Wolf of wall street like any other movie based on true events was totally blow out of proportion.

I came to watch a movie, not a movie without these kind of explicit ""party scenes"". Leonard DiCaprio gave a stellar performance and Scorsese made a fabulous film. I just think that they went a bit too overboard with the length of the movie. The movie was way too long, 3 hours was pushing it. It was a movie that shouldn't have been longer than 2 hours. Totally lost one hour of my life since they were filled with pointless party scenes or something similar. I got the point of the way they partied based on the first one. In the end after 2 hours, I totally lost interest and couldn't wait for it to end. The party scenes were way too many and over the top, shocked they didn't show someone getting a heart attack. I did like how the movie started and ended, gave the movie a head and a tail and made sense as to why it started the way it started. They needed to be a bit toned down, it made me think how far apart were erotica films and normal cinematic films.

Right out of the bat, this is absolutely a dark subject matter but colorful comedy story that makes you laugh your ass off. A lot of critics have complained it's just a repetitive and pointless film, well several things you need to concern, first if the nudity and profanity bothers you, this isn't your movie, and indeed, there is a lot of it in this film, and it gets worse and worse as the story goes along. However, you need to realize this shows the reality of these characters, it shows their greediness, it shows how the more they make money the greedier they become, and they want the same thing over and over again but just in bigger or stranger stage, it shows how much nothing matters to them, I mean absolutely nothing, it shows how much these people who used to be nothing now they are all everything and want everything with giving no crap to anybody else, that's the reason it can be repetitive to some people. The dialogue and narration are very smart and natural in this film, it's not just there to fill the gaps, and it's there to show the nasty nature of these greedy bastards and inside the protagonist mind. It shows how much fun these people were having and it's shown in hilarious and comic tone, but it's the truth, I personally think the laugh at these situations are more affective than in drama tones, be you ask yourself ""Am I laughing at someone's stealing money and ruining someone's life?"", the audience feel more guilty, and that's the point but it is not represented the usual and cliché way, which is why it's difficult for some to approach this with a comic tone. Regarding the performances, oh my lord, Leonardo DiCaprio brings his best performance of his career, prepare to be amazed by that; Jonah Hill absolutely deserves a nomination; Matthew McConaughey, oh my god, he's there in three or four scenes, and he kills it all - also I think he was getting prepared for Dallas Buyers Club; Margot Robbie astonishingly a beautiful and hot woman and talented actress, watch out for her in the next couple years – Aussie actresses are pretty talented honestly. The soundtrack fits the film so well, I just wish they would have released the end credit track that Matthew McConaughey hums, it's pretty awesome – FYI, that single improvise make two other scenes to be awesome in the final act. I also think the pacing and editing is absolutely fine; the three hours was gone quickly for me, I was so absorbed that I only looked at the time to make sure that I've been really laughing and enjoying this for 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>Overall, this is my favorite film of 2013 and one of my favorite of all time. I had never laughed so hard in theater before (I almost rolled over or broke the front seat), I had so much fun watching this film that is unexplainable. To tell you the truth, that day I was all grumpy since the weather was all cloudy, insanely cold outside, and my cousins had left visiting me and my brother, so I thought I'd be bitching about it afterward, but this film changed my mood 180 degrees. I always read how people were critical about Stanley Kubrik's ""A Clockwork Orange"" or even ""The Shining,"" and look now, they're both appreciated and praised, and I think the same thing will happen to this film, so please be open minded and clever, then watch this awesome film. Since some critics are being crying baby to this film, I give the highest rating, 10/10, THANK YOU MR.SCORSESE."
"ZeeRaaN","10","4","13","9 January 2014"," Its a black comedy not deep stuff drama
","**spoiler alert**<br/><br/>The most genius part about this movie is that it was a ""Black Comedy"". I'm sure that the memoirs were not meant to be a comedy but Scorsese made the right call. i can see that such a story might be very controversial if it was done as a biography-drama, as it is being told by one side of the story who is the bad guy. people will start saying (and they are already)that the movie celebrate this criminal. but if you would forget for a moment that it is a real story, i think most of us will agree that it was hilarious and fun to watch. and this is what the movie is all about. its about a con artist who scammed people and did so many bad things and finally he was able to have a happy ending (not fair but true).<br/><br/>what i most like about this movie is that it is one of those movies which show us the inside of a situation and make us more aware. this movie did not show us the effect he had on his victims but it showed us the strategies these brokers pull to get a commission. whenever a sales person call me now i will probably imagine him doing what DeCaprio was doing when he was convincing that man to buy from him (when he was teaching his employees how to close a deal). I remember when i first saw ""wag the dog"" i swear i look at the media and politics from a different perspective now !!<br/><br/>so i really wish those who are looking for ""depth"" and tears to just try to relax and laugh at this movie and perhaps take a lesson or two from real events happened to real people.<br/><br/>I never thought that Leonardo DiCaprio can be this funny and at the same time give one of his absolutely best performances. and Jonah Hill was hilarious.<br/><br/>i noticed one tiny mistake that i think i shouldn't be picky and mention it, but im going to anyway, coz well, I'm. in the scene where DiCaprio and his wife had their last sex together, DiCaprio was without his pants laying with her arguing about the divorce and in the next shot he was fully dressed !! it was so obvious i had no idea how it passed by Scorsese !!!!<br/><br/>otherwise.... a fantastic movie"

","Went to watch this movie all alone to ensure that I experience every bit of Scorsese's magic. Turned out to be one of the best movies I have watched in recent times. In addition, this movie excels in the black comedy genre.<br/><br/>Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio has taken his acting to a whole new level in this one and no wonder Scorsese is interested in casting him time and again in his movies. A perfect 10/10 for Leo. In fact, almost every single actor has excelled in his or her role. Particularly, I loved Matthew McConaughey's role. It was short, yet his character and acting was very cool. The chick looks very hot. Yes, I am talking about Margot Robbie who plays the role of Noami, Leo's wife. My rating for the whole cast is 10/10. It was perfect.<br/><br/>Narration + Screenplay: It is good. Not excellent. I don't think it can be compared to other gems of Martin Scorsese. However, it was not bad at all. The team has ensured that we stay interested in the story, and yes, they have succeeded. However, there are just 1-2 instances when you might feel that the movie is a bit longer than required. Especially in the second half. 9/10<br/><br/>Direction: Rate Martin Scorsese? You must be kidding! 10/10<br/><br/>Laugh riot? Not exactly! Not a laugh riot. But, a very sensible black comedy movie. It doesn't make us laugh by showing chaotic or funny senseless scenes. However, the movie wins big time by bringing on the screen, the right amount of humor at regular intervals. 9/10<br/><br/>Would I recommend this movie? Hell, yeah! This is yet another classic from Scorsese and Leo.<br/><br/>I hope and pray for Leo. Wish he wins the Oscar for his acting finally and breaks his jinx."

","Another brilliant piece of work from one of my favourite directors Mr. Martin Scrosese. Even a good 3-hour long movie usually goes soft for a short while and honestly that was my only concern before watching this. But, man oh man what a kick ass movie. From the very first scene right till the end it keeps up the energy off the roof. Each and every scene is fueled with some nicely delivered dialogues and natural improvisation. I read some reviews regarding the authenticity of the story but come on, its the story-telling and the acting that simply washes away all these bullshit criticism.<br/><br/>We all know what an amazing actor Di Caprio is and he simply makes it an understatement with his performance throughout the film especially some his drug sequences. Besides Leonardo, i would like to raise my hat to Jonah Hill, Simply impeccable. He proved his prowess in Moneyball and this time around he just amplified it 10 times.<br/><br/>All in all it's my favourite from 2013 and definitely earns its status besides the greats of Goodfellas & Casino. Mr. Scorsese with all his experience and creative powers makes it that that good and the awesome acting Di Caprio and Hill makes it a mouth-watering experience. Although i don't expect The Academy to recognize pure gems like these.<br/><br/>Without a doubt 10/10."

This is a master, Martin Scorsese, at the top of his form. DiCaprio's impeccable comedic timing in this film cements him as one of the greatest actors of this generation (to me, comedy is far, far harder to do than drama. It's harder to make people laugh than you think). And don't get me wrong, this is a film of horrible people doing horrible things, and most people will be offended how this movie turns horrible things into laughs.

"daveygandthekeyboard","Null","4","13","20 December 2013"," Money is the Ultimate Drug
","I thought Scorsese owed me one after Hugo, which I really hated. TWWS only partly repays the debt of the two hours I lost to that previous film. It is a much better film than Hugo, but only a little more than half as good as The Departed, which, to be fair, was pretty darn close to being a masterpiece. TWWS is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio a broker who made a fortune selling penny stocks, which are stocks sold for companies so far down on the corporate food chain that they cannot get listed on the stock market. These stocks are appealing to a man who is as addicted to money as Belfort is, as they bring the prize of a fifty percent commission, though it comes at the expense of people who maybe cannot afford it as much as the more well-heeled whales of Wall Street. Along with his right hand man, Donnie played by Jonah Hill, Belfort makes a killing and lives the life of debauchery that his wealth affords him, which includes drugs, boats, houses, cars, and of course, women. His long rise and subsequent downfall at the hands of a dogged federal investigator, played by Kyle Chandler form the narrative arc of the film, which is fairly profanity laced and full of sex and rampant drug use. The performances from Leo and Jonah are excellent, and it is good to see Dicaprio finally in a movie where he actually escapes a sinking ship.<br/><br/>A couple of problems I had: this movie is WAY too long. Because it goes three hours, it is of course not possible to maintain the level of energy it kept in the first half. I give a little bit of a pass now that I realize it is based on a true story. But still, it could really have benefited from a few less sales speeches from Belfort or a few less examples of bad behavior while on drugs. Speaking of the drugs: After the first few drug scenes, you start to get the point. Belfort is an addict. He does funny things while on drugs. But after a while, it starts to feel like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, with the ""look what I'm doing while I'm on drugs!"" punch line. It just seems like not all of these scenes were absolutely necessary. And much like other movies about somewhat unlikeable people (I'm thinking maybe Raging Bull), it is hard to root for anyone here. The characters give us an entertaining show, but at the end of the day, I have a hard time loving a film that I am not rooting for someone. This film is sure to earn nominations for Best Actor, Best Director, Best Picture, and I don't have a good argument for why that shouldn't happen. But that doesn't mean I have to love it."

I don't know what the full ""story"" was because I gave up after about an hour and a half but it seemed to follow the antics of group of fallen men as they ""succeeded"" by falling deeper into depravity. Its truly frightening to think of all the awards it was nominated for. It was also very profane, which was evident when they couldn't even find a 10 second clips to use for the awards show that didn't have a profanity in it. And as another reviewer said, there seems to be no shortage of corrupt women in Hollywood willing to cavort around naked for everyone to see. <br/><br/>There is one very good thing about this piece, it effectively proves that God is real because something this devilish proves the devil is alive and desperately wants us to fall so our souls can be destroyed along with him."
"jstein92","10","3","9","30 March 2014"," One of Scorsese's Best Films of All Time
","When I first saw this film, I was rather excited. I myself am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese's work. However, I had no idea that this would become an instant favorite of mine. <br/><br/>Essentially the plot of this movie chronicles former stockbroker Jordan Belfort's rise and fall on Wall Street. What you get in this almost three hour film is one heck of a ride. First off, Martin Scorsese's directing is as always fantastic. It is such an exciting and entertaining movie to watch. Not once did I find myself tired of watching this movie. The acting is also fantastic. Leonardo DiCaprio kills it in this movie. He really pulls off the drug-taking, alcohol- drinking, corrupt businessman type in this film. Other great acting in this movie comes from the likes of Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Rob Reiner, and many others. <br/><br/>One major surprise which I got out of this movie was just how comedic it really was. Scorsese does not often do full-on comedies, but this is truly a hilarious film. Part of that can be accredited to Terence Winter's superb writing. So many crazy and humorous situations occur in this film. My personal favorite involved Belfort trying to drive a car under the influence of drugs. <br/><br/>I can say right now, however, that this movie is not necessarily for everyone. It can be over the top at times, and it may be downright offensive to some people. I never minded that aspect of this movie. I think it really works for this movie and genre. Some may find that this film glorifies the way investors were and still are treated by stockbrokers. To a degree, that can be true. I found, however, that this film is trying to denounce that type of behavior. If you like Scorsese, black comedy, over the top/entertaining hijinks, and Wall Street-type movies, then this movie is for you. This movie deserves all the Oscar nominations that it received."
"ltfyffe","10","3","9","26 February 2014"," Incredible film! Dicaprio and Scorsese mesh better than ever!
","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" will have you laughing, crying, and wondering what you were doing in the 1980's. Dicaprio becomes Jordan Belfort as Scorsese beautifully tells his tale. Jonah hill is as funny as Superbad except this time, he's a real character. The entire cast blend and convince so well that you'd never think this was a movie. It's a must see. As if this movie wasn't good enough already, there is more blatant nudity and drug use than ""Van Wilder"" ""Sex Drive"" and ""Breaking Bad"" put together. Scorsese and Dicaprio make light of these things so easily that you forget drugs are even harmful. The bottom line is that this movie does a fantastic job of telling a story about a wealthy stock trader who loses track of the important things through a haze of drugs, sex, and federal crimes. See it now, or forever hold your peace."
"scottyent","10","3","9","8 February 2014"," Really? How are people upset with this movie?
","I guess I can understand when people are offended by the intentionally shocking nature of the film (though if you expected different from the trailer, it's kind of your own fault), but to criticize the plot and overall character arch? I mean come on.<br/><br/>I thought that this movie is probably the best 3 hour movie I've ever seen. There wasn't one moment where I was like, how much longer is this? Not one moment where I had a down thinking...phew this is a long movie. <br/><br/>The plot definitely was more lewd and more over the top then I would have expected, but it really drove home the point of the movie. This happened, this is what some people in America embody and are excited about doing. It's so extreme that it makes it disgusting, nauseating, and repulsive. Many people on here are saying how it was a movie celebrating this way of life. To that I say, really? How many people do you think thought ""yeah, I'd love to have the captain of a plane tie me to my chair because I was so messed up on drugs I tried to rape a stewardess"" <br/><br/>Nobody. The point is it's so over the top, you see really how sick these people were. They saw woman as objects, they saw life as only pleasure, all for them. Hedonism at its finest, and the results were honestly quite disturbing. There was one scene I remember when Leonardo is doing the voice-over thing as he walks through the suite in Vegas the morning after the party, and just fondles a passed out woman's breast. Just because he can. That made it clear to me how much he saw these woman as objects, as things he bought and paid to do whatever he wants with. <br/><br/>Sure, this could have been a movie celebrating hedonism, but instead it was done in a way that made you really think about what our values are as a society, and why people like that exist.<br/><br/>The way it ended, with the FBI agent sitting on the subway, and Jordan Belfort living it up in a resort like prison....it just drove home the point. These people took advantage of so many, ruined lives, stole money, and did everything possible just to live an immoral and horrible life....and they were able to get away with it for the most part. The FBI agent had his win, but then went back to his meager earnings.<br/><br/>It really makes you think, how messed up is our value system that someone like Jordan Belfort can buy anything he wants at anytime, and an FBI agent trying to protect us citizens is eating bagged lunches and barely scraping by?<br/><br/>Even carry that over to sports, or even (ironically) the entertainment industry! Is Leonardo an amazing actor? Yes. Does he entertain people? Yes. Did he deserve to be paid ten MILLION dollars for this film? NO. That is a CRAZY amount of money. Then we have nurses all over America who devote their lives to helping people, and are absolutely scraping by on their salaries. Sure, they aren't as specialized and rare as Leonardo is, but should the gap be that crazy? He could easily have made 1 million dollars for this film, still made a million in a few other movies, ands still be living it up.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was hilarious, serious, and a statement on American value systems. All of it rolled into an immensely entertaining movie that didn't let you down for even a minute. Incredible (though overpaid) work by all involved! 10/10"
"praveenraghav1989","9","3","9","13 January 2014"," Powerhouse Movie from De Caprio and Scorsese !!!!!
","Martin Scorsese has always had an obsession with Robert De Niro initially as they have done 8 movies together and now the same continues with Leonardo Di Caprio, with the recent outing The Wolf of Wall Street being the fifth collaboration of Scorsese and Di Caprio.<br/><br/>Scorsese's movies always have adapted the Narrative Style Screenplay maximum rather the Linear Screenplay where either the Protagonist or any other character associated to the story begins the narration. Raging Bull (1980), GoodFellas (1990), Casino (1995) and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) come under the Narrative Style Screenplay category.<br/><br/>To begin with, The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) is based on the true life incidents of Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker who comes to Wall Street in aim of making it big with money and finally ends traveling in path of greed and lust while creating his own stock broking company using all fraudulent methods to make quick money. This movie narrates his story of rise, downfall and salvation for his crimes. The biggest USP of this movie is its protagonist Leonardo Di Caprio who has not only acted, but lived the character of Jordan Bel fort in the movie and has completely shouldered the movie with his charismatic and riveting performance. His character is portrayed with sheer finesse from the scene where Jordan begins the narration of this story to the last scene where he begins his reformation. <br/><br/>The scenes where Jordan first tricks a customer to invest for a fake company, the way he trains his new recruits on how to defraud the customers into investing to rob of their money and notably the complete scene sequence where the highly drugged Jordan reaches to his come from the country club to avoid getting caught by the police have been stunningly enacted by De Caprio, making this his career best performance.<br/><br/>Scorsese has also done a brilliant job of extracting the required performances from the supporting cast which includes Matthew McConaughey, Jonah Hill, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, Jean Dujardin and Jon Favreau makes a small cameo appearance. This movie has many scenes involving sexual content, excessive drug usage and its aftermaths and abusive language embedded in the dialogs of the movie and due to which this movie has been rated 'A' for viewing.<br/><br/>You may have slight nostalgic feel from Scorsese's movie Casino, as some of the character references and their portrayal seems to be have been inspired from this movie. In Casino, Sam Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro) runs a Casino illegally with him being unlicensed whereas, Jordan in the Wolf of Wall Street runs a fake firm to make money in quick time. Ginger (Sharon Stone) in Casino is portrayed as a greedy, money loving and drug addicted character who aims at living a luxurious life rather than a responsible one and here Jordan takes the same role with the similar character shades in him with money addiction and excessive drug usage playing killjoy. If it's Nicky (Joe Pesci) in Casino, then it's Donnie (Jonah Hill) in The Wolf of Wall Street and the characters played by them in both movies have similar shades. If you are curious to know more, watch them both.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a Must watch for fans of Leonardo Di Caprio and a Highly Recommended Must Watch for fans of Art House Cinema and especially Ace Director Martin Scorsese."
"ajetunhsiv","9","3","9","8 January 2014"," Di Caprio at his best
","This movie is supposedly based on the true story of Jordan Belfort. The screenplay is said to be adapted from the book of the same title by Jordan Belfort (Wolf of Wall Street). Reprising the role of Belfort is the ever-talented and perennially Oscar denied Di Caprio. This is perhaps the best movie role played by Di Caprio, who has come a long way from the lover-boy role in Titanic.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Di Caprio joining a Wall Street stock brokerage firm that goes belly up in the late eighties ""Black Monday"" stock market crash. Belfort then joins a two-bit penny stock offering firm and turns it around. The first scene at the Penny stock firm is worth watching twice, as employees marvel at Di Caprio's sales pitch and perseverance in reeling in wary buyers. Scorsese is in his elements with amazing direction, as the movie showcases the rapid rise of Belfort into a multimillionaire who launches his own 'seedy' new stock brokerage company-'Stratton Oakmont.'<br/><br/>The female leads are ably played by Margot Robbie (as Naomi, Belfort's second wife) and Christine Milioti (Belfort's first wife). The stand-out star of the movie other than Di Caprio is Jonah Hill. He has come a long way from ""Super Bad."" While Money Ball was a great introduction to Hill's acting chops, this could be his ticket to Oscar glory. Hill reprises the role of Belfort's partner -in-crime with aplomb. Their scenes of sharing banned substances are both hilarious and sad at the same time.<br/><br/>Belfort soon realizes that the FBI are fast on his trail and makes more shady deals with Swiss banks to stash away his millions. While I don't want to give away the plot of the whole movie, this one by Scorsese is definitely worth a watch, once, if not twice. Oh, and how could I forget Matthew McConaughey. He plays the early career mentor for Belfort in a short but very meaty role.<br/><br/>Enjoy the debauchery and the depiction of Wall Street brokers. One aspect that is unabashedly missing from the movie is the perspective of Belfort's victims. I need to read the book by Belfort to see how true Scorsese was in 'adapting' this book into the movie. The movie is not family friendly and has way too many adult sequences and serious substance abuse. If Di Caprio does not at least get nominated for an Oscar for this role, then there must be something wrong with the Oscar committee."

It's never meant to be taken too seriously, so if you're in the mood for something heavy and dark in subject matter and mixed with equal parts laughs humour, I have 3 hours for you to spend at the cinema. It doesn't really deserve any Oscar consideration (not that it matters), but it is a very well made film that will continue to exist, so you might as well sit down and enjoy it before it gets shoved in your face by the end of awards season.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives a wonderfully physical performance that is a lot more over the top than anything he's done before, you still never forget you're watching DiCaprio, as is with Jonah Hill, but because their off- screen chemistry comes together on-screen there are no complaints in the acting category, though a nice bit of observation. In playing Jordan Belfort in his 24-36 year old period, it feels like the first time the baby-faced actor is playing too young. The Hollywood golden boy is finally showing physical signs of having grown up. This isn't something I'd dock the movie for, rather I see it as a positive indicator for DiCaprio's career arc.<br/><br/>The only major complaint I would have about the film overall is that in being 3 hours of self-indulgence, and Scorsese and company being very aware of the themes of excess running throughout Jordan Belfort's life, the film almost doesn't feel worth the time the audience spends involved. It's a filmmaking paradox, which means it achieves it own means sometimes at the audiences' expense. This in turn is a major crime, that like the whole of the film and point of it, doesn't prove to be a major consequence.<br/><br/>Rating: B/ +2"

But after being laid off following Black Monday, Belfort learns about the world of finance removed from the glitzy world of Wall Street. Learning to take advantage of his salesmanship skills and the ignorance of the general populace (as well as the undermanned regulatory agencies), Belfort amasses a huge fortune illegally which he spends visibly and without restraint on drugs and women. When finally cornered by the FBI on his illegal activities, Belfort first chooses to fight before finally facing the reality that all is lost.<br/><br/>The movie fully earns its R Rating for the record-setting number of F-bombs, as well as rampant drug use and graphic scenes throughout."
"Rickting","8","2","5","5 January 2015"," A flawed but marvelous explosion of incredible insanity
","The Wolf Of Wall Street will be loved by some while others will be absolutely mortified. I'm more in the former direction. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a fantastically appalling stockbroker who lives the high life thanks to making millions illegally, but soon the authorities become aware of his illegal activities. Divisive but acclaimed overall, TWOWS, with its depictions of swearing, greed, sex, drug use, moral corruption and bad behaviour does not know the art of taste or the art of subtlety, but if you can look past its lack of taste, it's a relentless, ruthlessly effective and devilishly demented black comedy which is less a movie, more a machine gun helicopter blasting its way through every tasteful movie studio around. Disregarding a short running time, a restraint on unnecessary scenes and examinations of the consequences maybe wasn't the best idea, but this is overall a slightly brilliant movie which, as a cinematic whole, has got it all. People may forget how brilliantly made it is.<br/><br/>TWOWS is quite blatantly the work of a master. With every frame exploding with cinematic skill and precision, this movie looks amazing and there's not an arbitrary shot to be found. In terms of scripting, despite having over 500 uses of the F word it never feels gratuitous, and with amazing dark humour, clever character development and badass lines galore the screenplay refuses to be boxed in. Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better on screen, while Jonah Hill makes it pretty obvious he is destined to win an Oscar at some point. Matthew McConaughey is only in it for 10 minutes, but he makes a huge impact. There isn't really a solitary bad performance here. It dips after the halfway point before finding its feet again, and there are many scenes which aren't necessary and feel like they're prolonging the film for the sake of having an obnoxious length, which means the delirious heights the film sometimes reaches are never sustained for long enough. Even so, this is one of 2013's finest and deserved the Oscar nods.<br/><br/>8/10"

It boasts an amazing cast and a vibrant direction. I'm not a huge fan of DiCaprio's previous work, but after seeing this I'm very impressed with his acting. Moving on, it's a three hour flick, and it wasn't boring at all. Despite its long running time it kept me interested and entertained. I usually don't like this type of films, but this one was very funny and powerful. The characters and the story are interesting too.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely faultless. The main character performed by DiCaprio is completely nuts, he's riotously funny and you care for him. Although some moments in the movie were too surrealistic, I still love it because it's an extremely well executed biopic that manages to be hilariously entertaining and inspiring. It is about leadership and craziness; it's a strange flick filled with a bunch of obscene and bizarre moments. It definitely earns an R rating, it has some... explicit stuff. (A-)"

","To be honest, I wasn't too interested in watching this movie in the first place. However, when I saw the initial reviews and ratings I thought I'd give it a try. I shouldn't have. I rarely stop watching a movie halfway, but that's what The Wolf of Wall Street forced me to do. I found it so disturbing that it left me with a very strong desire to wash my eyes with antiseptic just to cleanse them of the filth. Two things must be said: first, I really think if viewers have any kind of wish to watch porn, they'd know where to find it. It seems very dishonest to sell this movie as anything other than that. Second: the meaningless vulgarity and decadent scenes that add absolutely nothing to the story actually manage to make us forget what the story is about in the first place. Bottom line: I only watched half of this movie and still managed to hate it. I'm left wondering how I'll get the time I spent on this movie back and how I can forever erase it from my memory. Oh, and.. Oscar nominations? really??"

Sure, it's offensive and the dudes in the story are the type I would never hang out with (mostly because I couldn't afford their suits, couldn't keep up with drug habits, don't agree with their treatment of women and find their endless pursuit of money to be the lifestyle I actively avoid—I'm very poor, by the way), but all this aside, the film tells a great story of excess, greed and extremely loose morals and ethics but it tells it in a flashy, fun and, most importantly, funny way and done with tremendous performances from not only DiCaprio but the entire freakin' cast.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a comedy that shouldn't be funny and a tale of greed and crime that shouldn't be entertaining.

"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","5","2 June 2014"," 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a high-energy rush with a reflective message about America.
","Martin Scorsese's 'The Wolf of Wall Street' delivers the world with drugs, sex, greed, humor and a strong message about how we as Americans are always unhappy with what we have and always need more to be satisfied. Leonardo Dicaprio stars as Jordan Belfort, a once calm and quiet guy to a drug-fueled, wealthy stockbroker causing crimes towards his clients in order to become a multi-millionaire. His crimes included stock market manipulation and penny stock scams. Jordan's partner, Donny Azoff (Jonah Hill), is just as greedy and rambunctious. He joins Jordan on his penny stocks, manipulation, prostitutes, drugs, and money. Jonah Hill adds a sense of comedy to fulfill the natural humor of the men's lives, and when tasked to act serious he delivers the performance of his career. Jordan's hot wife Naomi (Margot Robbie) foolishly marries him and gets manipulated as well by Jordan's lifestyle. Terrence Winter's f-bombed filled screenplay is done brilliantly in the narration form. He gives a clear understanding of what life was like for Jordan Belfort , and doesn't add foolish dialogue or unneeded text. Scorsese gives such an energy to this film that it feels like an hour opposed to three hours.He adds partying, intense drugs scenes, sex, comedy, lawbreaking and much more that revolves around the true message of American greed and how we as Americans are unsatisfied with what we have. The similarities between 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and Scorsese's finest picture 'Goodfellas' are incredible. Both stories tackle on the theme of greed, both protagonist are shown in the good and bad times of their activities and the relationships with women, the supporting cast is greatly shown, the protagonist is shown from rise to fall, and the energy and length gives you great vision of the crime in American society. Leonardo Dicaprio delivers a brilliant performance and gets Terrence Winter and Martin Scorsese's message out beautifully. His character is never satisfied with the amount of money he has (even when he is worth millions), isn't satisfied with his multiple women he cheats on, doesn't have the proper amount of drugs, homes, resources, boats, you name it more is never enough, hence the tagline."

The hours fly by, the narrative moving so fast you don't remember what happened in the last scene. DiCaprio and Hill are the dynamic duo that steal the show from even Scorcese's incredible direction, their comedic input making you forget their disgusting exploits that you end up so completely enticed in the world of the film that you can't peel your eyes away from the screen for even a second in fear of missing anything."

No details into the hows, and why's of what Jordan Belfort was doing, And very little about the investigation, and conviction. Basically all we're shown is that Belfort makes stupid amounts of money by somehow robbing faceless people on the telephone, and then he spends it on lots of drugs, and hookers. After this escalates, the FBI sort of shows up asking questions... more drugs, and hookers... more drugs, and hookers.... Drugs, and a car crash, more hookers, after a while, somehow the FBI nabs him, and he gets 2 years in prison. Which is amazing, because there's really no investigation shown. Marty probably thought good story telling would interfere with the drugs, and hookers.<br/><br/>All of this takes 3 hours. Most of which is spent doing drugs, and hookers. Unless I'm the one doing them, 3 hours of drugs, and hookers gets boring after about half an hour.<br/><br/>Please take my advice, save your 3 hours for something deserving of your time, and money.

The film deals principally with greed and how it can greatly change a person.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort and Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's partner in the scam. It marks the fifth collaboration between DiCaprio and Scorsese.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is magnificent as Belfort, managing to portray him in a brilliant way, showing off the character's extravagant and vice-filled lifestyle. DiCaprio is able to show on-screen the radical transformation his character goes through when money and greed come into play. Jonah Hill's portrayal of Belfort's sidekick is great too, the actor uses his comedic abilities to bring fun to the duo. And Martin Scorsese's direction is excellent. The production studio's decision to tell Belfort's story without restrictions allowed him to make the movie the way it had to be done for audiences to really get an idea about how far greed can take someone.<br/><br/>All this elements make ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" an excellent film, a movie that has to be seen as a satirical takedown on greed rather than as a glorification of it, to be able to fully understand and enjoy it."

","This movie functions similarly to its subject matter...After watching it, you'll have a throbbing headache, feeling like you partied the whole night with Jordan Belfort and Donnie Azoff...except no...you just watched a bloated and crappy movie.<br/><br/>I had friends tell me it was AMAZING and I had other friends tell me that it was too much movie..Too much movie? Yep. They said it actually was a physical challenge to watch the whole running time. I didn't know who to believe, but I knew I had sat through many Lord of the Rings movies as well as Harry Potter movies and never had a problem...so why should this be a problem..? I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>This movie blows so hard. I will admit, I watched and enjoyed the first hour and a half or so of the movie, but then I hit a wall. I was determined to sit through it, but it became increasingly difficult to do so. It was too much profanity, drugs, and sex. TOO MUCH. This is coming from a guy who considers ""Scarface"" one of his all time favorite movies. It was TOO MUCH. The movie had decent plot, characterization, and pace through the first half but it just meandered and became stale the second half. It was not funny, it was not entertaining, and it was not even watchable. This is one of the few movies I recall checking my watch (phone) every other minute or so. <br/><br/>I don't know who MacGuyver'd this screenplay, but here's a sample of the dialogue. <br/><br/>""We gawt some f**kin hookas, then we snorted some f**kin coke, then we gawt sawm more f**kin money so we could buy some more hookas and coke!""<br/><br/>Okay, that's not verbatim but very similar, trust me. As for the acting, DiCaprio is a fine actor, no doubt but this role was so wooden and flat that DiCaprio was essentially a 3D object working on a 2D plane. How in the world THIS ROLE got nominated for best actor, I will never know. This movie actually made me hate Jonah Hill, which is hard to do. I've loved him in almost everything he's been in, but just seeing his face and hearing his voice made me want to punch him, really freaking hard. As for the supporting cast...? Fair to midland. Nothing special. Matthew McConaughey's performance was lame as well...Unless you like talking about masturbation and...you got it...coke! <br/><br/>If I have to judge Scorsese by this film, I'd have to say that he's lost his mojo. You can see narrative devices of ""Goodfellas"" playout in this movie to very little effect. Hell, you could almost call this a watered down ""GoodFellas"" meets ""Wall Street,"" but not only would that insult two great films...it would be wrong. This movie doesn't take place on WALL STREET! Well, for 15 minutes it does, but it's just awful. This movie also conveniently leaves out any explanation (except the MOST basic) of penny stocks, market training, brokers, and the illegal activities in the film for...you guessed it....Hookers and coke!!<br/><br/>I could harp on this movie for probably as long as it took to watch the movie, but I think I'd rather move on with my life and leave this review as a warning to potential viewers that this movie is pure trash. You will feel dirty and sleezy after watching it. Scorsese needs to take a vacation or something and get back to his roots."

","Well damn! This was most definitely not a fugazi but the real effin deal: Scorsese doing what he does best, telling the tale of seizing the American dream by any means necessary, be it legal or illegal, and the inevitable downfall that comes after trying to get too much of it.<br/><br/>He's done it so well so many times before from ""Godfellas"" to ""Casino"" to ""Gangs of New York"", that you could say that Wolf of Wall Street is just repetition of the same formula – but it's a formula that works so damn well, it's just an absolute pleasure to watch. ""Wolf of Wall Street"" would be well worth the three hours even just for the performances: yes, di Caprio is on the roll as the rags-to-riches Jordan Belfort, but the film is filled with amazing performances in the smaller roles from McConaughey's manic mentor-like figure in the beginning to Jonah Hill as Belfort's best friend, pulling himself to major league from his previous mostly comic relief characters.<br/><br/>But what makes WoWS perhaps even more relevant and worth while is the fact that it does not tell the tale of mobsters like so many of previous Scorsese bravuras, but of people in the finance business – of people who have had way more influence on the daily lives of people and the society at large than any criminal kingpins. And what sets Wolf of Wall Street apart from many other movies looking at the finance sector is that it doesn't at all try to analyze how the system works or show how the money is being ripped off. McConaughey's character Mark Hanna sets the tone in the very beginning by telling that Wall Street doesn't give a f**k about the people who invest their money – it's all about getting the dealer's share of the trade as it happens, no matter how crappy the stocks you are selling really are, and then heading for the next kill. With that notion, WoWS is free to focus on elaborating on the general debauchery of the people deep in the testosterone-coke-power-trip. And with all the dwarf-tossing, Ferraris, coked-up parties and nude hot bodies it does this so enjoyably that you can't wonder if certain people are going to look at this film as a how-to guide to dollar-fueled decadence – just as the real Jordan Belfort did look up to Gordon Gecko of ""Wall Street"" as a role model for his real-life version of the film."
"eddie_baggins","9","2","5","28 January 2014"," A comedy of the highest order
","It's safe to assume that you haven't seen anything like The Wolf of Wall Street before, Martin Scorsese's epic adaptation of Jordan Belfort's true life tale that you could literally call Wall Street on Crack. That we haven't seen anything like this before is a sure tell sign that what Scorsese and his leading man Leonardo DiCaprio have created is a black comedy unlike any other, a movie that brims with cracking dialogue and therefore acts as a stunning tale of greed, lust, drugs and excess.<br/><br/>Directing a script written by key Boardwalk Empire collaborator Terrence Winter, WOWS sees Scorsese on a level we have arguably never seen him on before. Jumping into the tale with both feet and both arms (and wide rimmed glasses) WOWS sees the great spectacled Italian directing the movie with a feverish intensity that sees the 3 hour run time never outstay its welcome and gives the film an energy that is hard to describe for the those yet to see it. WOWS is a film that doesn't hold back, a film that doesn't care if you find it offensive or if in fact you find it appealing; its a film that Scorsese wanted to proudly display to you and say ""so what do you think of this?"". In a career that has so many peaks and so many varied hero's and anti hero's its not far fetched to say that WOWS is in the upper echelon of his films and is perhaps one of his bravest ever directional decisions, gone are many of his stylistic flourishes with the camera and in are scenes that crackle with mere dialogue (a scene played out upon Belfort's yacht with FBI agent Denham played by Friday Night Lights Chandler a prime example of this) and a comedic sense that even outplays Scorsese's great comedic tale The King of Comedy. If WOWS were to have been released in another year one gets the feeling that Scorsese would be getting primed to collect another well deserved statue come Oscar night, something you could say also of his leading man DiCaprio.<br/><br/>A key player in getting the film off the ground, DiCaprio here in his 5th collaboration with Scorsese delivers what could well be the performance of his career in one that is littered with award quality turns. Whether delivering speeches, partaking in unsavory behavior (which has a major role in the film) or in one particular Country Club scene physical acting of the highest order, DiCaprio fully embodies the role of Belfort and is a commanding presence in a film that needed the audience to if not like, at least be interested in a main character who never really deserves our support or affections. With such a commandeering performance by DiCaprio it's Australia's very own Margot Robbie who stands up most in the supporting cast with her role as Belfort's second wife Naomi, it's a role that will unquestionably launch her into the big leagues. In the other main supporting turn I will be critical and say that Jonah Hill's turn as Belfort's business partner Donnie has been overrated and while not a bad turn is also not Oscar worthy, it could however just be his distracting fake teeth that look to pop out at you at any given opportunity.<br/><br/>A movie that is not meant for everyone and a movie that doesn't look to give a definitive answer on what's right or what's wrong in a world that many would rather ignore, WOWS is a stunningly original movie that can be admired for pure unbridled insanity and at times breaking of the third wall between film and audience. It's a brave film, a daring one and a showcase for the great talent that is Leonardo DiCaprio. If you're willing to accept this particular Wolf into your life you will find much to enjoy, much to contemplate and much to cringe at and in the end that's rock solid proof that what we have here is a film that could one day be considered not only a masterpiece in its own right but the quintessential tale of what went wrong with humanity in this day and age of excess and partying.<br/><br/>4 and a half Quayludes out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","In the fantasy novel ""The Blade of Justice"", the warlike pirate Ganoolite raiders have a religion whose main sutra states ""Life belongs to those strong enough to live it. Weakness is born to be crushed while those born with strength will thrive. Strength in unity! Strength in comradeship!"" In many ways Belfort and his 'raiders' resemble them a great deal, and the Ganoolite mantra might not just be theirs, but of the film itself.<br/><br/>Imagine what a screwball comedy written by Ayran Rand might look like, and you have a pretty good idea of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", a highly fictionalised and romanticised account of the life and times of infamous crooked bonds dealer Jordan Belfort. Scorsese has, to his great credit, never been one to condemn or judge, but to sit back and observe the power play and rules of the game of the enclosed and exotic worlds he peers into, whether it is the Cosa Nostra or Victorian society, Tibetan monks or Civil war era New York. There are no real villains in his world, for even the darkest and most vicious human being is shown to have a soul and a personal code, and it is perhaps for this reason that his films have been so consistently refreshing and rich.<br/><br/>That rule applies here, as Belfort and his financial 'raiders' defy the beliefs of both right and left, strive for nothing but the gratification of their own needs, and rob many people rich and poor of great sums of money to pay for them. They would be out and out villains in any other film or book, (just as the cast of ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"" would in most conventional thrillers) but Scorsese has again turned the picture around 180 degrees so we see it from their viewpoint. <br/><br/>The film's message seems to be that in any world and any time there will be the 'Alphas', the men and women who are stronger, smarter, more capable, then there will be the rest. No matter where they start off, these 'Alphas' will rise to the top and dominate the others because that is their natural destiny in the Evolutionary cycle. In other times and societies, they would be bandits, pirates, raiders, war bands, but in American capitalism they are Wall Street hustlers. They behave like pirates, celebrating their natural superiority and engaging in ever more insane and dangerous acts of machismo and bravado to show they do not live by the same fear and apprehension of their inferiors. They worship their war leader Belfort with almost fanatical devotion, aware he has taken them from the gutter into the stars, and he in turn is protective of his war band, seeing in each and every one of them the same spark of brilliance he possesses. Around this ever growing band of 'Alphas' are the inferiors, such as the dim recruits who fail the 'sell me a pen' test, the limp wristed Gay butler who is caught with his hand in the till, the weedy would be raider who cleans his fish tank on a big day, or the superficial shoe designer roped in for a scam, or Belfort's slutty trophy wife Naomi, and even to an extent eager FBI agent Patrick Denham (the hero in most other accounts but here almost a destructive inhibitor of natural selection). They are humiliated and denigrated, shown to be weak and valueless besides the Alphas. Like it or not this is a true fact and it is a brave author indeed who dares propose it in these times, especially using a relatively recent true life story to tell it.<br/><br/>""TWOFWS"" is however quite un-Scorsese like in its style, which is blackly comic and defiantly un-PC. In many ways it resembles last years ""Pain and Gain"", though even less judgemental and even more applauding of its characters vices. There are laugh out jokes aplenty of various styles and kinds, including a post marriage bliss scene between Belfort an Naomi that seems ripped from the 1930s screwball comedies so beloved of the film historian. The heavy use of drugs is also made light of, and the comedy veers from 'Cheech and Chong' territory to one extended scene which comes straight out of Gilliam's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (another film this recalls) featuring an accidental overdose of heavy duty pills, a Lamborghini and Popeye. However there are also some dark moments, the darkest of which is the breakdown of the Belfort's marriage, where neither party exactly covers themselves in glory and the screaming child between them is the confused terrified victim (hope they used clever editing for that?)<br/><br/>Technically the film is great, with good cinematography and music (as you would expect) and the acting all round is top grade. De Caprio evokes compassion and support for someone who should not have it, Jonah Hill continues his rise, bringing his comedy skills into the mix, Margot Robbie excels as Naomi., likable and hateable at once, and Kyle Chandler plays the FBI straight arrow well, teetering between hero and villain. Also of note are Matthew McConaguhey who plays the wall street broker that teaches young Jordan the ropes and conveys the film's whole message in his Native American style 'war chant' before and after a 'raid'. ""The Artist"" Jean Dujardin plays a slimy Swiss banker, Rob Reiner plays Belfort Senior, and the UK's national treasure Joanna Lumley is Naomi's sexy older lady aunt.<br/><br/>This is not a film for everyone, but it is a brave one, and an extremely funny and entertaining one for those with 'the strength to live it."""

","1.Well to be frank this is one crazy movie, I haven't seen a movie with so much craziness. 2.It seemed to be more than reality to me at one point.The taking of the movie was brilliant and the screenplay was different. 3.I wouldn't have thought anyone better than Leonardo DiCaprio for this role. He played the role brilliantly. 4.It was he who carried out the movie completely.If it was not him, the movie wouldn't have been any better. 5.The narration was not so different, it was a routine. 6.The work of cinematography can be clearly seen, it was distinct in it's way. 7. Altogether I should say the crew worked so hard to portray the reality of the character so much. 8. One should appreciate their efforts and movie was all good but few can think it was little obnoxious."
"levenson20000","6","2","5","19 January 2014"," Some of Scorsese's past film successes
","The Wolf of Wall Street's problems do not stem from the technicalities of filmmaking. Though the storytelling half of Scorsese's job that could have been executed much better, at least he forms the shell of a quality movie. His films typically have a masterwork of film editing; the editing for Wolf is no exception. It is like DiCaprio is snapping his fingers the whole for the three hours. The look of the film is another strength. The juicy cinematography looks as if it was painted with the infinite money made my Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>Some of Scorsese's past film successes find themselves drilled into The Wolf of Wall Street. The first person point of view from Goodfellas and Casino is put to good use, it even grows in this film. DiCaprio not only narrates the majority of the film, but also pulls a Woody Allen and looks directly at the audience and speaks to us like we are having a private conversation with Jordan Belfort. His obsession with wealth and drugs damaging his life and family echoes from Raging Bull, but this works against Wolf. In Raging Bull we saw Jake LaMotta beat his wife, but we also felt his guilt. There's a scene in Act Three that feels like a direct homage to Raging Bull, but Wolf lacks the humanity of that film. Scorsese wanted to isolate us from the world in Wolf like he did in Taxi Driver, where we understood the violence Travis yearned for, but here Wolf fails to tug at the same cords with greed as Taxi Driver did with loneliness.<br/><br/>At the end of the day does the greedfest of The Wolf of Wall Street matter? No. If it were not so hollow, it could have been a fun movie, but I didn't even buy into the ""enjoyment."" People around me were laughing at the slapstick comedy, but I did not find most of it funny, not even DiCaprio's raved physical comedy scene in the last section of the film. I shrugged my shoulders after the first thirty seconds and then the scheme continued for five more minutes. Not a bad film, a bad narrative, and a poorly communicated film. If I retitled the film, it would read: The Disappointment of Wall Street."
"robybaggio18","8","2","5","3 January 2014"," Very good, but not exceptional
","I'm not a fan of long reviews, but I am certainly a fan of long movies. This movie goes for the three hour mark and in my opinion it hold enough material to use those minutes properly. I went to an 11 PM screening which ended well after 2 AM and the movie actually woke me up. This is always a positive thing for a drama with many characters. So I cannot say it is not interesting or captivating. It is provocative and direct, not just because of nudity and foul language. The lifestyle it shows is a bohemian utopia - sex, drugs and alcohol with no limits. This is what many movies talk about, especially mafia movies which Scorsese is famous for. It has a very similar plot to what ""Goodfellas"" have. Shows the dark side of society as something desirable and worth fighting for, but as it evolves it shows that such life comes hand-in-hand with failures and frustration. It doesn't look 100% real, but I think this is actually done on purpose because the scene where Belfort drives his car waisted on drugs suggests that all we see on screen is just a hallucination. Yes, I believe they had lots of sex, spent most of their days on heroin and that sleeping pill they mention, but the party atmosphere which they describe is just a hallucination which makes a very attractive movie.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie - what a woman! The moment when she invites Belfort into her bedroom, completely nude, goes into the same book as the famous Sharon Stone scene from ""Basic Instinct"". <br/><br/>All in all, I find this a bit too similar to ""Goodfellas"", with a slightly weaker group of actors. So I can't give it more than 8. But it is definitely worth watching."

My life has changed after this movie, I've started thinking about my life, what I could do do and how to improve.<br/><br/>I think we all want to experience luxury life: money, expensive houses and yachts, and to be the Boss of our life. Sometimes people who have a lot of money and they can buy everything start taking drugs because despite having everything they need, they want to fill in the emptiness inside them I have compared two characters - Leonardo DiCaprio and Jordan Belford - and I was impressed.

"saschakrieger","10","3","10","30 January 2014"," The heart of brightness
","Trust and integrity: These are the values a TV commercial proclaims with which The Wolf of Wall Street opens, presenting a brokerage firm as a hard-working, serious, honest service provider for those who want to invest their money in an efficient and successful way. Once the commercial ends, we get a glimpse into the company as it is: the scene opens to a raucous office hosting an orgiastic party complete with dwarf tossing, sex, alcohol and more than enough drugs to last a lifetime. Based on the true story of fraudulent stock broker Jordan Belfort, the film dives deeply into the heart of what is wrong with an economy that has embraced greed as a key component of the way it works. Where J.C. Chandon's Margin Call was a cool analysis of the workings of a system that is based on no substance whatsoever and Oliver Stone's second incarnation of Wall Street is a thriller depicting the workings of personal greed, Martin Scorsese presents the economy of greed as an orgiastic and never-ending feast that devours everything else, in which money is the drug of drugs and is equivalent with success, sex, life. A parallel world following its own rules and totally disconnected with the outside world it so drastically affects.<br/><br/>As in his classic gangster tales, Scorsese chooses the inside perspective. And so we watch Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio in an earth- shattering performance) as he rises from small Wall street apprentice, mentored by a slick and yet charming veteran broker (perfect cliché and compelling personality: Matthew McConaughey), to the master of stock fraud, committed entirely to his firm's – and his own – prosperity, which he achieves mostly by duping investors into deals that can only have one winner: Belfort and his posse. The film's most disturbing aspect is how it commits itself to following the special logic on which this world is turning. Drawn into the vortex of success and admiring the brilliant strategy Belfort follows, the viewer only gradually understands that there is world outside, full of defrauded clients who lose their mortgages, their children's college money, their homes, their livelihoods, They never appear, yet the longer the film continues, the more their presents is felt, the more they weigh on the glamorous world of eternal success.<br/><br/>A world that Scorsese paints in the brightest colors: The Wolf of Wall Street is an orgiastic film portraying an orgiastic universe in which money is everything. Whether it is wild partying, boundless sex, limitless drug use or the everyday work at the office: this is a life on speed, fast-paced, constantly seeking out extreme, a permanent high which cannot afford a coming down. All is one, whether the brokers frantically call their ""clients"", whether they have a totally out of control orgy on a plane, discuss ""dwarf tossing"" in the most cynical way imaginable or turn the serious business of how to get their money abroad into a sex-filled extravaganza: sex, money, ""love"", drugs are all part of the same permanent rush that allows for no other reality than the one they have created themselves. Apart from DiCaprio who delivers the performance of his life, Jonah Hill impresses as Belfort's even more out of control sidekick, a virtuoso of everything extreme. There are no morals in this world and there cannot be any, only one easy answer: money is everything.<br/><br/>Scorsese spares no details, the film is graphic and at the same time way over the top. The story-telling as well as the visuals occasionally have a comic book touch. Realism isn't Scorsese's goal, what he tries to achieve is to convey how it must feel to live inside this bubble. This includes the danger of making it feel desirable: a trap Scorsese skillfully plays with and avoids. The more the spiral spins, the more grotesque this world becomes, the more that initial fascination is replaced with unease and ultimately disgust. The turning point is a long scene in which DiCaprio and Hill, looking for the ultimate high, descend into a hell of crawling, mumbling and completely spinning out of any remnants of self-control, a long scene lasting several minutes that will enter film history as the most uncompromising as well as imaginative and equally comical as well as devastating depiction of a drug-induced state of mind ever.<br/><br/>From here, it's downhill but Scorsese is smart enough not to gives us a happy or even moral ending. Despite going to jail for a few years, his Belfort is on top of the world again as a highly successful author and motivational speakers, once again pulling his old tricks. The film ends with Belfort's apparent nemesis, FBI agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) riding a New York City subway train, a dreary and totally unglamorous scene with no sense of triumph or satisfaction. The order has been restored, the gamblers rule and justice is little more than a drop in the ocean, with no effect or long-term consequence. The Wolf of Wall Street is a crazily funny comedy that ends on a quiet and bitter note, a wildly colorful yet deeply honest film that beneath the craze and behind the parallel universe it depicts conceals a stark reality that presents itself even more strongly in its absence. Yet again, Martin Scorsese has come to the core of what makes the world work and delivers yet another masterpiece.<br/><br/>http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/"
"jackasstrange","8","3","10","17 January 2014"," One of the most hilarious and ambiguous films ever
","No wonder, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the greatest hits this year, with all the controversies going on about its content, some claiming it a feast of profanities, a film without any message and a torn of the moral values. Others, claim it to be a masterpiece, and hilarious and entertaining all the way through, some even go as far and say it's one of the greatest films ever made well, it's very subjective what is a good and what it's a bad film, the only thing we can judge and evaluate for real it's the artistic merits. And well, since that a comedy is always played for laughs, so in fact, this film deserves a thumbs up. But no wonder(as well), this film has some kind of distorted notion of morality for some people, and I really can't put the fault of them, because if this film isn't glorifying what Belfort did, it's not bashing or judging it either(like most films do with their despicable villains). It's just showing how dirty he is and how everything works. Of course, excellent acting by Leonardo Dicaprio. His performance was thunderous and powerful, required to interpret someone that was 90% of the time under the effects of cocaine. Funnily enough, I still not figured out what this film main intention is. The profanities on it is what may bother some people, since that it has really a lot of swearing, it's almost impossible to heard two lines in a row without them. I kinda liked Jonah Hill as well, he was disgusting and certainly it's his best performance by far. Everything works well into the film. But as you can see, worth noting, I still not figured out what is this film about. I hope there is something more than just showing how the dirty world of the Wall Street works. For now, it's kind of an incognita. Being said, it's a good comedy film, with some hilarious scenes, and a good watch if you don't mind with the language (if there is a real complaint about this film, language is it, for sure, and I find worth noting to say that it's really strong). 8.9/10"
"Atomic_Peace","10","3","10","2 January 2014"," The Wolf on Wall Street
","Based in the 1980's, The Wolf on Wall Street follows Jordan Belfort, a starting up stock broker in New York. When the firm he is working at crashes on Black Friday, he is thrown to the curb with almost nothing to survive on. When he applies for another job, he discovers the excellence made off of penny-stocks and from there, it is a roller coaster ride of adrenalin rushed cocaine fun.<br/><br/>Now, understandably, there is controversy surrounding the film. Citing that is making awe-too good out of a horrible situation, that is emphasizing drug-usage and prostitution, and other sorts of illegal activity. Now, I must say in someway I agree with the controversy. <br/><br/>Back when Django Unchained came out, I defended the film, in a post Sandy Hook environment, the filmmakers had absolutely no percussing knowledge of the tragedy, so I stood behind the film. But this is a film that I can say that they know of the situation, and they are glorifying it.<br/><br/>So this is where things get touchy; are the emphasizing it to notify it, or to have fun with a bad situation. Now, you are more than welcome to see either which way. Personally, I'm kind of torn on which way the cookie crumbles. But, from the environment and tone that the film presented in it's nearly 3 hour run-time, I'd say both.<br/><br/>I did in fact see this film as a parody of it and I mean a classic parody. Like Mel Brooks parody. What they did was they took a devastating situation and shined a different light on it.<br/><br/>Now, with the cast involved, people would have come out of the theaters commenting they didn't seize the opportunity they had at hand, if it was looked upon from another, more serious view point. So, either which way, people are going to come out peeved off.<br/><br/>The film is narrated and stars Leonardo Dicaprio, in one of the best roles he has to date. What the filmmakers do is a Ferris Bueller type of narration, in which he would notify the camera and actually talk to it.<br/><br/>The film also has an amazing supporting cast, with Johnah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Jordan's right hand man through out most of the film, Kyle Chandler as an FBI agent on Jordan's tale through out the second and third act of the film, Rob Reiner in one the best comedic roles to this date, and a cameo of sorts from Matthew McConaughey. All of whom knock it straight of the park.<br/><br/>The slightest nit pick I have is the way they took the narration though. In some scenes he's notifying the camera and in others, he was just doing it in his head. Another thing I would like to bring up is how self invested it got the drugs and sexual innuendo. Soon enough, it developed to the point that I was used to it, so that's something to say.<br/><br/>But either which way, just focusing on it from a film viewers perspective, it's a 10/10."
"shivam-ganesan","10","3","10","27 December 2013"," SELL THIS PEN TO ME!! this small quotation contrasted the whole 180 min Film..Scorsese's best directorial and Leo's best performance!!!
","I'd like to thank first to Jordan Belfort for writing his Memoirs and now its become a major motion picture and we gotta chance to know about Jordan Life..even he was in jail for 4 years..it didn't go waste but he was writing his biography and people require to see this..forget about bad behavior and drugs addiction..everyone does that when it comes to have money..we just don't see them..I'm so inspired by his empowering quotation. <br/><br/>I must tell this is the best Scorsese's film since Goodfellas..nobody could done it better than he did..Three hours of Film length just flew away like sands..I don't even realize how the film came to the end..the story doesn't have any dull moment that you might get bored. Directing, Scripts, acting, editing, production design and Cinematography are 10/10.<br/><br/>Opening sequence of Leonardo as Jordan Belfort is portrayed very detailed and shaped well about Belfort attitude and life style.And the film went on flashback about how he started. Every level of the story depth was built in a very unique way that I just left on wondering every moment of the sequences.<br/><br/>I would say only one thing for Leonardo DiCaprio that he deserve the Oscar. <br/><br/>When it comes to Matthew McConaughey part, even he just appeared for the small sequence , he literally become the shadow of the whole film. His character was huge inspiration for Jordan. Even its seem small role for him, he has big reflection to the film. As Scorsese vision, he know exactly how to create an illusion in the audiences mind without existing in real. <br/><br/>Then it comes to Jonah Hill..He turns out great in this film that you can't even imagine. Nobody could have done that character better than him. He is hilarious and faithful to his character. <br/><br/>Its good to see Margot Robbie in this film since Pam Am America.The film would be her greatest chance to approach completely challenging character as like you see previous Scorsese's films such as female protagonist in Raging Bull and Casino. <br/><br/>Moreover, the cast is fantastic including nowadays influential director Rob Reiner, Spike Jonze and Jon Favreau. <br/><br/>Terence Winter screenplay is also powerfully written according to his best knowledge of Stock Business. And Scripts fell exactly into the right man Martin Scorsese. <br/><br/>Cinematography and Editing style is fascinating especially in the boiler room. I always like the Scorsese's vision of cinematography as one single shoot without cutting such as in Goodfellas and Hugo. There is the one scene it was took exactly like that Camera move forth and back in one complete shot.It was beautiful. All the entire sequence of stoker broker making millions of phone call is beautifully juxtaposed and transited. Editor (Thelma Schoonmaker) and Scorsese are the best collaboration since over decades.<br/><br/>Sex, Drugs, Wild party and I would say ""Orgies"": No comments at all..those are the most craziest moments ever portrayed on the big screen according to Scorsese Career. I wouldn't mind it all. It was truthful to the book of Jordan Belfort. Some people might fine it offended..but I would say its normal..people do crazy staffs all the time. That's what I like about Martin Scorsese that He's so dedicated and devoted for what he's doing..He doesn't feel hesitate to portray exactly what he imprinted in his mind. In real life, we normally hide those situations even if we did. I don't mind for that. Film is not about hiding the reality..but it's the mirror of human language, behavior and thought. People require to see that depend on age level. <br/><br/>To wrap it up, I would like to say what's make Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest director of all time. It can be found in this film based on the two powerful moment;<br/><br/>1. Subway Sequence: FBI officer is reading newspaper and wondering people on the train. <br/><br/>2. The Ending: Sell this pen to me..<br/><br/>That is all I have to tell about directorial. If you are going to deconstruct the sequences, you will find out."

","Today I have spent three hours of my life watching the moronic ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", one of the worst movies that I have recently seen. The decadent Martin Scorsese makes a film about the life of a despicable man depicting him as a hero or an idol to be worshiped basically with sex, drugs and lots of naked women. The characters act like morons but are not funny and the dialogs seem to be written by a teenager after taking them from a cheap motivational book. <br/><br/>The story is also terrible and is not clear how Jordan Belfort made money in the beginning swindling his clients. Further, are people that invest money in Wall Street imbeciles and do not request receipts? But the worst is, how could this flick be nominated to the Oscar?

","I had to pace myself over a period of THREE DAYS to get through this horrid film. That it was even NOMINATED for several Oscars, much less pass R or NC-17 Ratings (should have been X-RATED) stinks of a rat or foul play in the Academy or those who rate movies. DiCaprio and Scorsese must have some MAJOR friends in both camps.<br/><br/>Disgusting. Boring. Putrid. Jading. Those are words that come to mind as I slogged through one foul-mouthed, coke-sniffing, ""Lude"" popping, sex maniac scene after another with no clear point to the reason for its existence ever revealed, much less standing in the same camp of great of even a few years ago -- ""Lincoln"", ""Argo"", ""Les Miserables"", ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"", ""Hugo""....the list goes on about Oscar contenders and WINNERS -- few that delve viewers into such rampant filth and ilk.<br/><br/>I, for one, remember movies that develop their characters and story lines that leave a mark on my heart and mind decades later -- movies such as this one, want me to take a purification bath and cleanse for the next full year. I would suggest that DiCaprio, and frankly, Scorsese honor the greats of the past in movie making by returning to reliance on TRUE creativity by developing their characters without having to subject viewers to garbage. I, for one appreciate the power of SUGGESTION without having to sink knee deep in one sex scene, drug scene, blatant disregard for sensitivies of the majority of movie goers in exchange for trying to prove ""how really bad"" and filthy one can sink or perform to ""get a message"" from the characters across.<br/><br/>My wager is that Scorsese must have some special ""in"" with the higher ups in the industry to being allowed to subject movie goers to a continuous barrage of filth and junk talk in most of his movies, with the pleasant exception to ""Hugo"". He proved he could be nominated for a clean movie -- why return to more garbage tactics in attempting to breath life in their characters.<br/><br/>My opinion of the movie is that a bunch of actors were hired to see who could act the lewdest, speak the worst possible amount of garbage in 180 LONG minutes and call it ""art"". 100M wasted on film for this? I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this one disappears into a vault never to see daylight in the not too distant future. One shaped like the garbage pit it was born out of.<br/><br/>It's such a pity -- because clearly DiCaprio is mega-talented as is Scorsese, and yet they waste their talents on garbage time after time. As in, what are they really trying to prove? How profane, disgusting, and senseless they can be? As if THAT takes talent?<br/><br/>Oh! And my opinion of Wall Street now? Well, if its purpose was to warn small time investors such as myself to stay clear -- it worked for that. I have no desire to support drug addicts, thieves, and big spenders with my hard earned money -- and that goes for Hollywood too. Thankfully, I didn't have to spend a dime on this horrific excuse for a movie."

The whole idea was to show as much of T&A as possible. Which is the only part I liked about this movie, but not worth spending 3 hours in the theater. DiCaprio with colored hair looks ridiculous. I guess, he was supposed to look young, but in fact looked like a middle age guys pretending to be younger. His actor performance was OK, but half-baked, does not add anything to what he has done before.<br/><br/>Also, I did not get the point of the movie. It almost looked like the producers admired the sell-person skills of the main character. The last scene in the movie was showing him teaching how to sell a pen at some seminar...<br/><br/>Everything was oversimplified, 1-dimensional, and predictable. Half-baked effort"
"baumer","10","4","16","27 December 2013"," Scorcese's best film
","This is not just the best film of the year, it is unquestionably one of the best films I've ever seen. Every scene, every shot, every performance is about as good as it gets. Standing out of course are DiCaprio and Hill. Hill transforms himself in this film but DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career. He jumped head first into the role and there isn't one moment that you are watching this where you feel like you are watching Leonardo DiCaprio. What you are seeing on screen is Jordan Belfort. He is brave, brilliant and fearless. Snort coke off a hookers breasts? No problem. Blow coke into a hookers ass? He does that. Give rousing speeches that compel me, the viewer, want to work for him? It's in here. Dance, get naked, party, crawl around like a baby, cry, show vulnerability, it's all in here. It is one of, if not the best performance in a film I have ever seen. DiCaprio is good in everything I have seen him in, but he has taken the extra step here. He knows Jordan Belfort. There is a scene where he crawls around on the floor for 10 minutes in a drug induced paralysis and it will go down as not only the scene of the year (along with the ejaculation discussion in This is the End) but one of the most messed up but brilliant scenes in film history. <br/><br/>When DiCaprio first came on the scene, his talent was easily seen. Then he did Titanic and became a heart-throb to teenage girls. But he's never just let loose like this. Scorcese did it with Pesci and Liotta in Goodfellas and he has done in Wolf with DiCaprio. He holds nothing back and just goes for it all. DiCaprio worked on getting this made for 6 years. It has paid off handsomely for him. You can tell he dove into this role and just let whatever inhibitions he had, check themselves at the door. Once the cameras rolled and he had to do all the crazy stuff that was required of him, he just did it. The film is memorable for many reasons but none more than his fearless performance. In my opinion, this is one of the best performances in any film.<br/><br/>This is the Goodfellas of the 2000's. It's created from the same palette that made Goodfellas. It's long but never boring and it's so entertaining and funny and exhilarating that I hope the 4 hour cut we have heard about does find it's way to the DVD. I'm not sure yet if this is better than Scorcese's opus, Goodfellas, but it is certainly on par with it. I don't know if the academy is going to be progressive enough to reward this film with what it deserves, but in time, regardless of the awards, it will be remembered as one of the great films in the annals of film history. <br/><br/>It has to be said that the movie makes you kind of envious of the lifestyle these guys lead. Their life is a party. They make 22 million dollars in three hours and then spend the next 12 hours snorting coke, swallowing quaaludes, banging the hottest strippers and hookers around, flying in private jets and spending 2 million dollars on bachelor parties. Their life is a fairy tale and it makes you a little sad that after you leave the theatre you have to go back to your 9-5 existence. This world is full of excess and debauchery but damn it looks like fun.<br/><br/>IMO, this is the best film of the year and it has the best performance of the year and it's not even close. I understand this will not be a film for everyone's liking but it is undeniably hilarious, expertly directed, crisply edited and beautifully acted.

","I had a feeling that I would enjoy The Wolf of Wall Street and that it wouldn't be another over- hyped blockbuster and I wasn't disappointed. The acting is phenomenal. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Jordan Belfort and depicts the demons that surface from huge wealth and unorthodox success. Jonah Hill's performance is also strong. Actress Margot Robbie has proved to be a great new talent and gives a powerful performance as Jordan's wife. I was very impressed with her Brooklyn accent as she's originally a native Australian.<br/><br/>Scorsese doesn't play safe and this one in particular is the most controversial movie he's ever made. It's visually amazing and both funny and moving. Matthew McConaughey, who I love, has a small but really hilarious role. I was pleased to see Joanna Lumley in this movie, who as usual, is absolutely fabulous. Out-standing."

"edgereviews","10","3","11","11 January 2014"," Scorsese delivers yet another masterpiece.....
","The Wolf Of Wall Street was my most anticipated movie of 2013. I was very familiar with its story, having read Jordan Belfort's book multiple times, reading two drafts of the movie script and watching countless interviews with Belfort himself. Martin Scorsese is my favourite director (his movie 'Goodfellas' is my favourite movie of all time) and Leonardo DiCaprio is my favourite actor. Add to that a supporting cast with the likes of Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey, and you get the idea of how excited I was for this movie. I'm very happy to say that it did not disappoint in the slightest.<br/><br/>Jordan Belfort's book has been adapted for the screen by Terrence Winter, and he does an excellent job of doing so. Having read the book, I noticed that there are quite a few differences in plot, specifically with things that happen towards the end of the movie. There were also some scenes in the book that were very hilarious, and I really wish had been put into the movie but sadly have not. This is my only minor gripe with the movie, but the content that has been included is so damn good that it pretty much cancels that negative out. Unlike other Scorsese films, The Wolf Of Wall Street is incredibly funny, there are some real hard laugh out loud moments. Not all of the comedy is dialogue between characters either, there's one particular piece of physical comedy that's easily one of the funniest I've ever seen. However, the story of The Wolf Of Wall Street isn't all fun and games, and there are some very dark and serious moments. Scorsese manages to perfectly shape a film that can meld the silly and the serious together flawlessly, with the silly being incessantly funny and the serious being incredibly heart- pounding.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely phenomenal, everyone is performing to the top of their game. Now, I certainly don't think that the Oscars are the end all be all of movie recognition, but if DiCaprio doesn't get a nomination this year, then it's just proof of the Academy's grudge against him. He delivers yet another career topping performance after last year's 'Django Unchained', he just consistently gets better and better, never to failing to completely blow me away. Matthew McConaughey has a remarkably short amount of screen time considering he's fourth billing in the credits, but for every minute he's on screen he's utterly captivating, delivering one of the most memorable performances of the film. Jonah Hill is incredibly funny, say what you will about him but the guy can really act and here he just proves that yet again. There are very few female characters in the movie, and Margot Robbie plays the main one. After hearing about her casting I was sceptical as if to whether she would be able to pull off the character, but she does it perfectly. Some may complain about how little character development the females have, but bear in mind the story is told by Belfort, and he probably didn't see the women in his life as much more than objects of desire so he won't show them as any more than that. Supporting cast members like Jean Dujardin, Rob Reiner and especially Jon Bernthal all give outstanding performances as well.<br/><br/>Scorsese does a wonderful job directing, as he always does. Many people are saying that The Wolf Of Wall Street glamorises the criminal activities that Belfort gets up to, but if you think that then I seriously suggest you watch the movie again and take a long hard think about it. The film is three hours long, but Scorsese does the pacing so perfectly that it doesn't feel like it's that long, in fact I didn't want it to end. The cinematography and editing is great, and unlike many other Scorsese movies there is a very bright and vibrant colour scheme in contrast to the dark colours he very often uses, which was a very nice change. The soundtrack is flawless as Scorsese's soundtracks always are, and most things in this movie are flawless as well. It can easily be placed side by side with other Scorsese movies like 'Goodfellas', Casino', 'Taxi Driver' and 'The Departed'. Not only will The Wolf Of Wall Street go down as the best movie of 2013, it will be remembered as one of my favourites of all time."
"tutorscircle2013","10","3","11","8 January 2014"," DiCaprio at his best
","The wolf of Wall Street is a definite 3 hours of super humor and comedy outlining the life of Jordan Belfort. Grab a huge bucket of popcorn because you would not want to step out for a refill. Many names and characters have been changed or modified from the real version of the story but Martin Scorsese has left no stone unturned in making this movie an absolute watch. <br/><br/>Ever since Titanic Leo' Di has carefully chosen all his movies and roles which have been blockbusters or could be watched again on a quite evening. I frankly was not expecting very much out of this movie ever since Wall Street 2, which was completely done up to pick up the extra change from the original series or by playing on the sentiments of the aftermath of 2008. But I was blown away. Di'Caprio has definitely set a benchmark for the new generation of actors that would come into Hollywood."
"slicedbread117","10","3","11","2 January 2014"," DiCaprio and Scorsese are the Wolves of Hollywood.
","There's a certain magic that director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio bring to the table when they are penned together for a film. The raw acting ability of DiCaprio could make even the dullest character seem interesting, and Martin Scorsese's directing style could make any script pure entertainment. In The Wolf of Wall Street, these two men are the showstoppers of arguably the best movie of 2013.<br/><br/>The movie centers around the true story of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who's rise to power and wealth through securities fraud and money laundering led to his arrest in the late 1990's. It's a fantastically compelling story, and thanks to the mastermind that is Martin Scorsese, this story that most likely shouldn't be viewed as entertainment for its criminal roots, is made an absolute blast to watch. The 3 hour run time of the film at first seems like a heavy burden for this movie to carry, but the time is spent perfectly on delivering every detail possible. Nearly half of the film is spent providing background story of Belfort's life, and in the end, the extra character and story development give this movie a deep and very real plot that clings to you. The themes that are delivered in this movie are powerful to say the least, making you think about everything you thought you knew about crime and corruption on Wall Street. As a true story, this film grabs your attention and never lets go, seizing any idea you thought you had about crime stories and vamping them up to new heights.<br/><br/>Any movie with massive amounts of sex, profanity and drug use are bound to be criticized, and with the plot showing the glorification of crime, The Wolf of Wall Street is the front runner for criticism. However, with every outrageously adult scene comes an abundance of entertainment and laughter. Belfort and company perform countless explicit acts, and director Martin Scorsese is able to take these acts and turn them into hilarious moments fueled by the ridiculous amount of drug consumption, profanity and sexual content in the film. The bottom line is that this movie is wildly fun to watch, with a high entertainment level intact the entire time.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, and in the minds of many more, Leonardo DiCaprio is the best actor in the world who has not won an Oscar. All I can say, is that if The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't earn him that award, I'm not sure what else can. There are endless amounts of words I could use to describe DiCaprio's performance. Captivating, exquisite, phenomenal, enthralling, etc, etc. DiCaprio shows his sheer ability to take any one character and create one who is developed beyond belief, with the ability to make you feel any emotions he displays, no matter what they may be. DiCaprio's character, Jordan Belfort, is a highly uncontrollable drug and sex addict whose lust for money and power often drives him over the edge of reality. We've seen DiCaprio portray some crazy and unique characters, but none like this. This already sterling actor goes to a new level to find his character, and the result is the best performance of his career. DiCaprio's acting ignites the movie, and it spreads throughout the film like wildfire. It's addicting to watch his talents unfold on screen, there's nothing DiCaprio can't do. Bar none the best performance by a male in a lead role this year, possibly of the last few.<br/><br/>I have to also give approval to other cast members such as Jonah Hill (Donnie Azoff), Margot Robbie (Naomi Lapaglia), and Matthew McConaughey (Mark Hanna). These actors all helped fill out the supporting characters to a tee and gave the cast depth which in turn gave the film true depth.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese know how to create movie magic. The Departed, Shutter Island, and The Aviator, to name a few, are wonderful films done between these two. But The Wolf of Wall Street is a whole new beast. The story was captivating, the screenplay seemed to have been made from gold, the themes portrayed by the film are powerful and controversial and it shines bright. With Leonardo DiCaprio's sensational performance as the icing on the cake, The Wolf of Wall Street rightfully places itself as the front runner for my best movie of 2013.<br/><br/>10/10"

There are some intense scenes with drugs and nudity, but when you read about Jordan's life, this movie was about his life. I loved the movie!

Not that I have not been a fan of Martin Scorsese. But more often than not, I am napping, at least for a short while in the cozy seats of theater in the loud noise. But this 3 hour movie was a different experience altogether. The story was not extraordinarily great, but when you watch at least 2 -3 movies a week, nothing sounds or seems unique to you. I was specially impressed with the dialogs. It seemed as if Leo could steal you pen and sell it back to you. Probably the best performance of his career and I hope he gets a nod for Oscars this year. I found each and every frame, every scene, every dialog engrossing to the limit. When it was funny, it was too funny. It had been a long time when I knew the film was full 3 hours in advance, but was still afraid it was going to be over soon. I give it nothing less than a 10 our of 10."
"jzappa","10","3","11","29 December 2013"," Quaalude Overdoses and Midget-Throwing: A Martin Scorsese Picture
","Very likely being an avid follower of Martin Scorsese's works and even more likely to be particularly fanatical about his most accessible and recent films, you were right in expecting a total reflection of the GoodFellas/Casino formula and style---machine gun cutting, swooping camera, characters bursting through the fourth wall like wrecking balls, monster production scope and a soundtrack like a jukebox on speed, all to get us high on our complicity in the excessive debauchery of the characters and their fast-paced lifestyle---and it is indeed awesome. But it is also amazingly effective as a slapstick comedy, loaded with outrageous and absurd laugh-out-loud set pieces.<br/><br/>I say amazing because Scorsese has never done scenes like that and DiCaprio has never even done a comedy before. Scorsese has, but the hilarity here is not in the same vein as The King of Comedy. Or After Hours. It's much broader, goofier and unexpected, as demonstrated in several epic comic tours de force throughout. And it's that very sense of absurdity that makes its commentary on American capitalistic gluttony whole. You know exactly what movie you'll be seeing, but you'll be cheating yourself out of one hell of a ride if you don't see it. It clocks in at three hours but you still won't really want it to end. The movie is as outsized, excessive and compulsive as its title character is.<br/><br/>Money here is not just the root of all evil. It's the total disintegration of any and all traces of decency, at the throbbing heart of which is DiCaprio's character, Jordan Belfort, a real-life stock trader so outrageously shameless and blind to his routine corruption that he virtually appears to be sympathetic, even chivalrous. Belfort couldn't care less whether his clients made money, so long as his share was complete. And like the oligarchs running the country now, his forte was defrauding the the struggling working man who he jockeyed into investing in third-rate penny stocks. Even his sweet first wife is feeling enough to wonder why he marks people who can't afford to be conned. Her civility gets in his way and she's promptly usurped by a blonde lingerie model.<br/><br/>Scorsese's always able to take hard-to-like characters and look at them without judgment, then somehow never have a single dull moment no matter how long he has us watch them. In this case, unabashed farce is the key to it working as a commentary on the absurd overload of greed in this country and how disconnected the super-rich are from their actions and how they affect other people. It also has the most enjoyable and random cast I've seen in a long time, and almost certainly Jonah Hill's finest hour (or three).<br/><br/>Sure, Jordan Belfort begins as a mild-mannered kid with a dream, refusing lunchtime martinis and all, but most of us start out with a soul and a sense of self-control, until we reach a level so rarefied and powerful that you never see any consequences or hardships, and you're cushioned and gratified so completely in a world of leisure and lavishness that whether or not you put the country in debt or screw a few working-class people doesn't really feel like it makes much difference.<br/><br/>As long as the class divides are that wide, that will always be the case. We are constantly baffled by the total lack of conscience in the actions of the 1% and the politicians they puppeteer, but at the same time they honestly must feel that underprivileged people are that way because they choose to be, or simply aren't as smart as them. It's a catch-22 and the only thing we can do, Scorsese says, is laugh at it."
"FilmMuscle","9","3","11","26 December 2013"," The Wildest Three Hours of Cinema
","Jordan Belfort was one of the most successful stockbrokers, but how did he get there? When he did get there, what did he do with the wealth he had so quickly accumulated? Martin Scorsese's newest film, The Wolf of Wall Street, recounts this shocking true story, exposing us to the monsters that our economic system- capitalism- has produced. To truly understand Belfort's (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) sheer insanity and criminality, what we witness herein is an energetic, 3-hour narrative that's fueled by sex, drugs, profanity, and hilarity. This is an exemplar of the paths the moguls and magnates pull through in order to finally reach affluence. <br/><br/>As usual, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers another powerful performance; in fact, this could be his best yet. He's high, he's inebriate, he's irate, he's desperate or ambitious, he's dejected, he's just deranged- the list goes on. The Wolf of Wall Street is fitting proof of this brilliant actor's range, but it also proves how utterly pathetic it is that he's still not carrying a few, or at least one, Oscar's. In this case, he goes all out, and he goes to lengths and depths we haven't seen him touch yet. In addition, he's absolutely hilarious, discovering the perfect vehicle to showcase his comedic talent. What more can the guy demonstrate to grab the Academy's attention? Then again, since he hasn't won an Academy Award yet, it totally substantiates how essentially unimportant those awards are anyways. It evinces that actors shouldn't feel doubtful of their own talents just because they can't call themselves an Oscar or Golden Globe (to a lesser extent) winner. Jonah Hill also brings his A-game, giving us yet another remarkably unhinged character to exist next to DiCaprio's as we see them participate in some of the most downright outrageous sequences. In all honesty, the entire cast shines as we sight the likes of Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, Jon Berenthal, Jean Dujardin, and much more. <br/><br/>The screenplay is undoubtedly another profound strength of the film's, providing us with some of the most ingenious dialogue this year. Furthermore, it consistently brings out the richness of these characters- their personalities and relationships, incorporating irony and/or farcicality to each and every segment. Again, Wolf doesn't only cast us into the lowest depths of humanity and wrenches us until we cry foul (in consequence to the individuals' despicable acts), but it's also one of the funniest movies I've seen all year, absolutely overshadowing most of the comedies we received these past twelve months. It comprises a plethora of memorable and incredibly amusing scenes that left the whole audience bawling with laughter. Like American Hustle though, those scenes blur the lines between what's hysterical and what's just disturbing and dispiriting. Without those boundaries and sensibility, almost every scene is bound to induce laughter of some kind. <br/><br/>As with Scorsese's numerous other projects like The Aviator and Goodfellas, a considerable portion of the protagonist's life is revealed with the plot's progression, spanning decades. With that, we begin to sense the 3-hour duration, and it's not exactly that the film drags out in any particular spots or hits a sluggish pace in general, it's merely that we're reliving a single man's history, advancing through the high's, low's, and more relaxed stages of his maniacal life. Understandably, a viewer would begin to feel the lengthiness after so many wild events have already transpired and yet it seems like the story is leading us to another one. <br/><br/>Now, many critics have panned the production's willingness and, perhaps, eagerness to delve into persistent lunacy. Of course, what we see is excessive and imprudent, but that's surely what the film is attempting to convey in the first place- these lavish lifestyles are intemperate beyond remorse and the decadence seen means exactly that never is it all apparently enough in our culture - the copious money, the gorgeous women, the sensation of drugs, and whatnot. They just don't feel that temptation to quit the debauchery and leave it all behind for betterment. Anyways, The Wolf of Wall Street is definitely one of the best films of this past year and another exceptional entry in Scorsese's filmography. Considering DiCaprio's presence, Scorsese's directorial involvement, and a riveting story to top it off, the real question isn't ""why should I go see this movie?"" The question is: why, in any possibility, shouldn't I?"

Thankfully I didn't even check my watch once as this movie is a pure ride of in your face Scorsese directing. <br/><br/>Leo was great and Jonah Hill was stellar. I think both of these guys are up for some nominations and likely even a few wins. It may be hard once again for Leo to win best actor, simply because of Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance in 12 Years a Slave but Leo's performance was awesome.<br/><br/>Simply put, if you're a fan of the old Scorsese classics, this movie won't disappoint."

","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" brings together once again the dynamic duo of actor Leonardo DiCaprio and legendary director Martin Scorsese. This time around Martin Scorsese delves into familiar territory by going back to his crime-ridden roots. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as real life stock-broker Jordan Belfort who quickly becomes infatuated with the corrupt Wall Street lifestyle and over time climbs the Wall Street ladder.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's character comes from humble beginnings but once he is sucked into the lifestyle of the Wall Street world he develops into a wicked and despicable character who commits every vice known to man. Belfort is brought to life by Leonardo DiCaprio's exuberant and flexible performance. This is Leonardo DiCaprio's movie and he takes the bull by the horns and puts this movie on his back. The fact that Leo did not win an Oscar for this role is a travesty. Honestly his performance was way better than McConaughey's from ""Dallas Buyers Club."" Speaking of McConaughey his little cameo was one of the best scenes in the film.<br/><br/>Leo was not the only standout performance in this movie but he still was the best. The acting overall in this movie is fantastic and the over the top debauchery portrayed by the characters creates a contagious vibe of highly energetic acting that everyone seems to get in on from Jonah Hill to Matthew McConaughey to newcomer Margot Robbie and even Shane from ""The Walking Dead."" Everyone pulls their weight and creates their own little moments of hilarity that add to the story. This movie was one of the funniest and most entertaining movies of the year. Scorsese really tries to portray every crazy scenario in the most over the top kind of way which just makes it even more unbelievable that this all actually happened.<br/><br/>Now let's look at the flaws of the film. First being it was overlong and a little drawn out at moments. It was like watching the extended version of something. The first two hours just shows Belfort's rise as a broker to his frequent spurts of drug inducing mind boggling shenanigans with his pals. This starts to wear on the audience because we have seen so much of it it starts to become redundant. Then there is the final third of the movie which shows the downfall of Belfort's empire. This changes from the formula of the first two hours because this is where most of the drama is present. The first hour is a blast because we are not quite ready for what will be thrown our way and it also comprises of the most memorable scenes.<br/><br/>In short ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a very funny, entertaining, eye opening, quotable, energetic, overlong, somewhat redundant escapade into high life excess filled with amazing performances. Also to note that this is NOT for kids. 8/10"

","West: The Wolf of Wall Street 9/10- Think of the best Leonardo DiCaprio movie you have ever seen, now multiply it by infinite and take it to the depths of forever. Now you have a glimpse at how this movie will play out. I have never seen a movie like this before, it is the most dynamic and energetic movie I have ever seen. <br/><br/>I do not understand why this movie did not get better reviews. Some people may have thought that it had no class and was vulgar with unnecessary language, but they should know that Martin Scorsese films have never just tried to be good while staying on the same line that all other movies do so that it is deemed acceptable to all. No, Scorsese sees that line and says the hell with you line, I will do what I want. He achieved greatness with this movie by doing so. <br/><br/>I guarantee that no one in this movie was playing themselves, but they fooled everyone. They could fool themselves to believing that they were these unpredictable, drug addicted stock brokers who broke every financial law in America. Leonardo DiCaprio is probably the one of the few actors in Hollywood right now who has been great in every movie he has been in. He just has the raw talent that is necessary to number one. He delivered the best performance of his magnificent career in this film playing the once legendary stockbroker Jordan Belfort. He delivered a perfect New York accent and the way he was able to show all of the different versions of the character he had was truly amazing. I have given this a lot of thought and I think this might be the best performance I have ever seen in the history of cinema. I honestly feel bad for Jonah Hill because he gave the best performance of his career as well but when you put him right next to Leo, Jonah Hill's performance looks like a first grade school play. Still, credit should be given to Jonah Hill because I firmly believe that only a few people could play this role as well as he did. Jonah's performance in The Wolf of Wall Street is a million times better than his performance in Moneyball. Aside from those two, who were really the only people who were in the movie consistently, the acting decent. I do not think that anyone else in the movie did a bad job, but when you have a three hour movie and someone is in there for twenty minutes such as Matthew McConaughey, it's just not memorable. McConaughey still did the absolute best he could with the screen time he was given. <br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street was not just some hard core drama biopic either. If you are a person, you will be nearly on the floor laughing throughout this whole film. Some jokes may cross the line for some people, in fact probably a lot of people, but if you anything about the real Jordan Belfort, this plot is an understatement. The one thing I will say though is that there are a couple of scenes that are not really useful to the plot or understanding the characters, but still, even The Godfather wasn't perfect. <br/><br/>I wish Leonardo DiCaprio would win an Oscar for this film like he deserves, but sadly the Academy probably will not give him one because it as I have said before, just crosses too many lines that some critics deem disrespectful. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, I believe that if you have a good sense of humor and are open-minded, I think this film will amaze you.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

It is a disgrace, and such things should never be put on the screen. It is the most disgusting mainstream film I have ever seen. (I'm sure there is much worse in the porno world, but I do not watch such rubbish.) People might say, 'but Scorsese is so clever and talented, and Leonardo diCaprio gives such a brilliant performance!' True, but no excuse. It doesn't matter how brilliant your performance is if it takes place in a pile of excrement like this. Can diCaprio ever wash the contamination off? I wonder. And it does not matter how clever you are as a director, if you direct something this disgusting, you deserve contempt for what you have done.

The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself"

","If you're looking for a great character who you can empathize with and whose values you want to mimic, this is NOT the movie for you. The story of Jordan Belfort is one that is told to show one path that takes you to the neo-American dream that is becoming so rich you don't know what to do with the money. As long as you can tolerate a good pro-villain (spectrally opposing the anti-hero) movie that subtly denounces everything the main character stands for, you'll enjoy the superb directing, acting, and props of this movie. Jonah Hill breaks out as a quasi-serious actor with the hilarity of his character's flaws. All around it sufficiently conveys the conundrum a person faces in society between getting ahead and facing morality. P.S. definitely do not see this with a parents nor should adults see this with their kids."

","I have not seen many Martin Scorcese movies in the past but this one just blew my mind away. The story of this movie is pretty interesting and will keep you hooked to the screen till the end. The movie is a bit long but I did not feel like I wanted the movie to end at all.<br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio delivers another amazing performance. He seems to make every movie he does look so good. Jonah Hill has also given another amazing performance after Moneyball. Margot Robbie has also shown some fine acting skills and might become a good actor in the future.<br/><br/>Thoroughly enjoyed this movie even with the abundance of foul language in the movie. Recommend everyone to watch this movie."

","This would have to be Scorsese's greatest film, thine far. This is a movie pinnacle of a legendary career of great films. It's all so perfect like a well oiled machine. Here in another Goodfellas, Casino like movie, this time, Leonardo, driving the narrative, in a fantastic portrayal of money hungry, stockbroker/crook Jordan Belfort, in sure fire Oscar Winner mode, we see him quickly ascend to wealth, thanks to the 19th October 87 Wall Street slump. He revamps a chop shop on Long Island, where he basically retrains the employers and installs confidence in them, where soon they're living a dream of excess wealth of oversupplous partying and sex. There's a gluttonous amount of sex in this too, let me warn you, not that I have a problem with that. It's great how Scorsese has made this three hour film and story exciting, throughout, with many great performances, second to Leo's, Jonah Hill, as Belfort's right hand man and best friend, Donnie, and hot and strikingly impressive Margot Robbie from Oz as DeCaprio's new and seductive wife, who causes Hill to sort of unload. Matthew McConaughey has a small an unforgettable role at the start as a Wall Street giant, he truly leaves his mark here, as he's been doing with many other performances nowadays. A much stacked on Jon Favreau is good too. The Wolf Of Wall Street is very funny too, two scenes, one a trademark scene with De Caprio, smooth talking, bribing two FBI men on his boat, the other has a staggering Leo, trying to make it back to his car, after swallowing a Qualude at the Country Club, where the second time recounting, making it home, is not just a surprise, but almost side splitting. Violence runs short, save for two scenes, and there's quite a bit of drug taking, with a few foolish acts at the end of em' as you'll see. Here's one of the best movies I've seen in years, it's frightening to imagine Scorsese bettering this film. There will also be a director's cut, an hour more of extended sex scenes. One can only imagine."
"InakiArias","8","2","6","21 January 2014"," Perfect in execution, but anything new.
","The Wolf of Wall Street can be considered a flawless movie but I left the cinema with a bittersweet sensation.<br/><br/>Lets start with the positive points: Firstly, the direction is outstanding. Scorsese at his best, he can manage the pace of the film to the extreme of not being a bit boring despite of the 3 hours of duration. Every shot, every scene has been done with extreme care and talent.<br/><br/>Secondly, the main star, Leonardo Di Caprio's acting is stunning, absolutely Oscar worthy. Marlon Brando would be proud of his successor. The rest of the cast is great but, in my opinion, not amazing. Jonah Hill is not Joe Pesci, for example.<br/><br/>Finally, production values. The target of this film was to show a luxurious, glamorous and excessive lifestyle of some new (very) rich men and I can swear that this film succeed in that.<br/><br/>Following with the negative points I will start remarking that I feel I'm being a bit unfair. If this film was been made by another director I wouldn't give such importance, but this is a Scorsese's movie and a serious contestant for the best movie's award.<br/><br/>The main flaw of The Wolf of Wall Street is, in my opinion, that the plot is good, sometimes brilliant, but anything special. It lacks of deepness and capacity of surprise. And the storytelling is quite conventional.<br/><br/>I recognize the enormous effort of Scorsese in the way of how he tries to represent the cruelty of the extreme ambition and excesses of Jordan Belfort and his comrades and the visually magnificent representation of the effects of drugs. The ambiguous morality of the film is well received too.<br/><br/>The problem is that there are already a lot of movies that manage both Wall Street and drugs stories in a better way that this movie does.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a technically perfect movie, worthy of watching in cinemas and in the level of Scorsese's last films (which is not a bad thing) but it's sad to say that it seems we can't expect anything from our beloved director worthy of surpassing (or even matching) hits like Raging Bull or Taxi Driver."
"maurice_yacowar","9","2","6","21 January 2014"," Crime pays on Wall Street
","There's a reason Martin Scorsese made The Wolf of Wall Street so similar to his Goodfellas. In both a young man is seduced by the allure of ill-gotten wealth and the power, sex and glamour it provides. In both the man tells his story in candid voice-over. Both build to a manic drug-propelled climax. Both heroes turn rat to save themselves and enjoy a second life, though Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) fares better than Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) did. As the heroes are propelled by cocaine the narrative is driven by a pulsing rock score, though here Scorsese leans more on lesser known tunes and covers. Both films expose the amoral conventions and dishonesty of a tight subculture. And that's the point. Scorsese implies the American stock brokerage and banking world are now what the Mafia was in the 1990s. It's hard to disagree.<br/><br/>When Belfort avows ""There's no nobility in poverty"" he doesn't acknowledge the sordidness of the alternative he chose. ""Stratton Oakmont is America,"" Belfort trumpets, which flatters neither. The opening commercial for his crooked penny stock brokerage revives the lion from the old Dreyfus commercial, but in this jungle leonine Leo is a base wolf not a regal lion.<br/><br/>The film manages to pull a lot of comedy out of its bitter view of American commerce. The more addled Belfort and partner Donnie get, from booze, coke and power, the funnier their stupidity gets. That such fumble bunnies can fare so well only emphasizes the weakness of the government's protection of its innocent, exploited investors. The honcho who at 26 made almost a million a week gets off with a 22-month sentence and a fine. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com."

","Terence Winters. Martin Scorsese. Leonardo Di Caprio.<br/><br/>The trio made pretty much of what The Wolf of Wall Street is all about. Belfort penned it, Terence adopted, Scorsese gave his splendid vision to the book and well all of it and everything else wouldn't make a crumb of a difference, had it not been DiCaprio to act with such an ease yet be marvelous at it. His acting and presence on celluloid took it to an entire different level altogether.<br/><br/>The movie is about a twisted robin hood, a tale which explores a swindled slice of life, its about a penny stockbroker who raised from nowhere and became an iconic figure for those who believed in him and themselves. He made a conglomerate where no one had a past from the same industry but yet were unanimous on the same platform. But as its said that when everything falls your way..you are in the wrong lane, and as every success has the failure standing at the door waiting for that one moment where you leave the doors open, Jordan Belfort was no exception. He falls, and falls hard.. so much so that he has to serve 36 months in prison..and with that, everything changes. Though I believe that this dwindle of Jordan Belfort could have been at least postponed (if not stopped), had he not been a doctrinaire which unfortunately he was that eventually led him to his own fall.<br/><br/>The story covers almost all the aspects of the book (as I read it before going for the movie), and is well driven by Terence Winters (screenplay) as the length could have been a drawback but well, it just comes at your face the very minute and finds a place in your bones as the time passes by. Martin Scorsese provides humongous efforts to keep the plot alive and is outstandingly successful in doing so, along with which, you can always see his trademarks in the movie like the lead facing internal and personal problems (mostly marital concerns).<br/><br/>I've always been a Scorsese fan, this was indeed not Scorsese cinema, nor was Shutter Island but well..as long as you get the dose and you like it..that's what really matters at the end of the day. And I totally enjoyed it as I'm myself a sales person and all my life, I've believed that sales is all about conversation and convincing, but this flick taught me an echt definition of sales. All hails to the trio. And I hope it bags at least 3 Oscars out of its 5 nominations this year.<br/><br/>I'd rate this astonishing comic sensation of the year as 9/10."

","In the 90s, Jordan Belfort started brokerage firm Stratford-Oakmont. His company quickly grew from a staff of 20 to more than 250, and their status in the trading community and Wall Street grows and grows. <br/><br/>As their status grows, so does the amount of substances they abuse, and so do their lies. They draw attention, throwing huge parties for their staff when they hit the jackpot on high trades. <br/><br/>With the FBI onto Belfort's schemes, he devises new ways to cover his tracks and make his fortune grow. He comes up with a scheme to stash their cash in Europe. With the FBI watching him, how long will He be able to maintain his luxurious lifestyle......<br/><br/>At three hours, the film is long. Scorcese could have trimmed some of the debauchery and made it into a 150 minute masterpiece. But while it's too long, it's never boring, and its one of the most likable films about someone you really would never associate with ever made.<br/><br/>Dicaprio puts in his best performance as Belfort, and makes him as sleazy and as hate worthy as you would expect. His every act selfish, and very grandiose. Scorcese uses the camera to wonderful effect, using different medium whenever the cast are under the influence.<br/><br/>The narrative structure is fundamentally the same as Goodfellas, and Dicaprios narrative keeps the flow of the story fast paced, again despite the lengthy duration. Its hilarious in spades and Hill is wonderful too, you really hate his character by the end of the film, he's that good.<br/><br/>My only other gripe is the way the women in this are depicted. They are either objects of desire, woefully mistreated, or they have their head shaved.<br/><br/>Scorcese has made another brilliant film about excess, and featuring a highly unlikable character, but for some reason, you are compelled to his character."

","Well I had an open mind when I went to see ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" after such praise and ratings for this film/movie by the media etc. Yes it was a long film but this wasn't the issue for me, it was the main character Jordan Belfort played by Leonardo DiCaprio. In previous box office hits by Martin Scorsese you become involved in characters who are by no means pleasant but one becomes attached to the characters in some way which helps keep it buzzing along. There's only so much interest and intrigue one can have for a drugged up criminal with no real care but his own self importance in a movie that lasts this long. To sum this one up for me, it's worth watching for a finely directed and casted story of a unpleasant/unlikeable stockbroker with many LOL's moments. 7.5"
"raoulderooij","8","2","6","11 January 2014"," Good satire, excellent performance, good directing, but not for everyone.
","What is satire? Depends on who you ask, but to me it means enlarging or exaggerating certain aspects of something serious until it becomes hilarious. If perhaps in a dark way.<br/><br/>I did not want to see this movie at first. I feared it would be one hour of hedonism and debauchery of an essentially loathsome character, followed by his inevitable downfall. I was wrong. It was two hours of hedonism and debauchery. But to my surprise Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio used that to tell a darkly comical story. True satire in my book.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite simple: the rise and fall of New York Stockbroker Jordan Belfort, whose unethical business practices and excessive lifestyle make him a shooting star on Wallstreet; rising high, burning bright, until he falls down to earth, burnt-out.<br/><br/>One high-point of the movie is without a doubt DiCaprio's performance of Jordan Belfort, who gave him aspects of a hedonist, shady 'used cars dealer' and an obsessive and unstable cult leader. This was not a subtle performance, which in other movies would surely be considered overacting. But for a character who is continuously high on success or drugs, it works fine. I cannot help but wonder if Mr. DiCaprio's furious acting gave him the same rush the real Jordan Belfort must have felt while closing a deal.<br/><br/>Moreover, when the scene required it, DiCaprio's acting gave a dark but subtle undertone to very extrovert performances. In other movies, a scene where the criminal throws away a year's salary to gloat and mock the visiting FBI agents would highlight just how loathsome he is. Here it conveyed the increasing dread and desperation in Belfort.<br/><br/>Other performances were very good as well. Jonah Hill is an actor I mostly associate with rather wacky characters and the role of Donnie Azoff, Belfort's even more unstable friend and partner fits him like a glove. Kyle Chandler fulfilled the role of Agent Denham well. Though his screen time was somewhat limited, his performance in the scenes with DiCaprio was not lacking, giving the character the introversion, integrity and stability one would expect of Belfort's complete opposite.<br/><br/>That said, most of the other characters are not that interesting, mostly there just give Belfort someone to interact with and display his character and thoughts that that moment. As such, his inner circle of employees, while generally funny characters and sometimes even plot-relevant, are rather flat and mostly resemble obsessive cult followers (even more so for in regards to the rest of Belfort's employees, seem to be screaming fanatics, though one can argue it is part of the satire). The one character who was different was Chester Ming (Kenneth Choi). Though less screen time than his colleagues, he stood out for seeming to be much more composed and level headed, but also more brutal. I would have thought he would further develop into some kind of loyal enforcer, but noting more came from it.<br/><br/>Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) fulfilled a role as one of Belfort's interaction partners as his wife and, as she took the brunt of Belfort's instability in the final scenes, arguably the most important one. Nevertheless, the character remained shallow at best (You met him while he was still married, Naomi. What did you think would happen?).<br/><br/>The other highpoint of the movie was the Directing. As I said, the debauchery in the movie was excessive, but did manage to cross the line of overly lustful into disturbingly comical. The movie contains scenes and dialog that are not in any way relevant to the plot, but on second glance seem remarkably appropriate to Belfort's mental state. This includes non-sequiturs (the dialog on midgets), breaking the fourth wall (Belfort, repeatedly), slapstick (the scene at the country club), unreliable narrator (Belfort's little ride in a very expensive car, twice!) and even outright surreal scenes (the 'Popeye' cartoon). It doesn't always work. For example, I just didn't understand the purpose of the shot of the exploding plane (but than again, the character said I wouldn't believe it...).<br/><br/>In all, this movie was a very pleasant surprise. On the story alone I would give this movie a 6, but DiCaprio's performance and Scorsese's directing each lift it to a higher plane, coming to comfortable 8.<br/><br/>Still, this movie is not for everyone. The hedonism is very explicit, just short of pornographic. Substance abuse is abundant, and not portrayed as a bad thing in itself (though the movie loves to mock those who do not know when they should temper their impulses). Moreover, Belfort's character is essentially loathsome, preying on the vulnerable (and even the poor) to maintain his lifestyle, and one can argue if karma ever truly catches up with him. This is not a movie for those with sensitive morals.<br/><br/>This movie does not convey that greed is bad. But it does show that one cannot gorge oneself indefinitely without bursting apart."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","6","10 January 2014"," A Crazy Riot from Start to Finish.
","I won't deny that I had no expectations at all from The Wolf of Wall Street. Martin Scorsese's films rarely work for me & the trailer for this one made it look like a cinema about party, sex & drugs on loop for 3 long hours. And The Wolf of Wall Street was exactly that. Booze, party, sex & drugs on loop for 3 hours and yet, I ended up really enjoying it & the biggest plus, never got bored for even a second, something that rarely happens when I'm watching this director's works. But this biopic of the infamous stockbroker Jordan Belfort has a lot of energy & madness written over it & is a crazy riot from start to finish.<br/><br/>Although a biopic, The Wolf of Wall Street is actually a film about excess. Excess of everything; be it drugs, money or women. It's vulgar. It's loud. It's dirty. It's funny. Actually, calling it funny doesn't do real justice because it's downright hilarious. And it's extremely entertaining. There is so much in the film that could've gone terribly wrong & would've turned it into a complete disaster but Scorsese's assured direction has masterfully rescued this overdosed cinema from passing out completely. And if Scorsese's direction is brilliant, then the lead performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as the stock market maniac, Jordan Belfort, is absolutely show-stealing & one of the best performances of the year plus he is exuberantly supported by Jonah Hill who makes an impression of his own as Donnie; Belfort's sidekick.<br/><br/>I think there is also a need to stress that this isn't a film that'll work for everyone. It never takes itself seriously and in a way, that's both a plus & minus for this film. What is going to work for one probably won't for another & what you want to watch in it is the criteria which will decide whether you'll love it or hate it. On an overall scale, thanks to Scorsese's stylish direction, hilarious script, clever use of music & insane performances by the cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on dope but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes and, despite all the bullshit that this cinema is full of, it still finishes as one of the finest & most entertaining films of 2013.<br/><br/>Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"

","I give it a 6. Mainly for the entertainment value. Martin Scorsese does have a knack for good quotes and some interesting dialog, he also pushes his characters into climaxes we may not see in other movies, I like this. But overall, the story was week and did not develop very deeply. I do believe the cast was right for this movie and Leo did a good job. He is really looking and sounding like a younger Jack Nicholson in some of this movie. The cinematography was the biggest disappointment for me. I am very much into lighting and shot design when it comes to the big screen and though there we a few shots that were good, most of it seemed like a repeat of other movies, nothing new and mesmerizing."

It's difficult to empathy or understand the situation in this way. Sometimes dialogs lack of interest.

Jordan's descend into madness, greed and addiction is shown in a hilarious way, without however overromantisising his hideous lifestyle as many claim, since his actions have direct consequences, and ultimately lead to his downfall.

","It's in many ways a very good piece of film and art. But in context of real life the movie really misses its mark. It's clearly supposed to tell the ultimate cocaine repleted American tale that turns into a nightmare. It does a good job on the first part. It never shows us the nightmare.<br/><br/>A large portion of the audience will come out of this movie with a new hero and role model. I'm talking about the villain Jordan Belfort. The guy who swindled thousands of people and came off easy because he ratted on his friends.
But the tone of the first portion of the story is far too positive. So positive that it becomes offensive. And the second part, well there's barely any negativity. The tone barely drops. It's all just a humoristic capitalist adventure with a bunch of happy bros living the dream with their drugs and hookers. And while Scorsese tries to salvage it all by putting on a nice vague little bowtie of critique towards capitalism at the end, it's too little and too late. The damage is done. This film has already inspired an entire new generation of misogynistic capitalist pigs."

"ArmenPandolaITSJUSTAMOVIECOM","5","1","2","22 April 2019"," RATHER SING WITH THE SINNERS
","The story Martin Scorsese tells in The Wolf of Wall Street is classic Americana: a social climber, Jordan Belfort, strikes it rich by taking H. L. Mencken's advice, ""Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people.""<br/><br/>Belfort gets rich by selling penny stocks to people who don't know any better, then gets ever richer by selling them to people who should know better, but as they say on Wall Street, ""You can't make money investing in what you should.""<br/><br/>And making money is the name of the game and it's the only game ion town. Here's to you, unscrupulous scumbags!<br/><br/>Wolf is all about excess. Cocaine by the pound snorted, quaaludes by the carton popped, prostitutes by the score banged, Cristal by the case spilled, money in the millions squandered, and scenes of indescribable decadence are all part of the Scorsese palate in creating Wolf. And it's almost three hours long.<br/><br/>Shortly after it was released, the daughter of one of the con men depicted in the movie wrote an open letter to Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, telling them what scum they are for making a movie that praises the lifestyle of people who have destroyed lives with no more thought than killing a bug. She tells them that she is officially turning over to them the shame she has felt for years at being this guy's daughter.<br/><br/>Actually Scorsese and his writer, Terence Winter, just depict - and not necessarily praise - the lives of these lowlifes; but showing lowlifes getting extremely rich while defrauding people and living the life of the rich and fatuous is as close to praise as you can get in this country.<br/><br/>Who's the hero?<br/><br/>The problem of portraying evil without making it look appealing dates back to the the birth of western literature. No less a writer than John Milton struggled with the problem in his magnum opus, Paradise Lost. All the critics agree that the most interesting character in Milton's tale of good versus evil is, well, evil, as personified by the mother of all evildoers, the devil himself, Lucifer. Everybody prefers Mr. Hyde to Dr. Jekyll.<br/><br/>The history of the movies is studded with blockbuster hits about bad guys whose lives are full of violence, greed, addiction, and that fourth horseman of modern depravity, casual sex. The problem is that from Valentino's Sheik - he kidnaps the woman he wants - to Jordan Belfort, movies make heroes of the bad guys they portray.<br/><br/>And no matter how hard a filmmaker tries to show us how bad a guy is, audiences love them.<br/><br/>Take The Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola shows the transformation of Michael Corleone from a WWII hero who wants nothing to do with the family business of crime and punishment to the most ruthless mafia don in America. I saw the movie shortly after it came out at the long-gone Fox movie palace on 16th and Market in Philadelphia. The culminating scene in the movie is a now-classic montage: Michael acts as the godfather to his nephew (whose father he soon will have garroted), renouncing the devil. This scene is cut together with scenes where Michael's henchmen murder his rivals. As each mafia don was brutally wiped out, a cheer went up in the theater. The audience was applauding Michael's bloody triumph.<br/><br/>Why, I wondered, was everyone applauding this murdering conniver?<br/><br/>The answer is simple - people love to watch bad guys be bad. Maybe it's because it provides an easy answer to why so many of us perceive our own lives as failed. If I had been willing to [murder, cheat, betray, steal], I would be rich and successful too. Of course, in the old Hollywood, all these bad guys ended up like their template, Lucifer, in hell. But finally Hollywood came to the conclusion that the American people can take the truth: greed is good.<br/><br/>What sets Wolf apart from the other classics that celebrate the bullies is the fact that Wolf is not a very good movie. For three hours, we watch a super-salesman hump, snort, cheat, hustle, and deceive his way to the top of the FBI Wall Street hit list. (By the way, the FBI's history of prosecuting Wall Street elites proves that its Wall Street hit list is a very short list, and you have to be really, really bad to get on it). In the end, the Wolf loses all the money he stole from others and ends up selling himself as a self-help guru. As the daughter who turned over her shame says, these guys always land on their feet.<br/><br/>Where do you draw the line?<br/><br/>So is a filmmaker or writer or artist promoting the evil he or she portrays?<br/><br/>Not necessarily, but how much sex do you need to show before you fall into the porno well? Is it just the fact that you're not showing the actor's penis that makes such depictions art and not porn? There is such a thing as violence porn. How about financial porn? In Wolf, greed is not only good, it's the reason for living.<br/><br/>So what is Scorsese trying to tell us? Our country has gone berserk by letting guys like this get away with financial butchery? Is this an ""only in America"" tale? Maybe. If so, Wolf fails because the idea that this movie is an indictment of the system is nowhere to be found in the movie itself. In the end, we have one more movie that is about all that the people who made it claim to hate.<br/><br/>At least at the end of The Godfather Michael is forced to lie to the one person in the world he loves, his wife. And by doing that, he destroys the one thing he claims to care about, his family. Jordan Belfort cares about no one and nothing. Even when he loses his family, his friends, and his money, he couldn't care less.<br/><br/>Frankly, neither could I."

"nicolechan916","7","1","2","16 April 2016"," Incredulous
","DiCaprio really embodied his character well, as he does with all his movies. He became Belfort so much so, that my friends and I were questioning if he was like that in real life. The rest of the cast too, did well in portraying their characters and displaying the kind of people who are in Wall Street. The chemistry they had with each other was good, and felt more like a club than a company. <br/><br/>The film is quite explicit and both promotes the American dream and depicts women as objects. Perhaps as this is a biopic, it actually did happen, but I felt it was not at all necessary for the show to have nude women in it. And many instances of it too. Plus, the amount of sex scenes and orgies showed is probably the most I've seen in any movie. It does add to the understanding of the characteristic of the environment, and of Belfort's character, but I'm not so sure if multiple and frequent depictions were necessary (this could have also shortened the length of the film). <br/><br/>Additionally, I was quite surprised to see the breaking of the fourth wall. It's intriguing to me that it did this so well. Apart from the first time it occurred, the other instances aren't as jarring, and managed to keep me invested in the story of the narrative. As well, it didn't feel awkward. This was perhaps because of the fast pace of the film. As in the Experimenter, the breaking of the fourth wall was very awkward and didn't feel right. <br/><br/>Overall, I'm not exactly sure how true this film is in depicting the actual life events of Jordan Belfort, but it definitely gave it a worthy try. The directing and editing is well done in establishing this fast-paced life of the Wall Street wolf, and the actors did a great job at portraying their characters. However, the film was about an hour too long, and had too much nudity. It also seemed to be slightly portraying this lifestyle as glamorous."
"hou-3","7","1","2","12 March 2016"," A good movie but far too long
","Nobody could deny that Leonardo Di Caprio turns in a fantastic performance in this movie. There are several standout scenes including his various speeches to his staff, the hilarious encounter with the FBI agents on his yacht, and above all the incredible gymnastics with the car at the country club. I found him absolutely credible as a man driven by - not exactly the pursuit of wealth, because he carries on long after he has more than enough - rather sheer energy, the need to be incessantly active, whether in making money or spending it.<br/><br/>And it's the spending of the money that drags the film down. What on earth persuaded Scorsese that we needed not just one or two drug-fuelled orgies but so many they couldn't be counted? The film could have lost an hour with no damage at all to its narrative arc or its exploration of human greed and white collar criminality. Ironically, the movie didn't take up on the opportunity to pursue the consequences for the duped of Di Caprio's fraudulent schemes. A very short scene on the NYC subway showed what was missed in that regard. Instead we had the constant pounding of the stock selling, the drug taking, the crazy behaviour. <br/><br/>In some ways a remarkable film which took the time to explain how the scheme worked but alas not to illustrate the damage it inflicted on the victims. It might have been Scorsese's masterpiece."
"jammasta-1","7","1","2","19 November 2015"," Highly entertaining flick about a bunch of a-holes
","This is one of those Marmite things - a well-made, entertaining film that may still leave you feeling that you've just been conned out of your money. It follows the general pattern of Scorsese' ""Goodfellas"": we are invited to a vivisection of the twisted life-story of a thug, with all the accompanying over-the-top theatrics. Here, however, instead of ruthless perversions of a life of killing and crime, we get a life of coke, Quaalude, and sex. The pace is often unbearable, but well suited to the story being told. Which still doesn't change the fact that the film ultimately glorifies the oneupmanship of a petty thief without really batting an eye. As far as the artistic value is concerned, this is a notch or two below ""Goodfellas."" You can probably make the same movie yourself if you patiently scroll through Dan Bilzerian's Instagram. There's very little room here for reflection, not only in a moral sense (which I don't care much about), but also in the sense of the development of characters. DiCaprio is well versed in this kind of fare and his acting doesn't really stand out. (In fact, Jonah Hill may be the stand-out performer.) At times, this gets really depressing, as when Matthew McConaghuey easily upstages Leo during the briefest of cameos. Or when Rob Reiner basically embodies the generational (and ethical) difference between the con-men of the 80's and the wheeler-dealers of the 70's. This is also why the film can still satisfy. Other than the pure showiness and shallow theatrics, it does include some fine acting and writing. The rest is well summed up by that YT video of all instances of the f-word in the film."

","This film kept lurking in my head for a while, but not because I was taken by it. I just kept wondering why I got so bored. Even though DiCaprio performs very well (as usual) and there were nicely put comic notes, it just didn't capture me very much. Only the final parts were slightly more engaging. I now know why; the entire story as well as pretty much every character stayed flat and superficial. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing insightful, nothing unexpected, no shock, cringe or excitement. However, the part when Jordan (temporarily) changes his ways has an element of surprise; that is because you get no clue on how he did that (or even why, other than his realisation that he's been found out), what process that was and what part anyone around him played in it. Wasn't interesting maybe because of the lack of drugs and hookers?<br/><br/>It does depict empty sales pretty well, you could say. Sales that is only about making people give you their money without exchanging anything valuable for them, with no consideration for the long term relationship or consequences. Some still think that is what good sales is about; it is not. That is just criminal. You might argue that someone like Jordan Belfort is indeed that flat and superficial, but I have a hard time believing that. I suspect as a psychopath, that is just the picture Belfort prefers to sell. There was one character slightly more intriguing, in the beginning, and that was Mark Hanna, probably because he was played so well by Matthew McCounaghy."

And not only that but people recognize him immediately and this presence scream NEPOTISM and just as nepotism ruins governments, it ruins creative projects and just about any operation. He's not an awful actor, but it's just so unnecessary unless he's offering to work for free. Leonardo DiCaprio is pretty good in this film, but again, it's just Leo again. Just like Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise, they are just the same person in every film sort of doing an acting school level of method acting. I think the film could have done really well if Martin Scorsese took a note from Richard Kelly and directed it in the style of Donnie Darko. In fact, why didn't Richard Kelly just direct this film? Why does Hollywood insist on being so small and having lunch with its buddies and bros and not inviting others to the party? It's to its own demise. This version of Wall Street greed is humor-ized and glamorized more than it is made into a twisted drama and that's the mistake, that's the old fashioned played out Martin Scorsese-style. Anyway - missed the mark in a big way because the family refused to accept in new members. Bye!"

","Wolf of Wall street was not only easily one of the best films of the year but an accomplish in cinema also. Here's why. Leonardo Dicaprio, one of the most underrated actor in our generation fails yet again to win an Oscar who happens to deliver one of the strongest performances in his entire career. Not once during this film the audience should consider recognising Dicaprio but his convincing character (Jordan Belfort). His performance was intense and impacting, along with Jonah hills improving attempts. The direction of this film was memorising frame buy frame, not one scene was lazy or tedious despite its outrageous runtime, the film successfully sustains focus and confidence. The editing was extraordinary and the films script holds pure brilliance. The film explores the lives of beyond rich stock brokers in wall street during the 80's and their consequences when their obsessions get out of hand this films plot is limited but surprisingly intriguing. Now because this film is directed so magnificently well, I had literally transported myself into the skin of Jordan Belfort and when the film had ended I returned back to my average home feeling the need to blend into the environment of not being rich. The only down side was there were a few unresolved sub plots and not enough character development for the side characters, which made me feel that Jordan Belfort was the absolute centre of attention which is fine but this resulted into the other characters to look like they're worth jack sh*t."

"thedriver829","9","1","2","22 November 2014"," Human Depravity In Its Most Delightful Form
","So many have been quick to label this movie as a glorification of reckless behavior. Critics claim that the movie has a moral ambiguity, and that it actually promotes the sex, drug abuse, and debauchery it shows on screen. And I can certainly see why one might say that: The Wolf Of Wall Street is a graphic movie. It has probably the most graphic depiction of drug abuse I've seen on screen, as well as sex scenes that are almost to a pornographic level and f-bombs which never seem to stop. However, watching The Wolf of Wall Street, I felt more like the movie was a commentary on people and how greedy and depraved we are. It's one of the reasons I love this movie, not to mention the fact that it's a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted film.<br/><br/>We all know how great of an actor Leonardo DiCaprio is, and he's definitely progressed more and more with each movie he is in. But with this movie he gives his absolute best performance to date, giving his 110% to every seen, whether he is calm and collective or he's spazzing out and screaming at the top of his lungs. You can feel how much he took over the character. Jonah Hill also takes a dramatic turn from what we're usually used to seeing him as. He's still his funny self, but man the guy really can act! Matthew McConaughey, while not in the movie much, makes a memorable appearance earlier on in the film.<br/><br/>All of the other actors do a really good job, and that largely has to do with the script by Terrence Winter (""Sopranos""). This is easily the best written movie of 2013, and while one could certainly detract it for its 500+ f-bombs, it has some of the best and most memorable lines to come out of a movie this year.<br/><br/>And of course we can't forget to give Martin Scorsese his due. We all know he's a talented director. He's made classics, and this could easily become of his classics. This could easily fit in with something like Goodfellas and Casino, and is very similar in content and in style. It fits perfectly with all of his filmography.<br/><br/>I also have to give props to the editing and the visual effects team. The editing and cinematography looks incredible, as it always is with Scorsese and how he puts his movies together. But I was really surprised when I found out how much of this movie was actually CGI. There are a lot of locations and sections that we see in the movie that are completely computer-generated, and you don't even realize it. So props to the team in charge of that.<br/><br/>In the end, The Wolf Of Wall Street may be graphic, sometimes almost to a fault, but ultimately does a great job at depicting this real life event as well being another welcome addition to the Scorsese catalog. My only complaint is that it may have run a little too long at times, but there's nothing in here that needs to be taken out in order to make a much better film, and it's already fantastic the way it is. So if you like Scorsese and don't mind a lot of sex, drugs, and swearing, pick this one up."
"BlueFairyBlog","9","1","2","19 November 2014"," The Wolf Eats Well
","The greatest thing about this addictive, chaotic, machismo piece of beefcake movie magic, would have to be Scorsese's ability to slow down where it hurts, and show big moments in really long scenes. The life of Jordan Belfort is portrayed as a mélange of orgies, parties, business dealings, extortion, pure crime, and unabashed and unapologetic decadence. Even from the start of the film Belfort is unapologetic, which may be the true theme of the entire film. Though he feels neglectful of his family, irresponsible in his business dealings, and drug addled to the point of insanity, in the end he really feels unapologetic. Having a character like this is refreshing, since we haven't seen this level of criminality since Gordon Gekko. Not only is Belfort uncaring, but he traverses in a world of richness and depravity that we couldn't even handle. Scorsese takes his time, and creates big, beautiful set pieces, that take a lot of time and explain very little in terms of plot. These scenes are amazingly intricate and are some of the most memorable moments of the film. The entire sequence when Belfort (DiCaprio) is on lemons and has to make it home from the country club, could have been trimmed, but because Scorsese let it go on and on we got to appreciate the level of helplessness Belfort was going through. We saw his immaturity, his guilt, and his horror at the state of his life, and that can't be replicated in any one line of dialogue. The scene where they're speaking about the contract with the dwarfs and how they should have been treated, could have been cut easily, but it shows how Belfort and his associates treated those they could buy, and led to one of the funniest moments in the film. This film is downright hilarious at many points, especially when dealing in character development. Jonah Hill deserved that Best Supporting Oscar nomination, because he not only handles diverse moments of dramatic tension, but he's laugh out loud hilarious. Donnie Azoff could not have been played by a funnier person, or a better actor, and every time he's on screen it's another chance for us to see just how removed from reality these people really are. There's also a level of opulent violence that shifts underneath the surface that we don't always see, but we know it's there. While movies like ""Scarface"" put the prospect of violence in the forefront of your mind, ""Wolf"" builds its tension over time, until characters erupt. While Belfort may not be violent towards his wife throughout most of the film, he is emotionally abusive and their fights are temperamental. It makes that much more sense when things become physical. There were some excellent performances from many of the cast, especially DiCaprio in the lead role. While many of DiCaprio's roles kind of blend together for me, this was a truly unique, unequivocal performance. Belfort's brazen love for business, and building himself up to the highest level possible, is his undoing time and time again. He can't walk away, even when he's offered an out, only because of his pride. Even today Belfort makes his money easily, with a level of persuasion that can only be portrayed by DiCaprio. Hill is enigmatic and perfectly crazed as Azoff, Margot Robbie is a delight in her role as Belfort's second wife Naomi, Matthew McConaughey is just the right level of kooky misanthrope as Belfort's mentor in the beginning, Rob Reiner is perfect as Mad Max Belfort, a man who is always angry and always influenced by his son's schemes, and Kyle Chandler is a surprisingly entertaining choice for the FBI agent who takes Belfort down, commanding his time on screen with a very complex and layered performance. This isn't exactly a love letter to the world of Wall Street, or even to the lives of the rich and famous. We as the audience don't want to see Belfort succeed or fail, we just want to see what he does next. Belfort's life is so chaotic and crazed that he seems unreal in such a huge sense. Between the legions of hookers, the drugs, the money, and the antics of his entire office, the film plays more like the exploits Caligula than the playboy world of a charlatan like Belfort. For many, they found no insight into the moral capacity of the character. Without morality critics decided that this was a hollow perspective intent on showing indulgence. I disagree heartily, and would argue that this is much more a character study than anything. There's solid humor to this film, there's a decent level of character development, and for what it's worth, there doesn't need to be a moral. Scorsese shows us that these men exist, and they are getting away with everything, to the point where they can brag about it. Scorsese doesn't want us aligning ourselves with the likes of Belfort, and he certainly isn't legitimizing the exploits of his company. He set out to make a ""ferocious"" film, and he did just that, creating a black comedy that shows what modern day indulgences look like, and how they are being employed by everyone and anyone who can get their hands on their version of the American Dream."
"brchthethird","8","1","2","14 November 2014"," Somewhat of a thematic retread, but Scorsese fires on all cylinders
","THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is insanely hyper-kinetic, wall-to-wall with sex and drug-taking, and the most energetic Scorsese has been since CASINO and GOODFELLAS. While this doesn't quite live up to those previous films, it is nevertheless quite entertaining. The story follows the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, who ran a brokerage firm, Stratton Oakmont, in the late 80's/early 90's. Along the way, he makes a ton of money and indulges his every whim, which was mostly a lot of drugs. A smaller part of the story is how he was taken down by the FBI, but the main draw is obviously Jordan. In his previous gangster/crime films, Scorsese provided the viewer with a window into how those criminal enterprises operate, and he does the same here with white collar crime. One thing which was extremely effective, yet detracts from the experience a little bit, was how Scorsese used cinematic technique and a frenetic editing style to convey the themes of excess, over-indulgence and greed. It makes logical sense that a film about a person like Jordan Belfort would be this stuffed, even if it does start to wear on the viewer after a while (as it certainly did me). Fortunately, there were some quieter moments, and scenes where a voice of reason could be heard, even if it was ultimately ignored. However, there should be something said about the end result. Unlike previous characters who were reduced to shells of their former selves, Jordan Belfort gets off fairly lightly. Sure, he goes to prison, but it's a cushy prison and he only has to serve a few years. Perhaps this is cynicism on Scorsese's part, and maybe it's emblematic of where our society has gone. Instead of the ultimately good-natured criminal who looks out for the interests of a family-like organization, we have greedy vultures who only look out for themselves, and by and large we let them take advantage of us in ways that are truly despicable. The film makes a point about not showing the victims of Jordan's crimes, but I didn't find this too disheartening. The movie is meant to revolve around Jordan and to give the viewer an experience which approaches what his life was like. Sure, parts of it are extremely funny, but underneath all of the humor lies a rather masochistic current. Excess will ruin you, and by the end of this you should feel disgusted at how people are treated (especially the women) and exhausted from the whirlwind ride you've just been taken on. Even though the film does become repetitive after a while, I wouldn't have wanted to be taken on this journey with anyone but Scorsese. It's not quite a masterpiece, or even top-tier Scorsese, but it's a film worth watching even if only once."

","This film had a lot of controversy surrounding it which in my opinion is the only reason that Leonardo Di Caprio wasn't a legit contender for the Oscar because this is a superb performance in a fantastic film. This film documents the life of Jordan Belford a silver tongued devil who runs wall street while getting tied into a lot of shady activities. Now as I said Di Caprio as Belford was fantastic he totally fit the role perfectly as when he is delivering speeches you are tied onto any word he says and it keeps you energised. This is his show and he absolutely kills it, with this being his best performance to date. The supporting cast is also really good with Jonah Hill being awesome throughout and adding a lot of great comedic timing, plus his and Di Caprio's chemistry is great as well. Also for the short amount of time he is in the film Matthew McConaughey is awesome and steals the show as Belford's mentor at the beginning of the film. The girl that is Di Caprio's love interest is a really good actor and did a really good job plus she is stunning to look at. The FBI agent in the film also does a good job but just like McConaughey wasn't really used a lot and I wish that was used a bit more. The story is excellent as we see the rise of this guy through Wall Street and it is awesome to see his lavish lifestyle grow as the movie progresses. This is also one of the best scripts ever as the dialogue is just so snappy and good also the monologue's by Di Caprio really add to the film and really carry the films. The style of the film is big and lavish and over the top but it works for the most part except when it just goes slightly overboard with the nudity, I mean I am fine with nudity I just think it sometimes goes too far with it. Overall the 3 hours fly by and it never slows down and I love this film."

","A former Wall Street broker realises that pumping junk (penny) stock is very lucrative and turns a small cottage industry into something a lot bigger. Soon crossing white lines even he can see.<br/><br/>I am generally a fan of Martin Scorsese to the point of often wanting to watch his movies more than once. Sometimes even owning. He has made some fantastic films giving some real depth and insight into off-beats, street people and criminals. There isn't a director working today who he hasn't educated. Indeed quality hard-edged TV shows like The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire are almost based on his templates, look and ideas.<br/><br/>(Can you imagine these shows even being made if he had died at birth?)<br/><br/>And yet, and yet, the man has a serious flaw: he struggles to be moral. On film at least. He seems on the side of the conman, the crook and the mafioso. The Joe Public who get crushed under their mighty wheels are of little interest to him. Comedy fodder. Police/law enforcement who stop them (or at least try) dull and low paid. Sometimes corrupt, inefficient and devious. At other times ignored completely or treated as last-reel extras.<br/><br/>Here he brings all his faults to the table and then some. Indeed almost seems to be underlining them. The FBI are full of subway riding drones in cheap brown suits and non matching ties.. Dry humoured nasty people who want to end the party (all bought with stolen money) early. There only advantage - over their quarry - being not risking sleeping six inches from a toilet seat.<br/><br/>Although few have noticed, this film has been shot before as ""Boiler Room."" A passable Vin Diesel number. So little has this film being seen that some scenes are almost copies of it! Indeed copies with a bit bigger budget. When you have the budget the camera can swoop and roll through a million extras - all acting their little socks off. Here everyone acts like they are on The Price is Right, even when they are work!<br/><br/>(Do the tits-out extras get extra pay? Hope so. Humiliation should come with compensation.) <br/><br/>Excess? I can spot it in small doses. It doesn't need to be repeated over and over again until I wonder if I have sat on the remote control and jumped back two chapters. Voice-over too. In case you have gone blind during the movie. It stops just short of flashing subtitles pointing out that what we are watching is immoral or illegal.<br/><br/>But wait and hold on, it does entertain and does make you laugh. Guilty laughs, but laughs (of the out-loud variety) are not common with me. A lot of it is probably true as well. Or true-ish. Clearly MS doesn't know how a helicopter is actually flown, so why not employ somebody who does? <br/><br/>DiCaprio is very good in the central role of Jordan Belfort. Best acting yet and let's be frank his face has been his fortune so far. Clearly over-the-top and silly at times, but some real acting wrinkles. It is not him on the stunts though, the double is too tall to be him and even in the ""daring"" sex scenes we never see candle wax on his back. Only that of the double.<br/><br/>I love Jonah Hill (Donnie in the the film). He is a brilliant comic actor. He just has it. Never afraid to make a fool of himself, he does a wonderful performance as best friend and co-conspirator. Not consistent though, stupid one minute smart the next. I wonder if he is going to go down the Jack Black route and get his own vehicles? Second wife Naomi (played by Aussie Margot Robbie) is hot in a Playboy way and seems appropriate for the role, but you don't like her character much. Just another spoilt mercenary happy to join the bandwagon without asking too many questions. Unlike his first (screen) wife. Whether Robbie is going on to anything else is open to question. Probably turn up in costume in one of those superhero movies they are always making. Has the build for it.<br/><br/>In the old 40's Warner Brothers days the film ended with the crook dead or in jail. Here there is another scene to underline the bit about Scorsese being basically immoral. And maybe so if the audience if the IMDb rating is correct. Maybe we are all going to hell laughing."

"golfer296","8","1","2","30 September 2014"," A film about Jordan Belfort's rise and fall.
","How can a movie that involves heavy drug use, intense use of explicit language, and full-frontal nudity be rated R by the MPAA? The first scene of The Wolf of Wall Street shows Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) snorting cocaine out of a hookers butt, receiving fellatio from his wife in his Ferrari, and naming a fistful of drugs that could ""sedate Manhattan, Long Island, and Queens for a month"" (The Wolf of Wall Street). This depiction of how to live is inaccurate and vulgar. Treating women as objects for sale, along with treating drugs as an accepted part of everyday life is wrong on so many levels. The Wolf of Wall Street should be rated NC-17 instead of R because of its obscene themes and graphic scenes.<br/><br/>The MPAA (Motion Pictures Association of America) defines an R-rated film as one that ""contains some adult material. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking their young children with them"" (mpaa.org). What is the definition of the word 'some'? Every scene either involves drugs, hookers, or swearing of some form. These are all themes that are not suitable for those who are not mature; this is a film only suited for adults. One reoccurring theme is the rampant use of explicit language. The word ""fuck"" was used a whopping 569 times, or just over three times a minute. This means that on average the f-bomb is being dropped every 20 seconds. This is an absurd amount of times to use a word that is frowned upon by society. In addition to this, the amount of prostitutes that are referenced in this movie is ludicrous. From the opening scene through the vast majority of the movie, these women are depicted as part of a normal routine. Belfort even comments on the fact that he ""fucks hookers five to six times a week"" (The Wolf of Wall Street). This idea that prostitution is something that can be done on an everyday basis, better yet even at all, is obscene on its own. One final theme that is revealed throughout the entire film is the amount of drug usage. According to Rodrigo Perez, ""the characters hoover up mountains and mountains of cocaine"" (Review: Martin Scorsese's Outrageous 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' Pushes The Boundaries Of R-Rated Depravity). Cocaine, Crack, and Quaaludes are the most common—all of which are now illegal, yet Belfort and Azoff (Jonah Hill) use them like they are harmless. Through all of these themes—swearing, hookers, and drugs—less mature audiences may believe that it is perfectly fine to engage in these actions because they saw it in a movie. Older audiences for the most part will be able to reason through what they see on the screen and know that it is morally wrong. <br/><br/>Another reason why The Wolf of Wall Street should be rated NC-17 is because of the graphic content in the film. One scene that is probably one of the most disturbing scenes of the movie is when Belfort is about to have sex with yet another hooker. The prostitute idea of getting intimate is pulling a lit candle out of Belfort's butt and letting the hot wax drip onto his back while he is screaming his safe word for her to stop. Those under the age of 18 may not be able to comprehend this scene. Another example of the graphic content of the film is when Belfort is explaining the three types of hookers. On the last type, or the penny stock type, shows one of the brokers having sex with one of the low level hookers while the other traders watch. This is borderline pornography, and not meant at all for people under the age of 18. The public sex does not end here either. There is another scene where the woman referred to as the ""office slut"" (The Wolf of Wall Street) is having sex with Azoff while giving Belfort fellatio. This scene is yet another example that some are too young to understand, reinforcing the fact that this film should be rated NC-17. <br/><br/>Therefore, how can a film with such obscene themes such as drugs, explicit language, and prostitutes, along with graphic scenes of employees having sex with cheap hookers and two executives humiliating the ""office slut"" be considered an R rated movie? This seems more along the lines of a NC-17 movie to say the least. People under the age of 18 may not be able to comprehend these mature themes that are expressed throughout the entire film. They may believe that because the characters in the movie were able to perform these actions without consequences that they can do the same, while that is not true. Because of the mature and adult aimed themes of The Wolf of Wall Street, the film should have a MPAA rating of NC-17 instead of R."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","2","15 September 2014"," Not bad, but Leo and Marty did better already
","The strongest reason why I would tell you to watch this movie is possibly that it is based on a true story, unless you really like DiCaprio as you will watch it anyway then. It's another Scorsese-DiCaprio biopic and in my opinion one of the weaker films from the two with ""Shutter Island"" still being my favorite. The writer here is Terence Winter. Winter and Scorsese already worked together on ""Boardwalk Empire"".<br/><br/>All in all, it is a decent movie. Di Caprio lets it all out, McConaughey (as Belfort's mentor) shines early on as a businessman who obviously takes no prisoners to make the winnings he wants and we see why he is having a career year and Kyle Chandler does a fine job as a cop where it's really hard to say if he is likable or not. Jonah Hill got his second Oscar nomination for this, a bit of a surprise as he had no precursor results. Also his performance just wasn't that great, even if he was probably better than in the film for which he received his first nod. The Academy really seems to dig him right now. Leo and Chandler going against each other was lots of fun. When we see Chandler's character sitting in the subway near the end as a reference to an earlier dialog, this is probably my favorite piece of writing. Meanwhile Belfort (Di Caprio) still lives off the fat of the land, despite being in jail.<br/><br/>I cannot give it a higher rating than 6 though as the topic and Belfort's life including the Margot Robbie storyline (she is not the kind of girl I have the hots for, but her acting wasn't particularly convincing either) just wasn't that interesting to me. The film, during its three hours, had hardly any moment that was really edge-of-seat stuff like other Scorsese-Di Caprio movies such as the aforementioned ""Shutter Island"", ""The Aviator"" or Scorsese's recent take on the history of cinema, ""Hugo"". It is basically a showpiece for Di Caprio's talent. The film is three hours about him and he shines in it, deserves the Oscar nomination, even if there were performances from 2013 I liked more, such as the eventual Academy Award winner. One scene I did not like that much is when he saved Jonah Hill's life. No, not because of that. I'm fairly certain things did not go the way they showed it here in reality when/if Belfort actually saved his partner's life. Too showy for my taste. A bit more subtlety would not have hurt. Then again, Belfort was not exactly a man known for subtlety I guess.<br/><br/>Scenes that I liked were early on when he makes a huge deal of money with his new company and how he protects Hill's character by letting him know that he carries a wire. We find out that Belfort was loyal to those who accompanied him on his road, at least in the business world, not so much when it comes to his love life.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a good movie with a strong lead performance and also offers an interesting insight into the world of finance, which may suffer from the fact that hardly any of the characters are likable, although that maybe is just the way it is in reality. For some careers you have to sell your own grandmother."

","(69%) The pairing of Scorsese and DiCaprio runs on, and is now as strong as the DeNiro partnership. This is the most full-on production of the duo yet, and is very likely to remain so for some time at least, although it must be said that it is not really that overly shocking. There is quite a bit of nudity and sex, but only prudish fools get upset about that, and the swearing becomes unnoticeable after the first five minutes, likewise the tons and tons of drugs filling the screen. DiCaprio is fantastic and this is worthy of a watch just for his performance alone, the brilliant scene of him crawling on the ground to get to his Lamborghini after one too many funny pills shows a more physical side of his talent which is not always shown. The run length is as excessive as Belfort himself as a good 25-30 mins could have easily made it into deleted scenes, but I never once got bored, just a little bit tired of it all after about two and a half hours in. It's also well worth a look simply to get an account of the devils pulling all the strings to the financial world, and at times the feeling that the FBI cannot get the handcuffs out quickly enough and put these guys away is very strong. One of Scorsese's good films, but not one of his best."

","Leonardo DiCaprio acts great in this movie, Jonah Hill, acts his usual self, trying to be funny, but ultimately failing. The cinematography is good, but a movie like this one was too quirky for its own good. Way over the top with every theme in the film. <br/><br/>Another issue I had with this film was the glamorization of, really, just a bad human being (Jordan Belfort). The consequences don't seem to effect the protagonist much, and really I can't root for a man that doesn't seem to be effected, and only cares about money. Scorsese also decided to add comedy an autobiographical crime movie. Which works sometimes, but really this story shouldn't be one of comedy, we shouldn't laugh at the things that happen to the characters, and think its all just a big joke. In particular there is a scene where Jonah Hill and Leo's character decide to take Quaaludes. A form of drug. What insues is, again, and over the top scene where Jonah Hill is choking, and pretty much jeopardizing the well being of Jordan Belfort. I didn't even smirk, cause I didn't know this scene was supposed to be funny. What in the world? This scene was supposed to be comedic? I don't know what Scorsese was thinking when he made this movie, but it fall short. <br/><br/>The movie did however have some quirky moments, and I will say it is entertaining to watch, and the acting is great from most of the cast, but this obsession with over the top moments, and unnecessary comedy parts makes this movie just decent. -6/10"

Knowing that this film is based on a true story makes it even better to watch, and you never tire of seeing what they will be up to next. One area where it fell short for me is that it never portrayed the darker side of the financial scandals behind the firm, and downplayed the present reality of the protagonists continuing debt and failure to make restitution. The movie tells a great story, with fantastic characters who you enjoy watching because 'you can't make this stuff up'. Scorcese re-creates the fun these guys were having as the firm fell into disrepute. Best viewed without judgment."

The story follows the life of our protagonist, excellently played by Leonardo Dicaprio as a hedonistic product of the underbelly of Wall Street. What follows is three hours of drugs, sex and non-stop mayhem.<br/><br/>The seriousness, the pathos, the intensity which could have been imparted into this film to help us connect with Jordan Belfort were all missing. As such this movie became a circus without a soul.<br/><br/>While these comments may sound harsh, i do not mean to say that there were no redeeming qualities to this experience.

"mark-durfor","7","1","2","1 February 2014"," Disturbingly Graphic Look into the Evil World of Wall Street
","The preview for The Wolf of Wall Street just barely gives you a glimpse into the seedy world of finance that is a breeding ground for complete and utter debauchery and total lack of self-control or inhibition. On Belfort's first day on Wall Street, he is taken to lunch by senior partner Mark Hannah (Matthew McConaughey) who snorts cocaine, drinks martinis and talks about sexual gratification openly with Belfort. Belfort innocently declines the drugs and booze and naively suggests that making money for their clients in the process of making money for themselves would be a good thing. Hannah quickly shuts down that idea and says it's only about making themselves rich. Within months, Belfort is in a strip club, doing enough daily drugs to sedate Manhattan, and drinking excessively. He is making so much money that he snorts a line of cocaine off his desk at work with a hundred dollar bill, crumples the bill and tosses it in a waste basket full of them. He comments that he made forty-nine million dollars last year and that upset him because he was three million shy of a million a week. He is constantly with different women, cheating on both of his wives. He is constantly cheating investors out of their money and training his staff to do the same. This film is graphic and disturbing. I laugh briefly but am quickly nauseated to remember that this actually happened, and probably still happens in the world of finance among those who care for nothing than to have more money than they know what to do with. I don't care to watch it again and it will not be making it into my personal collection. That's exactly what the movie aimed to do. It isn't glorifying this behavior. It's bringing it into the spotlight. It shows how dark and ugly riches can make people. And co-star Johah Hill understood that fully when he took on the role of Belfort's co-founder and best friend Donnie Azoff. ""It was understood going in that there was no holding back. Every day we were doing something crazy, and it's fun and exciting working for Scorsese, and then when I'd be driving home at the end of the day, I'd feel a wave of guilt come over me because I treated people so badly that day."" And Hill was just playing a role. Playing a character. Except these aren't just fictional characters in someone's mind like a psychopath in the mind of Stephen King. These people actually exist and they actually don't have those moments of guilt or remorse for the things they've done or to whom they were done. While the FBI was investigating Belfort and his company, none of his co-workers ratted on anyone, giving the FBI no information at all that could help with their investigation. They presented Belfort with enough evidence that suggested he could go to prison for 20 years to life if he refused to cooperate. In exchange, he would only serve 4 years. He agrees to wear a wire, but slides a note to Azoff alerting him to the fact they were being recorded. The FBI recovers the note and arrests Belfort with no more deals. However, once he tells them everything he knows, his sentence is reduced to a mere 3 years in a facility where he is seen playing tennis daily. Belfort went on to write a best-selling novel about his experience about which this movie was written, he had a guest appearance in the movie, and is currently giving salesmanship seminars. It's disturbing that our financial and our justice system allow and encourage this type of behavior while the hardest working people can barely get by. <br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey, Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio give amazing performances and effectively portray the slimiest dirt bags you could possibly imagine. To me, however, it's just sad that even in bringing about such evil to light, the performances and film themselves are rewarded with nominations for the best of the year. Maybe I'm just getting too old and maybe I'm just a prude, but this seems a bit like showing criminals on the news. Yes, it gets ratings, but it also gets them what they want: their moment of fame. In fact, the story of criminality continues for the real Jordan Belfort. He was paid $1.045 million dollars for the rights to his book. According to the government, only $21,000 of that went to repay his victims. In 2003, he was ordered to repay $110.4 million dollars to his victims. He has only paid back $11.6 million. Though it doesn't glorify the behaviors, The Wolf of Wall Street does still show that you can cheat people and make yourself filthy rich, if you don't mind the filthy part. And, even if you get caught, if you have enough money to start with, you'll still end up much better off than most people."
"Likes_Ninjas90","7","1","2","19 January 2014"," It's hard not to see the more outlandish behaviour that so much of the film dedicates itself to exposing as existing in a vacuum
","Amidst the Oscar buzz at this time of year, there is a different storm brewing over Martin Scorsese's biopic of Jordan Belfort, an American stockbroker from the 1980s, who spent just twenty-two months in prison for fraudulent activities. A member of the Academy Awards apparently lashed out at Scorsese, calling the film ""disgusting"" after it was screened for the awards voters because of the film's detailed look at Belfort's rampaging party life on Wall Street. A debate has now stirred as to whether the film condemns or glorifies the outrageous behaviour of Belfort and his collaborators of the Stratton Oakmont brokerage firm. In his fifth collaboration with Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort and is also a producer on the film. He has said that the film doesn't glorify its subject but that the director doesn't judge the characters either.<br/><br/>I'd hate to imagine the film if it was critical then. The film is foremost a comedy that uses humour to character assassinate Belfort and his company. It makes us laugh squarely at the ridiculousness of Belfort's appalling behaviour and the things that he and his friends say, like some career advice from Matthew McConaughey in a very funny early scene. Casting Jonah Hill (Superbad, Get him to the Greek) is also a deliberate match between an actor's traits and the script's comic aims. On top of the deadpan humour, there are purposely ugly, terrible images in the film involving drug use and mass sexual exploits openly conducted and celebrated in Belfort's firm. Scorsese makes an important distinction: these scenes aren't a fun ride or a romp. It's a corporate nightmare of mob mentality, misconduct, and the misogyny of the power crazed and money hungry. There are also some unforgettable scenes, notably a long, bizarre sequence of slapstick that intentionally seeks to characterise DiCaprio and Hill's characters not only as destructive but as dehumanised, wild animals. <br/><br/>However, one of the other major criticisms of the film has been that by focussing on Jordan's party life the film doesn't show the victims of his fraud exploits. This is a more valid complaint that underlines the film's paradox. By painting almost everyone in the film as shallow lowlifes, with no redeeming qualities and whose internal psychology stems no further than greed, the film's own ideological goals look simplistic. It aims to shock and succeeds. What else does it teach us though? The most interesting facet only touched upon in the long and well paced script by Terence Winter (Boardwalk Empire) is Jordan's persuasiveness and manipulation of ordinary people either over the phone or into a cult of figurative and literal chest beaters. But it's hard not to see the more outlandish behaviour that so much of the film dedicates itself to exposing as existing in a vacuum. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Scorsese and DiCaprio said they wanted to hold a mirror up to today's greed. Parallels between Belfort and the GFC are inevitable and broadly valid. Yet how many people on Wall Street today are receiving oral sex in a glass elevator with onlookers? <br/><br/>The use of comedy as the film's primary attacking weapon against Belfort makes the film very funny and brisk over its extensive running time (its three hours long), but I think it also robs the film of some its dramatic staying power. The most serious sequence in the film is also its most powerful and touches on an emotional level as opposed to a superfluous comedic one. Australian actress Margot Robbie (Neighbours) plays Jordon's second wife. Jordon slaps and punches her when he tries to leave their house with one of their kids. It is an upsetting scene and also more personal and shocking because we see the consequences of his destructive behaviour. It leaves an emotional imprint. Scenes like this also make it difficult not to admire the intense commitment DiCaprio brings to this daring role. There is more asked of him physically than anything he has done before but also times when it seems impossible for him to get any further under this creep's skin. We're left with some incredible moments of self-destruction, which the film insists are behaviours moving in revolutions. Yet we're also no closer to resolving a timeless question about how can we prevent these cycles of greed and self-interest. While no one can truly answer this, it makes us feel better to be at least a little more stimulated when in the company of people like Jordan Belfort."
"bobsgrock","Null","1","2","8 January 2014"," The Art of Addiction
","For whatever reason, Leonardo DiCaprio really wanted to play Jordan Belfort in a movie; so much so that he went into a bidding war against Brad Pitt's production company and won, though still having to wait several years before being able to convince his long-time counterpart Martin Scorsese to command the helm. Seeing these two names on the marquee certainly stirs the blood up in most people, given their track records both collectively and individually. Indeed, a mere five years removed from what is now becoming known as 'The Great Recession' allows for this material to continue to have relevance in our society. However, this would have been the case regardless because like Oliver Stone's Wall Street and Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story, Hollywood continues to reveal its infatuation with what is perhaps the most ruthless, notorious and powerful area in America.<br/><br/>Honestly, the plot itself is nothing too original. The rise and fall of the protagonist with plenty of drugs, prostitutes, scandal and outrageousness along the way. Scorsese and DiCaprio, as well as writer Terence Winter, knew this all along, even going so far as to mention Gordon Gekko and a few other well-known Wall Street figures. The unique element this film seems to present is its sheer unflinching portrayal of everything excessive and extravagant about this lifestyle, and the self-satisfaction afterward of mission accomplished.<br/><br/>Scorsese has never been a director to pull back and subtly craft his style; he is celebrated for the very reason of his viscerally lavish craft both visual and narrative. Having worked with him more and more, DiCaprio has carefully and steadily grown into perhaps the most fearless American actor today outside of maybe Daniel Day-Lewis. None of his other roles have required such out-of-control insanity, yet he handles it with the sure-fire steadiness of a true professional. Verging on the brink of camp, he always manages to stay right on course, keeping us interested in this character who narrates to the camera in a rather jovial manner of acceptance; he freely admits all his flaws and at times seems amazed at what he was capable of doing. In this film, Jordan Belfort loves the rush of addiction; he is willing to go to any length for any substance or satisfaction. Women, pills, cocaine, alcohol, yachts enormous enough to put a helicopter on top; all this is done with the smug satisfaction of a tested professional. In his own words, Belfort feels he ""can spend my clients' money better than they can."" <br/><br/>How did Belfort get to this level? Like most memoirs, he has a fall guy: Mark Hanna. Appearing for a mere ten minutes in this three hour marathon, Matthew McConaughey gives a performance that should demonstrate to audiences and executives that he is one of the finest American actors around. No more can we blame him for sappy, empty-headed romantic comedies and the strange satisfaction with constantly taking his shirt off. He has proved himself more than capable in movies like Mud and Dallas Buyers Club, although nothing quite prepared us for this. One scene, one speech to DiCaprio lays out how this film and, perhaps, the brokers themselves view Wall Street, America and the human race in general.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, this film continues to show Hollywood's fascination with the Wall Street broker lifestyle. Is this a cry for help or justification? After all, though they deal in a slightly different trade, it is even more well-known the excessiveness of movie stars and their circles. Maybe it's an affection between kindred spirits. Either way, it shows that once the powers that be begin to descend upon their happy existence, they soon turn upon the very culture and country which made all this possible. Certainly, one can see this and other films like it as an indictment of capitalism gone rogue; figures like Michael Moore will probably spin it that way. Yet, just like in his classic Mafia film Goodfellas, Scorsese prefers to look at people enjoying their addictions. Like his counterpart Henry Hill, Belfort narrates for us plenty of inside information to make us both desire and repulse this type of living. Of course, just desserts must be served. Yet, as many critics have surmised, there is an air of satisfaction from all these characters. Perhaps Belfort wrote his memoirs to prove to himself that he exceeded his own expectations of doing what he set out to do. This does not mean we have to admire him; we can only watch in abject astonishment at the possibilities America has to offer and the obstacles people are willing to scale for them."
"cinema_addict96","8","4","18","25 December 2013"," Graphic, Hysterical, and Masterfuly Directed!! Quite Possibly the Best film of 2013
","Though I wouldn't touch Hugo with a ten-foot pole ( just not my kind of movie), it seems like good-ole Marty has got his mojo back and with a vengeance. This film has all the Scorsese elements: drugs, violence, and greed, but in The Wolf of Wall Street they are jacked up on steroids. This movie was sooooo freaking graphic, and raw!!! Though such outrageous events transpire, they are all believable and usually hysterical. <br/><br/>2013 really hasn't been cinema's year. Not too many great movies have come out. So I was really looking forward to this film and my god; I was not disappointed. This movie had fantastic camera shots, amazing Scorsese style, beautifully edited, and acting left me speechless. I cannot praise the filmmaking of this movie enough. I wouldn't say Di Caprio's greatest performance, but it's in the the top 3.<br/><br/>I will say though, I wasn't expecting how graphic this movie was going to be. I don't mind sex scenes really, but this movie had some raunchy ones. Regardless I didn't really care because this film made me so invested in it and made me laugh my ass off.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this was a unique, and amazing movie that blew me away and made every second of the 3 hours worth it. I highly recommend it.<br/><br/><ul><li>Christian Sainz</li></ul>"
"space_base","10","3","12","18 January 2014"," The Best Picture of 2013
","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is Martin Scorsese at his most unrestrained. For a filmmaker no stranger to controversy, (and often condemned for his depictions of violence) it's really saying something that this is his most lurid picture to date. That may be too mild a statement. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is Jordan Belfort, a married, seemingly idyllic New York stockbroker who takes a job with an established Wall Street firm. By chance, he is noticed by his Boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey, in a memorable minor appearance) who takes him under his wing and advises him to adopt a steady lifestyle of sex and drugs in order to succeed. Not before long, ""Black Monday"" hits, leaving Jordan without a job and with little options. His wife pressures him into taking a job with a small Long Island firm who's penny stock dealings are of the shady variety. His aggressive knack for the scam amount him a fortune, and it's not long before he along with new found friend and all-around oddball Donnie (Jonah Hill) open their own firm ""Stratton Oakmont,"" ambitiously scamming their way to the top. This soon gets the attention of Forbes (who label Jordan The Wolf of Wall Street) and inevitably the FBI.<br/><br/>""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is completely outrageous, hilarious, perverse, vulgar, and brilliant. In it's three hours of (mostly) depravity, it gets away with things that R-rated films usually don't or wouldn't even try. But this is no mere waltz in exploitative muck. There's a method to this madness sure, but a point as well. It's an exquisitely naughty satire... a send up that is to corporate and systemic corruption what ""Taxi Driver"" is to suppressed rage in the face of a collapsing infrastructure. The dark comedy of Terence Winter's script effectively cutting just as deep as the rebel yell of Paul Schrader's opus.<br/><br/>Belfort is essentially a scumbag who embodies a lot of what's wrong with the western world (as does the film itself), but this degenerate provides the perfect vessel for what is arguably Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance. The guy's a marvel to watch. We should hate him, but we never do and attentively watch his unbelievable story unfold for 180 minutes. That's a credit to DiCaprio's endlessly likable presence and under-appreciated range. He balances the comedy, the dramatics, the intensity; commanding the screen in a way few could. Look to the already classic, as well as horrifyingly hilarious ""Quaaludes"" scene (THE scene of 2013) for definitive proof of his skill. Jonah Hill (surprisingly Oscar nominated for his role) is really strong here as is the pitch- perfect cast in it's entirely, including Margot Robbie, Jon Bernthal, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Jean Dujardin, and most notably Kyle Chandler who's federal agent Denham emerges as our moral compass through the sleaze.<br/><br/>""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" a remarkable directorial achievement, is above all else a masterpiece of pacing. This is a three-hour epic, but you'd never know as it flies by like a picture half it's length. The film maintains a sense of urgency so that even extended scenes are played snappy and breeze by. The film spits so much quick fire information that a mere bathroom break would throw a viewer so out of the loop that catching back up would feel impossible. It's marvelous to behold how Scorsese is able to stuff every frame with so much detail and never have it overwhelm or feel like graphic overkill. Like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" we are more than happy to soak all of this in. Despite the potentially off-putting motivations and actions of these characters, Scorsese captures glimpses of humanity while entertaining the hell out of us at the same time. <br/><br/>Comparisons made to ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" should not only be acknowledged but welcome. Those are two of Marty's very best films, and in time I have an inkling that ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" will be held in similarly high regard. <br/><br/>Now the hot button issue. Is ""Wolf"" a celebratory picture glorifying a culture of corporate thievery, rampant carnality, and hardcore drug use? Some might feel this way, but they have either been seduced by the events portrayed or have refused to read between the line... missing the entire point in the process. That's not the fault of the film or it's makers, but select audiences that consume entertainment at face value alone. <br/><br/>For it's incendiary screenplay, wicked sense of humor, on point performances, outstanding editing, and typically stellar direction from the master, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is frankly a phenomenal film that can't be ignored. It's the fastest three-hours in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>""The wolf of Wall Street"" is the best picture of 2013."
"PWNYCNY","10","3","12","14 January 2014"," A cinematic free-for-all with Mr. Di Caprio leading the way.
","What a wacky, goofy movie! This movie is a spoof on all the props that drive the United States on - capitalism, banks, stock brokers, family, friendship, religion. Nothing escapes the mockery of the director. It is as if the director was given a carte blanche to have his way and have his say with no holds barred. And in this movie, no holds are barred. It is a cinematic free-for-all, with Leonardo Di Caprio, in his greatest role, leading the pack. Di Caprio not only makes this movie happen, he IS the movie. His presence is so dominating that it is impossible to separate him from the movie and still have a movie. This is a case where the movie is both story driven and actor driven. True, the other members of the cast are wonderfully entertaining too, but they are support characters for the one star of the movie. Now, why is this movie so entertaining? Because it calls to attention and unmasks the phoniness of a system that purports to be the envy and role model for the world. It says to the audience, ""Behold, I am unclothed! Take me for what I am!"" Yet, the movie is not all goof; it also contains some disturbing scenes of a domestic nature which underscore the precarious and potentially violent nature of relationships. If one likes movies that take off the gloves and say it like it is, this the movie for you. If you don't like those kinds of movies, then watch it anyway; it may change your mind."

"igende","10","3","12","5 January 2014"," Pure entertainment.
","I love this movie, for me it's pure entertainment. It's Casino on Wall Street. Much of the behavior in the film is so funny the theater broke out in loud unison laughter multiple times. This could have been a cautionary tale, one for the wall street movement, but it's not really there. If you look at what this man did, how he led his life, and how unfair it is that he basically goes unpunished, there are so many ways to tell the story, however, here his life is almost really glorified, like in Casino, where the audience is involved in the fun of it all even though people in that film were ultimately being robbed, killed, cheated, abusing drugs etc, you were made to feel it was all somewhat funny. You enjoyed the characters and somewhat gave them a pass therefore it was fun, and OK. Same here, although DiCaprio narrates with guilt and disbelief in his speech to compensate for what is being portrayed as funny. There are a few scenes that remind us of how unfair the world is, especially the ending, where DiCaprio is sent to prison and he's playing tennis, while the FBI agent that got him convicted is shown taking the train home and looking around as the camera focuses in on the rest of the average joe's that have to schlep to work every day, exhausted making it day by day, no excess, no luxury, just life one day at a time, surviving. The impact of this is however lost in the contrast of all the fun, the sex, the drugs that don't seem to physically decimate anyone, the fun you just had watching these guys break all the rules. I love the move, it's pure entertainment, but be careful you could walk out of the theater saying gee i want to live a life like that. Instead of walking out saying what a horrific way to lead your life, possibly killing someone with a car, ruining your marriage, divorcing twice, having to rat on your friends, nearly dying in the ocean, spending time in jail, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol. That would be a different movie I think."

","One thing to say for sure is that TWoWS is NOT BORING ! It's 3 hours and literally you can't go to toilet because it keeps you on screen (I am taking my friends example this noon when she hold it for 1h 30 min), there is always an important scene after an important scene, which gives you the feeling at the end that the film wasn't 180 minutes. <br/><br/>Directing? Is Martin Scorsese, what do you expect? <br/><br/>Cinematography was actually pretty great, I liked the shots, I liked the colors, I actually liked all the job done there. <br/><br/>The fact that it is based on a book and above all it's a true story makes the script kind of special, because you sometimes during the film ask your self: ""Is this thing really a true story? Did Belfort really do that? Is he out of his mind?! "" , and that blows you off because you actually know it's true. There are many humor lines, in fact the whole film is a black comedy, which worked perfectly with these characters. I also like the fact there are some remarkable quotes. <br/><br/>Acting is very realistic, Leo , Jonah,Margot and others accompany true feelings. Leo does a great job at performing. He actually waited like 7 years to do the film (read the script) and that means he had time to prepare.<br/><br/>If a film is relatively fast, then there's good soundtrack also :)<br/><br/>If you wanna laugh, If you wanna see a crime, If you wanna see what greed can bring you (which in this case was drugs, not stable marriage, hookers, crime, jail, etc), if you wanna learn something new, a history or if you wanna see how a pen is sold , then go watch The Wolf of Wall Street because it's worth of time and money."

"bb_man94","10","3","12","28 December 2013"," Raunchy and enthralling; Wolf of Wall Street packs a solid punch
","This Review Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>Let me get right to the point here; Martin Scorsese's newest motion picture The Wolf of Wall Street is a thunderous roller-coaster of debauchery, corruption, capitalism, sex, and the emotional consequences of high-stake living; the tale of Jordan Belfort and his greed is not for everyone. DiCaprio rockets into the sky as Belfort, giving us a performance driven by intense passion and persuasion but also with a sense of unfathomable dishonesty and immorality. He is a character driven by success and the will to do wrong to others for his own gain; nothing will stand in his way when it comes to mountains of money and self indulgences. He is a sex fiend, a drug enthusiast, a bloated fabricator. He is a man you love to hate, and hate to love.<br/><br/>Before Belfort acquired his fortunes he was a lone stockbroker of Wall Street. He worked for Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) and became intrigued by the luxurious lifestyle he possessed. After losing his job on Black Monday, he makes acquaintance with a bumptious and mannerless parasite named Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) and together they open up Stratton Oakmont; a ruthless off the wall organization where you cannot hang up the phone until you have your clients by the neck and the money in your pockets. This insane practice grows until Stratton Oakmont becomes a billionaire organization and causes wrinkles for everyone involved. The money gets to everyone's heads. The FBI becomes curious, yet Belfort says he has nothing to hide. The worst is when wrongdoing devours Belfort and his addictive personality affects his wife and his child. There are some very intense and hard to watch scenes; such as when Belfort loses his temper after having one sided sex with his wife Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie.) He beats her, and in the heat of anger rips open a sofa cushion to find his stash of coke and snorts all of it at once. His wife threatens with divorce and custody of their child and in his drug infused frenzy he tries to kidnap his own daughter; but he doesn't make it far in his intoxicated state. <br/><br/>This is the kind of brash yet fierce filmmaking Scorsese is famous for; he gives us characters and situations that are shocking and hard to pull away from. Some may groan at the movie's lengthy three hour runtime, but while your twiddling at your thumbs and looking at your phone's clock, I'm going to be sitting down and watching a damn fine movie which is what The Wolf of Wall Street really is and nothing more.<br/><br/>from http://bbman94.wix.com/brandonsmoviecorner"
"samishoward","10","3","12","27 December 2013"," Absolutely Insane in the Best Possible Way
","The Wolf of Wall Street was absolutely insane in the best possible way. Words that describe this three hour movie experience: Outrageous. Wild. Crazy. Hilarious. Smart. Masterpiece.<br/><br/>I'm obsessed with Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. WOWS is reminiscent of that film-narratively and thematically-and in my opinion it exceeds even that masterpiece of filmmaking. Yes, WOWS is my new favorite Scorsese movie. Leonardo DiCaprio has said that with WOWS, Scorsese has inadvertently finished a film trilogy that began with Goodfellas and Casino. I agree; all three Scorsese films are told in the same manner and offer glimpses into seedy subcultures of American society. If you love Goodfellas and Casino, you'll love WOWS.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a genius performance as Jordan Belfort, the titular character, who makes a fortune through his self-made stocks company. Jordan narrates the story of his life, which is full of law- breaking, drug using, sex, and an ongoing FBI investigation into Jordan's illegal money making practices. Jonah Hill plays Donnie Azoff, Jordan's humorous and outlandish business partner. Margot Robbie gives a star-making performance as Jordan's second wife. Rounding out the cast are Rob Reiner, Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, Jon Favreau, Jean Dujardin, and Joanna Lumley. All the performances are stellar. There's never a dull moment and as the three hours sped by, I found myself laughing almost constantly. The editing is superb and fast-paced. Scorsese has created some truly memorable sequences.<br/><br/>I hope WOWS gets some love this awards season, because it's highly deserving of it. I found it to be far superior to The Departed, Scorsese's 2006 film that won Best Picture and Best Director at the Academy Awards. So, if there's any justice, WOWS will snag these awards as well. DiCaprio and Hill deserve to take home the gold for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. Whatever the results of awards season, WOWS will stand the test of time. It's a period piece that's extremely relevant and modern. It's sure to become a classic."

","Not to be confused with that 1929 film (LOL); I saw this awhile back off Netflix, and can't believe I forgot to review this, considering it was one of my fav. films of 2013???!!! I would call this ""Goodfellas"" meets ""Boiler Room""! <br/><br/>Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort(Leonardo DiCaprio), from his rise to a wealthy stock-broker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government. If you've ever seen the 2000 film ""Boiler Room"", the Tom Everett Scott character in that film was also based on Belfort. I heard he received $1 million for the sell of his work to be made into a movie- wow!, that is just so wrong-?? <br/><br/>As I was watching this, with DiCaprio's narration, and the pacing and music and everything, I couldn't help think of ""Goodfellas"" (of course, also directed by Martin Scorsese) - in fact, DiCaprio's voice almost sounded like he was intending for it to echo Ray Liotta's in that film-?? <br/><br/>And wow!- what an all-star cast??!- no less than Jonah Hill (who I heard wanted to be in this film so bad, accepted a $60,000 salary compared to Leo's $10 million! LOL), Kyle Chandler, Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal (TV's ""The Walking Dead""), Jon Favreau, Jean Dujardin (""The Artist""), Joanna Lumley, and Matthew McConaughey in a key role as Belfort's mentor. <br/><br/>And the running time- just under THREE hours!?? No matter, the film just flies by. I will say it is refreshing to see what is basically a comedy come in at that length. DiCaprio and Scorsese, who ten years ago I would've thought it was a joke comparing the actor/filmmaker duo to DeNiro/Scorsese; however, with this film being their fifth collaboration after the likes of ""Gangs of New York"", ""The Aviator"", ""The Departed"" and ""Shutter Island"", I will have no problem putting those two collabs in the same group..."

"anne07876","6","2","7","18 January 2014"," Mixed emotions
","Went to see this film in its opening week since I have friends in the stockbroking world. I gotta say - this is way over the top. This film is the very definition of the kind of debauchery that MALEkind can muster akin to going to Africa to shoot elephants for the fun of it, or starting a paedo ring just because they can. <br/><br/>Did there have to be nearly 3 hours of unleashed debauchery to get the message across? No. We got the idea from the opening scenes. So, basically, Scorsese turns us, the audience, into bystanders who witnessed misogyny, drug addicts, sex addicts and the heartless conning and exploitation of the working and middle classes because they are 'too dumb' to know any better. <br/><br/>On the other hand, (my intellect kicks in to protect me from all the disgust), it is a black comedy (I assure myself). This genre contains exaggerations, caricatures and highly unlikely situations, and exists to twist and turn out emotions in various directions. That it does!<br/><br/>No doubt, this film is riding on the current public's vilification of bankers and stockbrokers. But, I hate to burst everyone's stereotyped bubbled: it just isn't like that in the stockbroking world these days. It hasn't been like that for the vast majority. But then, maybe the film is a general statement about society's greed in general, and how it has gotten out of hand.....even in Hollywood. At one point, it entered my mind that maybe some of the scenes in this film were taken from the lifestyles of celebrities in Hollywood!<br/><br/>DiCaprio is VERY good in this film. Jonas Hill's character got on my nerves as the obligatory friend that gets DiCaprio into more degradation than he would otherwise. <br/><br/>DiCaprio deserves on Oscar for his role; he was amazing whether he was giving an impassioned speech or alone, writhing on the floor recovering from his latest drug stupor. Fantastic."
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","2","7","13 January 2014"," The American Dream gone wrong.
","The Wolf of Wall Street is one of those films that just isn't for everybody. It's loud, it's extravagant, it's insane and it's cocky. Oddly enough, the same can be said about filmmaker Martin Scorsese and leading man Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>You can't help but watch the nearly 3 hour long Wolf of Wall Street and not think that Scorsese is drawing a parallel to the escapades you see in the film. It's as if Scorsese is saying, ""I don't care if I'm 71- years-old, I've still got it and I'm going to prove it."" Marty pulls out every tool in his toolbox and dares the audience to take a ride with him, because there's not a goddamn thing anybody can do about it. Much like main character Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>For those that don't know, Leonardo DiCaprio plays New York stockbroker Jordan Belfort. At the start of the film, Jordan is a straight-laced youngster just eager to break into the business. He immediately falls in love with the fast-paced wheeling and dealing of the stock market, but does he have what it takes to be successful in this field?<br/><br/>It's not until he has a lunch meeting with his boss Mark Hanna, played by a loopy Matthew McConaughey. Hanna tells Jordan the secrets of making it in the business. It's fairly simple really, or so Hanna explains it like it's a routine part of one's day, like making coffee or buying the newspaper. A line of coke here, a bottle of alcohol there. Viola, successful New York stockbroker.<br/><br/>Things seem to be going just fine until the market crashes. Jordan finds himself looking for a regular job. He's just not cut out for that and soon finds a loophole in the stock trading system. A way to sell penny stocks of two-bit businesses and haul in 50% of the take.<br/><br/>Belfort quickly finds a partner in crime in Donnie Azoff, a sweaty, buck-toothed wild boar of a creature. Azoff is played by Jonah Hill in the best performance of his career. He's the kind of guy you just want to strangle, but can't take your eyes off of.<br/><br/>In no time at all, business is booming and everybody is rich. They have so much money they literally don't know what to do with it. Booze, drugs and women flow through their lives on what seems like a daily basis. After the third or fourth scene depicting this debauchery, some might feel a bit exhausted by its redundancy. <br/><br/>This is all part of the director's plan. Scorsese is showing the evils that come with greed. These are normal people who have elevated themselves to a god like status through illegal activities. The only way they can deal with the new person they have become is to get high, have sex and drown themselves in alcohol. Not necessarily in that order, mind you.<br/><br/>Like with anything that gets too big, Belort and his company attract the eye of the F.B.I. Kyle Chandler is great as the aw-shucks agent Patrick Denham. Denham would like nothing more than to catch Jordan and return him to the boring, mundane life the rest of us are all sentenced to. <br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street has Scorsese's fingerprints all over it. From the music, to the kinetic editing, to the small, but memorable characters, it feels like Scorsese at his best. That's not to say that it's better than Raging Bull, Taxi Driver or Goodfellas, but it's pretty darn close.<br/><br/>The breakout star for me is Margot Robbie who plays Belfort's second wife, Naomi. Naomi is a blonde bombshell of extraterrestrial beauty. On the surface, she seems like just another woman passing through Jordan's bed. It's not until Naomi and Jordan are married that she truly sees what his life is like. It's too much for her to handle and Jordan's home life begins to unravel along with his professional life.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that, although it's an amazing cast, this is Leo's film. This is easily one of the best performances of his career. There are some scenes where he is literally red-faced and shaking with rage. The thought actually crossed my mind that this guy might actually have a stroke. Not the character, the actor. You can be a great actor, but you can't perform scenes like that unless you are truly passionate about your craft. During some of DiCaprio's scenes, the hair on my arms was actually standing up. A true testament to a great performance.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how The Wolf of Wall Street will be compared to Scorsese's other films, but I do know that it will be remembered as a daring, high- energy portrayal of the American Dream gone wrong."

This is not always an easy film, but overall, despite all of his philandering and problems, I did not walk away disliking the lead character. That's how well LD pulled this off. The rest of the cast is hilarious...just see the film. Don't take the kid because ""this ain't no family film."" lol"

","I rated 'The Wolf On Wall Street' an 9 because of a couple things, <br/><br/>1.) Leonardo DiCaprio's acting was fantastic, there wasn't a drop of bad acting on his part. (Obviously)<br/><br/>2.) The movie made me along with everyone in the audience, laugh like crazy! Especially during the parts where Jordan and Danny did the lemon- drugs(I believe that's how it's called?), and Jordan came up with the new stage while on drugs, 'CP'-Priceless.<br/><br/>3.) How the movie tricked us into believing, that some scenes during the movie were going to change the course of the movie's direction. Like when Jordan found out about the FBI tapping into his phones, and Danny was still in his house. And it turned out that he was too messed up to even speak!<br/><br/>4.) The ending, god we all know the movies that have terrible endings. But the ending of TWOWS was just terrific. I walked in the movie believing this was going to be an 'ok' movie, 'ok' ending, but it was the exact opposite. <br/><br/>But, if you have a problem with people taking drugs, having sex, drinking alcohol, nudity,-don't watch this movie, cause it has at least one of those in almost every scene."

","Meet Jordan Belfort, a handsome, rich and amoral stock broker who lives the American dream by surfing the crest of Wall Street excess, ripping people off, and flying just under the radar. He is the penny-stock king, a showman and glib sales hack enriching everyone around him who is willing to embrace his ideals and methods. Here is another Gorden Gecko, but one stripped of nuance, decorum, sobriety, client responsibility or ethical sensibility.<br/><br/>Scorsese shows us these excesses in broad strokes, almost in cartoon fashion. Everything is over the top in this movie. Belfort is not just loved by his staff; he's cheered by all his staff en masse, sometimes with tears pouring down their cheeks. He doesn't just do drugs; he does them constantly and in huge amounts. There are not just grand homes, luxury cars and yachts, but absolutely fabulous homes, cars and yachts. The movie does not just show us macho culture, it shows us office orgies and straight men being very openly sexual in front of each other. (Is this realistic, I'm wondering. I'm having a hard time with that.) Money, drugs and sex. Sex, drugs and money. Belfort is a drug addict and sex addict, but most of all he is a money addict, an addiction with no shame and no 12-step programme.<br/><br/>We've all suspected it would be a lot of fun to be filthy rich like this, to be able to indulge every desire. We want this story to be true. This movie presents this adolescent male fantasy on the screen for the masses. Wouldn't it be great to be 30, no 14, again, and yet to have all the money in the world. F*ck social responsibility, morality, sobriety, ethics, the law. Who cares if someone gets hurt. (This movie doesn't show us that.) These men are having fun, the kind of fun some of us secretly imagine when we think about what it would be like to be stinking, amorally rich. It's porn. Not just sexual porn, but money porn. Titillating views of the American dream. Naked avarice in all its glory.<br/><br/>Scorsese sucks the viewers in by making us laugh and showing us a good time. This movie is thoroughly entertaining. The sensationalizing and comedy humanizes these people and draws us into the movie as easily as if it were a ride at America's Wonderland.<br/><br/>Of course, the chickens will come home to roost. Belfort (and we) are reminded of this half way through the movie. This is an American movie, after all, so moralizing is to be expected. Despite the fun, despite the ribald comedy, we see that Belfort is not a nice person at all and in the end hurts even the people close to him.<br/><br/>However, Scorsese reminds us that the law is almost powerless to stop people like this. In the new America, the moralising is ineffective and soon turns into cynicism. Our hero is soon out, doing his thing to other people; the honest cop who put him in jail is still poor and riding the subway. <br/><br/>The final scene of the movie shows us the hopeful, desperate faces of the poor sods who have been suckered in by Belfort to attend one of his get-rich-quick seminars. The show goes on. They are staring back at us from the screen. They are us. Money drives us all. We all want to get rich. We all love this movie."

","I saw ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", starring Leonardo DiCaprio-Django Unchained, Critters 3; Jonah Hill-Django Unchained, Knocked Up; Margot Robbie-About Time, Pan Am-t.v. and Kyle Chandler-Zero Dark Thirty, King Kong-2005.<br/><br/>This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese and is based on a true story about Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker in the 1990's. Leo plays the colorful Jordan and be warned, this movie is not for little kids. There is a lot of graphic nudity and drug consuming going on, all throughout the film. Jonah plays an eager disciple to Leo after seeing one of Leo's paycheck stubs; he wants to be just like him, so he quits his job and goes to work for him. Leo and Jonah start a new company and start raking in the money, under Leo's teaching skills. Margot is a guest at one of Leo's extravagant parties and Leo falls hard for her. They get married but the hookers and drugs keep right on coming. Of course, all these excesses in cocaine use and naked ladies-of-the-evening had to draw some attention, and F.B.I. agent Kyle shows up. There are a few good cameos scattered here and there-one of them has not acted in a movie in 10 years. There are a lot of humorous scenes, too-one in particular is when Leo is trying to drive his car, under the influence of Quaaludes. The story of stock fraud and all the indulgences that can come with having lots of cash is told with an enthusiasm that keeps you wanting to know what will happen next. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content- including lots of nudity-and has a running time of 3 hours. The movie was very entertaining, which I was not expecting in a 3 hour movie-I was not bored-and I would buy this on DVD."

","""The are going to need a wrecking ball to get me out of here. This is my house!"" Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) is a stock broker at one of Wall Streets biggest firms. When the crash of '87 hit his firm went under and he lost his job. Desperate, he takes a job selling penny stocks, after finding out the commission he can make on these stocks he goes into business for himself. When he turns to duping rich people into buying these stocks him and his partner Donnie Azoff (Hill) become rich beyond their wildest dreams, but everything comes with a price. I am a huge Scorsese fan and am becoming a big DiCaprio one as well so I was really looking forward to seeing this. While the movie is 3 hours long it doesn't feel slow or drawn out and never actually felt like a 3 hour movie. If that is your reason to hesitate on it don't worry. While there is a ton of drug use and nudity in this it doesn't distract from the flow. All that said this is a real must see. There is drama, comedy, action, everything that makes a movie great. I can't say enough about this movie. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even better. Do yourself a favor and watch this, you won't be sorry.

When watching the first two minuets of the film in the theater, I turned to my friend and said that this would be an amazing film; I was right.<br/><br/>The time has come for Leonardo DiCaprio to finally win an Oscar.

"nskanyal","9","3","13","25 December 2013"," Excess, overboard, over the top?? - keep it coming, give me more of it
","Goodfellas was the gold standard - it starts with unimaginable intensity and it ends with the same. While, goodfellas has the best ever portrayal of how mobsters might live their life and think about others, TWOWS gets close to telling a powerful story about debauchery, greed and extravagance in disdainful, abhorrent and empathy-lacking life of wallstreet traders. As ""Rolling Stone"" review says Scorcese has taken it over the moon, but you are going to completely love it. The movie is 3 hours long, but I could have controlled my bladder for 30 more minutes and taken on more of this magic. During all these 3 hours, I might have lost a little grip for a total of just 5 minutes. WSJ review says something about this being lengthy and being repetitive, mind-numbing drama. Really?? Suck it, grow up and learn something about movies and about storytelling.<br/><br/>I have been waiting for this movie for quite some time now and it turned out to be even better than I expected it to be. Leonardo has added another very strong bullet on his ever expanding resume. The movie is all about his character - I think he is there on screen for 90% of the movie. That scene where Leo is high on Quaaludes and drives back from country club, might be one of the funniest and among the best ever performances. Perhaps, this might be his lucky year for the Oscars. Jonah Hill is simply awesome, right from the point where he meet Leo and wants to work for him. The script, screenplay and dialogues are off the charts. This is dark and crude humor (and at times crass and outrageous) at its best, and the filmmakers make no attempt to sway away from that overall theme. I think movie lost a little intensity towards the end, and probably the last 15 minutes were its weakest. But, in-all this is among the best of this year. Thanks yet again Mr. Scorcese for all the entertainment."
"jcbutthead86","10","3","14","10 January 2014"," An Excellent And Hilarious Black Comedy-Drama. Martin Scorsese And Leonardo DiCaprio At Their Best.
","The Wolf Of Wall Street is an excellent and hilarious Black Comedy-Drama that combines amazing direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a great soundtrack making The Wolf Wall Street Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio at their best.<br/><br/>Based on the book of the same name and set in New York City during the 1980s and 90s,The Wolf Of Wall Street tells the story of Jordan Belford(Leonardo DiCaprio),a Wall Street stockbroker who forms his own stock company and becomes more successful and living a life of money,drugs and excess. But as Jordan's life goes on he discovers that the F.B.I. and other forms of law enforcement are on his back which leads to Jordan's rise and fall.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's The Wolf Of Wall Street is a brilliant,funny and over the top 3-hour black Comedy-Drama and is not only another Scorsese classic but another amazing collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio,it's a movie that is darkly humorous,truly demented and insane and very amoral and also tests your morality to the point where you can't take your eyes off the screen even if you want to. The Wolf Of Wall Street works not only as it's own film but also a terrific companion piece to Scorsese's Mob/Gangster classics Goodfellas and Casino in which The Wolf Of Wall Street are very similar to in style and storyline but whereas Goodfellas and Casino were about the violent lifestyles of Gangsters then The Wolf Of Wall Street is about the crazy lives of stockbrokers. Now,this isn't the first time that Scorsese has done a Comedy because years before he also did underrated films such as The King Of Comedy(1983)and After Hours(1985)but Scorsese goes even further with WOWS creating a movie that is energetic and satirical that you never know what's going to happen next with the story or it's characters and the Comedy is wild,funny and takes on a surrealistic tone that as viewer when you watch this film you will wonder did some of the stuff in the film actually happen. WOWS is a movie that will divide viewers and critics because of the characters actions and the many scenes of sex and drug use(which got the film an NC-17 rating before it was given an R-rating)some will feel Scorsese is glamorizing the lifestyle in the film. But I don't think Scorsese is really glamorizing anything in WOWS I think Scorsese is showing how success with some people can go so far that any person can fail and that is shown with Jordan Belfort because WOWS is not only a rise and fall tale but also a cautionary tale. The things that the characters in this do make the gangsters in Goodfellas and Casino look like model citizens in comparison. Scorsese and his editor the great Thelma Schoonmaker are masters at pacing and at 2 hrs and 59 minutes the movie goes by really fast and WOWS keeps you glued to the screen throughout making the three hour running feel like 90 minutes. The character Jordan Belfort is a character that viewers are going to love or hate you will love Jordan because of his ambitions to be huge and successful and you will hate Jordan for his own morality(or in this case amorality)with his excessive drug use,wanting more money which leads to his downfall. Most of the bizarre events in the film are seen from Jordan's P.O.V and you are along for a crazy thrill ride that never stops. When you watch WOWS you will ask is Jordan a tragic character or does he deserve his fate? It's a question you ask after the movie is over. The screenplay by Terrance Winter(creator of Boardwalk Empire)is amazing and very well-written,with Winter giving the movie great dialog and scenes that are funny and memorable and with Jordan's narration that speaks to the audience with a wild energy. The ending of The Wolf Of Wall Street is fantastic and effective showing viewers what happened to Jordan and gives viewers a bittersweet conclusion. A great ending.<br/><br/>The whole cast is wonderful Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent and at his very best as Jordan Belfort,bringing intensity and wild energy to the performance. Jonah Hill is brilliant and funny as Donnie Azoff,Belfort's right hand man. Margot Robbie is wonderful and sexy as Naomi Belfort,Jordan's wife and has great scenes with DiCaprio. Matthew MoConaughey is terrific in his small role as Mark Hanna,a stockbroker who shows Jordan the ropes. Kyle Chandler(Agent Patrick Denham),Rob Reiner(Max Belfort),Jon Bernthal(Brad),Jon Favreau(Manny Riskin),Jean Dujardin(Jean Jacques Saurel),Joanna Lumley(Aunt Emma),Cristin Milioti(Teresa Petrillo)and Shea Whigham(Captain Ted Beecham)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Martin Scorsese is amazing with Scorsese bringing his trademark energy and style to the film with tracking overhead shots,close ups and freeze frames giving the movie a wonderful visual style. Fantastic direction,Scorsese.<br/><br/>The soundtrack in the film outstanding composing of many Rock N'Roll songs that match the flow and tone of the movie. Great soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Leonardo DiCaprio or cinema,I highly suggest you see The Wolf Of Wall Street,an excellent,hilarious and excessive Black Comedy-Drama that is Scorsese and DiCaprio at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","Most probably the best dark comedy in decades,Martin Scorsese's best movie since The Departed along with Leonardo DiCaprio's's bizarre performance.....simply amazing to say the least. The film was in everyone's attention with Jordan Belfort's controversial life.And Martin Scorsese doing a Biopic based on the epic story of the Wall Street stock broker made it even more interesting,its a story of corruption, greed,drugs and success and failure set in late 80s and 90s. the movie was fast paced,never boring,filled with dark humor and hilarious scenes. Leonardo DiCaprio was absolutely astonishing with his bizarre comic performance in the role of Jordan Belfort,I personally can not think of a person who could replace him in this role.He did something totally different from what he have done so far in his bright career.you could see the film just for him only. Matthew McConaughey in a short role proved his worth,Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff was quite good with his comic timing,Margot Robbie was brilliantly well suited in her role as Jordan's wife Naomi Lapaglia.Kyle Chandler as FBI cop and Rob Reiner as Max Belfort did a pretty good as well. with a Martin Scorsese's film,you simply just cannot get disappointed,the legendary 71 year old director still amazes the audience with the energy he injects in his film.And with his unique ability of portraying ""Bad guys"" from different perspective,showing their Backgrounds,personal feelings,thoughts,explanations of doings.He carried these unique pattern from Goodfellas(1990),Casino(1995) to The Departed (2006),and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)is similar in this pattern. Now,Why should you watch this movie? A movie with 180 min length is filled with laugh out loud moments in every inch(I can't recall even a comparable one).These movie carries the signature style of Scorsese,unbelievable and bizarre comic performance by Leo DiCaprio.with excessive sex,drugs,f-words Its a guaranteed entertainer(best in last few years).My rating 9.5 out of 10. My verdict:Don't even think of missing this movie.its a stunner that don't comes every year.I repeat Its a must must watch!!Go for it!!"

Some may object to the total lack of any moral compass. The first Mrs. Balfort might have provided some grounding except she was quickly dispatched and never heard from again.<br/><br/>The movie is funny and very entertaining. It is frightening to think about how much Balfort got away with for less then two years in a country club Federal prison. The movie is worthy of the awards it will receive. See it."

","Leonardo Dicaprio and Jonah Hill star in a movie showing the downfalls of how money can turn into a wild obsession. Wolf of Wall Street is an unconventional movie that shows the craziness of getting involved in the stock market. Though this movie may be extremely far from the truth; it is completely entertaining with the amount of diversity in the cast and their ability to act out such wild characters. The story essentially explains how a man who craves nothing but money that struggles to make his way to the top, but when he gets there he explodes from the inside out. This story was not only original, but has something for everybody. With its dramatic effects while the characters were abusing substances to its comedic attributes in the most mind- blowing scenes. This movie shows how different reality is from a dream and how things can really catch up to you when you keep running from the truth. Wolf of Wall Street has an amazing amount of cinematic effects that make the audience feel that you are truly experiencing what the characters are experiencing. By far one of the best movies of this year and is definitely a movie that has something for everyone."
"Geeky Randy","10","2","8","6 April 2014"," Easily Scorsese's best in almost 20 years!
","Martin Scorsese is a rare director. When it comes to overall filmography-quality, the guy lacks any middle-ground. His praise is either rightly deserved or incredibly overrated. MEANSTREETS, TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, THE KING OF COMEDY, THE LAST TEMPTATION, GOODFELLAS and CASINO, are just a few of his deservedly high-praised features; while GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE DEPARTED and SHUTTER ISLAND are all incredibly overrated. Notice how the rightly praised films are all pre-1996, while all his overrated films are post-1996. So, where, you might ask, does that leave THE WOLF OF WALL STREET? It appears Scorsese has climbed his way out of a slump to create a highly realistic portrayal of Wall Street corruption, with this tale revolving mainly around security-fraud. The memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort (played by DiCaprio) was a huge inspiration to Ben Younger for his 2000 debut film BOILER ROOM, which is an excellent film in its own right starring late-1990s up-and-comers, but what WOLF delivers that BOILER ROOM lacks is what I'm coining as ""genre gumbo""—and if you do yourself a favor and watch WOLF, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about not to say that you shouldn't do yourself a second favor and also watch BOILER ROOM. Hilarious, cruel and intense; WOLF OF WALL STREET is an epic that is in full-speed from the very first shot, and ceases to slow down until the end credits. Easily Scorsese's best in almost 20 years! However, CASINO has had the privilege of having 19-years to grow on viewers; who knows what WOLF's replay value could be for all we know, it could be the best thing Scorsese has done since RAGING BULL. Only time will tell where it ranks on the Scorsese-classics (definitely higher than lower on the impressively long list); but one thing is for certain, there is no denying it is an immediate classic and possibly the best film of 2013.<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

"Jordan-thornell-7","10","2","8","15 February 2014"," An absolutely insane film - Leo's best work to date
","The Wolf Of Wall Street is an incredible tale of a man who was destroyed by his own greed and ego. It's brutally honest and brave, captivating readers of Jordan Belfort's international best seller of the same name. <br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is an insane almost-3-hour ride. Women's bodies are flashed and fondled in nearly every scene, drugs are sniffed off of every surface and swallowed in obscenely large quantities and the f-word is used 506 times (every 2.81 minutes to be exact) and now holds the record for the most swear words in a film. If that isn't exciting, I don't know what is!!! Even though it's 2 hours and 59 minutes, the film doesn't slow down for a second. Super fast and high paced (like the drugs they're taking) you don't realise the its been 3 hours until the credits are rolling.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio marks The Wolf Of Wall Street as the film of his career. Leo lived and breathed Jordan Belfort for 2 years which showed in the whole 3 hours - he is so into the role that it's hard to believe he's even acting. And the fact that Leo is nearly 40 is a shocker in itself, but he still looks as young as he did in his Titanic days, completely passing as young and youthful Belfort. Leo is a rare sort. He seems to stand the test of time and gets better and more experienced with age. TWOWS is Leo's 5th film with Martin Scorsese as the director and you can understand why. Their connection is clear through Leo's acting and you can just tell he has nailed Scorsese's vision to a tee.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie is stunning and perfectly cast as Naomi. Her Australian twang is disguised by a brilliant Brooklyn accent and fits the part of Jordan's snippy, confident wife . She does strip down to her birthday suit a few times, but not just to get her kit off. A lot of films use nudity to connect to the right audience, and most of the time girls are flashing their breasts for no apparent reason. Naomi uses her body to control Jordan, knowing that her assets will help get her own way. Nicely done.<br/><br/>The real Jordan Belfort dedicates his book of his life to his children, knowing that one day, he will have to explain how their father could have done the endless despicable things to their mother and others he loved. Martin obviously focuses on the craziness of Jordan's life but touches on his love for his wife and children every so often, showing the softer side to his incredible story.<br/><br/>All in all, Martin Scorsese is a cinematic genius."

His role in Django Unchained is like a teaser to this one, but this role is just another beast entirely.<br/><br/>The range of emotions di Caprio pulled off in this movie was beyond praise-worthy. I don't think any actor could have pulled it off better - if he doesn't get an Oscar for this, he probably never will.<br/><br/>The plot, as most of us know, is a biographical one about Jordan Belfort and how money, drugs and sex did to him. This movie is the funniest movie I have seen in a long while, so funny that my mother came to my room 3 times to tell me to not laugh so loudly and asked what I was watching - and this is coming out from a guy who almost always complains about the lack of humour in comedy movies.<br/><br/>Seriously, if you haven't watched The Wolf of Wallstreet yet, you better do - especially if you are in desperate need of entertainment because, boy, this movie oozes it and watching it will give you one of the most megalomaniac ride of your life!<br/><br/>Definitely, a 10/10 movie for me."

No bars are held back, which ultimately give an unfortunately realistic and gritty portrayal of these themes and how they are still corrupting many in contemporary society including sex, drugs, hookers, nudity, money.

We are brought into a fake looking fantasy world of debauchery bliss. This is not the film to explain the inner workings of wall street or what an IPO is or how exactly the company makes money from exploiting people. DiCaprio says outright speaking to our faces, ""you don't care about this technical stuff lets just say I'm making a lot of money and its illegal"" - YEEEAAY! And that expresses the point – follow me on a roller coaster ride of extraordinary decadent, nasty, fun, the kind that those of us in this business get to have. The movie doesn't show the hard work that is done to make the millions it only explores the fantasy that the millions brings to these young eccentric personalities that make it big fast. It is not satirical, nor is it a down to earth slice of life tale or even a much of commentary it is mostly pure playful entertainment. <br/><br/>Over the Top Caricatures are created as opposed to real people which add to surrealism. DiCaprio as the leader and Jonah Hill as the sidekick are an amusing frat boy/wallstreety combo that opens up new levels of laughably painful debauchery throughout the entire three hours. The plot moves fast but the pace is well managed since time slows and we can witness wonderfully creative, amusing scenes of the raw over-the-top decadence in its full manifestations. These scenes have a pseudo-realistic flavor and therefore are more laughable than anything else. <br/><br/>The invincible arrogance of DiCaprio's character is a lot of fun to follow. He knows he is doing wrong and seems to relish in the evil of it. Women are degraded and co-workers are humiliated in this dog eat dog machismo company that the Wolf creates and the Wolf loves every minute of it. There is only one brief instant when he becomes almost stupefied by his unbelievable invisibility. <br/><br/>This character trait doesn't really glorify wall street since it shows these types to be so perverse and not only corrupt but inherently a bit evil, a bit sick in the head. Scorcese is making fun of them by showcasing them in ridiculous sequences of slow motion while they are under the influence of this weird drug qualudes, that the film goes into. The exaggerated affect also gives a playfully over-the-top tease to these wall street types and that is what makes it different from other movies in this Wall street genre that took themselves more seriously. The fantasy of the pure debauchery bliss might seem glorious to some of us but overall most of us, I think, will root for the Feds getting the Wolf. <br/><br/>This is another extremely enjoyable highly re-watchable movie. Like during a late Sunday afternoon of channel flipping when you stumble on other Scorsese greats, such as Good-fellas or Casino, which ushers you into stopping for an indulgent peak, and all of the sudden finding yourself once again for the 10th time becoming so engrossed that you can't help but to continue watching to the end."
"blanbrn","8","2","8","29 December 2013"," A near excellent satire on greed, excess, corruption and indulgence it showcases hedonism at it's best!
","After watching ""Wolf of Wall Street"" you will feel entertained and also a bit down as you see the good and high party times of a rich greed corrupted stock broker has a fallout to it. That fallout includes drug addiction, broken relationships and yes a prison sentence. Anyway veteran and legendary director Martin Scorsese hams up this satire to show the world of the late 80's thru the mid 90's and how the world of wall street took off becoming a major power player. The wall street business became a pool and a scheme of crime and corruption that tied in both the corporate world and the banking industry. The film based on true events centers on Jordan Belfort(a role that Leonardo DiCaprio pushes to the edge)an up and coming young guy who all of a sudden becomes a wealthy and powerful stockbroker. And Belfort's methods and his rise to power involves bribes, schemes, and false bank accounts that are made for his customers and victim clients. The film has it all insider trading and false security tips still it makes Jordan a very very rich guy. Along with the life comes hard partying coke snorting, binge drinking, and a lot of sex with beautiful women mostly escorts still Jordan hooks a sexy trophy wife. And a man named Donnie(the super Jonah Hill)is funny and crazy as Jordan's partner in crime and top sidekick. Still the good times and high life brings the bad life of addiction and broken relationships all leading to a prison sentence. This is one picture that is a showcase on excess and indulgence showing that the good life can be lived up with highs yet the lows to come are evident as the wolf can only howl for so long and only to a certain point."

","Directed by Martin Scorsese<br/><br/>Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie<br/><br/>Written by Terence Winter and Jordan Belfort<br/><br/>""Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government."" <br/><br/>This was the film I was waiting for all year. I was heartbroken when the film got delayed it's release from November to December. Luckily, it didn't hurt the film one bit. DiCaprio and Scorsese have done it again!<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, what else do I have to say? I believe he is the only director that could keep me entertained for 3 long hours. Critics have been criticizing the length of this film but throughout, I was never lost, confused or looking at my watch. My eyes were constantly on the screen and it was typical Scorsese film-making. This could be Scorsese's most intense and funniest film to date. The actions of the characters would be viewed as disgusting, but Martin Scorsese frames this story of greed and corruption with a comedic lens that allows us to laugh at things we probably shouldn't find humorous. His work with the camera is fascinating as always. He is one of the few film-makers that teaches a new camera technique in every one of his film releases. The collaboration of Scorsese and Schoonmaker once again knocks the ball out of the park. It's the simple things that keep you at awe. The quick cuts once again do their magic and works well.<br/><br/>The cast did a superb job with this film. Everybody was on their game and not one performance faltered. Notable performances were given by Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie. DiCaprio once again gives a stellar performance under Scorsese's direction. His performance reminded me of Ray Liotta from 'Goodfellas' but with more 'swagger.' His confidence and arrogance leap from scene to scene and you can't keep your eyes off of him. Jonah gave his best performance yet in my opinion. His accent was always spot on and never trailed off. He contributed so much to his character and improvised portions of his dialogue. Great effort! Margot Robbie is a blonde bombshell! She is so physically attracting, you want her to be seen in every scene. Her accent was partially over acted but it didn't hurt her performance or the story as a whole.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese can be counted again and again to choose the right music soundtrack for his films. He is fearless. His efforts in this film reminded me of a 'Goodfellas' theme but with it's own voice added to it. The songs are so diverse yet they come together as a whole, perfect harmony. One of my favourite examples is how 'Mrs Robinson' was used. Such an intense scene with a great flowing song on top of it.<br/><br/>This film isn't for everybody. There are a lot of intense scenes but are all necessary in telling the truth of the story. if you are able to keep an open mind throughout, you will see the beauty that Scorsese brought on screen. If you're a fan of Goodfellas and Casino, you will absolutely love this movie. A definite must see for Scorsese/DiCaprio fans."
"aglymber88","Null","2","8","27 December 2013"," The Great Gatsby of the 90's
","The Great Gatsby of the 90's. The autobiography of Jordan Belfort and his extravagant lifestyle with drugs, parties, beautiful companions a whole New Money environment. A colorful film with brilliant acting performances by Leonardo DiCaprio Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey. A story of how fraud becomes a strong tool of power and wealth. Scorsese has shown us few times before his admiration of wealthy, powerful and smart scammer figures in history. Eg: The Aviator, Casino. An answer on how shady sales works, and who ends up to be the winner and loser. In my opinion The Wolf of Wall Street is a film where repeats it's self over and over again, leaving out important details of the real downfall of our protagonist fun adventure. Instead is focusing on his personal details of his relationship with drugs and women. More like a Vegas ""fairytale"" than a Wall St. story. An arsenic comedy, that makes men's dreams visual. Leonardo DiCaprio again exceeds himself with a dizzying interpretation accomplishes something terribly difficult: to interpret a hero by nature excessive and explosive, with control, restraint, and radiation power.I recommend it because of the fact that it's a typical Scorsese film , which breathes through a closed circuit of people who experience the sweetest success and steeper fall, pleasure and guilt , promiscuity and punishment."

","From Oscar and BAFTA nominated director Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, The Departed), I saw the trailer for this film, although it looked interesting I wondered if I would really watch it, but of course I was going to when awards season came around, this got nominated a good number. Based on the autobiography of the real man, Jordan Belfort (Golden Globe winning, Oscar and BAFTA nominated Leonardo DiCaprio, also producing) started working on Wall Street as a stockbroker, he was barely into the job and the firm fails following Black Monday, but his boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) advised him when he makes the money to take advantage of it, adopting a lifestyle full of casual sex, cocaine and other drugs when successful. The stockbrokers job market is in a poor state and Jordan is unemployed, so he takes a job in a Long Island boiler room dealing in penny stocks, encouraged by his wife Teresa Petrillo (Cristin Milioti), he earns himself a small fortune with his aggressive pitching style and a high commission rate, and he meets and befriends small businessman Donnie Azoff (Oscar nominated Jonah Hill) who is keen to work for him and make money. Jordan and Donnie go into business together, recruiting a number of friends, many dealing marijuana to help facilitation, they create Stratton Oakmont, Inc. the name may be respectable but all runs on a pump and dump scam with customers on the telephone, and eventually Forbes magazine interviews Jordan, dubbing him the ""Wolf of Wall Street"", but this pres works to the company's advantage as hundreds of ambitious young financiers want to work for them. What follows is a lavish lifestyle filled with parties, sex and drugs, with Jordan hooked on sex with prostitutes, and an addiction to cocaine and hypnotic drugs, but Stratton Oakmont is under the watch of the FBI, and Agent Patrick Denham (Super 8's Kyle Chandler) is investigating, with the Securities and Exchange Commission involved as well, and meanwhile after a meeting at one of his parties, and an affair, Jordan gets a divorce and marries Naomi Lapaglia (About Time's Margot Robbie), and months later they have daughter Skylar. Securing the IPO (Initial public offering) of Steve Madden Ltd. Jordan makes an instant $22 million, he sees corrupt banker Jean Jacques Saurel (The Artist's Jean Dujardin) and opens a Swiss bank account to hide the money, under the name of Naomi's British Aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley), and he eventually smuggles the cash into Switzerland, but the schemes are almost exposed following Donnie having a public fight courier Brad Bodnick (Jon Bernthal) who is arrested. A string of bad news is happening, Donnie gives Jordan a powerful brand of Quaaludes to ease the stress, but they take large doses as their potency seems to have worn off with age, and at the point he is receiving calls from his private investigator Bo Dietl, he wants to avoid being tapped and being arrested, and at the wrong moment the drugs finally kick in, debilitated and driving he is too late to stop Donnie using the phone to Saurel, they have a bad fight, Donnie almost chokes on food, but Jordan uses coke to counteract the drug effect and save his life. Jordan's father Max Belfort (Rob Reiner) knows the shadow of law enforcement is hanging over Stratton Oakmont, he convinces his son to step down and escape legal charges, but when he does arrange a leaving party he changes his mind and refuses to back down, encouraging all his staff to keep doing what they are doing, of course the heart attack death of Emma mean trouble, so to avoid passport stamping Jordan and Donnie sail to Monaco and Switzerland, only to have the yacht capsize in a violent storm, and in the chaos Jordan sees their rescue plane explode because of a seagull flying into the engine, he sees this as God telling him to sober up. Two years pass, and during the filming of an infomercial Jordan is arrested by Denham, Saurel told the FBI everything, and is arrested in Florida for an unrelated charge, and meanwhile following one last night of sex with his wife, Naomi wants a divorce, and Jordan violently angry gets high on hidden cocaine and attempts to take his daughter away to stop her getting custody, but he only ends up crashing. With evidence against him overwhelming, to lessen his sentence Jordan agrees to help the FBI, so he goes to work wearing a wire, but they catch him out finding a silent note he showed Donnie telling him not to incriminate himself, Stratton Oakmont is raided and shut down, and Jordan is sent to a minimum security prison for 36 months, in the end, following his release Jordan made an innocent living teaching sales technique in seminars. Also starring Jon Favreau as Manny Riskin, P.J. Byrne as Nicky 'Rugrat' Koskoff, Spike Jonze as Dwayne, Christine Ebersole as Leah Belfort, Brian Sacca as Robbie 'Pinhead' Feinberg, Henry Zebrowski as Alden 'Sea Otter' Kupferberg and Ethan Suplee as Toby Welch. DiCaprio gives a brilliant charismatic and vibrant performance (you can see the real Jordan Belfont at the end), Hill is fantastic support as the larger than life buddy, this film is not afraid to show a high amount of excessive drug use and hardcore sex sequences, sometimes both combined, it does so in a funny way too, it is a great mix of laughable bad behaviour, dramatic and thought-provoking material, and of course illegal activities that really happened, it really is an exhilarating and interesting must see crime drama based on a true story. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing for Thelma Schoonmaker, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!"
"Jerghal","10","2","9","17 March 2014"," DiCaprio and Scorsese make an excellent team
","Martin Scorsese is an actor's director and my god does it show. 'Wolf' is perfectly cast even down to the extra's. Every actor brings their A-game here. The film lasts over 3 hrs but trust me it is time well spent. Marty takes time to let scenes develop, to let actor's play of each other, to let the script breathe. Despite (or thx to?) all the profanity (506 curse words) you can't help but love the cool dialogue and conversations. Nudity and debauchery have never been framed more gloriously with sweeping camera moves, strategic slomo and creative shot compositions. This film is just so much fun: I've laughed more with this film than almost any other film intended as a comedy I've seen the last 10 years. It's too bad it didn't win any Oscars because it surely deserved them. But I guess that won't bother Marty or anyone else who will see this film. 'Wolf' might be the only true spiritual successor to one of my other all time favorites 'Wall Street' (forget Wall Street 2). DiCaprio and Scorsese make an excellent team and I hope we will get to see a lot more masterpieces from them in the future!"
"addanilov1","10","2","9","1 March 2014"," Brilliant movie about total badass
","I waited for a new Marty Scorsese movie very long, he is my favorite director. His teamwork with Leo DiCaprio is always fascinating. So ""Wolf Of Wall- Street"" definitely was most anticipated movie of the year for me. This movie tells a story of a multimillionaire broker Jordan Belfort – it starts from his first job at an old white-shoe firm. And then it describes how far from this place Jordan goes. His life story is ambiguous – at one point he become a very successful person who earned millions of dollars, and from another point – he did it illegally and for that he was sent to the jail. But for me his story is inspiring. His life is awesome, he became a millionaire by just himself and it commands respect. <br/><br/>When I was watching this movie I got a real satisfaction – Scorsese showed me what I wanted him to show. Wolf Of Wall-Street looks like a great combination of Goodfellas and Casino with Leo Di Caprio instead of Robert De Niro. I know Terrence Winter by ""the Sopranos"" and I was absolutely sure that screenplay would be awesome. And it is! Perfect dialogs, interesting storyline, I like the style how it developed. And of course actors. I think Di Caprio did his best in this picture. He was absolutely brilliant and I loved every second when he was on the screen. He definitely should win an Academy Award for this role. Also I admire work of Jonah Hill and Margo Robbie – they also made their characters look like alive people.<br/><br/>But I think the accompanying music was not so good – in other Marty's films you can hear tons of old school rock-music, but here there mostly modern music and in my opinion it is disadvantage of the movie because the place took place in 80-s and to preserve the authenticity there should be music from that time – like Guns and Roses, Michael Jackson and other music from 80-s.<br/><br/>And there was a discussion about what is exactly genre of this film. I can say that precise definition of the genre of this picture is criminal dramedy. It if full of hilarious jokes, sex and orgies scenes and awkward episodes, but it is also a deep real life story of a real man. <br/><br/>Also a lot of people said that 3 hours is too long – but when you will go and see it, the time will pass unnoticed.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend to everyone to go and see Wolf of Wall-street. You will experience nirvana by watching it. It is a great movie and one of the best Scorsese movies.<br/><br/>Definitely best picture of the year. Thanks Marty for another masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10"

Most people are saying that this movie is just too vulgar but what those dumb people do not realize is this was what reality was like during the years this movie portrays so those people just need to suck it up. In the end, once you get past the vulgarness (which isn't necessarily bad) you will see how this film is a masterpiece of acting and screenplay.

","There's a lot to look forward to in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"":<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is a dramatic comedy starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort, a stock broker who is trying to make a name for himself on Wall Street. The screenplay was adapted from the memoirs of the real Jordan Belfort, and therefore the movie functions like a biography that satires many aspects of his life and behaviors, including his perceptions about society and business culture on Wall Street in particular. The movie is about Belfort's opportunities for success on Wall Street being stripped away early in his career, only to find himself working for a firm selling penny stocks, and turning the unsuccessful boutique firm into a wildly successful corporation named Stratton Oakmont Inc.<br/><br/>To make matters even more challenging for Belfort, his professional ambitions are coupled with drug and sex addictions. While Belfort has an extraordinary business mind, he is also unreliable, womanizing, and almost always intoxicated. The traditional idea of the American dream is not a satisfactory idea for him. His parents were accountants, and he was raised in a middle class family. Through investments, Belfort made tens of millions of dollars in his early twenties. He very much desired to be a member of the upper class. Therefore, he constantly strives to make himself successful financially. While financial success is a noble pursuit, Belfort's behavior is irresponsible and reckless. Cocaine, prescription pills, non-prescription pills, prostitutes and a never ending supply of alcohol are the behaviors successful people should have according to Belfort. These behaviors created addictions within a flawed central character.<br/><br/>Audiences learn very quickly that Belfort is far from a perfect man. They also learn how skillful he is in marketing and communication. Forbes Magazine publishes an article on Belfort and Stratton Oakmont Inc., calling him ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". The magazine article pinpointed that Belfort achieved financial success by misleading investors in order to receive the highest possible profits. Belfort is painted as the inverse of the famous character Robin Hood, where he is responsible for stealing from the poor and giving to the rich. Belfort is later held responsible for these practices throughout the film.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street reveals Belfort's aspirations, obstacles and relationships. The movie depicts the chronology of Belfort's personal and business life. DiCaprio's performance will receive nominations from multiple award programs in 2014 for its depth, versatility and quality. It is probably the most socially relevant film in the box office right now, and it reveals a lot about business culture on Wall Street and one's personal struggle for success."
"alinsteglinski","10","2","9","19 January 2014"," One of the best films to close out 2013
","This film is a real hoot to close out 2013.<br/><br/>Owing to the poor situation of our economy currently this film portrays the fraud that goes on in our stock markets every day.<br/><br/>While parts of this film seem quite fictitious and hyped up they are that way for a reason, this film is more of a comed-ocumentary (comedy and documentary) of the fraud that went on with Stratton Oakmont, a New York based Over The Counter (Pink Sheets) brokerage.<br/><br/>If you are a stock trader and have traded pink sheet / OTC-BB then you will love this film, it is a real throw back of what has happened. If you were trading in the days that Stratton Oakmont had a big foothold you may even recognize its logo from in the film. <br/><br/>If you have never traded and know nothing about stocks or investing this film may have some portions of it that will be over head but it is still funny to watch without knowledge of investments, but it will be a lot better if you do brush up on some basic words, it's not overly wordy.<br/><br/>My mother attended with me and had quite a laugh and has no investment knowledge, I myself being a trader absolutely loved this movie.<br/><br/>Steve Madden though was a bit inaccurately portrayed, a bit too nerdy by my opinion.<br/><br/>This is a movie worth seeing."

","To be honest, I never thought that this movie was based on a real life story... The true obsession with money, the life style involved with it, the messed up state of mind... I mean there was no dull moment... To create an organism full of insanity and then give life to it... Well that's my take on the movie and believe that is the way of Scorsese...<br/><br/>DiCaprio seemed at his best throughout the movie... The not so perfect conman, with his ego and drug issues...So he has a vision and goes on to fulfill it and does whatever it takes to do so... But the dark side is portrayed so beautifully as could have been done only by Scorsese...I think DiCaprio has a Oscar in his bag this year... Also the pick of the actors for me was Jonah Hill who played Donnie Azoff, co-founder of the con but wilder than DiCaprio... He seemed like a complete madman with drugs and the way he lived it... The movie has so many layers to offer and there are no dull moments... <br/><br/>All I can say is that this movie is full of sex, drugs, money, power, madness, success and more success, more than you can handle and how these people handle it...

"peggy-mann","10","2","9","16 January 2014"," Hunter S. Thompson would have loved it!
","Perhaps the shorter censored version being shown in other countries should have been an option for those interested in this story of unbridled greed, sex and drug usage in 1980's Wall Street, but I found the objectionable scenes completely pertinent to the storyline. I loved Terence Winter's screenplay, the cast and the director's ability to bring this real life crime story to the big screen. A bigger question for me than the sex scenes so many innocents object to is whether Jordan Belfort profited as the government demanded he hand 50% of his gain over from the film.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was the exchange between FBI Agent Patrick Denham played by Kyle Chandler and the Wolf, Leonardo DiCaprio: ""When you have a boat built for a Bond villain sometimes you need to play the part."" Then there was the Quaalude scene, so hilarious it could easily have been written by Hunter S. Thompson and made me wish Scorsese had brought the Rum Diaries to the big screen.<br/><br/>Seeing Jon Bernthal and Jean Dujardin gracing the big screen was a kicker, thanks go to those wise enough to put them in a movie, and hope it happens again and again.<br/><br/>This was my favorite portrayal by Leonardo DiCaprio, he should get an Oscar for ""acting"" as if he is having sex with Margot Robbie. I give this movie a 10 for the uncensored version, my only suggestion is for Hollywood with regard to their distribution: if you want to end the public's blindness to the unpunished crime that goes on within the Wall Street community let the innocent's know with an X Rating upon release, otherwise many in certain regions of the country will not get past the early scenes showing the decadence and drug use."

","For someone like me who has read the book that this movie is based on I can safely say that is a clear cut 10/10. The movie follows the book almost perfectly and the whole casts absolutely nails their characters (Leonardo and Jonah Hill especially). <br/><br/>I don't understand the people saying that Scorsese has lost his touch, this movie is masterfully done with his signature techniques. And for the people that say the movie is just drugs and sex, first of all you can't be mad at movies showing that these days, it's not the 50's anymore and you need to grow up. And secondly, welcome to Jordan Belfort, this debauchery needs to be shown because it demonstrates just how excessive this guys life was and it does it brilliantly. <br/><br/>Overall a definite 10/10 and has been thrust in to my top ten and looks to stay there."
"paavanpshukla","9","2","9","3 January 2014"," fast-paced, though exceedingly dark comedy about the ruthlessness of the highly competitive stockbroker business
","In his fifth collaboration with Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jordan Belfort, a Long Island stock wizard, whose brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont swindles a multitude of investors in the late 1980's. Based on Belfort's own memoirs, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a fast- paced, though exceedingly dark comedy about the ruthlessness of the highly competitive stockbroker business.<br/><br/>A film panned by most critics, but in my opinion,its fantastic! In this role, DiCaprio plays the high-roller wannabe Belfort with a manic verve and exhaustive energy. It's hard to imagine how he, Scorsese and co-star Jonah Hill kept up the pace. I have always been a huge fan of DiCaprio. In reality, his performance was the only good thing about ""Titanic"", a film I loathed. How anyone can enjoy watching a disaster in which 1500 plus humans drown is beyond me, but I digress. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a gift to DiCaprio --- allowing him to be as outrageous as necessary. Equally addicted and addictive is Hill, portraying the whiny, paranoid wingman, Azoff. This would be a plum role for anyone but I'm not sure anyone except Hill could have jumped off the screen and made Azoff his own as well as Hill. Both DiCaprio and Hill would be in line for Oscars! First half of the movie will pass by like bullets from a M16. Last 25 minutes in the second half might seem a bit boring and slow. But that's okay because the rest of the movie is so fast paced that when it comes to normal your brain may think that the last part is slow,but its not! It is just normal paced! The language of the movie might seem a but over the line for some since it averages 2 F bombs a minute.<br/><br/>Good- The dialogues, editing , Leo's acting Bad- (some)sequences seem similar to The boiler room. Overall- ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is infectiously entertaining. It is probably the funniest movie I have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen. Between all the fun however, there is also a story about addiction and how it can cause a downward spiral in your life whether it be drugs, money, or power."
"rahmannoodles22","10","2","9","31 December 2013"," The Wolf of Wall Street
","Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese can never go wrong together. Scorsese is a legendary filmmaker. The late Roger Ebert even said that Scorsese has given us a classic each decade with Taxi Driver in the 70s, Raging Bull in the 80s, Goodfellas in the 90s, and The Departed in the 2000s. It's my pleasure to say that he's continuing that tradition with The Wolf of Wall Street. The Wolf of Wall Street is basically the biography of legendary stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who is an incredibly greedy and despicable, yet ambitious guy. My favorite quote of his in his narration when he says, ""the year I turned 26, I made $49 million, which really ticked me off because it was just three shy of a million a week."" That just shows how arrogant and confident this man is. But that's not it, because he also lives a life filled with drugs and desire. This movie is gratuitous and insanely realistic about that; it doesn't hold back at all and you'll know what I mean when you see this movie. It explores that world of rich Wall Street brokers who are extremely corrupt, and it does so in such detail. You witness the arc that is Jordan Belfort's life from his start as an innocent and ambitious stockbroker looking to make his way up in the ranks, to the peak of his life where everything is bizarre and extreme, all the way to his tragic fall from grace. Along the way, he's accompanied by some diverse interesting characters, sharp quick-witted comedy, and probably one of the most engrossing and fast 3-hour movies I've ever seen. This film is so entertaining and filled with such colorful characters. At the front of it all, we obviously have Leonardo DiCaprio with yet another Oscar-worthy performance. He's such a vibrant character in this movie and his energy resonates so well that it's contagious to the viewers. He plays his role so well that you stand behind him and love him because he's so fun and silver-tongued, but at the same time hate him because he's such a despicable person. While I expected a great performance from him anyway, this is one of those times where I started to not even see him as Leonardo DiCaprio. He was so phenomenally invested in the character that every word that comes out of him is gold. And then there's Jonah Hill, who plays his best friend and right-hand man, Donnie. If you thought his Oscar-nominated performance in Moneyball was good, then this will blow you away. Jonah Hill has greatly matured as an actor and he's absolutely spectacular in this movie. Like DiCaprio, he got lost in the role and you started to not see him anymore, but instead just see that character he's portraying. On top of that, there's an extreme amazing supporting cast. Margot plays Belfort's wife, and she absolutely nailed the east-coast accent. Matthew MacConaughey's there for a short time and he's awesome. Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, Jean Dujardin; they're all incredible, and add immensely to the completion and hilarity of the overall movie. And this movie is hilarious. It's that sharp and quick type of comedy that you have to sort of think of about. It's almost like a Tarantino movie in that respect. There are so many laugh-out-loud scenes and even some where you feel like you shouldn't even be laughing, but you do so anyway. The movie goes by so fast because of all the crazy and outrageous scenes. It's a long story but it's so fast that you don't really even feel the length of it up until the end. On top of that, this film is still a serious character study and biography of this man Jordan Belfort, and there are some very serious scenes in which the tone gets really dark. While there's so much fun going on, the film doesn't shy away from the consequences and what negative results can come from living such a lifestyle. In that, Scorsese so seamlessly blends these elements together and retains a consistent focus throughout the entire film. It's astounding how well the tone can change so drastically, yet the perfect focus can still be there, and it continues to show why Martin Scorsese is such a legendary director. He brings such great style to the movie, with vibrant shots and utterly bizarre scenes that just confuse you but draws you in. It's a really hypnotic film as all the bizarre things that go on just draw you in and keep you invested, despite the long runtime. It's fast-paced and the writing is stellar. There's quick and realistic dialog, as well as so many great memorable monologues. It almost felt like Pulp Fiction wherein it keeps you so entertained for so long just because of the witty dialogs and great words that come out of every character's mouth. The Wolf of Wall Street blends such great elements together and everyone involved in the movie works so well together. The serious drama and starkly opposite vibrant comedy blend so seamlessly, while still holding focus. And the directing of the movie complements the writing to the point where the momentum of the film just never stops. The writing works perfectly with the actors as they sell every word they speak as if they're selling you a stock share. The Wolf of Wall Street really sucks you in and shows you the lifestyle of these characters, sparing nothing as it displays the great successes, the bizarre occurrences, and the dire consequences. I gotta say: The Wolf of Wall Street is my favorite movie of 2013. I can't think of a single flaw. Jordan Belfort once said, ""If you give people a good enough 'why,' then they'll figure out the 'how.'"" Well, I just told you why this movie's great; now figure out how you're gonna see it."

","Greetings again from the darkness. A brilliant and expertly made film that is excruciatingly painful to watch, yet impossible to look away. That would be my one line review. Of course, that line could be followed by a 10 page essay, to which I won't subject you. How to do justice to this extraordinary three hours of excess and debauchery? How to give due credit the craftsmanship of director Martin Scorcese? How to acknowledge the pure physicality and kinetic energy of Leonardo DiCaprio's performance? How to heap praise on a project so lacking in morality and decency? There are no easy answers to these four questions, but there is plenty to discuss.<br/><br/>Let's be clear. This is a vulgar film telling the disgusting story of a crude and egotistical scam artist who defrauded many innocent people. Jordan Belfort's autobiography serves as the source material for the screenplay from Terrence Winter (The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire). Leonardo DiCaprio (in his fifth collaboration with Martin Scorcese) portrays Belfort as the talented stock broker who soaks up lessons from both his mentor and the real world stock market crash of 1987. That Black Monday led him right into the world of penny stocks and huge commissions. Those commissions and his stunning sales skills take right into a world that rivals that of Caligula or Fellini's Satyricon.<br/><br/>Sex. Drugs. Rock and Roll. Sorry, that's not enough for Belfort. He is also driven by money, greed, power and the need to take advantage of the weak. I lost count, but surely Belfort displays more than seven deadly sins. Everything is extreme. Nothing in moderation. Belfort is both smart and stupid. He is the worst of human nature, and when combined with his charisma, becomes very dangerous. Watching him give his invigorating and over-the-top pep talks to the team recalls the cult evangelists we have seen over the years. His religion is money and winning ... never accepting ""no"". His followers eat it up.<br/><br/>While most of the movie is pedal to the metal, there are two exceptional scenes that really stood out. When a young, eager, new to Wall Street Belfort has lunch with his mentor (played by Matthew McConaughey), we sense him soaking up the lessons ... we see the wheels turning to a new way of thinking. McConaughey is in top form here. The other standout scene takes place aboard Belfort's yacht as he interacts with the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler. This agent is the closest thing to a moral barometer the movie allows and this dance of dialogue and acting is pure cinematic magic.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill as Belfort's business partner is his physical opposite, and possibly even less morally-centered than Belfort. He is also extremely funny in a demented way. Three very talented film directors have supporting roles. Rob Reiner (in a rare acting gig) plays Belfort's bombastic dad and firm accountant. Jon Favreau is the high priced attorney fighting off the SEC and FBI. Spike Jonze plays the boiler room manager who first schools Belfort on penny stocks, and sets the wheels in motion. There is also a very sexy, funny performance from Margot Robbie as Belfort's second wife.<br/><br/>My words don't do justice to the manic existence and frenzied scenes of sex, profanity and drug use. The black comedy mixed in prevents this from being the bleak portrayal that it could have been, but don't underestimate the depths to which the characters will stoop to get what they want. This one makes a similarly themed American Hustle look like a Disney flick. Consider yourself warned ... and don't think you can just look away."
"fresnomanman","9","2","9","26 December 2013"," Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect in this over-the-top portrayal
","The Wolf of Wall Street was an awesome three hours long as it careened from drug fueled appalling sexual depravity (how it avoided a XXX rating I do not know), to pathetically hilarious (spastic on Quaalude), to the tragedy of marital infidelity and divorce, to an infuriating reaffirmation of everything we have always suspected about the schemes, and scams of greed-head capitalism.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect as the loathsome self-absorbed materialist guru of greed who preached the gospel of me-ness with all of the emotional enthusiasms and manipulations of a televangelist on speed and steroids to his loyal cult following of stock selling graspers and grafters.<br/><br/>In spite of the absurdity of a life style that is at odds with most of my values there is nothing in this over-the-top portrayal of life of the rich and infamous that was unbelievably gratuitous. I do believe that the financial corruption portrayed is systemic.<br/><br/>This is an important message film about the sinister underbelly of what it means to be reckoned as a successful person in America. This is a shock doctrine for what ails our way of life."
"jdesando","Null","2","9","26 December 2013"," Entertaining, over-the-top romp.
","""My name is Jordan Belfort. The year I turned 26, I made 49 million dollars which really p----d me off because it was three shy of a million a week.""<br/><br/>For the first third of Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, I was watching the best film of the year: Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) was on the rise in the stock trading world, he brimming with enthusiasm and cunning and coached by devilish Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), a fast talking broker coach with an eye on personal profit that he makes seem almost ethical. The movie is an entertaining, over-the-top romp around the excesses of Wall Street and one of Martin Scorsese's best films.<br/><br/>In this not quite all true story of Belfort, DiCaprio reminds me of his exuberant Frank Abignale in Catch Me if You Can, and McConaughey, well, has the third plum role for himself this year, this one the most entertaining without the gravitas of Dallas Buyers Club. <br/><br/>Even Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's pudgy acolyte (some would say Joe Pesci to Leo's De Niro), is memorable in a role that will remind you of his turn in Moneyball but with much more attitude. Sales is the name of the game, and even the least educated has a chance given Belfort's genial coaching.<br/><br/>Scorsese directs acting and cuts scenes expertly with the enthusiasm of a young filmmaker but the class of a lifetime of excellence. This foray into sustained comic tone is a first for the acclaimed director as far as I can remember. He does it so well that I was laughing most of the way through the film—me a tough guy on comedy.<br/><br/>Granted, the excessive bacchanalia, which uncut earned this film an NC- 17, and the one minute shy of 3 hours, were unnecessary, a flaw in an otherwise spot-on mix of Margin Call and Stone's Wall Street. Although many of us lost too much money because of unscrupulous stockbrokers like Belfort, that world sure looks like fun under the hand of a world-class director."
"Art Snob","10","3","17","6 January 2014"," A major Scorcese winner!
","Even if I'd seen this movie without credits and completely unaware of what I was about to see, I would have known right away that it was directed by Martin Scorcese. The first person narration  the content of the narration, with many ""lists"" of characters, events, details, etc. reeled off  the Thelma Shoemaker editing  Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead  and, of course, the tone of gleeful naughtiness throughout. (MAN, what parties!) <br/><br/>But did familiarity breed contempt? Not in the slightest! For me, this was ""Goodfellas meets Boiler Room meets Wall Street""! When a three-hour movie feels like a two-hour movie, there's no denying that you were totally into it. I'd rate this as easily the best of the five Scorcese-DiCaprio collaborations (not that I didn't like some of the others).<br/><br/>DiCaprio has plenty of support from a thick, diverse cast. Jonah Hill's part could have been played by any number of actors, but he does a perfectly acceptable job while providing marked visual contrast with the lead  just like he did in MONEYBALL. The real find is Margot Robbie as the love interest  yowsuh! She almost won my annual ""best non-costume"" award (Rosario Dawson in TRANCE was the 2013 winner), and I certainly hope that she'll keep trying! <br/><br/>Is it for you? I very much recommend that you use GOODFELLAS as a yardstick. I can't imagine much of a disparity in anybody's scores for the two movies."

","I for one loved the Wolf of Wall Street. I loved the characters it was extremely funny in every way. Jordan Belfort could be one of the smartest men in business he knew how to sell everything. The F.B.I is breathing down his neck throughout the whole story does he care no because he is making so much money. This book makes you wanna become a stockbroker make millions just like Jordan did. This story is true which makes it even more tempting to become a broker or just smarter in the business world. Jordan Belfort dreams of being a rich stockbroker, but after losing his Wall Street job in the crash of 1987 he falls on hard times. Inspired by a dodgy local dealership, which sells cheap stocks to working-class people, Belfort goes into business by himself, manipulating the finance market and spending millions on his decadent lifestyle. Belfort narrates his own story which takes you in, in a way we could never understand if we didn't see it first hand. Donnie Azoff, a hedonistic putz with bizarre white teeth who gets some of the biggest and broadest laughs without ever straying into caricature. Matthew McConaughey comes and goes, but his presence is indelible, being not only hysterical but inspiring Belfort to adopt the business practices and lifestyle that will lead him to jail. Finally, though there isn't very much for any woman to do in this movie, it's worth mentioning that is excellent as Belfort's wife Naomi, slowly becoming the books conscience and emotional compass."

"nogodnomasters","9","1","3","4 October 2018"," SELL ME THIS PEN
","Golden Globe winner Leonardo DiCaprio stars in the title role of Jordan Belfort. Belfort works his way up the ladder making money in penny stocks, i.e. ""selling garbage to garbage men."" His scheme is to sell these garbage stocks to rich investors due to the high commissions. Along the way he does some illegal transactions as he runs his corporation like a frat party in ""Animal House."" Having not known money, he and his crew are ill equipped to handle it.<br/><br/>I thought that Jonah Hill gave one of his best performances. The production is awfully long, not wanting to miss out on any details. The film goes into detail to explain to the audience things like IPO and the history and effects of quaaludes. If you note the ludes he took early in the film were crumbly. Those were non-prescription ludes made from a pill press in uncle Vinnie's garage and not too potent. Later they score some real ludes. Having taken the fake ones for so long, they didn't know how to handle them causing them to crash, like the money it was too much too fast.<br/><br/>The main criticism of the film is that it featured over 500 F-bombs. It really didn't seem like that many due to the length of the production. Besides you get numb to it after the first few hundred or so."

It was Martin Scorsese, his direction was the foremost reason, I decided to watch the movie 'The Wolf of Wall Street'.<br/><br/>Its an average movie. There were two instances which where ethically nice. 1) Stealing from rich and 2) Owner writing cheque for a women in need. The sad part is apart from that nothing is considered about health, relationships, integrity, manners, respect, nothing but money and the animalistic drive to get more. In the run there was a lot of drinking, partying, and doing drugs. A lot of adult nature involved, so much that it was rated NC-17 (not R).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Graphic nature of a particular (adult) basic instinct drives men more than women. Thus my ratings."

","Scorsese is always named among one of the great filmmakers...and why shouldn't he be? He's made tons of masterful, acclaimed, and overall classic films. Even his documentaries are amazing (my personal favorite of all his films is actually the concert doc ""The Last Waltz""). He also supports a lot of rare and classic films (just look at his World Cinema project and the two film history documentaries he made, one focusing on Italian cinema and one on American cinema), and, in interviews, expresses his true love for film, which I must admit I share with him.<br/><br/>I've seen hundreds of comedy films, and few are nearly as hilarious as this film, and there are few films that are over 2 1/2 hours that are as entertaining and enjoyable as this film.<br/><br/>At times it may seem like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" glorifies Jordan Belfort's criminal lifestyle. Well...so what? All of this glorification ultimately ends in darkness. Anybody complaining that the film encourages this lifestyle obviously skipped the last 30 minutes. Trust me when I say the last half hour is extremely intense and emotional, a complete change of tone compared to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>And, this last note is to all of the reviewers that like to give films like this 1 star and then title their review ""Disappointing"". Please, lower your expectations or something! You can have your opinion, but isn't 1 star a bit harsh. This is a film that is very well shot/made and has some great acting!"

This film has some of the best writing I have ever seen in a film which is ironic since describing the plot of this film is quite difficult. The plot development of this film is immense and the change that all the characters have to go through is incredible. This huge change however, wouldn't be the same without the incredible acting from pretty much every single actor in this film, not just from Dicaprio. The best way I can describe this film is saying it's a 'word action' movie. The plot is driven by the dialogue and it's done brilliantly. <br/><br/>This film is a must see for any film fanatic if you amazingly haven't seen it already."

","Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio combine again to make another excellent film. DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort and the story spans the majority of his life. Belfort starts with humble beginnings, but when introduced to the survival of the fittest world of Wall Street he thrives to become the top dog.<br/><br/>Belfort finds the hand over fist way to make money with penny stocks, and gets a group of guys he knows together to start a hedge fund. In the process he links up with Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) who quickly becomes his right hand man. The story goes on to tell of Belfort's meteoric rise and how the riches enrich his life in all aspects: women, drugs, toys and travels. <br/><br/>When Belfort and company get in trouble with the law the film shows how they try to maneuver around it. I won't go on to spoil anything, but for me the ending lacked a final blow. Scorsese and DiCaprio have come out and said that the final part of the film was to show how it was the common people who are being duped by the likes of Belfort, but it hardly seemed like that was the message. <br/><br/>There have been articles telling of how this movie has spawned a high that some of the young generation are trying to attain. Belfort has become someone you strive to be, and that is exactly what the story isn't about. Hopefully it will be remembered for its true meaning because it truly is a great film."

I guess when you take that in to account, you would say, score it a 9 or a 10. No, I don't think so. My problem with this film, is, considering who the director is, he told a story that was not really worth telling. Yeah, there is a fine line between good and bad, blah blah blah. The reality is this was a film that was outrageous for outrageous sake, raunchy for raunchy sake, and soulless. There really wasn't an ounce of humanity to the main character or anybody around him. I am not saying we have to empathize with a main character, but I think Scorcese was saying we should. A narcissistic conman makes a ton of money by pridefully ripping people off, and uses that money to live in excess, until he is sent to Club Fed for a few years. Thank You, Martin, that story really needed to be told! Meanwhile enjoy how outrageous they were and enjoy the numerous naked chicks I can throw in. Seriously, why bother?

"jvic52","9","1","3","30 November 2014"," Why the many bad reviews? A terrific movie, if you can handle how crazy the world is that we live in.....
","I was very excited to watch this film. I have been a huge Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio fan for many years now. I love the fact that Scorsese uses the same leading actor in many of his great films because he truly knows brilliance when he sees it. All throughout the 80's and 90's we saw the brilliant performances of Robert DeNiro in his films, and today we are treated with DiCaprio's captivating performances. This film met all of my expectations and believe me I went in with very high expectations. Before watching this movie I read some of the user reviews and I saw a lot of 1 out of 10 ratings, many were saying how this movie is a huge pile of you know what..... I couldn't believe it.<br/><br/>A large number of people said that the plot was horrible and this whole movie only glorifies greed, sex, drugs, and narcissism. What I have to say to these people is WAKE UP!!!! What kind of world do you think you live in?!?! This is the America that we all helped create because for so many years we all secretly wanted to become just like ""The Wolf"". We all dream of accumulating vast sums of wealth because it is fun to think about what we would do with all the money. Have it be used for noble causes or not so noble causes...greed lies in the hearts of us all, and it drives some of us further than others.<br/><br/>THIS is the world we live in and the people depicted in the movie are the people who run it! This movie isn't supposed to have a moment where the main character realizes how terrible a person he is and tries to reconcile, and repent for all his ""sins"". This is because he isn't like your average person which is why I'm sure not many people liked this character or the film. The Wolf is someone that that a very small percentage of us can relate to. Ever heard the saying ""the rich are different""... <br/><br/>Scorsese is pulling back the curtain on the real Wall Street... it's a world full of cutthroats, backstabbers, sociopaths, drug addicts, and eccentric a$$holes. They will sell their friends out and do terrible things not only to themselves but to their families as well. Just take a look at the competitiveness when you see the scenes of employee's on the phone screaming orders and pleading with people to give them their hard earned money. We all dream of being as rich as these people but a lot of us don't realize what strings come along with all that wealth. Notice how many drugs Leo's character was on, and that was a daily morning routine for him... he named off at least 7 different drugs that he takes to get him through the day ranging from cocaine, to aderall, to xanax, to morphine!!! morphine!? These guys are high energy, high octane all the time and they have to be in order to survive. That's why so many of these people die at such an early age, their hearts simply can't handle it. It really is a sad world that these characters live in...<br/><br/>For all of those saying that the acting was terrible I simply have no idea how you came to that conclusion. I feel that everyone involved in this movie did a tremendous job. People were saying that there was no depth to the characters, well did anyone ever think that maybe because these characters aren't supposed to have depth because in real life they are the shallowest humans on the face of the earth? All they care about is money and that is the only thing that drives them... so why would there be much depth to them. Again I am really hammering this point that the Wolf is nothing like you or I. He doesn't care about jail time or how many of his friends he sells out. The only thing driving him is wealth. You have to give him credit, although he is a scam artist... he didn't get his millions by simply snapping his fingers. He is an excellent sales men and was obviously a hard worker to get to where he was. We all have that ambition inside of us but the Wolf took a chance and excelled to the next level partially on luck and partially on his own skill.<br/><br/>Like it or not people this is the ""American Dream"" and I'm sorry that too many people were ashamed to see real life on the big screen. I feel that this movies main point was just to give us a glimpse of what people on Wall Street are all about. They don't give a sh** about you or your stocks!!! They care about making money, and I know its hard for us because these people are essentially playing with our 401K's and our retirement funds.... but at the end of the day they get richer and we somehow end up getting screwed. They party as hard as possible because they are above the law... they do easy time when caught and when released they go back to that same life. While the average person gets the hardest jail time and when released their lives are ruined. We aren't supposed to fully understand motives or why these people turned out the way they did. The fact is that we let horrible people control our financial institutions and we just live with it. A good wake up call for the public and a great film overall!"

","I watched it but I felt sick to my stomach the whole time. Not only did Di Caprio scowl throughout the whole film (like he does in almost all of his movies these days), but the excess was just too much and way over the top. While I'm sure that things like this do actually happen with these greedy wall street types all the time, it just wasn't pleasant to watch. I think what made me most disappointed with this film is that there wasn't even one character that was in the least bit sympathetic that you could hold onto as a sole light in the darkness. Surely there are a few good guys out there who aren't scumbags out to steal every nickel from anyone dumb enough to buy into their promises of riches. Surely the ones cheated out of their money have some recourse. It just paints the most hopeless picture of capitalism at its very worst with absolutely no possibility of any hope that they might become human beings one day."

","The Wolf of Wall Street is a superb movie on a professional level. The actors, topnotch. The visuals, magnificent. The pacing, incredibly long as the movie is, flawless. The music, great. The costuming, great. The script, great. It's an all-around proof that Martin Scorsese knows what he's doing.<br/><br/>It's also a surprisingly easy movie to follow and keep up with, given that it is three hours long. A lot of this is due to Leonardo DiCaprio, whose sheer sleazy charisma fills and steals every scene he's in. And he's in most of them. It's also surprising how identifiable he can make his character, even though the sole purpose in Jordan Belfort's life is to convince other people to hand over their money to him and then do drugs and hookers. That's it, no redeeming qualities whatsoever, but somehow DiCaprio makes you understand what drives this man to be like that. It's certainly not pleasant to watch to world through Belfort's eyes, but it's fascinating.<br/><br/>Though it must be admitted that really the only flaw in the movie is the fact that Belfort apparently has no soul. Making the bad guys look identifiable and even admirable is a common theme in Scorsese's movies, but whereas in, say, Goodfellas, the gangsters are at least somewhat loyal to each other and function according to a code of loose honour, Belfort is just a straight cesspool of filth. A well-groomed and dangerously charismatic cesspool, but the fact remains. It is absolutely intentional, I'm sure of it, but it keeps the movie from being as great as Goodfellas, for example. At least in my opinion.<br/><br/>Still, a magnificent film from a master of visual media. Easily worth watching."

","As a big fan of Martin Scorsese, I could not miss The Wolf of Wall Street. To my surprise I found the movie not up to my expectations. I will not bother you about the plot as it already on the Info. So to begin with, directing was outstanding. Scenes that would please even the hungriest eyes, amazing visuals and pretty much everything that is expected from Scorsese's directing. Acting was also great with DiCaprio giving a performance of a lifetime trying to convince us about the lust for power and the greed that comes after that which leads to illegal financial actions, drug abuse, prostitutes and uncontrolled parties. Now, for the weakness. Absolutely no plot at all. Routine story, no turnarounds, no fireworks that can twist the plot. Just everything is centered around drugs, prostitutes, abuse of alcohol and dirty money. The whole movie is like a grand drug party. And for most good movies it's not just acting and directing but the plot that gives the good reviews and potentially the Oscars. Overrated..."

"gdavidson1221","9","1","3","1 October 2014"," Wolf of Wall Street was gruesome yet fantastic
","The Wolf of Wall Street Review<br/><br/>Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street is probably one of the most gruesome yet enjoyable movies ever screened; film critic Matt Zoller Seitz even said it was ""one of the most entertaining films ever made about loathsome men"" (Seitz). That is the perfect quote to introduce what should be the general consensus for this movie: it was disturbingly fantastic. This movie contained a myriad of inappropriate scenes including drug use of a long lost drug (now banned by the United States government) called ""Quaaludes"". Aside from the main characters Jordan Belfort and his friend Donnie popping Quaaludes almost every other scene, viewers also see the use of cocaine, alcohol consumption, prostitution, and explicit language. The movie probably goes a maximum of five minutes without seeing any one of those activities occur, which is why I use the word ""disturbingly"" to modify how fantastic the movie was. However, many people just saw the gruesome activities in the movie and could not look past them and see the main details of the film. A lot of people bought tickets to The Wolf of Wall Street expecting something completely different than what they got. When they viewed the movie, it seems all they saw was the inappropriate drug use, prostitution, explicit language, etc. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote ""If you're going to invest three hours watching a movie about a convicted stock swindler, it needs to be a whole lot more compelling than Martin Scorsese's handsome, sporadically amusing and admittedly never boring — but also bloated, redundant, vulgar, shapeless and pointless — Wolf of Wall Street"" (Lumenick). Lumenick seems to represent a large consensus of average reviewers who thought The Wolf of Wall Street was overblown and redundant at most parts. But what these viewers failed to see in this movie was the fact that it is NOT about Wall Street alone. It is actually an account of the life of Jordan Belfort, who even wrote a book which was the inspiration for this movie. Belfort's book described his life of lavish partying and addiction to Quaaludes, which was the inspiration for the heavy use of them in this movie. <br/><br/>It is unfortunate many people cannot see that the plot of this movie is centered on the man Jordan Belfort and that they expect to see a more detailed account of what it is like to be a broker on Wall Street. Maybe they need to start being more realistic and stop judging books by their covers because The Wolf of Wall Street is much more than a nearly three hour fun-fest of drugs, sex, and swindling money from people. It is an actual account of the life of Jordan Belfort, whom Leonardo DiCaprio depicted beautifully. His acting was exquisite, and the style he did it with was beautiful. He acted with an intensity and passion that any DiCaprio fan would expect. But going back to the original point: despite being packed with all the gruesome activity, the movie was overall fascinating and well worth the 179-minute viewing. Yes, it is quite long, but it is so detailed that it is nearly impossible to get bored at any point during the movie. The movie gets so detailed at certain points that viewers are able to delve into Belfort's initial thoughts when he meets his good friend Donnie Azoff. The fact that the movie included the thoughts on Jordan regarding Donnie's teeth is kind of incredible because it is an extreme type of detail which no other director would be able to make work. Scorsese's work in this movie was top notch, comparable to many of his other highly regarded films, like Taxi Driver and Gangs of New York. Oh and by the way, Taxi Driver included a highly controversial role of an underage prostitute played by Jodie Foster, yet it received several Oscar nominations. So for those critics who disagree with Scorsese adding all the use of prostitution in The Wolf of Wall Street, just look back to Taxi Driver. He made it work then, and he has made it work again. So despite many people being so opposed to the highly inappropriate aspects of The Wolf of Wall Street, it is pretty obvious that all anyone has to do is look past the title of the movie and set real expectation for this movie. From there, this movie is nothing but fantastic. The Wolf of Wall Street deserves nothing but praise for its accurate depiction of Jordan Belfort's life, but mostly for its extreme attention to detail and its ability to never get boring. David Thomson of New Republic described it perfectly: ""This is a film by Martin Scorsese, not just the funniest he has ever made but the first in which there is an authentic daring"" (Thomson). The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that deserves high praise and recognition."

","Well-directed, well-narrated, well-acted, awesome story, keeps you watching throughout; I only have one problem: too much sex. Movies nowadays have become one of the few places that are OK to show off nudity outside of porn; but there is a level that takes it from artistic to uncomfortable, and that was my feeling here. Some may say it degrades women, but the truth is that rich Wall Street execs do attract women who do actually do that. Not all women are like that, but some are, in particular gold diggers. Nonetheless, they could have portrayed this without so much explicit content (although I guess I'd have to say I have seen more explicit). Overall feeling, is if you have kids, even under 18, don't watch it with them around; but otherwise if you're a mature adult and want a quality movie, then I would recommend."

","The Wolf Of Wall Street is hands down the best film of 2013. Martian Scorsese's brilliance is amazing in films like Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, and that early brilliance really came back for this film. Scorsese really went back to his directing roots here. And Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was phenomenal. What he did to the character of Jordan Belfort made you feel like Dicaprio was actually the man who wrote the memoir the film is based on. And Jonah Hill had one of the best performances of his career. That odd combination of actors for the lead cast really scared me at first, but they blew me away in the way that they bounced off of each others energy. The script was very well put together and if you ask any stockbroker from the 90's they'll tell you that wall street was EXACTLY as Scorsese depicted it in this film."

","Filth, profanity and excessive debauchery. It adds up to make one of the most fearless uncompromising films of our time.<br/><br/>The master director Scorsese and the wonderful actor Leonardo DiCaprio collaborate to give us the life of Jordan Belfort, a stock broker. The collaboration is fearless and it is produced by these two guys themselves, that is Scorsese and DiCaprio. Thus, it gave them the freedom to go full throttle and never for a moment hinder any thing nor go for uncompromising lines or scenes. <br/><br/>Thankfully, they did go the full throttle and gave us a charming film. Yes, since this is India, probably a few scenes were censored, but thanks to censor board here who have not cut the film for the language it uses. If the dialogs were cut, the film would not have even one scene in the first places. Almost every dialog uses the ""F"" word. The best part is that they use it as if it was something divine and never even care of show any displeasure. That's what is called madness and passion when you are relentless in pursuing something you believe in. Scorsese pursues this film as if its is a new toy given to him and he must explore ways of playing with it. <br/><br/>The acting was superb by everyone. Leonardo steals the show like never before playing an out and out protagonist that involves all kinds of histrionics. Also, the other actors like Jonah Hill who plays Donny and Matthew McConaughey in that wonderful restaurant scene.<br/><br/>I am astonished by the editing department. It would have been really tough for them to edit this film. Though, it is nearly 3 hours it is not long because most moments are interesting and endearing. The dialog makes the scenes wonderful and thanks to writing by Jordan Belfort and the screenplay writer Terence Winter. <br/><br/>Mind you, there is lot of drug abuse and physical romance involved apart form the language used. Yes, it's profane and there excessive debauchery and that's why I call it fearless film making. So beware of these and if you are willing to give a way a few things like, your prejudices and even hypocrisy you will enjoy this film. It's completely for open-minded audience and if you are one. Please go and enjoy this wonderful film. It does not seem long and tickles bones even in the most awkward moments. <br/><br/>A 5/5 and still this would be so less for the master ""Martin Scorsese"" his body of work speaks of genius and this stands along with his finest work. Thanks to Leonardo, man you have made a place in the hearts of people who love great acting earlier and with this one, you are a man of great interesting subjects and you proved it producing this."

","-THE WOLF OF WALL STREET <br/><br/>-2013 / R <br/><br/>-DIRECTED BY: Martin Scorsese<br/><br/>-STARRING: Leonardo DiCaprio; Jonah Hill <br/><br/>-DISTRIBUTED BY: Paramount<br/><br/>--- Don't buy into the hype; this is pretty much a bad film. I can obviously see why people are confused and thinking this is some piece of great filmmaking, but, in a couple of years, when people get around to re-watching it a time or two, it WILL hit them at some point that they never had to feel obliged to like this frighteningly-paced movie just because it's fine art mixed with cocaine and hookers.--- Of course, as usual, when it comes to Scorsese's legendary visual style and general aesthetic, he puts on the magic without effort...and, even twenty-five years after GOODFELLAS, he is still refining this little breathtaking world of his; fine-tweaking it as the years pass and his films become more and more relevant. But, his recent effort here is pretty much a wooden nickel coated with a thin, yet shiny candy shell. By this, I basically mean that the guy's stuff is ALWAYS worth a watch, but... what was he thinking exactly? Three hours of watching people laughing hysterically in a giant office just doesn't translate for me; the fun and games always kinda feel contrived. Basically, the first third or so feels like an invitation to dance; an invitation to dance that, at some point, abruptly turns into that situation where the way-too-drunk chick at the party suddenly turns up the music incredibly loud and begins yanking on your arm while spitting in your face at the same time. The critics didn't need to brown-nose this, and the Academy didn't have to either. Scorsese has the form down pact; no one argues this, but it may just have been normal, everyday bad judgment on his part to make a film that wants to get you to Woodstock, but with a quarter tank of gas. The sex, drugs and rock-n-roll combo is never one to come up empty-handed too often, but, man, next time go with something a little higher up from the bottom of Yahoo News.

"ILoveFilm1998","10","1","3","5 August 2014"," ""The Wolf of Wall Street'
","The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a 2013 American black comedy film directed by Martin Scorsese, based on Jordan Belfort's memoir of the same name. It was released on December 25, 2013. The screenplay was written by Terence Winter, and the film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street in the 1990s. The film also features Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal, Jon Favreau, and Jean Dujardin.<br/><br/>If ""American Hustle"" divided people on whether they like the film or not, than ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" had audiences divided on the content that was presented. The film was accused by some who thought the movie was glorying the characters and their lifestyles. Or that the film didn't show what the victims were going through and how their life's were affected. And in a respectful matter, I feel they(Or you if you felt that way.) miss the point of the film, or were expecting something that Scorsese was not intending to do. He was not trying to tell the viewer what they should think, but rather show the lifestyle these people had, and let the audience make their own judgments. I find that very respectful to the audience intelligence, and makes the film have a much lasting longer impact than it would have if it had pick a side. And with that out of the way, let's talk about ""The Wolf of Wall Street"".<br/><br/>This is by far, Martin Scorsese funniest film. Packed full of witty, clever dialogue that is highly quotable. It felt like Terrance Winter was having a ball on what lines to put in the script to maximize the laughs. My stomach was busting from how much the film made me laugh. The film also uses a good deal of visual and physical humor, making the jokes form feeling one-note. If ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" was looking just to make people laugh, than it succeeded in spades. It was a giant laugh riot.<br/><br/>The humor, and the film as a whole is elevated by Martin Scorsese direction. The camera-work is vibrant, and Scorsese knows how to make the camera make the viewer sees the story form the characters perspective. That, and his always masterful use of narration makes the ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" feel less than 3-hours. However, the acting must be on par with these elements to make the package feel complete. And my goodness are the actors brilliant. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance I might have ever seen from him. Not just from how he is clearly having a ton of fun in the role, which is refreshing compare to his dramatic, but still highly stellar roles he done recently, but DiCaprio is fully invested into the role. All traces of Leonardo DiCaprio were gone, he is Jordan Belfort. Also, I was greatly surprised at how he great he is at psychical comedy. I laugh myself to the ground, literally.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill also gives his best performance as well, truly dedicated to the material given to him. Again I didn't see the actor, but the character, and his chemistry with DiCaprio is perfect. For a actor that is criticized by some for playing the same role, Hill has reached a point in his career to were he is considered award-worthy. That is highly impressive in my book. The supporting cast is terrific also, with performances from Rob Reiner and a small, but pivotal role from Matthew McConaughey that almost steals the show.<br/><br/>While ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" masterfully works as a comedy, the film stills a good number of effective dramatic sequences. After all, the film is meant to provide insight on the life's these people had, and the consequences they faced for their actions they committed. And the tragedy of it is, it seems that people like the ones in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" are destined to exist, even if they ruined the life's of others.<br/><br/>Funny as all hell, masterfully directed with phenomenal performances across the board, and even thought provoking, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is one of my favorite Scorsese films, and among with ""Goodfellas"", his most re-watchable flick. Even when it nears at the 3-hour mark, I can't get enough of it. That what incredible filmmaking does for me."

It runs three hours, and was reportedly cut down from four by Scorsese's regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker. It's a testament to Scorsese and Winter and their collaborators that one could imagine watching these cackling swine for five hours, or ten, while still finding them fascinating, and our own fascination with them disturbing. This is a reptilian brain movie. Every frame has scales. <br/><br/>Its a must see."

","Martin Scorsese's three hour epic dive into the corrupted, misogynistic and power hungry world of one Jordan Belfort's career as a wealthy stockbroker.<br/><br/>Jordan Belfort started out with a incurable lust for money, so it was only fitting he should seek a job at Wall Street's stock market. Only a few days into his time there, after learning the ways of conning and pilfering money through shorthand methods, the Wall Street crash of 1987 occurs. Without a job, Jordan starts his own stockbroker company with a ragtag selection of salesmen. But with his skills and natural confidence, the company explodes into a riotous, drug-fuelled yet successful business, and soon Jordan's (and his co-workers') excessive lifestyle begins to shrink the ground beneath his feet.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is one of the great directors in modern Hollywood, and his affinity with our lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio here has never appeared stronger. DeCaprio oozes self confidence and roars with egotistical nonsense at every turn, so sincere and compelling that he both disappears into the role and keeps you invested for the film's entire run time. This confident director/lead actor synergy pours into its supporting cast, Jonah Hill (someone I never really focus on) surprises with every scene he's in.<br/><br/>The script is almost Tarantino in its brutality and pacing, and this coupled with Scorsese's very honest directing style, makes the film fly by.<br/><br/>But it isn't exactly an easy film to watch. Jordan Belmont is a drug and sex addicted warmonger of the financial sector. While you find yourself amused and often sympathetic for his cause, his actions are insane and reckless. The film is crammed with sex, drugs and a litany of misconduct, not for the faint hearted! But the film balances its recklessness with a lot of levity through the unhinged humour of its characters. Midget tossing, anyone?<br/><br/>I guess if I had to dig at something, it is only that the story is relatively straight forward, you won't be too surprised where the characters' directions are going, but you will be taken aback by the moments they have. That and the editing seemed off slightly, I would see little inconsistencies between cuts. But, that is me being cynical.<br/><br/>Shock value aplenty here.

He's the head of this office full of crooks, who blast you with jargon on the phones on which stocks to invest in, before taking a huge slice of your cash. He is also a drug addict, a philanderer, a raging egotist, and no regard for anything apart from making more $.

For one thing, It's hilarious. The comedy here is blacker than the strongest coffee... just how I like it. Also, there are so many great lines you could fill a book of quotes. Expect this movie to be paraphrased from in the future as much as Casablanca, Dirty Harry, etc. are. There are a surplus of superb performances too, from Leo's repellent slimeball to his wife (materialistic Margot Robbie) and Joanna Lumley in a small role as a plummy Englishwoman. Biggest SHOCK has to go to Jonah Hill, who usually has the same effect on me as Kryptonite on Superman. He's the second in command of these sleazebags-in-suits, and for a change his arrogance and stupidity are perfect for the part. Well done, Jonah. I knew you could do it.<br/><br/>Anyone casually looking at The Wolf Of Wall Street without thinking might assume it condones all the immorality and depravity which goes on almost till the end. Nothing could be further from the truth. These nasty pieces of work may get their kicks from shagging each others brains out, doing lines of coke as if they were sherbet dips and buying all their luxuries that they barely use for obscene amounts of money... but are they ACTUALLY happy? There's no love here... only lust. No friendship... only dependence. Nothing wrong with aiming towards the better things in life, as long as you don't do it to excess, discarding all ethics along the way.<br/><br/>I used to think that becoming rich was worth almost any price.

","Sex. Greed. Corruption. Crime. Drugs.<br/><br/>These words define Martin Scorsese's The Wolf Of Wall Street. The movie is the true story of stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Jordan is brilliantly portrayed by Leonardo Dicaprio. I've seen a lot of films that Leonardo has been in and this is one of his best roles. He pulls off Jordan perfect from becoming overwhelmed by his wealthiness to his downfall.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot is straightforward. Jordan starts out as a stockbroker working on Wall Street until October 19, 1987 when the stock market crashes. He joins up with Donnie Azoff, a great performance from Jonah Hill. He is very different in this than the goofball he was in Superbad. Pretty much Leonardo and Jonah form a broker corporation called Stratton Oakmont. It eventually picks up and Jordan becomes a billionaire.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, it all goes downhill from there as Jordan is consumed by drugs and money. Margot Robbie is gorgeous as Leonardo's wife Naomi. Her scenes are just eye candy for every guy.<br/><br/>The character development is stellar. The movie is 3 hours long and it is the perfect length for a movie like this. Leonardo and Jonah get very fleshed out as Jordan and Donnie and how their relationship is.<br/><br/>The music in this movie is fantastic! My friend and I saw this in theaters and I remembered how I felt when Mrs. Robinson came on. I must admit that I'm 20 years old but the music they played during this movie was just astounding. I really enjoyed it. A few months after we saw the movie, I was in a restaurant and heard Mrs. Robinson in the bathroom and I started singing.<br/><br/>The Wolf Of Wall Street had it's fair share of supporting actors too such as Matthew McConaughey, Rob Reiner, and Kyle Chandler.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese does it again with The Wolf of Wall Street. All of his movies: The Departed, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York among others as received very high praise and The Wolf of Wall Street adds on to that list.<br/><br/>This movie is not for kids. It has graphic sexual scenes and very explicit use of the F word. Fun movie to see with friends but I would not recommend seeing this with your parents.<br/><br/>Leonardo has this one scene that is so funny that my friend and I were in tears.<br/><br/>Go see the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street.<br/><br/>P.S. The real Jordan Belfort wrote a book as the same title of the movie detailing his rise and fall. I might read it, but for anyone who wants to know more, he has that book."

","For me, it was like ""Sylvania Waters"", plus-nothing. A bit like chewing tea. No substance, and not much kick. I'm sure the actors enjoyed themselves. It you want my assessment, is is LAZY and LAX acting, LAZY and LAX direction and just a bit TOO much ""we know something, we won't tell..."" HUH!!?<br/><br/>Could be the script, the book or just a ""get a movie"" published mentality ... summing-up: vacuous.<br/><br/>To make a comparison, ""American Psycho"" (imho) was a good book and a poor movie. ""Wolf of Wall Street"" felt to me like a remake of ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" lacking the charm(?) of Bruce Willis... I expected a movie -- Did you like it babie?"

The idea was a good one, but it certainly didn't have to be as dragged out as it was. <br/><br/>I was bored to death after about a half hour. It is probably just me, but after buying and watching it, I sold it next day on ebay. Waste of time IMO<br/><br/>I didn't mind the plot, but I found the actors to be lacking in something.

","After watching The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2011) i though that Martin Scorsese got a grip on himself. Well, i was wrong. The Wolf of Wall Street was a platform for profanities in an attempt to prove that money is the only measure of all things in life. The box office performance might speak against my opinion, though.<br/><br/>I can only assume that the target group for this movie were the people conditioned by watching reality television. They probably think that Jackass was funny, The Hunger Games had revolutionary potential and Marvel/DC comic books adaptations were cinematic masterpieces. And when this audience gets out of the theater they might dream of becoming the wolves of Wall Street when they grow up, either literally or spiritually. After all, money and power are what matters in this universe.<br/><br/>If they get lucky in that dream space, they might strike a deal with the authorities for shorter jail terms for money laundering or whatever fraud they were up to. During the sentence they would write an autobiography and become famous. And with some luck, this would be brought to screen by a renown director."

","The film is too long ( 3 hours ) and these hours are filled with clichés and predictable outcomes. There is almost no psychology and none of the characters, including the main one, is developed and interesting in any way. The whole story is commonplace and it is not worth making into a film at all. We have dozens of repetitive situations –drugs, sex, drugs, sex etc. which soon become horribly boring. We see neither the way of cheating, nor the victims of these schemes, not even the way the authorities fight against them. I have the feeling that the whole film somehow glamorizes this way of life and this system of values by giving them too much time and attention. And there are absolutely no alternative characters and lifestyles shown. Are ALL people on Wall street like that? I do not believe it. What irritated me most of all is the almost obsessive repetition of the word ""f**k "" and its derivatives. It is repeated every two minutes or so, in every phrase by every character. It will be very interesting to see some statistics about how many utterances of the word there were in the film. Maybe 200-300 at least! Including this one: ""I f**king love you! "" This is plain stupid! At the end of the film I was bored to death and I must admit that I skipped some episodes at the end out of boredom.

This was not some random person's life story, it was based on the former stockbroker Jordan Belfort which mostly speaks about the frauds he committed. This movie was presented in a dark comedy like it's supposed to be, mainly because of three stuffs it deals, (1) drugs, (2) sex and (3) money.<br/><br/>Drugs: It was not the first time a Hollywood movie to represent this issue in raw act, but depends on whose movie it was. When filmmakers choose subjects like this they should ready to roll on any challenge that comes ahead so I believe Martin Scorsese did an exceptional job here to depict the truth as it should be.<br/><br/>Sex: It was very strong and kind of shocked to see in a Martin Scorsese movie. Like I said in earlier paragraph no matter what it is the director excelled in this department as well to extract the possible reality.<br/><br/>Money: This is a common theme in world cinema so no surprise the director mastered in this field as well without letting anything behind. But previous two themes from above two paragraphs braced this theme very comfortable blend and reached the crest of the tensed end part of the story.<br/><br/>Does it require to brief about Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill's contribution. Well, both of them were outstanding in their respective roles. And great supports from second stream actors and cameo appearances from various top profiles.

"gracenth","8","1","3","16 March 2014"," Sad truth, great comedy
","I strongly feel unjust for Leonardo DiCaprio for leaving the 86th Academy Awards ceremony empty handed once again. This year, he was nominated for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street. <br/><br/>Based on the memoirs of a stockbroker swindler, Jordan Belford (played by Leo), this movie captures the gist of the nefariousness of humankind – greed, lust and pride. Watching the movie was like being on a roller coaster ride, it started off with a good pace, characteristic traits slowly being built up but still being fueled by energy and adrenaline (more like being fueled by drugs and booze). However, it might have been three hours too long for a movie that portrays the vicious cycle of things. <br/><br/>Apart from sharing the same theme (and the similar level of shallowness), both The Wolf of Wall Street and The Hangover were in the Top 10 movies by the American Film Institue(AFI) Awards in 2013 and 2009 respectively. Despite having the strong belief in how it is these movies about drugs and drinks that have set a bad benchmark for the social norm, I feel that it is still a privilege for our generation to have a few light comedies for us to laugh and talk about for a period of time; and The Wolf of Wall Street fulfills this role perfectly. <br/><br/>A glimpse of how the rich and famous live their lives- using Franklins for paper toss and snorting cocaine, literally throwing money at people; the 3 hours for when I was watching the movie actually made me lose track of the value of money. What was running through my mind at the point of time? -""How I wish I could afford to act like them."" <br/><br/>As much as the scriptwriter did a good job of dramatizing the story, showing the audience what we would want to see in an Oscar-worthy nominee, it is sad to say that there are still certain parts of the movie that holds true in today's society. The hedgies who work on Wall Street themselves might say that the ""Wolf"" is just a mythical reflection on reality and that they are actually stressed and depressed and losing more hair than ever everyday. But hey, who is there to say that these very same people who are earning at least 6 figures per year do not squander money like napkins? <br/><br/>Ultimately, this is just another film for entertainment purposes. Being a rated-R movie, people whom this film is targeted at should be able to differentiate which parts of the movie are dramatized, which parts of the movie that are for laughs and most importantly, what is the learning point from each movie. Even horror movies have their takeaways too- never open a diary if it looks like something that is related to witchcraft. And for me, one of the most vital learning points that I got from this was to never forget where you began, especially when you're at the top of the ladder. <br/><br/>Based on the fact that it is an awesome comedy (and the fact that the lead male is Leo), I would give it 8.5/10."

"YJLcool","8","1","3","15 March 2014"," An awesome satirical film, a masterpiece of its own
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a satirical drama comedy film that's based on Jordan Belfort's autobiography of the same name, a story about a young and promising New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street in the 1990s.<br/><br/>First and foremost, it is to say that the film is not everyone's cup of tea for sure, due to its moral ambiguity, sexual content, vulgarity, presence of drugs and alcohol. We are shown, through Belfort, the dark, 'fucked-up' side of the world, in all its glory.<br/><br/>Jordan Belfort is a smart crooked bastard. His depravity knows no bounds. Armed with an amazing 'gift of persuasion' in sales and a mind filled with various illegal financial strategies that allows him to earn huge commissions on selling useless penny stocks, makes millions upon millions during his day in the 90s, which leads him to a life of drugs, alcohol, prostitutes.<br/><br/>He constantly speaks about money and the power it buys, the 'American Dream', his seemingly noble ideals, but the truth is that he is as vain, greedy, superficial, materialistic as they come. The film glorifies the excessive lifestyle it depicts, yet it is disturbingly fun to watch his indulgence in doing drugs and women in broad daylight, divorce his first wife who stood by him in difficult times for the seductive Naomi and the constant yearning to possess more money. <br/><br/>Despite his terrible personality, Jordan still manage to win you over, due to Leonardo DiCaprio's charming, powerful and magnetic performance, who effortlessly unleash a kind of on-screen charisma that's proved to be quite difficult to hate. The casting of Margot Robbie as the sexy, gorgeous and vivacious Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife was perfect, especially the scene when Naomi spreads her legs open and tells Jordan he won't be getting sex any time soon, with Jordan seemingly begging to want it, only to learn that she is in full view of a security camera in the end is simply awesome.<br/><br/>The running time of the film is close to 3 hours, the movie does feel a bit stretched despite its brilliant pacing and good story and character development.<br/><br/>Overall, while some people will disagree with me on this, The wolf of wall street is an awesome film...a masterpiece of its own. It is a film that shows how easily, quickly and thoroughly the path of dreams can be corrupted beyond reckoning.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10"

","A bit of an understatement, but it definitely has it's weak spots unlike the near masterpieces of the likes of Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Casino. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" in a way, reminded me of Goodfellas and Scarface. Both stories about a man who rises to fame and fortune, only to fall by his own graces. But that is really the only comparison I can find between them. Other than that, all ""The Wolf"" is about is a drugged up stock broker named Jordan Belfort who inexplicably figures out how to make millions in the stock market, along with some other guys who pretty much also come out of nowhere. After one meeting with Matthew Mcconaughey's character, Jordan suddenly becomes a genius stock broker and drug addict. Jordan and his buds seem to be doing something illegal, and are being chased by an FBI agent, but it's never fully explained what exactly how are breaking the law. Basically, the movie is just complete style over substance. Though it was funny and Dicaprio was excellent, that was about all the movie had going for it. But either his character or any of the other ones gave us a reason for the audience to care about them. All they do is snort cocaine 24/7, have aimless sex, and somehow have no consequences. It's like a fantasy world where everybody is completely comfortable with this behavior. This could only happen in the movies. Basically the movie felt like an unrated version of The Great Gatsby, which also starred Dicaprio. That's probably the best way to summarize it."
"rava24242","8","1","3","1 March 2014"," Scorsese's most cynical movie is still awesome
","As a dedicated lover of cinema news of a new Martin Scorsese movie excites me as much as a new IPhone excites middle-aged tech hipsters. So naturally as soon as it opened in Australian cinemas I was at the first screening like an aroused cineophile moth. Three hours later I was still excited but feeling a bit deflated like I had just come down from a Quaaludes binge. Like all of Scorsese's work The Wolf of Wall Street is no lemon, it is a brilliantly made and an exhilarating cinematic experience but is also one of the most cynical depressing movies in his oeuvre . Probably the most constant theme in Scorsese's films is what it means to be a man. From the autobiographical Charlie in Mean Streets (1973), to Henry Hill trying to be accepted in the mafia (Goodfellas 1990), Jake La Motta's (Raging Bull 1980) wild jealously or the ultimate outsider Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver 1976), Scorsese's heroes are all flawed men who bring about their own fall in one way or another. Jordan Belfort is another flawed man unfortunately his flaws happen to make him utterly unlikeable. Jordan Belfort like Henry Hill is a real person. Belfort made a fortune in his 20s dealing in dubious penny stocks on Wall Street through his company Stratton Oakmont. In the films brilliant opening Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) to Elmore James' Dust My Broom brags about making $50 million in one year and shows off his mansion, Ferrari, yacht and the fact that he takes enough drugs daily to sedate Manhattan, Long Island and Queens for a month. For three hours we see Belfort's rise, success and fall (well slight fall) A lot of reviews I have read compare this film to Goodfellas and Casino (1995) and there are clearly a lot of similarities. The rise and burn-out dynamic, the breakdown of a marriage and the fact that Scorsese never tries to put any distance between the characters and the audience; he never attempts to make a judgement on their actions. For better or worse we are all along for every filthy detail of Belfort's high energy ride. What splits Belfort from Henry Hill or Ace Rothstein is he is ultimately a country club con artist rather than an alpha male crook. What is so disturbingly exhilarating about watching Goodfellas or The Sopranos (TWOWS writer Terrence Winter was a head writer) is that even though we are disgusted by the violence there is something seductive about watching an alpha male take the life they choose. As an audience we can live our own dark fantasizes of being a 'gangster' through Tony Soprano from the safety of our lounge rooms. Belfort though is not a gangster, he is a low level scumbag crook. When he comes in contact with criminal violence he calls the police for help. Watching Belfort and his mates is like watching a gang of high school jocks out of control. We envy his success and life but after spending a little bit of time with him we realise he is a giant deuce. At best we can feel self-pity for his own shallowness and his world view but mostly it is disgust and a level of hatred that we never had for Henry Hill or Nicky Santoro even if their crimes were far worse. Despite our dislike for the lead, TWOWS is still full of wildly entertaining moments. DiCaprio's crazy Fear and Loathingesque lemon Quaalude high seems to be getting the most acclaim and internet memes but for me (sick disturbed mind I have) the scene I laughed hardest for was when the Stratton Oakmont crew discuss the problems with hiring dwarfs for entertainment. It is a conversation that would make even the St Kilda football club look sophisticated in comparison. DiCaprio and Jonah Hill (who plays his best friend and work partner) have some great chemistry and some of the dialogue between them really does sparkle. With his boyish looks it really is a role DiCaprio was born to play. He may never be able to pull off DeNiro's rugged manliness or outsider qualities but as a cocky young stockbroker Scorsese could not have cast better. What is perhaps surprising is what Scorsese says about America in this film. In Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle says ""All the scum come out at night"" here they come out during the day. They are in the boardroom and not only are they not looked down on but they are celebrated. When Stratton Oakmont first begins to take off a journalist writes a scathing article about Belfort's practices in the Wall Street Journal, rather than spell the death knell for the business it brings hundreds to Stratton Oakmont's door wanting to join. Belfort sermons that money makes you a better person but it only leads him further down a sink-hole of depravity, for Scorsese to make this film after the romantic fairy-tale Hugo (2011) represents as fine a 180° between movie type as you will see by any filmmaker. When the law eventually catches up with Belfort he crashes down on soft pillows. ""At first I was worried about going to prison but then I remembered I'm rich"". Unlike Henry who has to settle for bad egg noodles or Jake La Motta who ends a bloated shadow of himself on the nightclub circuit Belfort ends still in demand selling his 'talents' as a self-help guru around the world. If the ending isn't cynical enough already the man introducing Belfort as the biggest bad-ass ever to a class of disciples is none other than the real life Jordan Belfort. The detective who busted Stratton Oakmont is seen afterwards still riding the subway to work."

","The Wolf of Wall Street wowed me when I saw the movie. I was thinking this movie was going to be all about sex, drugs, and alcohol like all the hype leading up to the premiere exclaimed. Even though it does have all of those things in it, it tells the story of the wall street genius, Jordan Belfort, quite well. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Belfort in this film well, and I believe this is one of DiCaprio's best performances since Titanic. Jonah Hill, another all-star actor, also performs a stellar role in this movie as Jordan Belfort's best friend Donnie Azoff. I would see this movie a second time because the overall story was great.

And I must say, I did not regret it in the least. Despite being three hours long, I was not bored for a single instance. <br/><br/>'The Wolf of Wall Street', with its impeccable writing was one of the most brutal, honest and smart films I have seen. Done with a twisted, dark sense of humor, we see the effect money has on people, and its almost impossible to thoroughly dislike any of the characters, despite them being money grubbing, womanizing, cocaine sniffing, deceptive, yet extremely ingenious and dexterous individuals. <br/><br/>With the list of things that were excellent about this film, the one factor that is absolutely worth mentioning is of course, the lead, Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Carrying the film completely on his shoulders, I don't think any actor could have really stepped into the shoes of the person being portrayed and done as much justice to his extremely dense, complicated character. <br/><br/>Overall, employing a variety of filming techniques, it did feel like we were sitting through a movie of an autobiography, and of all the wall street drama's I have come across, 'Wolf on Wall Street' is by far, the best. It is definitely worth a watch, keeping in mind of course, it's high nudity and drug content. And the absolutely exemplary Leonardo DiCaprio."

The fact that he sells crap to rich people is very interesting on a meta-level.

"l_rawjalaurence","5","1","3","7 February 2014"," Biting Satire of Eighties Greed
","Following a similar thematic path to WALL STREET or (for older filmgoers) OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET tells the story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose spectacular rise to financial power and subsequent fall offers an object lesson in Eighties greed and rapacity. In terms of plot, Terence Winter's screenplay contains the usual clichés associated with movies of this type: the emphasis on conspicuous consumption, the wanton disregard of Belfort and his fellow-stockbrokers for the feelings of those around them; the brazen belief that the world is their oyster. It is the kind of world in which Michael Douglas's Gordon Gekko would not seem out of place. Visually speaking, Martin Scorsese's film is a treat: the cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is stunning, with a series of fast cuts emphasizing the frenzied existence of those whose sole raison d'etre is the desire to make money. On the other hand, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is far too long; there are too many moments where the characters exchange dialog without advancing the plot. It is a genre film, to be sure, but one that could have benefited from a more rigorous directorial hand."
"caseymoviemania","7","1","3","3 February 2014"," Overlong but reasonably entertaining movie with Leonardo DiCaprio's manic performance on the loose.
","After going 360-degree with the unexpected children's fantasy, HUGO in 2011, it's good to see director Martin Scorsese has finally back to his familiar R-rated territory with THE WOLF OF WALL STREET. Already a highly controversial movie upon its release last Christmas in the US due to its boundaries-pushing R rating (for the depiction of sex, drugs and profanity), it's no surprise that THE WOLF OF WALL STREET failed to pass our local censorship board to be shown in Malaysian cinemas.<br/><br/>WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?<br/><br/>Based on the Jordan Belfort's memoir of the same name, the movie charts the rise and fall of 22-year-old Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) who first started out as a rookie Wall Street stockbroker in 1987. On his first day at the firm, his boss, Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) already sees potential in him and eventually mentors him to become a successful stockbroker. It all started out well for Jordan, until the unexpected Black Monday (the 1987 stock-market crash) cost him his job. Jordan moves on and gets a new job selling penny stocks in Long Island, at which he manages to make a fortune out of it. Then one day, he meets Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) and quickly becomes partners after he decides to open his own brokerage firm called Stratton Oakmont. Soon he recruits more people to work for him and he gets richer as the time goes by. With so much money, drugs and sex at his disposal, it doesn't take long before FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) begins to investigate around Stratton Oakmont's illegal practices.<br/><br/>THE GOOD STUFF<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's direction is as energetic and cinematic as always. He really amazes me that even at his senior age of 71, he still got what it takes to make a vibrant cinema (even though he doesn't reaches the same creative peak he had in GOODFELLAS, CASINO or even THE DEPARTED). From the technical standpoint, everything here are aces with Rodrigo Prieto's lively camera-work (e.g. freeze-frame, slow-motion, fast dollies) worth the special mention.<br/><br/>Collaborating with Scorsese for the fifth time since GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002), Leonardo DiCaprio gives a live-wire performance as Jordan Belfort. Here, he combines the cocky swagger of Michael Douglas's Oscar-winning performance of Gordon Gekko in WALL STREET (1987) with a dash of Alec Baldwin's Blake character in GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS (1992), and even a little of Robert De Niro-style of acting method. But it was the funny side of him that viewers rarely seen from the typically-tense DiCaprio he always known for. He certainly knows how to let loose and have fun with his character. He even pushes his comical edge to the limit that you have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>The supporting actors, ranging from Jonah Hill's strong support as Jordan's right-hand man Donnie Azoff to Kyle Chandler's effective performance as FBI Agent Patrick Denham (with his particular memorable scene involving him and Jordan at a yacht), are downright captivating. Last but not least is the breakthrough performance by 23-year-old beauty Margot Robbie as Jordan's trophy wife, Naomi. Not only she's strikingly hot and beautiful, she manages to stand on her own against DiCaprio.<br/><br/>MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)<br/><br/>The long, comical set-piece involving Jordan overdoses a handful of Quaaludes (a type of sedative-hypnotic drug), at which his entire body becomes numb and unable to speak properly. During that particular scene, he tries to crawl his way out of the building and back to his car to head home. Think Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton or even Jim Carrey and you'll get the picture.<br/><br/>THE BAD STUFF<br/><br/>At three hours long, the movie is undeniably excessive to a breaking point. Not surprisingly, all the manic energy that Scorsese is trying so hard to push forward, begins to wear out its welcome. Then there's Terence Winter's adapted screenplay which feels strangely monotonous. For instance, does the movie have to be so redundant by including repetitive scenes of Jordan and his people snorting cocaine and having sex with lots of endless naked women like nobody's business?<br/><br/>FINAL WORDS<br/><br/>THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is far from Scorsese's best works, but it's a worthwhile entertainment for those who wanted to see the lighter side of him.<br/><br/>caseymoviemania.blogspot.com"
"thegodfathersaga","9","1","3","2 February 2014"," an epic tale of unquenchable desire and ruthless
","here is another epic tale of unquenchable desire and ruthless candor from an ever vital and sharp filmmaker. fueled by breathless narrative pace, Scorsese directs the madness all around not to be a by-product or an excessive result, but as a driver and engine to a story about hedonistic, escalating thrills, relentlessly fighting the normal and the boring. Belfort is an animated character, and Dicaprio is on point to channel all the energy and exuberance. he really bares his all in different ways and delivers one of the finest performances of his career.<br/><br/>this film indeed doesn't glorify nor condemn Belfort's actions or lifestyle. that's interesting because, to me, Belfort isn't irredeemable, and as such, his character is compelling and the verdict on him is up in the air.. the thing is that, actually, morality is relative; and, provided a situation where society disagrees about what is moral, which is most of time, nobody is objectively right or wrong. the value of morality really gains significance when society is introduced, otherwise, it's whatever works. Belfort's story is a great example of moral judgement being relative to some certain standpoint, and the film excels is demonstrating just that."
"Hawkensian","8","1","3","1 February 2014"," This film is not a glorification, it's an observer rather than a judge
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a rather straight forward rise and fall story, it's 'Scarface' with even more excess but without the M16 with an under-slung M303 grenade launcher.<br/><br/>Some have said that this film is a glorification rather than a satire, a three hour parade celebrating Jordan Belfort's excess instead of a stern condemnation. Despite all the drugs, decadence and vulvas in the film, I don't think the film glorifies him, and I don't think it's a biting satire either.<br/><br/>The film is an observer rather than a judge; it displays Belfort and his minions' debauchery in a grand three-hour narrative with the energy and gusto of 'Goodfellas', letting the audience decide what they think of it all. If one leaves the theatre impressed or inspired by Belfort, that's very much a reflection of them rather than the film.<br/><br/>There is a lot of bad behaviour going on in The Wolf of Wall Street, understandably too much for some people, but over the course of three hours I didn't find it exasperating like some have. In fact, I think one would possess a certain amount of sanctimony to deny that there isn't a degree of allure to Belfort's lifestyle; an element of excess should be everyone's life, whether it's occasionally ordering that £30 sirloin steak or at some point in your life owning a car that does 20 miles to the gallon, just because it makes you feel good.<br/><br/>Of course, that wouldn't begin to be enough for Jordan Belfort. His ideas on money, relationships and life in general were quite awful during his years at the helm of Stratton Oakmont, his company that employed the 'pump and dump' scheme to rob scores of investors of their money. It is Belfort's obsession with wealth, material goods and just winning that makes him quite a one-dimensionally unpleasant character. The nature of the character made me question the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>This is not to say DiCaprio is in bad form here, his performance is teeming with conviction. Leo is in his element during Belfort's rousing, maniacal speeches to his employees; his frenetic energy reminded me of Evangelical preachers found in the southern states. Of course, there's nothing remotely Christian to be found in Belfort's fervent rhetoric, only sentences of remarkable crassness, immaturity and myopia – 'Does your girlfriend think you're a f*cking worthless loser, good! Pick up the phone and start dialling! I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich!' – 'If anyone here thinks I'm superficial or materialistic, go get a job in f*cking McDonald's because that's where you f*cking belong.'<br/><br/>Despite DiCaprio's committed performance, I'm not part of the indignant crowd who demand that he finally win the Oscar for best leading man, particularly with this year's nominations. He's had a great career so far, he's worked with Hollywood's most revered artists and has had a consistent stream good roles. Although his performances regularly display his great dramatic range, the problem is his huge Hollywood profile, I feel like I'm watching Leonardo DiCaprio rather than the character he is portraying. It's the same with The Wolf of Wall Street, Leo is just too cute and popular to play someone like Jordan Belfort – the casting gives a certain amount of sheen to him. Also, DiCaprio didn't adopt Belfort's New York accent, which is a pity because Leo's South African accent in Blood Diamond was impressive.<br/><br/>While there are flashes of gross vulgarity in DiCaprio's performance, the real Jordan Belfort is worse. To his credit, he is a naturally adroit salesman, he ran a successful meat business in his early twenties, he could've probably made a substantial legitimate living with his innate entrepreneurialism. However he didn't, and now he remarks in interviews and speeches that 'making money is easy', what he forgot to add is 'when you broke the law like I did'. I'm not preaching here, I'm just reminding the crowds he draws to his motivational speeches that this man's immense wealth hinged completely and utterly on criminality.<br/><br/>The other reason why Scorsese's Belfort isn't hateful enough is because the repercussions and victims of Stratton Oakmont are never shown, and to give a properly three-dimensional depiction of Belfort's story, they should have been. Scorsese and writer Terence Winter have followed Belfort's memoir so closely that it's quite a one-track narrative, perhaps they could have stepped back from the book and explored the extent of Stratton Oakmont's damage.<br/><br/>So, it is clear that there's not a particularly complex figure at the centre of Martin Scorsese's latest film, but that certainly doesn't mean it's a misfire. This is 'Casino'/'The Departed' Scorsese rather than 'Taxi Driver'/'Goodfellas'/'Raging Bull' Scorsese. <br/><br/>For me, the film's terrific energy and vibrant aesthetics manage to carry its three-hour running time. Among this spirited, flashy spectacle are also some very amusing moments, particularly Matthew McConaughey's great performance as Mark Hanna, a veteran stock broker who teaches an up-and- coming Belfort about his new profession, from ethics to the necessity of masturbation. What's become one of the larger talking points of the film is the sequence where Belfort, overdosing on Quaaludes and in a state he calls the 'cerebral palsy phase', tries desperately to drive his Lamborghini Countach back to his enormous house.<br/><br/>Although the one-dimensional central character and its limited perspective means it is not Scorsese's best film, The Wolf of Wall Street is an engrossing, sweeping rise and fall tale that is vibrant, funny and very striking.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

The guy that Dicaprio is playing here, is as vile as they come. Obsessed with money, ripping people off, drugs, and hookers. He's the bad-guy. But isn't the bad-guy always the best character in a film? You probably wouldn't want anything to do with this guy in real life. But to watch Dicaprio giving this guy his all (Perhaps going a bit to over-board in some places) makes for a quality 3 hours worth of entertainment.<br/><br/>I didn't find that there was much of a story to be fair.

","If the prospect of the film leaves you unconvinced then firstly remind yourself that Leonardo DiCaprio is the lead role, and secondly consider that Martin Scorsese really has extracted every grain of entertainment value from the tale of Jordan Belfort. I admit I came out the screening feeling like I'd just lived out Belfort's whole life - I thought it would never end! This certainly isn't for everyone. However, I can't really say that I was ever particularly bored. Whenever the pacing faltered it quickly threw another original, strangely engrossing, drug infused scene at us.<br/><br/>This is DiCaprio's film. Ever since Inception and Shutter Island his maturity as an actor has flourished. In Django and Gatsby he delivered flair and diversity, and now, in Wolf of Wall Street, it almost feels like (but lets hope not) his peak performance. He's incredible, hypnotic and easily the best thing about this film. Having DiCaprio in your film will make me want to see it. Whilst women where cooing over him after Titanic, it's now the turn of a straight male blogger to do the swooning. Gosling, you've got competition! I wouldn't rush to see it again - reluctant to sell my life to another 3 hours of insanity so soon. However, Wolf of Wall Street is so intense and relentless it deserves to be seen again one day. There are so many hilarious, outright ridiculous moments, over such a long run time that most of them get swallowed up by its fast pace. In some ways I felt like I'd been on the same roller coaster of debauchery and quaaludes, and as a result, lost my memory of the details. Maybe wait for the DVD if you're unconvinced by the prospects of this film, but we were all consistently entertained by DiCaprio's immoral antics."
"bobbysing","7","1","3","31 January 2014"," Leonardo's another gem of an act in a Scorsese film made on a man whose life had nothing to talk about other than money, drugs and sex.
","To straight away give you the gist; here is another gem of a performance by Leonardo DiCaprio in the maestro Martin Scorsese's film which unarguably can be included among the best acts of the talented actor's illustrious career. In fact in the last decade, Leonardo remains one of those few big names who have constantly delivered some great performances in his well chosen films, reaching new heights of the art in an exceptional manner. So to be precise, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is undoubtedly a Leonardo DiCaprio movie right from its first frame to the last with surely an Oscar-worthy performance as they say.<br/><br/>Based on the real-life stock broker Jordan Belfort's own memoirs, the film talks about a particular time-period of his life, when he got insanely rich in just few years through some clever stock scams and then had so much money around him, that he started calling them ""Fun Coupons"". Having nothing else to do, he just started spending that money lavishly on booze, heavy drugs, big parties, hookers & expensive purchases like a giant yacht, a helicopter, a huge mansion and much more with a group of his chosen friends. Hence in short, this can easily be called an unpleasant yet engaging black comedy about a man who was completely dishonorable yet had a magnetic personality to know, due to his own guts and spirit of taking big risks.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese tries to being in a fresh novelty in his treatment which works superbly but is also pretty bold or even obscene in its few scenes. And that is why the Indian version of the release gets few clear cuts made in between its sexual scenes quite brutally. At around 174 minutes, the film is a bit over length and becomes monotonous too since it doesn't have anything new to say after a while. But still you don't lose the interest mainly due to the splendid act of Leonardo and some fabulous supporting acts too like Matthew McConaughey as Belfort's mentor in the opening scene, Jonah Hill playing his first associate as Donny Azoff, Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent and Margot Robbie playing Belfort's stunning trophy wife providing all the sensual moments in the film as required.<br/><br/>The eye-catching camera-work gets a great support from the intelligently designed background score & a crisp editing which makes the narration going without any major drop. And that is why Scorsese's latest venture largely comes out as a winner due to its absorbing execution and entertaining performances throughout its three hours.<br/><br/>But despite all the merits mentioned above, thinking about the film as a whole, I was really confused as I couldn't really see anything great or worth telling in the life of this immoral person called Jordan Belfort. In other words, as the end credits started rolling, I was finding it hard to find any reason that why on earth they decided to make a film in such a style on this Belfort, who had nothing in his mind all his life except money, drugs and sex like a careless, disgraceful creature.<br/><br/>Perhaps Scorsese just wanted to give his viewers 'a high' without taking any pills or powder with just his powerful screen presentation only. So (keeping that in mind) do watch THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, for Leonardo's flawless performance alone but please don't search for any basic purpose or human factor in the film, as there always is in such major biographical ventures."
"A_Voice","8","1","3","30 January 2014"," An honest adaptation of an honest account of a dishonest person!
","As much as I enjoyed this film, which is a typical Scorsese Crime drama with a many situational laughs, I found it a bit overrated as far as the award season and critics are being concerned. Yes! it is a great and well made film, but yet it has its flaws. The film induces scenes where you are forced to laugh, at the same time there are scenes which will keep you checking the clock.<br/><br/>Jordan Belfort's story is a rags to riches saga by means which are 'not strictly speaking legal'. With more money comes greed, lust and drugs.<br/><br/>To be honest, before the film I had no idea who Jordan Belfort was, so it was quite fascinating getting to know a new persona and a new scam. This year already had a similar genre movie, namely American hustle, which was certainly not better than The Wolf of Wall Street. But just like American Hustle the film had some extraordinary performances. Leo as usual, he badly wants an Oscar, he is willing to do anything for it, so it seems. Jonah is excellent, even the rest of the cast is great.<br/><br/>As Scorsese said, if this was just a 'Crime-drama' it would have been a 3 hour torture, so it was necessary to make it a comedy, which was a pretty good decision. Many people argue that the film could have been easily cut shot to 2 or 2 and half hours, but I disagree. Yes there are a few boring scenes, but those are essential for character as well as plot development. Only a few dialogues here and there could have been cut shot, i.e at max 5 to 7 minutes.<br/><br/>As I was new to Belfort's boiler room investments, after the film I spent hours reading about him, from which I can conclude that this was actually an honest depiction of the fraudulent billionaire. Even though Jordan is supposed to be a bad guy, but due to the charisma created by his character (and Leo's jaw droppingly brilliant depiction of him), I can't help but like him. He even makes me wanna be a stock broker and to do whatever he did. As he said, ""Let me tell you something. There's no nobility in poverty. I've been a poor man, and I've been a rich man. And I choose rich every time. "".<br/><br/>Direction: Typical stylized Scorsese direction. A good first person account of Belfort's life. The viewer sees the world from Belfort's eyes. Top Notch, if not Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>Story/Screenplay: As I said, it remains true to the book as well as Jordan's life. Some witty writing and situational humor. Strong. Worth the Oscar nod given.<br/><br/>Acting: Leo is just splendid. If the film was released in any other year, Leo would certainly had won himself his first Academy Award. But this year competition is tough, where Matthew McConaughey is the favourite and Chiwetel Ejiofor was certainly better. Thus he is only the third choice. Jonah Hill keeps improving himself as an actor. The time is near when he will earn himself a lead role nod. Rest of the cast is great too.<br/><br/>Music: Great, fitting, perfect.<br/><br/>Overall a good film, with some witty humor and great performances."

","For those of you who are stating this movie will only entertain teenagers and the immature adults just need to relax and enjoy.<br/><br/>I think the reason why Martin made this movie is for the everyday guy just like myself. I have a family, kids, bills etc like the rest of us. And just like the rest of us, I myself have imagined a handful of times what it would be like to have been able to live like Gordon Geeko or Jordan Belfort? Well this movie does just that, and does it very well. I don't believe in making millions off other peoples ignorance, but I would be lying if I told you I didn't walk out of that theater feeling like I should become a financial adviser aka stock broker! The days of this movie are long gone! The free market ain't so free anymore, and the internet is doing a great job educating those ignorant people and keeping their money locked away in their bank accounts. I just hope the youth don't take it too seriously.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie. It was great fun!"

","Man, the guys that made this film really know what gets an audience going. There was never a dull moment throughout what initially seems will be an arduously long 3 hours. There was great comedy for every scene that would otherwise be deemed too serious. <br/><br/>The movie's long scenes were flawless and attention grabbing. The actors were a troupe of the very best and knew their characters to the core. <br/><br/>I am not an employee of Wall Street, but I have some ideas about the way things and ideas flow there. To me, the portrayal was quite honest. Obviously, it was quite flamboyant and exaggerated, especially with respect to the amount of sex and drugs, but this was a movie. It would not have had the same effect if it was toned down. <br/><br/>One of the coolest elements I find in films is when the 4th wall is broken. Guess what? Jordan Belfort did it! It was slightly unexpected, but a fantastic surprise. <br/><br/>It seemed to me that the crew did a good job of avoiding anachronisms. I did not see any obvious objects, customs, etc. that were out of place. I truly felt immersed into the last few years of the 20th century. <br/><br/>I found The Wolf Of Wall Street to be an film with everything! There was comedy, violence, and it had a great plot. This is definitely not one to miss. Give Leo his Oscar already! Some might find a 10 too generous, but I find a 9 to be an injustice. <br/><br/>Watched 12/30/2013, written 1/3/2014."

","This movie enjoys an ingenious writer, brilliant director and a versatile actor! Jordan Belfort is a great story teller and the story line has definitely leveraged the movie. Leo DiCaprio has deeply scrutinized the character and perfectly depicts moments of happiness, craziness and vulnerability of him! I've seen a lot of criticism about the explicit sex and drug scenes which I believe are all irrelevant. Remember that the director is preserving the reality and that's the truth about Belfort whether you like it or not! I was very impressed by the movie and laughed many many times throughout the film. While laughing, the black comedy genre was explicitly perceived. Scorsese proved that he is a kind of director that is not limited to only few types of movies; Indeed, he is master in making varying type of movies!"

","The Wolf of Wall Street is an excellent film with a strong sense of magic surrounding it. All who came out to the special pre-screening in Pittsburgh were excited to see somewhat of a spectacle, and that is what we got. DiCaprio is mesmerizing, dizzying in his portrayal of Jordan Belfort. He's the guy you love to hate, and the envy of every man. The supporting cast nails it. Jonah Hill never forgets his humor, playing a caricature of sorts, and playing it well. All in all, I would buy this film and watch again, especially for the luxury of pausing. Its 3 hour run shouldn't discourage you, though. Every minute feels like a second, and the movie moves faster than most 90 minute flicks. It's worth the time and money to enjoy this. Be cautious of its content, however, as it will not sit well with everyone. Enjoy!"

","Boasting an All-Star Cast, a 2 Hour-59 Minute Run-Time, and of course, Martin Scorsese, The Wolf of Wall Street lived up to everything I expected it to be.<br/><br/>The way the film is narrated, it was very reminiscent of Goodfellas, which isn't a bad thing at all. DiCaprio was superb as Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker trying to make millions on Wall Street, with his new-found friend, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) as his right hand man.<br/><br/>Chaos, Drugs, Sex, and Adultery are just a few plot points of the film.<br/><br/>With Cameos by Jon Favreau, Shea Whigham, Rizwan Manji, and Matthew McConaughey, I'd easily shell out the $15 it would cost to see this film in theaters, and I probably will, because a screener copy is nothing compared to seeing it in the theaters.<br/><br/>9.0/10 (8.7/10 on IMDb)"
"Callum_Hofler","10","2","11","14 January 2014"," What A Hell Of A Ride!
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a film directed by Martin Scorsese, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie and Kyle Chandler, and revolves around the life of a man named Jordan Belfort, a charismatic stockbroker who turns his normal, everyday life into one of incredible riches, drugs and beautiful women, whilst engaging in illegal activities.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese... God dammit, he's a bloody incredible director! I forget about him for a while, and then every couple of years, he pops up again with another fantastic film! The Wolf of Wall Street is one of his finest, boasting a fun and charismatic cast, a wonderful screenplay by the fabulous Terence Winter and an elaborate, irresistible story about greed, corruption and a whole heap of money!<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction, in my mind, is what makes this movie brilliant. In the hands of any less of a director, this film could have been an absolute mess. Thankfully, Scorsese brings life to this elaborate, smart film. The way he tells the story is captivating, with DiCaprio commonly breaking the fourth wall and delivering monologues to the audience directly. The camera never seems to cease in movement, giving this movie a life about it, and making you feel like the party, the fun, never stops at any point. Scorsese also allows a lot of long shots, which really add to the film. He gives DiCaprio time to shine as Belfort, as the camera rolls for seemingly endless periods of time without a cut. Again, with any other director, these touches to this film could have been compromised, could have made the whole picture into a disaster. But no, Scorsese delivers in every way possible. <br/><br/>DiCaprio gives one of the, if not his best, performances of his life. He's energetic, fun, and ultimately, becomes this character of Belfort. He completely throws himself into this absurd, strange world of rich tight asses, and holds the audiences attention for incredibly long periods of time. And surprisingly, DiCaprio is actually incredibly funny within this film! There were points where I laughed out loud thanks to DiCaprio's delivery! Jonah Hill, as well, gives a lavishly awesome performance as Belfort's right hand man, Donnie Azoff. Again, he dives in and becomes this obscene, strange character, and gives the performance of his career. Smaller roles include Margot Robbie, who plays Belfort's 2nd wife Naomi, who is perfectly cast! She's beautiful, strong and matches the role perfectly. Matthew McConaughey has another small role, but his is certainly memorable, and he performs brilliantly. There is certainly not a single role I can criticise, so I'll move on!<br/><br/>This film can very well be cut into thirds. The first two thirds of this film, the rise of the king that is Jordan Belfort, are easily the most entertaining, before the final third slows down and sends us on our way. The first act ushers us into this world of stockbrokers, and allows us to get our head in the game for this 3 hour long journey, before the 2nd act really picks up the partying aspect, and we get to see Belfort flaunt his sudden wealth around. It's wonderful, to be completely honest! Who the hell hasn't wanted to be rich?! Because after this fun, awesome film, I certainly do! Seeing Belfort spend his money, and even discard it without second thought is honestly one of the most exhilarating things I've seen all year, for some unknown, strange reason! Seeing a rich person just do rich things is somewhat fun! It's exactly what I wanted from The Great Gatsby, instead of a stupid sappy love story that maintained the final hour. Fortunately, The Wolf of Wall Street never makes that turn, and stays fun and exhilarating for the vast majority of it's running time. <br/><br/>In it's final hour, the film takes a slower route, and begins to heighten the inevitable stakes. I'm going to avoid spoiling the entire film for those who haven't seen it, but I will say that despite the fact that the film turns a dangerous corner, I still enjoyed the ending. I appreciated where Scorsese took the film, and where he sent it off. It was a surprising change of tone, but one that I felt was completely necessary and didn't subtract at all from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Ultimately, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's DiCaprio at his more daring, at his finest. Jonah Hill at his finest. Scorsese at his finest! Who would've thought a 71 year old could make such an exhilarating, ecstatic movie?! The film is funny, smart and very engrossing, and not for one second was I sucked out of the film. One of the best movies of the year, and one of the best of all time. <br/><br/>10/10"
"bobcolganrac","10","2","11","10 January 2014"," Scorcese At The Height Of His Prowess
","I can't compliment this movie enough:<br/><br/>from start to finish it's just one extremely powerfully photographed, acted, edited piece of cinematic art.<br/><br/>DiCaprio shows once again why he deserves to be considered one of the greatest actors...in my opinion this is his greatest work to date. He captures a character--whether it's an accurate portrayal of the actual Jordan Belfort or interpretive it doesn't matter---and stays perfectly within that character. His emotional state is always contextually spot on: he reflects the human condition about as well as it can be done. One of the things I love about DiCaprio is his underscoring vulnerability---even when he's portraying someone caught in the throes of emboldening power. In the case of Belfort that vulnerability is often buried beneath the narcissistic entitlement, but this is the power of DiCaprio's performance....that he allows us to see within, past the superficial social self, to the incomplete child self whose wants and needs drive Belfort past normal boundaries, destructively so.<br/><br/>Supporting cast: perfect. Editing: perfect. Cinematography: perfect. Directing: perfect.<br/><br/>I'd like to single out all the other actors in this for their contributions---even in the large crowd scenes I saw not a single person who seemed not to be appropriately in character to the scene---but ALL of them are worthy commendation. Matthew McConnaghy in his relatively small appearance is fascinating. He, too, is a very polished actor at this stage in his career, and convincing as hell playing a sleazeball broker who advises a young colleague what's important to them.<br/><br/>I partially did not want to see this movie because of the greed-driven people on Wall St who perpetrated the largest theft in history and who virtually have seized control of the US Government, not wanting to immerse myself anymore in seeing them in action-----but I was glad I saw it. The debauchery, the sybaritic Caligulan disregard of all morality was eye-opening, even to me, and I thought I was pretty blase at this point about the lifestyles of privileged hedonistic addicts after years of exposure to seeing and reading about these a-holes: but it was edifying. I underestimated their debauchery, really underestimated it.<br/><br/>Watch ""The Wolf Of Wall Street."" One hell of a fine movie. One of the best ever."

","I only have praise for the script, the acting and the directing. I am really impressed, and as a screenwriter, my standards for excellence are usually high. The film balances perfectly between extreme humor & entertainment and biting socio-economic satire and criticism. And because Leonardo DiCaprio is such an eminent actor, he manages to imbue an otherwise dislikable character with much sympathy. Or at least humanity. The film is about a monster that lurks in all of us, only not all of us are thrust into circumstances that allow us to release it. The film does not preach, but it does hold up a mirror, and if one does not like the reflection, one most probably will not like the film, but this does not make it any less genius or courageous. I highly recommend it, but leave your illusions at the door, and be ready for a hilarious roller-coaster ride down the rabbit hole of excess and decadence. Plus, the three hour long runtime flew by. I never lost interest for a single second."

","This is a film about Jordan Belfort. He rises through the ranks on Wall Street in the late 80's and early 90's. He starts his own firm and starts making a lot of money. Not always legally i might add. He spends his money on a cocktail of booze, hookers and cocaine. This is a very fast paced life style. The film feels that way all the way through. Even though it is 3 hours long. Not for one minute is this epic slow or boring.You have to be prepared to see a lot of sex and drugs and violence. If you've seen a few Scorsese films I am sure you will know what your in for. The film is also very funny. A lot of laughs. This is also one Leo Dicaprio's best performances. He is funny, cocky and just so fun to watch. There is one scene where he has a delayed reaction from drugs which is so funny i was nearly out of my chair. Also great performance from Jonah Hill and a star making role from Margot Robbie.. an Aussie actress that plays Jordan's wife. This is a great film, fun all the way through. If you loved films like GoodFellas or Casino you will love this."
"malc-steve","Null","2","12","25 December 2013"," Instant Classic
","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is sure to be considered a classic in certain circles. This film will be quoted for decades to come just as some of Scorsese's finer work is today with aficionados proudly displaying the blue-ray on their bookshelves next to their copies of ""Scarface"" and ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>Much like ""Scarface"" from Scorsese's friend and fellow Movie Brat director Brian De Palma, the film is an exploration of the darker side of the American Dream. Also like Scarface it follows the rise and fall of an identifiably American icon, and contains at least as much drugs, decadence and debauchery if not the violence.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill produce outstandingly sketched and often hilarious characters and there is an extraordinary cameo from Matthew McConaughey who does his best sleaze-ball yet as DiCaprio's degenerate mentor.<br/><br/>The film is identifiably Scorsese with his trademarks all over it including his beautiful use of tracking shots. There are parts of the film with narrative structures resembling those from his other work such as ""Goodfellas"" and you feel that Scorsese is doing so intentionally with a wink before turning the outcome on its ear.<br/><br/>Sitting beside me in the cinema was a well dressed woman in her mid-50's who was clearly uncomfortable and did not find the things that the audience and I were laughing at funny at all. Those expecting an explicit left-wing screed on the evils of capitalism and cronyism (as the title suggests it might be) will be disappointed. Also disappointed will be those seeking out a neatly bundled morality play where equity and justice are clear characters. The film contains a lot of sex and ""boys behaving badly"" and is not necessarily fun all the family can enjoy. If you like ""Scarface"" and you like Scorsese's work this is absolutely a must see."

"truemythmedia","10","1","4","26 November 2019"," An Epic Comedic Masterpiece
","I don't necessarily think that Scorsese's ""Wolf of Wall Street"" is the best film he's ever made, in fact, I'm sure plenty of cinephiles would jump down my throat for even suggesting that ""Wolf"" is better than ""Goodfellas"", but as far as personal preference goes, this is my favorite Scorsese film. All of Scorsese's movies are incredibly watchable; it's just easy to throw one of his films on and get swept up in the world he creates for you, be it 1870s high society New York (""The Age of Innocence""), the modern day crime-ridden streets Boston (""The Departed""), or a Parisian train station in the 1930s (""Hugo""). No matter what kind of film he makes, Scorsese brings his masterful direction to these stories in a way that simply brings those worlds to life, and this film, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", is perhaps his most insane offering to date; the parties Jordan Belfort hosts are wilder than those attended by Marcello Rubini (""8 Â½""), he consumes more drugs than Hunter S. Thompson (""Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas""), and he gets into more debauchery than Loki the God of Mischief, and those reasons are exactly why I love it as much as I do. If there is a film that better demonstrates the allure and destructive powers of wealth, greed, and excess, I don't know what it is. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is Scorsese's funniest film, but it's also one of his most epic and brutally honest."

"cdjh-81125","10","1","4","15 March 2016"," Scorsese' Funniest movie ever and the best one of 2013
","I Have Loved every Scorsese-DiCaprio collaboration and while it definitely doesn't live up to The Departed and Gangs of New York it's is still and incredible laugh riot throughout with amazing direction and writing. DiCaprio recently won the Oscar for his role in the Revenant and to be honest he should have one for this movie instead as he gives an absolutely amazing performance as Jordan Belford who in reality is a piece of sh*t but he is a very entertaining character and steals the entire movie. Jonah Hill also gives the performance of his career with Donnie Azoff. The Wolf of Wall Street is also very entertaining which is surprising for a movie like this, but it really is particularly when Belford is addressing his employees and it's really quite inspiring and proves he does have some humanity to him. Another very good Scorsese film, Casino while fantastic relied far to much on narration to tell a story but The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't have that problem DiCaprio addressed the audience and it helped them enjoy the movie even more as it put them in the situation. Like I said this movie is absolutely hilarious for example the drug sequence featuring DiCaprio and Hill will leave you on the ground struggling the breath but it isn't all laughs and giggles this movie definitely has its dark moments when near the end of the film his wife (played extremely well by Margot Robbie) asks for a divorce and Jordan loses it and beats her then starts taking drugs leading to his daughter being injured. It's admirable that Scorsese chose not to ignore this, Belford was not a good person and this scene highlights that. With a movie that is 3 hours long it is perfectly paced very fast with just enough moment for you to breathe in between. Scorsese has outdone himself again and created in my opinion the best movie of 2013 and leaves me really wanting to see more of DiCaprio and Scorsese collaborations."
"michaelmunkvold","9","1","4","25 September 2015"," ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" makes corporate sociopathy a lot of fun to watch
","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" opens with Wall Street scumbag Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Dicaprio) bragging about his superhuman drug intake, his insatiable appetite for hookers, and the fortunes he has made from tricking suckers into buying worthless stocks. And then he tells us he is better than the rest of us peons. <br/><br/>""Money makes you a better person,"" he says. ""Solve your problems by getting rich.""<br/><br/>Like any good huckster, he knows how to play our emotions. One minute, it's like he's daring us to hate him, strutting around as if he owns the world. The next, he beckons us to join him in his selfishness... and we do, against our own better judgment, because he makes sleaze look so satisfying. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" takes us into his world, and it's one hell of a ride: corporate intrigue, orgiastic parties, and drug-fueled madness that would make Hunter S Thompson proud. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" revels in greed, amorality and decadence... and it's damn near perfect. <br/><br/>Belfort's rise and fall during the greed-fueled Wall Street of the '80s is a perfect story for Martin Scorsese: he's at his best when portraying life in the criminal underworld. Here, he makes white-collar crooks just as fascinating as the Mafiosi in ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". He empathizes with Belfort and his fellow Masters of the Universe, and lets us get to know (if not like) them. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is Scorsese's best leading man since Robert De Niro, and here he gives an absolutely fearless performance as a man with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. DiCaprio's Belfort isn't a lost lamb led astray by excess - he is just a rotten human being. DiCaprio makes Belfort both repugnant and perversely likable: he gives him a con artist's cocky charm and effortless salesmanship, so we like him even when we see him at his worst. (His worst involves scamming his clients, hitting his wife and leading his employees in a game of ""midget-tossing"".)<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is top-notch as well. Jonah Hill is hilarious as Belfort's weaselly right-hand man, playing him as a rutting, grunting bag of unrestrained appetites. Margot Robbie is both sexy and slimy as Belfort's trophy wife, who is in her own way as much of a con artist as he is. Matthew McConoughey, as Belfort's drug-addled mentor, gives a performance of inspired, lightbulb-battered moth craziness; despite only being on screen for six minutes, he injects a wild, improvisational energy that we miss after he's gone.<br/><br/>""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is not for people who like to see movies where good prevails and everything is all right in the end. There is no moral, no life-affirming lesson to be learned. Bad people simply do bad things, in part for the money, but mostly for the sheer hell of it. But it's a testament to Scorsese's talent that this cynical, black-hearted movie is great fun to watch, and one of the more intelligent satires to come to movie theaters in a long time."

But the path is paved with hilarity, especially in a scene aboard the mogul's luxury yacht, where he surreptitiously offers a pair of FBI agents everything from booze to girls to cold hard cash in exchange for their silence."
"vijayprasanna2896","9","1","4","11 April 2015"," Honestly this film just blew my mind. This a must watch film for every movie lover.
","Wolf of the wall street is my first Martin Scorsese film and I am now happy to say I am a believer in his talent. The film literally took piece out of me and I can't imagine why It didn't win any Oscars. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best here. His acting was so great that I forgot that I was watching Leonardo DiCaprio and was completely invested in his character. Another great performance is from Jonah Hill, who plays Leonardo's buddy. This guy really turned his career around these few years. The same goes for Matthew McConaughey. He was excellent too though his screen space could have been more. But hey, this film is nearly 3 hours long( short by one minute) but believe it or not, it did not bore me for one single moment. This is where I realized the talent of Martin Scorsese. His film doesn't rely only on acting but also on a visual appeal. I was completely awestruck by the vibrancy of hues, colors and camera angles that were used to make this movie a true visual masterpiece. The pictures themselves tell a story. The film is hilarious and fun to watch, it is indeed one of the best films of 2013, but what it also has is a sense of depth and a buried message that action have consequences. This is a film that should not be missed if you truly love great cinema. Experience the life of a Wall Street broker through Martin Scorsese's wolf of a movie."

"lwierci","10","1","4","1 October 2014"," Review of The Wolf of Wall Street
","In the movie, The Wolf of Wall Street, the main goal of the film is to portray the life of a Wall Street broker and the amount of fortune that one is capable of earning. With all this fortune comes temptation. The elements of sex, drugs, and alcohol are strong themes that are thoroughly shown throughout the entire movie. Some may agree that it is excessive. This movie is lengthy in parts and includes many inappropriate themes that may make a viewer uncomfortable and question how it gained permission to be shown in theaters. In my opinion, I believe that the use of sex, drugs, and alcohol needed to be portrayed in order to drive home the point about how messed up some workers on Wall Street can be but it is also excessive. There were multiple scenes that did not to be included in this movie. Along with that, there were also scenes where graphic nudity did not need to be shown. <br/><br/>While some themes were inappropriate for even some of the most mature viewers, I believe it delivered a very strong message and point. What one takes away from this movie is that the wealthiest in our country, that gain money from tricking people, are absolute pigs. Maybe not all brokers are like this, but this movie makes one think that most are. From the prostitution and disrespect to women shown throughout this movie, a female could find this movie insulting and offensive Along with the constant theme of sex, drugs and alcohol are shown in almost every other scene. The casual use of drugs such as cocaine and the use of hard alcohol can make a viewer almost feel disgusted. The fact that men like this have such a vast amount of money and use it on illegal drugs and prescription pills is almost sickening. <br/><br/>Although The Wolf of Wall Street has such crude images and concepts, it is also very fascinating. This movie really gives an inside look to the not so glorious lives of America's wealthiest. It also shows that although they may lie to customers and screw them over in order to gain money, it involves great skill. Tricking some of these people into buying stocks is something not learned overnight. People such as Jordan Belfort who can not only do this but also form a company over it are geniuses. What also makes this fascinating is ""that it's not just these characters, and this setting, and this particular story. It's the world we live in. Men like Belfort represent us, even as they're robbing us blind. They're America, and on some level we must be OK with them representing America, otherwise we would have seen reforms in the late '80s or '90s or '00s"" (Seitz). Before this movie I along with probably most Americans were unfamiliar with or have never even heard about most of this before watching it. It is alarming because this is the world we live in and this is something that has been swept under the rug for so long. While this film delivers horrible messages about drugs and how success is earned through trickery, it also educates viewers and makes them see the men of Wall Street much differently. <br/><br/>One major downside to this movie is its duration. In some ways ""it's entertaining, in a depraved sort of way, to see financial (success) Jordan Belfort abuse his fortunes, paying for competitive dwarf tossing in his Wall Street office, dropping untold fortunes on drugs and women, and narrating every step"" (O'Connell). But with all these concepts the viewer learns of Jordan's lack of morality very quickly and about midway through the movie is done with it or disgusted by it. The movie really needed to ""shift focus away from Jordan after establishing (his immorality)the experience is exhausting in the way it shovels Jordan's excessive abuses"" (O'Connell).<br/><br/>When it comes to the acting in this movie, some scenes are a lot more intense than others. I believe that Jonah Hill's character, Donnie, serves as someone who delivers comic relief. I believe that Hill delivers this very well and shows that he can take a serious role and put comedy into it. Leonardo DiCaprio I believe did a spectacular job as Jordan Belfort. I believe that this role is probably one of the hardest that DiCaprio has ever had to do and he nailed it. His ability to act like a drug addicted, crazed maniac requires skill. Along with that, he also has to have the ability to carry out his character as someone who has a cast of arrogance and invincibility about them. To do both of these things seems very difficult and hard to pull off. I believe that in general, this entire film has great acting. With the content that this movie contains, it takes a lot of maturity and focus as an actor. Lastly, this movie is a film that everyone holds his or her own opinion about. I consider it to be a very controversial film for all the content and messages it delivers. This movie is definitely not a family film and should only be shown to the most mature audiences."
"pat-davitt","9","1","4","29 September 2014"," Instant Classic
","Martin Scorsese's take on the true story of Jordan Belfort and his financial rise through Wall street was masterful. It chronicles Belfort's transformation from an eager young stock broker in New York to a successful but money crazed business tycoon. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a legendary performance as the energetic and drug addicted founder of Stratton Oakmont. The film dramatically captures the sex, drugs and other crazy aspects of Wall street in the 1990's. Scorsese perfectly portrays Belfort's rise to wealth only to be consumed with greed as he begins practicing scams and money laundering perfectly. The Wolf of Wall Street was the best film of the year and one of DiCaprio's best performances."
"brando647","9","1","4","2 August 2014"," Crazed Debauchery at it's Finest
","Who doesn't love to watch rich people have all the fun us normal folks couldn't afford in our wildest dreams? Martin Scorsese gives us more than we can handle in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, where an insane amount of time is given to reminding us how boring life is when you're trapped living paycheck to paycheck. The film claims not to be glorifying the lavish life of a criminal but, c'mon, no one can watch this film without at least a handful moments where you wish it were you in the scene. It's a surreal, drug-fueled odyssey of one conman's rise to the top and the non-stop party that went with it. It's based on the real life experiences of stockbroker Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio, in the film), how he became a multimillionaire at the expense of others, and his ultimate downfall when the FBI finally close in on him. Jordan starts at the bottom with a powerful Wall Street firm and, when a market crash ends with his dismissal, Belfort uses the knowledge he gained from his coked-out mentor (Matthew McConaughey, in a short cameo) and gathers a rag-tag crew to open his own firm where he starts pushing penny stocks to postmen and eventually upgrades to one of the most successful firms in America. His rise to power is meteoric, his illicit practices rake in millions, and he celebrates in the most illustrious ways imaginable. Drugs, cars, women, and more drugsBelfort's love of excess and insatiable desire for money and power will eventually result in his downfall. In the meantime, it's one crazy ride.<br/><br/>THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is an insane three hours in length but it really says something for the movie that you never once feel bored. There is always just so much going on; it's a rush. For the first act of the movie, we witness Jordan's beginnings in the world of Wall Street. At the start, he's just a young man with ideals and big dreams. He sees all the potential of a career in investing and dreams of providing a comfortable life for his beautiful wife. He quickly grabs the attention of big time broker Mark Hanna who gives him the rundown of how life on Wall Street really works. The secret ingredients to success are hookers, cocaine, and a talent for lying. Clients are nothing more than ATMs to line you pockets with their hard-earned cash under the impression that they might earn some extra cash for retirement. Belfort is a fast learner and uses his skills to traverse the criminal path, training an army of loyal minions and dazzling them with extravagant parties and loads of debauchery. The movie works because it gives the audience a chance to connect with Belfort in the beginning while he's still got some humanity left. By the time he goes over the edge, we're just having fun watching them toss little people and engage in coke-fueled orgies. Part of you almost wants Belfort to get away with it all because we're having fun just soaking it all in, but Belfort is still the villain.<br/><br/>It's not long before the FBI takes notice and Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) is assigned to check into Belfort and his firm. He pops onto the scene about halfway into the movie but the investigation doesn't become the focus until much later, once we've about had our fill of craziness. I loved the whole cat-and-mouse game between Belfort and Denham. Belfort believed himself to powerful to fall and Denham bides his time, waiting for the proper moment to strike while gathering as much intel as he could. Belfort's biggest partner-in-crime is his friend Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). Dude, Hill was great. His character's a rat and probably more drunk on power than Belfort himself. He's careless and crass, and this is probably my favorite Jonah Hill performance. I haven't seen MONEYBALL so this was my first exposure to Hill's dramatic side (even if he's still the biggest clown in the film), and he's awesome. The rest of the cast is loaded with talent including Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, and Jean Dujardin. With Scorsese at the helm, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET has an element of class juxtaposed with the constant barrage of nude women and drugs-crazed antics. I really loved this movie and find it an easy recommendation for anyone who was curious to see it. Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill are a fantastic team and Scorsese's film is, in a word, insane."
"azzthom","8","1","4","2 August 2014"," Goodfellas 2
","The summary/title of this review may seem odd, but it really does sum this particular film up, though not in a bad way.<br/><br/>It's the story of Jordan Balfort, a stockbroker, and his rise, excesses and eventual, inevitable fall. As with Goodfellas, it's based on a true story with some fiction mixed in for dramatic purposes. As with Goodfellas, the narrative takes the form of a story being told by the protagonist. And the plot covers a very similar story to that of Goodfellas, albeit with slightly less violence.<br/><br/>So why the 8 star rating? Simply because the script and performances are first class. Jonah Hill in particular warrants a special mention for a brilliant performance as Balfort's right hand man. The rest of the cast are impressive as well, delivering every well written line perfectly and making the late 80's live again. Anyone who enjoyed Goodfellas should love it.<br/><br/>To sum up, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a sequel to 'Goodfellas' in everything but name and matches that film's impact. Good stuff."

"mattscript99","2","1","4","23 June 2014"," 3 hrs of Scorsese getting no where.
","I don't understand how the overall rating for this film is 8.3/10 when most of the reviews I read gave it a 1. <br/><br/>I would have given this movie a 4 out of 10 (below average). But I gave it a 2 because its a Martin Scorsese's film and the expectations were pretty high and he did a very sub-par job. If I had to give him a benefit of doubt, I would say this is Scorsese trying to tell the world about life on wall st and unable to come up with a succinct story line. <br/><br/>I don't like spoilers. So I read the reviews after watching the movie. Many folks were turned-off with the endless debauchery presented in the especially long film. I think Scorsese tried to show us the reality of wealthy low lives on wall st, where most folks go from being middle class to uber wealthy and don't know how to handle life, on the upper end of the wealth spectrum. But he din't have to over-do it to drive home the point. To be fair to him, the over-the-top portrayals are a reality on wall st. I know this from close observation and a lot of ex-wall st folks on these reviews board support my view. A lot (not all) of people on wall st have scant regard for fellow humans.<br/><br/>A real low is, Scorsese not even making an effort to explain the fraud happening in the script, even though he had DiCap doing a voice over narrative. Worse, he insults our intellect at one point by telling us (through Belfort's character) that we won't get it and that its irrelevant. So, he wouldn't go into details. Again to be fair, he does show (without explaining much) Belfort smooth talking an investor into putting money on some penny stock. These stocks (called pink slips) are very risky investments. Esp. since all the risk is on the buyer and the broker makes extremely high commissions. He also shows us how Belfort takes a shoe making company to IPO and makes a lot of money off of the deal, including buying the stock for himself which is a federal securities violation. (the moral hazard!. <br/><br/>One has to understand that this story relates to the times (the 90s) when investment firms on wall st took any and every .com companies to IPO. Hilariously some of these .com companies had no real product or service and brought no real value to the market place. Gullible investors bought into the hype generated by selfish brokers and lost their fortunes. <br/><br/>For folks who are not aware of the schemes on wall st, this movie would seem like a reckless and boring frat party. <br/><br/>I was not looking for any moral take home points. We don't need Scorsese to school us. But if you make a movie about a 'wolf' on the wall st, please explain to us how exactly the character fits that narrative along with a clear explanation of the crimes. <br/><br/>My main complaint is the length of the movie and the needless and endless sex and drug filled crazy scenes. Waste of time."

","Martin Scorsese, one of the Truly Great Directors Working Today with a Filmography that is Very Impressive, is Out of Control on this one. He is not so much Over the Top as Out of His Mind. He has Lost Control of His Genius and is in Danger of Becoming Senseless.<br/><br/>The Approach to this Movie is, one Guesses, Dark Comedy. But it is not Dark.

"Turfseer","5","1","4","21 April 2014"," Occasionally interesting chronicle of Wall Street scam artist's life ends up as a poor man's 'Good Fellas'
","I like to think of 'The Wolf of Wall Street' as a poor man's 'Good Fellas'. They're both based on a true story about a character who is a moral failure and they both rely quite a bit on a narrator as well as improvised dialogue. 'Good Fellas' was primarily successful due to the strong, believable performances of Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci; both those actors were of Italian descent and they were playing characters that also were supposed to be Italian. But here Leonardo DiCaprio is supposed to play Jordan Belfort, a Jewish guy from Queens. I watched clips of the real Belfort and I just felt DiCaprio doesn't come close to capturing the essence of the 'Wolf of Wall Street' (maybe I associate DiCaprio with too many other characters in films that he's been in before or maybe he simply is unable to move beyond his own persona). One other problem is that the stakes in 'Good Fellas' were much higher: there was that enormous Lufthansa heist and people being whacked all over the place; but here it's just a matter of investors being conned (who you never get to see on screen) and an anti-hero who's prone to a life of extraordinary excess.<br/><br/>Still, Belfort's antics are mildly interesting, especially in the first half hour, where in a series of flashbacks, we see how he lost his stock broker job on his very first day on Wall Street due to the stock market crash of 1987. Matthew McConaughey is highly entertaining as Belfort's sleazy supervisor who imparts his 'greed is good' philosophy to the fledging shyster, while they dine together in a high-end restaurant. Probably the highlight of the first half hour is when Belfort employs a new phone script at the low class 'boiler room' where he's recently been hired—Belfort proves to be much polished than his fellow employees, who rely more on intimidation than finesse. Way less successful is Jonah Hill's character, Donnie Azoff (Danny Porush in real life). There's really nothing distinctive about Azoff (unlike a Joe Pesci in 'Good Fellas) except for the fact that he's married to his first cousin; Hill basically has no memorable scenes (unless you consider the ridiculous fight between Donnie and one of Belfort's drug couriers later in the film).<br/><br/>Once Belfort is locked and loaded as CEO of the newly minted (and seemingly respectable) 'Oakmont Stratton', Scorsese's strategy is to highlight most of Belfort's reported true-life escapades. We're asked to laugh at the morally corrupt Belfort as Scorsese blasts us with Belfort's outrages piled on one after another. Not all of it essential to the plot. Take for example the scene where his wife's gay butler throws a party for his friends and some of Belfort's cash in the apartment ends up missing. The whole point of the scene is to show how ruthless and greedy Belfort is, with the butler ending up being held by his legs over a balcony. It's an interesting scene but again, not essential; cutting it could have contributed to the necessary shortening of the entire film, to a much more manageable two hour fest, as opposed to three.<br/><br/>Another problem is Scorsese's penchant for stretching things out beyond any modicum of good direction (as well as plain good aesthetics). I'm thinking of the scene where Belfort is wasted after downing the Lemmon- 714 Quaaludes; after taking too many, Belfort finds himself at a country club where he's no longer able to work, so he has to crawl to his car. Yes it's supposed to be funny but the long 'crawl' just goes on for too long and dilutes whatever humor Scorsese is attempting to extract from the situation. Another drawn out scene which loses its comic effect is the yacht being tossed in the storm. After about a minute we get the idea but Scorsese doubles down on the slapstick, with Belfort and crew being tossed around ad infinitum.<br/><br/>The dialogue here is very inconsistent. One very good scene is the cat and mouse conversation Belfort has with the FBI agent on his yacht. But often, Scorsese insists that his actors improvise, sacrificing verisimilitude (one example that sounded improvised to me, was the early Belfort-Donnie exchange where they discuss Donnie's incestuous relationship with his wife). <br/><br/>While many people will find it hard to believe, most of the scenes in the movie actually happened (if we are to believe Belfort's book--same name as the film). One scene that didn't happen were the dwarfs being tossed around at the office party (at the beginning of the film). A critical scene that did not happen in real life is when Belfort slips the note to Donnie that he's wearing a wire. I understand that Belfort did this with another one of his employees but not Donnie. I think it was a mistake for Scorsese to take liberties here since the implication is Belfort is not such a bad guy after all, since he's not willing to betray his best friend (but in reality, he did).<br/><br/>Ultimately, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' would have been a much better if it was shorter. Not all of Belforts' machinations are that interesting; after a while the greed simply becomes grating. Scorsese wants us to laugh at some of the outrageous things Belfort does and occasionally we end up amused. But 'Wolf' is also a cautionary tale about not following a good path in life. Scorcese and DiCaprio are critical of the 'old' Belfort but seem to have forgiven the 'new' (note that the real-life Belfort gets a cameo at film's end). Is Belfort really a new man? Prosecutors have recently alleged that Belfort only paid a fraction of the restitution he owes, detailed in the original plea agreement. Perhaps it's time for a new accounting. That's one important point I would have liked to have seen highlighted at end of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'."

","So much was wrong about this 'film' that I was left feeling abused intellectually and ripped off for the $1.50 I paid for the Redbox rental. Matthew McConaughey's worst part and performance - was totally beyond believable. The dialog during a meeting at a restaurant when he explains how to make money in the stock market was empty and made no sense and was allowed as a plausible, albeit deceitful, business model. The amount of Quaalude's supposedly taken was not scientifically possible. But that is only one or two of the many, many believability factor fails that leaves anyone above high school level life experience, feeling violated. So that I do not waste anymore precious time on this awful rip-off story all about ripping people off, I am here in a humane effort to save others the pain. Imagine - if you will - a movie in which a 'stock broker/swindler cons a 'mark' over a speaker-phone out of thousands of dollars while the entire office staff ( 40+? ) stand directly behind him and laugh and cheer. We are made to believe that DiCaprio's character simply holding his finger to his lips occasionally is sufficient to have us, the ultra-gullible audience, accept that the<br/><br/>the speaker phone being used , is somehow able to filter out laughter ! Please Hollywood - Please Viewing Audience - if we lower the bar any further it will be grounded.

Let's be honest, the debates are merely being conjured for debatings sake, creating a major surge of overspilled gumph and clogging up the over-saturated movie blogosphere, with nauseating shock factor reviews as opposed to integrity driven reviews.<br/><br/>Thus, even if some reviews generate controversy due to subjective but well-meaning reviewers (the late Roger Ebert springs to mind), they do so with good intentions, as opposed to the quirks of gaining some extra traffic flow. A self-fulfilling prophecy if you like; as in, the more some of the controversial issues get covered in the media, the more others compete to give a worsening opinion for the battle of the more detestable.<br/><br/>Thus, by mere proxy, these battles unfortunately become embedded within the lay person's general chit chat that generates naively negative 'word-of-mouth'. Luckily, with its second weekend drop of an impressive 28% at the North American box office, it seems some films are impervious to the cheap tactics of following the leader with intent to trip them up and do one better (or worse). Without typecasting, I have come across certain grating issues that contradict, not only Scorsese's style of film-making, but also the topical, thematic and overarching ethos and style that is expertly and professionally exuded from the auteur, which begs the question – what were these individuals expecting?! So, just to point out to many a culprit; it's a Scorsese film, with Scorsese sensibilities – touching on a taboo subject and adding a darkly comedic spin on shallow vacantly void individuals. The film does not condone the behaviour of the characters (Belfont) and their derogatory outlooks as some critics have implied. Just like Goodfellas was not condoning Mafiosos; Casino was not condoning the seedy underworld of gambling and Taxi Driver was not condoning the extremely deprived nature of a sociopathic loner.<br/><br/>There are all the pervading traits of emotionally indispensable and inherently non-gratuitous voyeurism and profanity that offer the realism of the ludicrous state of play during the 80s market boom, which highlights some of the ridiculously profound situations that the characters find themselves in. The casual film-goer is not going to see The Wolf of Wall Street merely to count how many f-bombs were dropped (560) as so many reputable sources have been bellowing and ranting about, and thus, overshadowing the most important and fundamental aspect as to whether the film delivers the goods. There is nothing gratuitous in the sense that what is displayed shot-by-shot is done in such a meticulous manner as to offer naturalist and voyeuristic manifestations necessary to muster up a verisimilitude to facilitate the viewer's comprehension toward the almost unimaginable aspects, expositions and character motives whilst being suspended in a disbelief that is not only entertaining, but also darkly facetious.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street has all the ingredients, which help create a riveting, amoralistic and emboldeningly absurdest film about the portrayal of the sex-and-drugs-fuelled-shenanigans during the 1980s stock market boom. It is everything that the many flawed Bret Easton Ellis adaptations wanted and tried so hard to to be. There is no doubt that DiCaprio is the star of the film, creating such a versatile performance about a man who was considered a superhero dirt-bag; portraying his roller coaster ride in a crazy and true story of debauchery that would even have Belladonna blushing. Everyone is pulling above his or her weight in this one, including what is left of Jonah Hill's. He has the chops, as he has already proved acting alongside Brad Pitt in Moneyball, and due to the darkly comedic nature of the film, it is a role that fits Hill's niche perfectly.<br/><br/>The film's over the top content sucks you in because you feel you are part of the party for the duration of the film. This film is testament that an above average book can be converted into a great screenplay with a delightful ensemble cast, and have all these elements molded into a tangibly visual feast. Be prepared to laugh, cringe and maybe even possibly relate to Scorsese's best since Goodfellas."

","Can the film be described as graphic, explicit, even repetitive at times? Maybe, but despite the fact that it is said to be too long at two hours and fifty-nine minutes, there is a higher message here. An American message. Most people from out of the states will not catch it. This is a relevant topic. The Oliver Stone Wall Street message of, ""Beware of greed' yada yada yada. Is not good enough. This movie had to be made of visual effect and disturbance. In America, people either hate Wall Street brokers or are one of them. These are not people to be idolized, no, that is obvious from the film. But what Scorsese is really depicting is how Jordan Belfort is the epitome of the American Dream. This is not a man who is a pure-bred, a wasp, this is a man that grew up in Queens and came from nothing. Rags to riches is the American way and that fact can't be denied. Traditionalism and aristocratic high society is NOT the American way. This film is designed to humble American Citizens and show them what they are really made of. Some Americans hate the film because they do not wish to see the truth. But this is the truth, this is America, we are not higher than the nude women, drugs, and alcohol; these things make up the country. Again, it could be described as repetitive to some, but it is a message, it is a graphic brutal image that is relevant to Americans today."

","Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government. The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American black comedy film directed by Martin Scorsese, based on Jordan Belfort's memoir of the same name. It was released on December 25, 2013. The screenplay was written by Terence Winter, and the film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street in the 1990s. The film also features Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, and Jean Dujardin. It is the fifth collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio, and the second between Scorsese and Winter following Boardwalk Empire. The film received positive reviews from critics, but was also controversial for its moral ambiguity, sexual content, presence of drugs, vulgarity, and use of animals.[5][6][7] The film has grossed over $338 million worldwide, and was been nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, as well as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for DiCaprio and Hill respectively, but failed to win in any category. It is historically significant as the first major film to be distributed entirely digitally.[8]((((. being a sharper wolf in economic business gives you many ways to spend your money. watch the movie and you will know why))))."
"dromasca","9","1","4","24 February 2014"," Scorsese did it again
","'Inspired by a true story' seems indeed to be the mantra for the majority of the films in the Academy Awards race this year. A few days ago I saw 'Dallas Buyers Club' and now this 'Wolf of Wall Street' which together with 'American Hustle' are among the strongest competitors in the race and are all inspired by biographies and true stories that took place in the last few decades of the previous century. Even '12 Years a Slave' is inspired by a true story and biography but from the previous century. While I liked much less 'Dallas' I feel 'The Wolf' is quite comparable - both are remarkable movies, both throw light on some dirty and corrupt aspects of the American society, both bring to stage characters which use and trick the system at the same time. While 'Hustle' has a more original idea, 'The Wolf' has Scorsese and DiCaprio.<br/><br/>The real life Jordan Belford is probably a much less likable character than the one brought to screen by Leo. He made his fortune in the 80s and early 90s by pulling the strings and walking the dark alleys of a system which was building financial castles on sand and where the real money was made almost exclusively by people like him. The whole movie can be actually considered as a sharp critical view of a society that creates and makes heroes of such individuals. This is however a moral judgment and it belongs exclusively to the viewers - actually the film makers were quite insistent that the many scenes of debauchery in the film were as close to what really took place in Belford's corrupt empire and faithful to episodes from his auto-biographical book. Scorsese can use the excuse that he just makes a film which is fun, interesting, entertaining based on the real life story and the conclusions are yours, Mrs. or Mr. Viewer.<br/><br/>It's rather amazing for me that things that I really dislike in other movies work so well under the hand of Scorsese. The use of the out-screen voice for example which I typically hate works here pretty well, as it gives an auto-biography touch to the whole story. I would hardly bear three hours in a cinema theater if it was not a very well told story, with heroes and action that keep me quiet in the chair. Leonardo DiCaprio amazes me again and again, especially when Scorsese directs him. His hero is mean and cynical and does abhorrent things and yet he is simply fascinating. The most questionable thing in the film seemed to the ending, which I frankly did not understand. Maybe it tried to make a point that I missed, maybe it just described the anti-climatic years of the rest of the life of an individual past his wild years - I do not know. It came however too late to spoil my immense appreciation for this film."

Jordan proves to be unstoppable in getting what he wants as portrayed by his disregard of Aunt Emma's death in face of the possibility of losing $25million dollars. such brilliant storyline truly deserving of this congregation of superstars! i especially love the details in the clothes, how they evolved and grew modern through the movie. the only flaw would be, perhaps, more could be done to integrate and smoothen the abrupt ending."
"TheGOLDENWALRUS","9","1","4","7 February 2014"," Brilliant dialogue
","A simple story with complicated results of kind of a rag to riches feel but with lots of f-bombs and cocaine. Martin Scorsese brings back his protégé Leonardo DiCaprio who stars as Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the funniest hooks in years we see a midget about to smash into a target with a large group of midget-fancy idiots cheering him on. Belfort's voice over (only Scorsese can do voice over this good) explains his love for drugs, sex and of course money.<br/><br/>Belfort lives in a small apartment with his wife trying to provide for his wife as a stock broker but after an amazing words of advice by his coked-out boss Mark Hanna (brilliantly played by Matthew McConaughey) he quickly embarks into the world as a successful broker. Though he his work goes under he finds penny stocks and successfully manipulates people into buying garbage slots after he learns he can take 50% commission. This giving him the money to build his own emperor and the real fun begins when he meets the bizarre Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill).<br/><br/>Greed is an understatement for Belfour after falling in love with a barbie-like blond, divorcing his wife, illegally earning money, but he does do good as he takes in a lot of single moms and down-on-luck employees and we still love the guy know matter how many coke lines he sniffs off of hookers.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is brilliant as in most Scorsese films. Himself and a few other directors only can get the best out of anyone but his screenplay is even better here. In fact, the whole time I was on the edge of my seat waiting excitedly for the next ridiculous, comical, out of control dialogue that was to be delivered next. One of the best paced three hour films I've ever seen even over ""Blue is the warmest color"" (Great year for the three hour mark).<br/><br/>Fantastic direction even though I'm not sure how accurate this film really is. The most comical scene being when Belfour was so drugged up he had to literally crawl to his car and somehow managed to drive ""perfectly home without a scratch."" But the scene with Balfour and Agent Patrick Denham was my favorite and smartest written. Both on different levels of dialogue and perfectly executed in everyday.<br/><br/>Easily be in my top five for the year and Scorsese's best film since the Departed.<br/><br/>9.25/10 - TGW"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","4","6 February 2014"," Excessive, outlandish, ridiculous, but mindfully and expertly made
","The man made famous for glorifying the mob moves over to Wall Street — Martin Scorsese's latest, ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" based on the memoir of crooked stockbroker millionaire Jordan Belfort, is a tale of excess: money, drugs, profanity, nudity, sex — even (pardon the cliché) rock 'n roll, given the soundtrack. So how does Scorsese approach it? With excess. Measure for measure.<br/><br/>Encapsulated by the three-hour runtime, ""Wolf"" is an endless train of drugs, nudity, infidelity, flaunted wealth, cursing and political incorrectness. Scorsese wants to drill home just how outrageously this man lived his life. And just when you think you get the point, another outlandish scene will come along and remind you that you haven't fully grasped just how absurd, inane and pathetic it all is.<br/><br/>Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) broke into the trading scene in the late '80s and became quickly captivated by just how much he could fill his pockets. Adopting the doctrine of go get 'em entitlement and tribal chant taught to him by his first employer, Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), Belfort discovers the human instinct of going out and getting what we think we deserve, and it trickles effortlessly into his sales tactics. Before long, he's started Stratton Oakmont, Inc. with his new pal, Donnie (Jonah Hill), training a bunch of sleazy nobody salesmen to become experts at convincing wealthy people to give away their cash.<br/><br/>Of course his success blinds him (if not, in his mind, justifies him) to amoral behavior. He's never a bachelor at any point in the film yet he has sex with hookers, does more cocaine and quaaludes than you could ever imagine and not before long, he's laundering money left and right. Naturally, he ends up on on the watch list of FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler). An extremely troubled man who acts first and thinks about the ramifications second, Belfort's prudence with regards to his illegal activities never catches up to his ambition, so it's clear he's not a man who is going to successfully evade the law for long.<br/><br/>Scorsese's approach to this story glorifies Belfort's lifestyle, but at the same time he recognizes that Terence Winter's (""Boardwalk Empire) script speaks for itself in terms of what Belfort's problems are; the audience will come to its own realization about whether this carefree, money-driven life of debauchery is all its cracked up to be. Scorsese also understands his role is as storyteller, not moral arbiter. He doesn't go over the top to prove how bad or despicable Belfort and his associates behaved, but to show the ups as well as the downs. <br/><br/>In fact, Scorsese and his 21st century muse, DiCaprio, actually manage to make Belfort a likable guy. He's fun and he doesn't treat anyone badly for so much of the film, nor does he engage in illegal activity in a deceitful way. He even truly and believably loves his two wives in the film, Teresa (Cristin Milioti), his first wife, and Naomi (Margot Robbie), the bombshell who utterly captivates him. The film avoids the details or moments behind his decision to launder money, painting him as not a guy who chooses to do wrong, but who did bad things because his passion and gusto for making money and living life the way he wanted blinded him to his own wrongdoing. The fact that a moment in the film in which Belfort gets caught elicited gasps from the audience means the film has done its job creating a complicated character portrait.<br/><br/>""Wolf"" takes this approach to not just Belfort, but all aspects of the story, both in script and direction. Winter and Scorsese are both very interested in the notion of the drive for wealth and success being a matter of biology as opposed to money being something we are conditioned to desire. This is not a film content to just show the rise and fall of a ridiculous man and pretend it's something new.<br/><br/>Hill, who took minimum salary to be in the film, proves to be a real bargain. Somehow, he has managed to fit his comedic style into a role in a dramatic film (can't quite call it a dramatic role) and create a totally different character that stands on its own. What he does with Donnie is the very definition of making a part your own. Are he and DiCaprio the new Pesci and DeNiro? It's a legitimate comparison.<br/><br/>For a film that amounts to an overly long bacchanal, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" manages to be thought-provoking and artistic thanks to one of the masters. It might not walk away with many awards, but it will deservedly win some people's votes for best of the year and deserves to be grouped in that category overall.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio reteam once again for the highly controversial three hour long black comedy looking at the excesses of the world of stock brokers.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is a bio-pic about Jordan Balfort (DiCaprio), following him as he starts out a young stockbroker who under the mentorship of Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) falls into a world of drug taking and hard living. When he loses his job after Black Friday, the biggest stock market crash since 1929, Jordan loses his job and he ends up on a course of the get rich quick schemes, over selling penny stocks to poor people and then rich people and as his firm becomes more successful enters insider trading and any other financial crime you can think of. As he and his cohorts become richer they fall deeper into a world of excess and debortuary and one FBI agent, Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) is determined to bring Balfort and his company down.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is very similar to other Scorsese films like Goodfellas, Casino and Raging Bull, following the rise and fall of a someone and their moral decay. The Wolf of Wall Street follows that formula, replacing the violence with sex and drug taking. Scorsese does use similar techniques to what he has used in his previous films, such the multiple voiceovers and a wedding scene and the story share the similarities to the three previous films. At times The Wolf of Wall Street does come off as a Martin Scorsese's greatest hit. But even Scorsese doing a greatest hit still provides us with an excellent film.<br/><br/>Scorsese still brought plenty of flourish to the proceedings, using many visual tricks from the way the cameras and hover, mixing with Balfort's narration, such as his car changing colour and the use of slo-mo. Balfort narrates to the camera similar to how Michael Caine did in Alfie, describing events and allows audience member who do not have much knowledge about the stock market to follow the film. There is also visual metaphor such as when Balfort's yacht sinks as he world starts to fall apart.<br/><br/>Some people have criticised The Wolf of Wall Street for being an endorsement of Balfort and the world he lived in. They must have seen a different film to me because to me the film I saw was a indictment of the culture of the banking sector, a culture of excess, bullying and people who were looking for a fast buck, not caring about how they get it. These people were fraudsters who looking for various forms of highs and these were people controlling the economy. Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter were brilliant at showing this nasty, aggressive world whilst still allowing us to see well written characters and their friendship and loyalty to each other, similar to a gangster film.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is a darkly funny throughout, blessed with a script with witty lines, top comic performances and set-pieces and Scorsese's direction. It is very funny using many different types of humour, both as a straight comedy and a dark comedy.<br/><br/>There is a great cast, Di Caprio leading the front and he is supported excellent actors. Jonah Hill's stock continues to grow, giving a great performance as Balfort's right-hand man and he was able to blend the comic and serious aspects of his character. Margot Robbie too was fantastic, giving a great Brooklyn accent and she has come a long way, from the Australian soap Neighbours to Scorsese. There are plenty of excellent actors in smaller roles, from McConaughey, to Super 8's Chandler and Jean Durjardin. They are even top actors in small roles like Joanna Lumley and Jon Favreau.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is a ballsy film that is a little on the long side. Scorsese was able to make a gangster film about white-collar crime, replacing violence with sex and drugs. This is a return of the Scorsese of the 90s."

","A totally awesome, roller-coaster of a movie...! I was transfixed from minute 1. DiCaprio is a fantastic actor - I can't think of a single movie I've seen of his where I've not thought so. Also, I felt that, finally, Jonah Hill was given a character he could work with - he was brilliant. The only reason I wouldn't give this film a straight 10 (and I suppose it's actually not even a fault of the movie, really...) is that, considering it's based on a real person who clearly made a lot of money out of very many gullible individuals, in my humble opinion, I felt the ending didn't take account of those 'victims'. I just hope the reality was more 'retributive'."

","All I can say after watching this film is that I have a headache. I mean that in the best possible way. So much is going on in this film at once, that some people would find to be too extreme and OTT. This film may seem superficial on the face of it, but what I found was a great depiction of capitalism gone wrong.<br/><br/>The frenetic pace of the film may be too much for people to handle but it is what makes the film so entertaining. This is simply one of the most entertaining films to come out in the past decade in my opinion.<br/><br/>Di Caprio is incredible as always but also surprised me in the lengths he went to portray Jordan as the greedy individual he was. Jonah Hill was also a great surprise for me as were the other supporting cast.<br/><br/>This was a hell of a ride and should be seen. I don't know whether I would rank it as highly as Goodfellas but it is one of Scorcese's best.<br/><br/>I have to say, however, that the film was about 30 mins longer than it should have been. But the film does a great job of entertaining you all the way through.<br/><br/>This is a truly incredible achievement by Scorcese and lived up to all the expectations I had."

I do have to say that there is a lot of drug usage and sex, which I find kind of awkward, but that's what this movie is pretty much about. The supporting cast is great as well, and they make this movie work really well, they don't seem to be awkward in situations where I would definitely be. However, it is a very long movie, and at some points while I was in the theater I wondered when it was going to end, but there are also a ton of scenes where you don't care how much longer the movie is, you just want it to keep going. I gave this movie a 9 out of 10, because I believe that's what it deserves, and I think it is better than American Hustle which keeps winning awards for comedy, which I didn't find it that funny...Sorry, anyways go see this movie Leo is great a deserves his Oscar!"

"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","1","4","23 January 2014"," Wickedly satisfying.
","The pairing of Leonardo DiCaprio with Martin Scorsese is starting to make Marty's collaborations with Robert De Niro feel like a distant memory. As if Scorsese was a different filmmaker then and now an imitation of himself. But nobody stays on top forever and this is an apt contemporary substitute for the films on the highlight reel of Scorsese's career. That said, The Departed, DiCaprio's third and most successful collaboration certainly belongs among Scorsese's essential canon, it seems The Wolf Of Wall Street is quickly gaining a reputation of apparently deserving a spot too. The cashier at the cinema even said that the film makes his top ten, not of the year, but all-time. It ostensibly has a dedicated fan-base already. But that tends to be the appeal of such dark material in an energetic, pull-no-punches but gloss-it-up style. Written by Terence Winter, Wolf unfortunately doesn't have the sophisticated grace and tension of his television show Boardwalk Empire, but instead it's a bewitching manic tale of excess through an excessive perspective. It's self-indulgent. But this self is infamous maverick Jordan Belfort and his, note this, white ferrari. It's like Mad Men plus Looney Toons. It's wild as can be.<br/><br/>All of man's temptations are here, money, sex, drugs and most importantly power. Even though the film is about something as dry as the stock market, it's all about the non-stop masculine energy and almost every office scene predominantly features boisterous extras jostling each other rather than working. But despite its graphic depiction of the sex and drugs, there's a distinct Hollywood sheen on it all that makes it hard to take seriously. Every shot in the film is lit and framed like a tabloid magazine cover. But this is all deliberate and merely the point. This is the type of shallow and impossible life these men lead and rather than inviting us to their celebration, it reflects their pathetic behaviour. Scenes run deliberately too long to push past the silly shock and consider the humanity. It's a very interesting way to approach the film, especially one usually edited so sharply, but it's sinfully un-cinematic for a Scorsese film. While we're presented with entertaining sequences of depraved characters indulging their vices, through all the glamour, it leaves you alone into how to interpret its moral code. At the very least, it's not preachy, and perhaps the film's acclaim is its own social commentary. It's something only Scorsese could get away with, really. <br/><br/>Ironically, the film is at its most captivating during motivational speeches by its blisteringly shining star Leonardo DiCaprio. During these scenes, he's never been more on fire in his whole career. It's the closest he's come to having his charisma be infectious, which is something, although he's a reliably great actor, that he's never quite had like his peers Johnny Deep, Brad Pitt and more. Overcoming the clearly inexperienced and weaker supporting cast that usually inhabit Scorsese films are a delightful and lively set of cameos from Matthew McConaughey, Rob Reiner, Spike Jonze, Jean Dujardin and Kyle Chandler, who really help the film combat its length. Margot Robbie is great casting as his wife with a performance thoroughly sincere, but the now bizarrely Oscar nominated Jonah Hill is a different case in that regard. He's definitely undergone a convincing transformation but it's difficult to tell when his character is serious, pretending for a joke or pretending to look serious. But perhaps that's the ambiguous yet frustrating point of his character. He brings an essential obnoxious quality to the film, which is a contribution to both its lurid yet endearing charm and unfortunately also the terribly irritating aspects of the film that don't work.<br/><br/>Hill and the male supporting cast are at their most useful when they bring the best in Leonardo DiCaprio, who truly earned his Golden Globe for Comedy with some spot on delivery and comedic physicality without feeling inconsistent. Although the film may drag in certain scenes as they ramble to get to their point, it leaves you wanting more, especially with its thought- provoking final moments. Even so, it's difficult to shake off the film without feeling guilty for the suffering of Jordan Belfort's victims. Maybe this is an essential global pity that they need to require retribution, or maybe Scorsese should've mentioned them in the film more to balance it out. It does feel like he's just trying to relive Goodfellas. There's no denying that it shares similar attributes with its kinetic camera-work, snarky voice-over, rocking soundtrack, monumental runtime, smoking money and kicking down of the fourth wall. But what could've been an exhilarating and devastating ride is just an engaging, intriguing and occasionally ghastly one. Perhaps he's compensating for the misfired Hugo. If so, fine, you're forgiven. The Wolf Of Wall Street is wickedly satisfying for now. Now give us something with weight. Bring us Silence already.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Whilst not a film for everyone, this production really does deliver a punch. DiCaprio is absolutely compellingly right for this role - really gives him opportunity to show his range and ability. Who knew that you could fall down a short flight of steps in so many ways! Full marks to the screenplay/writing. Everything has a natural flow and feels right for the period. Supporting actors are well chosen and are worth following throughout....hidden 'back stories can be detected' via these characters - quite a feat given how 'busy' the main story is. Saying that, however, you will occasionally check your watch....how much more of this do we have to watch.....well, that gives the other side of the Wall Street/Investments story. To con their marks the whole lot of these people resort to stimulants, uppers, downers, anaesthetisers and all manner of other anti-social kicks. Reality seems a long way from where these people go. And so it was."

","I have just watched ""the wolf of wall street"" what an amazing movie and it is definitely one of the best collaborations between Scorsese and Di Caprio to date. Running at 3hrs in length the film never once drags, it is a very fast paced movie with Scorsese managing to capture the essence and hedonism that ran wild through wall street during the 80's and 90's. Performance wise Di Caprio, as always, is magnificent, once again showing the world what a gifted and talented and versatile actor he is, if he is snubbed by the Oscars again then it is a complete travesty. Jonah hill has gave what I think is his best performance ever to date and manages to cross over to drama flawlessly, he is definitely one to keep an eye on in the future. <br/><br/>The only issue I have with the film is that after reading the book first there were a few scenes I was looking forward to seeing but they were either left out entirely or merged with other events that took place and the ending was changed quite significantly from the book and felt kinda rushed, if it was not for then then it would of got 10 stars.<br/><br/>All in all a very good film and not to be missed."
"paddyrossi-681-69534","7","1","4","16 January 2014"," After reading the book(s)..the movie was disappointing
","When I read the books (the wolf., and Catching the wolf) I remember thinking this would be a great Scorsese movie, even before I knew he was gonna make it. The first book especially has Scorsese written all over it. Now, I understand fully, the way some characters are missing, etc.. So, that's not my complain. My complain is that Jordan Belfort like Henry Hill are ""lovable"" cause they are you average low-lifes who end up with lots of money. So, they border on the cool side..But you get the feeling their coolness has a time clock and it's gonna end soon. In the movie goodfellas you get that feeling, and the book 'Wolf' you get that same feeling from Jordan. I love DiCaprio (I think in movies like Departed he oozes charisma, and in ""Total Eclipse"" He IS RIMBAUD, as I've always imaged him-freaking flawless performance). But in this one, it seems he's playing Belford (60%) of the time and the other 40% he's just being himself. I found it an Empty performance. Maybe he had to many 'yes-man' around, and he lost it. Albeit, the movie was funny in bits. But overall I found it empty. The book was more gritty, the depraved Chinaman was a despicable characters. In every Bo Dielt scene you could smell that Scorsese's new york. In the movie he appears in one fast scene. The racist limo driver was fun. In the movie the only one that shines is Jonah Hill(I was very,very,very,very surprised..I think HE should have won best supporting actor. What a good actor). So, If you've read the book..then don't believe the hype and go see it without expecting much."
"danew13","8","1","4","15 January 2014"," Great, but hard to believe performances in a film a bit too long
","DiCaprio and especially Jonah Hill produce career best work in a fast paced film that once again exposes the evils of Wall Street. The main criticisms of Wolf are it being too long and repetitive. I mean how much and how many drugs can a person take at one time to not die? This films tries to show that. It should have been at least 30 minutes shorter.<br/><br/>Scorsese tells the story as he did in the Goodfellas, with an off screen narrative. Yet, he fails, in his wrap-up, to show what happened to Jonah Hill's character. And in one serious script error, when DiCaprio's wife is leaving him, he says your not taking my children. Yet, we only ever see or hear of one young daughter.<br/><br/>It would be nice to see films once in awhile that aren't about criminal types...but about people who become wealthy honestly...we had the Social Network...How about the Bill Gates story? But, maybe they're just too boring. Crooks are so much more fun."

","The movie keeps you excited about what's coming up next every minute of the movie. Its got classic touch of adult language that has always popped out eye balls of every movie goer till times immemorial. The acting by Leonardo di Caprio ( much that I'm a ardent fan) is beyond anything I've ever seen of him. He's truly put in his entire life with every bit of white n red cell of his body into the film. The writer .... i was reminded of the 7 deadly sins so i'll put it this way, the screenplay writer is surely inflicted with lust and greed. The erotic touch with the successful arrogance is overwhelming and incredible. The comic timing is brilliant, some places I saw some people fall off their sofa seats in the theatre with the brilliant acts. Editing of the flick could've been slightly better.

"bhaveshbhatia","7","1","4","12 January 2014"," The Wolf of Wall Street: An Unrealistic Journey of a Real Man
","The Wolf of Wall Street released on December 25 2013. It is a black comedy based on Jordan Belfort's memoir of the same name. The film is directed and produced by Martin Scorsese, with screenplay by Terence Winter and stars Leonardo Dicaprio (who is also a co-producer), Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey. It is delightful for any full time writer to write a review on this film.<br/><br/>The film is a true story of Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He was a Long Island penny stockbroker who had to serve 36 months in prison because he cheated investors in a 1990s securities fraud. This fraudulent activity exposed corruption in Wall Street and banking sector. This is a retelling of a tale where a simple man is swept away by his ambition. He loses his away and gets entangled in an unholy world of money, substance abuse, a troubled family and lies to carve his own world where no body is allowed entry. This is a story of white collar crime where important and known heads would roll if deep secrets are divulged. Belfort and his employees led a life filled with lavish parties and where drugs and sex was a part of their personal as well as professional life. Convicted in 1998, Belfort later became a speaker on sales techniques.<br/><br/>Throughout the film Scorsese does not glorifies him, rather brings his excesses to the fore. He shown Belfort's flamboyance in the initial days but shows no pity during his lowest lows. Though it is questionable as to how close to truth the facts are, but sometimes it is impossible to digest the extreme turn of events. The film is a telling criticism of the American dream where people spend their lives in pursuit of money and success – whether by hook or crook. The film's photography and editing is top notch with Leonardo DiCaprio excelling as the titular character. All the supporting characters succeed in convincingly portraying their characters. There is some resemblance with The Goodfellas or Casino, but here the villain is not a gun toting mafia leader. Rather they are apparently respectable people who wear suits, work in proper offices and spend their time in conducting business. But paradoxically, their reputable profession foils their criminal activities.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's brilliance turns this serious black comedy into an uproarious karmic comedy. Though teeming with narcotics, nudity and slang, this film does not repulse the audience. On the contrary, this is one of the best films of 2013. It is defiant, indecent, rebellious and rude and viewers will be positively content with it. I just wish they hadn't glorified all the wrong Belfort did in his life the way they did."

It was totally different from MR Scoreses's usual style...<br/><br/>I think he was experimenting with the 'reality' type style in this movie.... Like District 9, Paranormal activity...<br/><br/>1) There was very little editing (or so it seemed) - There were several scenes in this movie in which seemingly pointless conversations went on and on ( i noticed several people sitting around me, including my wife, falling asleep !!!!) ... Not at all Martin Scorsese's style!! <br/><br/>2) very appealing to guys who still find dirty jokes hilarious, but not too appealing for those looking for some mature stuff!! the debauchery and vulgarity DiCaprio and his friends resorted to, were the only high points in this movie---- no emotional scenes or any inspiring scenes as in aviator..... my point is - the vulgarity made us laugh , as if we were watching some comedy show,,,, and at the end of the movie we got up, went home and forgot about the movie,, no feeling of ""WOW!!"" or ""MAN!!!"" at the end,,,,, it was that kinda entertainment... <br/><br/>N that's why for guys who absolutely loved Aviator and The Departed would find this movie a tad mediocre..."
"danj127","8","1","4","31 December 2013"," I enjoyed the film but too long
","I enjoyed the movie. That being said it was too long. Typical of what happens when you have a celebrity director (who is amazing by the way) has final cut and can't leave anything on the floor. The debauchery was well established so could have easily cut 30-45 min from movie and the storyline would have been much tighter. I found it to be great adult escapism and so well directed and acted you have to respect the effort. I am basically the same age as Jordan Belfort so the film is great nostalgia visually. We live in such different times with the populist movement and attack on capitalism. If you read history there has always been excess on Wall Street but that being said it is Wall Street that consolidated capital to build America and fuel the technological advances that have improved the lives of countless millions. I would take 100 Jordan Belfort's in the system as opposed to the progressive movement of collectivism that treats capital as a finite commodity."

"poitevinpm","10","2","14","28 December 2013"," Excellent !
","For complete review: whatruwatching.wordpress.com<br/><br/>I went to see ""The wolf of Wall street"" yesterday night. I was with a friend, and really unprepared (I didn't even know the title of the movie or the name of the actors in it an hour before the beginning). Anyways, the tale is about a stock broker (someone whose job is to sell stocks and take commission on it, a kind of salesman actually) who builds his company in the 1990s and makes a huge amount a money out of it. Drugs, prostitution, dirty money are all there to complete the picture! As I have seen it in the movies, and don't own a copy nor was able to take any note, it is a lot harder to cite precise quotations and have a complete scene analysis (I know I am being totally unprofessional here). There are many awesome scenes to take out from this excellent movie. At the beginning of the movie, we see how the main character ""morale"" was settle during his first day of work by his senior manager that basically say him to take cocaine to stay sharp, to take prostitutes or relieve himself often enough to keep his calm, and not to care about the client: only thing that matters is how much money you make. One thing here is that I don't really want to get into a debate about whether this is all real or not, nor just spit on all traders and stock brokers of Wall street. The important is that during this scene, during which we see the main character (Leonardo DiCaprio) decline wine and cocaine offer, substances he will abuse all along the movie. Jordan Belfort (main character) gets really good at selling anything to anyone, but he also knows how to teach it. He takes some friends from high school for which you can't really say they are smart neither educated, but he teaches them how to sell, and soon becomes the CEO of a fastly growing and hot company. In his own company he is a guru, treated like a semi-god, and the working environment is described as totally decadent (booze, drugs, prostitutes...). I have to acknowledge how funny this movie is, situations are often funny, characters are funny, dialogs are awesome. I was expecting more of a drama, but I enjoyed this light hearted mood of the movie. On the other side of course, some couple scenes between Jordan and his second wife shows what is really going on. And if you stop one minute on Jordan's wife, you can see that she doesn't make much sense, she expects all the money, the parties, the good parts, without the bad parts that are in Jordan's case intimately tied to the good parts: drug addiction, sex addiction, insatiable hunger for money and success. This couple is a key in the movie to, and it is explained at some point that the solution if you have any problem with you wife is ""pick up the damn phone"" (and make more money). This solution, money, is driving Jordan form A to Z in this movie. The character of Jordan is very inspiring and likable, it is really depicted as a hero, despite all his ""side-effects"". It is inspiring because after all nobody wants to be left aside, everybody wants the lion's share and be a success, and he is incarnating it perfectly. Seeing this man in action gives you hunger for money and fame ! It depends on which side you are at the end, but it could change your subway trips for a moment after you see the movie."
"Amari-Sali","9","2","15","25 December 2013"," The Wolf of Wall Street, undoubtedly is one of Leo's best performances, and makes it seem that Oscar may finally be in his grasp.
","When Martin Scorsese puts his name on a film, you know that quality is to be expected. Then, with his most recent muse Leonardo DiCaprio being in the lead role, it is almost impossible to imagine them working together leading to something horrible. After all, they are like a more refined, and dependable, version of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>As for the film, the story focuses on one Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who is this highly charismatic man whose ability to inspire is comparable to that of the great villains of history or literature. However, like many villains, things didn't start off with him going down the wrong path. When we first meet Jordan, he may not be a saint, but his conscious is clean. He has a wife Teresa (played by Cristin Milioti), and simply wants to live a life where monetary worries are something which are foreign and something simply seen on the news. So, with his first entry level job he meets a man named Mark Hanna (played by Matthew McConaughey) who not only mentors him, but is the figure which begins to change Jordan from the man Teresa fell in love with, to a character who you can't take your eyes off of.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Jordan though, after finally passing his series 7 exam, to be an official stockbroker, Black Monday happens. With this event, Jordan is out of a job and Mark is out of his life. However, with Mark introducing him to the taste of the life he always wanted, and Jordan having that old school American, pull yourself up by the bootstraps, mentality, he decides to not let this setback kill his vision of the new American dream: getting rich. So, he first starts out doing penny stocks and then begins building an empire with his workers being the downtrodden of the world, making him rise to a level where he almost seems like Hitler without an army or anti-Semitic views. Alongside him is a man who helps see his dreams come true, and push them to ruin: Donnie Azoff (played by Jonah Hill). Making for an overall adventure in which we see the usual dramatic rise and disastrous fall of a figure who may have gotten beaten, but seemingly gets the last laugh and lives to fight another day. <br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>First and foremost, there is an obligatory need to praise Leonardo DiCaprio for he will keep you entertained for the full three hours of the film. Through breaking the 4th wall, and all different types of debauchery which usually is only seen on HBO or Showtime shows, we are given a 3D character. One who has all the charm needed to trick people out of money, but at the same time seems like the life he lives and the person he is at heart are continually conflicting with each other. I say that since, despite the yacht, massive ego, and the ability to make a million in a day, there is still this sort of vulnerability, if only slightly. Take note of whenever he is looking at a woman as more than a vagina to stick his dick in, he becomes insecure in almost an inexperienced teen way, making it seem like testosterone is able to create a façade for when it is time to show off, but during intimate moments, the mask comes off and all that is left is a man with money and ambitions, but someone who also desires someone stable to share all of his profit with too.<br/><br/>But it isn't just DiCaprio who gives you an excellent performance. Hill, based off his filmography, seems almost destined to play Azoff, and though he may not go head to head with DiCaprio in terms of prominence, it is hard to deny that as a supporting member, he doesn't do a hell of a job. Also, I quite admired the use of soul/ blues music throughout the film signaling the shift of Belfort's rise, and perhaps the best thing about the film is that while it isn't rolling on the floor funny, it does keep you smiling and entertained all throughout.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>Leading to perhaps the sole criticism I have for this movie: The Ending. Our journey with Belfort creates the type of movie you can foresee watching more than once, just because of all the madness that goes on; however, the ending just feels so anti-climactic after everything that is done. You watch the man throw midgets, money launder, have sex with tons of woman, take as much drugs as possible without having an overdose, and though I realize Belfort, the actual Jordan Belfort, is alive so a definitive ending isn't possible, I just felt like after skyrocketing and maintaining that altitude, the ending feels like a plane nose-diving and just barely making it onto the runway safe.<br/><br/>Overall: Must See<br/><br/>I personally am not a huge Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but it is undeniable that his work with Martin Scorsese took him from Jack in Titanic to a mega star. Whatever it is, Scorsese brings out the best out of DiCaprio the same way he did with Robert De Niro for decades. And with that said, this movie is something not only worth seeing in theaters, but eventually getting on DVD. For while it is 3 hours long, like Blue is the Warmest Color, it uses said 3 hours to give you a compelling story which rarely, if ever, falters. I would even dare say, even amongst Idris Elba, Michael B. Jordan and Chiwetel Ejiofor, Leornardo DiCaprio may finally get an Oscar."

I know it sounds cheesy but the movie sends you on a roller-coaster of emotions: sad, lustful, happy, pitiful, angry, panicked then sad again. Couldn't get enough and recommend for everyone (over 17) to watch. The director is genius and knows how to make people laugh, because that is what I was doing most the time. Some may be offended by the amount of sex, drugs, and profanity, but if this is true then they shouldn't be watching a rated R movie about life on Wall St. Definitely on my rewatch/all time favorite movie list."

"bh_tafe3","10","1","5","11 March 2015"," Another triumph for DiCaprio and Scorsese
","Leonardo DiCaprio gives arguably the best performance of his career in this Wall Street/ Goodfellas hybrid which looks at the life and exploits of Jordan Belfort, founder of Wall Street chop shop Stratton Oakmont, exploring the depths of his drug induced sexual depravity.<br/><br/>DiCaprio narrates the film, which takes reasonable and necessary liberties with Belfort's book of the same name, taking us through his initiation into the world of stock broking through a memorable, insane, conversation with senior broker Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), the 1987 stock market crash and his discovery of penny stocks, which give a far greater return to the broker than ""blue Chip"" stocks. He meets Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill, deliberately painful), and starts his own firm, making a small fortune and drawing the attention of the SEC and FBI, who send Patrick Denman (Kyle Chandler, outstanding) to investigate, It is in this investigation, starting around the same time that Belfort meets his second wife Naomi (Margot Robbie in a breakout role) that the film really hits its straps. The scene with DiCaprio and Chandler on his luxury yacht is one of the great moments in cinema this decade, and the iconic moments flow thick and fast from there. DiCaprio's speeches on the chop shop floor, a darkly funny overdose scene, and deeply satisfying moments of comeuppance (even though Belfort gets off very lightly).<br/><br/>Scorsese resists, and in fact openly works against, the temptation to glorify Belfort or make him the hero of the piece, showing the full depths of his depravity and amoral nature and allowing DiCaprio to create a pathetic creature, selfish, greedy and destructive with few redeeming features but managing to be so charismatic you can't turn away. It is DiCaprio's performance that allows Chandler to shine playing Belfort's opposite. Principled, driven, incorruptible and unlike every other character we see, likable. His is a welcome break in the stench given off by every other character we see, and a strong performance in its own right. You want to see him stand up to Belfort, his disgraceful worldview and his cynical and criminal use of people. You want to see him win.<br/><br/>This is DiCaprio's film from start to finish, with nary a second he is not on screen and he is riveting. Whether he's doing deals over the phone, sniffing crack off a woman's breasts, or giving inspirational speeches, you won't be able to take your eyes off him. Several scenes involve Belfort addressing the audience the same way we see in Goodfellas and Casino. Belfort lets us in on his extramarital affairs, drug use and illegal business operations, making us co-conspirators, and also making us feel dirty as a result. Through sheer weight of consistent great performances, DiCaprio has risen to a rare level, and must now be considered the greatest actor and star of his generation. And Like de Niro, DiCaprio's collaborations with Scorsese have become event cinema for film fans.<br/><br/>Of the minor players, Hill comes off the best. It is impossible not to be offended by his Donnie and filled with murderous rage whenever he comes on screen. A truly odious creation and brilliant performance. Joanna Lumley (Naomi's aunt), Rob Reiner (Belfort's father), and Jon Bernthal (a drug dealing ally) are also outstanding.<br/><br/>Warning to those who haven't seen the film, it contains drug use, full frontal nudity, orgies, and drops the f-bomb with equal abandon to Goodfellas. That all this has a context, and helps the director establish the morality of his story won't be enough for some to plow through it. For those who can, this is one of the very best movies of the past 15 years, featuring a great director at the top of his game, and the finest actor of this generation giving arguably his greatest performance."

"vectorsoftware","8","1","5","27 April 2014"," from a Christian perspection
","To Christian viewers, if you must watch this film, have something else on hand to turn your attention to during multiple scenes. The Wolf of Wall Street frequently borders on pornography, among exhibiting other forms of depravity. Everything that needs to be followed in the plot line can be understood simply by listening for the few, rare words that are not profane or crude.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street serves merely as evidence of human depravity. There is really very little else to it. Directed by the famous Martin Scorsese, this film bears several of the director's trademarks, but somehow manages to make every one of the beloved traits burdensome to viewers. For example, Scorsese is well-known for his use of slow motion to emphasize the many aspects and emotions of particular circumstances. In this film, slow motion seems to only draw out this overly-lengthy, repetitive film.<br/><br/>Another instance of tediously detailed and slow filming tactics can be found during a scene in which the two lead characters, Jordan and Donny, fight each other while so high that they cannot even stand. It would seem that Scorsese, who is generally understood to have no real interest in accumulating money, wants viewers to be repulsed by the effects of greed and follow-up depravity.<br/><br/>From the first ten minutes of the film, however, this goal is accomplished. That the audience must continue to be disgusted for nearly three more hours by the same decadent debauchery is most certainly overkill. The characters in the story hardly seemed to be rattled by the extensive wickedness portrayed in the film, and it would seem that by the end, viewers are also likely to have grown accustomed to it because they are subjected to it for so long.<br/><br/>Scorsese takes the directorial ""show, don't tell"" approach to exposing the worst of humanity very seriously. It is difficult to find a single line that lacks profanity or crude phrases. There are no significant lines that offer any sort of point for the audience to remember. Rather, the dialogue just serves as a relentless example of how caught up people are in immorality.<br/><br/>Only one character seems, in any way, to maintain that a lifestyle of excess and recklessness is unacceptable. This character, FBI agent Patrick Denham (played by Kyle Chandler), is never glorified or backed. Rather, after accomplishing his goal in the film, Denham is shown riding a subway home, unsmiling, continuing to live his unremarkable life. His performance is certainly the most complex and impressive in the entire film, but that they may simply be because he has no competition.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting in the film is as disappointing as the directing is. The all-star cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, and Matthew McConaughey, hardly lives up to expectations. It may not be the actors who are to blame, however. Most of the storyline has the characters high on adrenaline, sex, or hardcore drugs. They largely just have to pose in ways that suggest they are drugged, or move in repetitive, sloppy manners evidencing that they are drugged. With such little emotional depth, the actors have very little performing to do.<br/><br/>It seems that the entire story is written to be so bland, though. Without a single likable character, the biggest accomplishment of this film is its unique ability to make absolutely nothing look appealing. The lavish parties, tons of cash flung about, and overtly intimate sex scenes never once appear original or inviting. All of the power obtained by the main characters, even when used for forms of ""good"" is utterly unattractive. The downfall of the leading character, Jordan Belfort, is easily overlooked because it appears there was nothing for him to lose anywayevidencing how unappealing even the high points of his life were.<br/><br/>Such is the monotony of this dull, despicable film. From the commonality of the aesthetics (see every mansion portrayed of late in film and every beauty recently photographed) to the forgettable soundtrack, it is unclear why this production has received any special attention at all.<br/><br/>The only apparent reason for The Wolf of Wall Street being heralded as well-done is its complete allegiance with the concept of post-modernism. One of the main ideas of post-modernism is skepticism about traditional structure, resulting in the finding of ways to work outside of the typical. As this film plods onward, it functions as resisting the expectations of viewers. The film is impervious to consequence, meaning, or climax, which are all a part of the preferred structure of modern audiences. No statement is ever made regarding what is and isn't acceptable; according to this things, everything might be permissible, and it's up for every individual to interpret.<br/><br/>From the standpoint of the Christian faith, this film is only valuable as an illustration of what hell represents. As 2 Thessalonians 1:9 describes, those who are in hell are ""punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord"". Men are not to fear that which kills the body, but rather that which overtakes the soul and also kills the body (Matthew 10:28).<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street illustrates the work of the Evil one who destroys souls. Greed, debauchery, flippant immorality, self-absorption, and an uncontested perspective that values only ""me"" and ""now"" are all soul-gripping realities that turn men into beasts. This film drives home the point that humanity is debased, decrepit, and determined to neglect all things righteous. It may, in spite of its poor production and futilely obscene story, propel people to wonder if perhaps there is another way to live. The question could lead to the only true answer: Jesus. But that would certainly be the work of the Spirit, not the film. (christiantomatoes)"

","There are spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>First off, only to mention it in comparison due to thematic issues, Wall Street, directed by Oliver Stone in 1987 is a classic. It depicted an era's mindset (the 1980's)of excess, in this case, Wall Street, where lots and lots of money is the only objective. The movie's famous line ""Greed is Good"" became a catch phrase. In the plot, the older male antagonist has no conscience vs. the younger male protagonist, who does. It's a finely done character study of a brilliant and at the same time sleazy individual. Michael Douglas was surely best actor worthy in the famous role of Gordon Gekko. Charlie Sheen, his younger protégé, proved to be a very promising actor. Darryl Hannah, not much more than the female trophy, wasn't portrayed as overtly sexual. Done in a mature, suspenseful way with an 80's ' having the most toys wins' mentality, Wall Street is a great snapshot of the time. It's very much worth seeing on many levels. And, It's a MUST see if you've paid(wasted)$5.99 like I just did to watch The Wolf of Wall Street. <br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street directed by Martin Scorsese, is what Wall Street the movie could have been if done from an Animal House (movie) point of view . Not only that- but God Rest his Brilliant Comedic Soul, John Belushi would've been the perfect Jordan Belfort. The Wolf of Wall Street depicts to the point of making no sense, the crudeness and immaturity of Mr. Scorsese's typical New York Male psyche. Come on, Enough already ! These men see themselves as heroes for no reason other then they are working for a creepy know it all(Belfort)who makes them rich by 'teaching' them to be exactly like him for all the wrong reasons. Thus, The Wolf Wall Street has no conscience. No redemption. No morals. No "" See? that is what can happen if.."" plot. ""No money is the root of all evil"" subplot. Even the protagonist FBI agent who brings Belfort's Stratford Oakmont business down, leaves the audience thinking perhaps he too realizes that Belfort was actually on to something good. But, the worst criticism for me is the way women are depicted in this film. There is not one positive, not too sexual, intelligent, compassionate, smart woman character in it. But, there are oh so many hanger-ons, cheap gold-diggers, strippers, hookers and tramps with no morals to fulfill the (a-hemmm) important needs of Belfort's 'company'. I've had this issue with many of the women in his past films, even main characters(Sharon Stone for instance in Casino who was terrific in her doomed drugged tramp for money role)in his films. And if we want to go WAY back ? Jodie Foster as the child prostitute that served to fuel Travis Bickle's angst in the infamous Taxi Driver) But this one? Simply so obviously over the top. If The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't make you realize that Scorsese sees women in 1 way for 1 purpose in cinema then I guess nothing will. I can only say this regarding the 2013 Oscars. Mr. Scorsese, if you are wondering why you haven't won any lately? The Academy isn't stupid, your unnecessary Animal house views have caused them to 'Depart' the building. It's 2014 not 1984. The party's been over for a while now, clean up the mess .......and grow up. PS Leo your muse is showing , find a new director"

","The Wolf Of Wall Street. Amazing. Incredible. Fantastic. HILARIOUS. Directionless. The Wolf of Wall Street is all these things, and more. However you cannot mistake that for all the things it is, it's also very meaningless. By this I mean, that the plot doesn't really show or do anything besides seemingly linked sketches of hilarious events occurring due to drugs. Nothing more or less really. The last half an hour of the movie is gripping and terrific, and has Scorsese all over it. This is how Scorsese would have done 'Wall Street'. Which is not to say the movie is bad, it's just not entirely gripping, and for the most part meaningless, like that strange mid-section in Django Unchained, where they sat around ate dinner and then shouted a little. However for a 3 hour movie the pace never loosens and unexpected of a Scorsese film, the humour never slacks. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is amazing, yet the script's speeches feel somewhat empty and loose. It's Sorkin-esque but no cigar. For a short while your attention drifts as DiCaprio's head reddens, and your back in for the speech finale. Everyone else's performance is OK, and besides Jonah Hill, they're very forgettable, and as much as I hate to say it, especially Matthew McConaughey's. A word of advice, for the teens reading, DO NOT watch with the parents. And for the parents, vice versa. There is a serious amount of drugs and sex, but already know that. The style is cool, and the viciousness of DiCaprio's character is amazing. Although nominated for an Oscar. It's still not good enough. Slick, funny and really funny. It just isn't as strong as his other works. There's just no heart to be found, and nothing a general audience can emotionally connect with, with a lifestyle and characters that are just so cold. Fun while it lasts.<br/><br/>For more visit... http://wp.me/P4w7bk-1"

","I am in no way an expert when it comes to film, just an average person giving my honest opinion. I thought this movie was boring and tactless. I had been warned about the amount of pornography and foul language in this movie but that was not what caught me off guard. I was waiting for the plot to develop and it never did. The movie is about greedy stock brokers and their drugs, hookers and parties. There isn't an ounce of humor, suspense, romance or drama to keep the audience interested. I don't understand how a 3 hour movie can play the same scenes over and over. A day at work is depicted followed by drugs and sex, throw in an argument with the wife and hit repeat for the entire movie. It was not even remotely entertaining. The last 20 minutes of the movie finally produces a twist in the plot but you have to endure a painful amount of nonsense to get to it. I will say that DiCaprio's acting is impressive as he plays a psychotic drug addicted millionaire. Overall, I was very disappointed in this movie and cannot understand what the hype was about."

","WOW. It is started with an advertising scene that bring you in the high life of stockbroking and ended with calmness of DIN typeface. Great. Just great.

Brandnew from under consideration must review this corporate empire of sleazy. <br/><br/>Second, This 3 hours long biographical black comedy is motivating. Just like the person, Mr. Jordy, the Gordon Gekko in real life. His fail career and rise to power is inspirational. Really inspiring like the Social Network, but have a lust-for-life content. And fortunately this film is just blew him up and makes him more famous than ever. Made him back in business life, and motivate others with his experience. <br/><br/>Three, The sex, drug and rock-n-roll of high stockbroker life. The jerk off things and other lust for life. Wholly its a tragic black comedy, and the end its not so tragic as other great role by Leo, The death of Gatsby, Jack Dawson, 'Blood Diamond role' and Howard Hughes. And for Mr. Scorsese, this is one of his terrific film ever produced in the old days, like Clint Eastwood. He got a dozen of essential filmography before 'Wolf' includes Gangs of New York, Shine A Light, the Aviator, the Departed (whose finally win because the superb adaptation from the East, not like poorly Oldboy from Lee), and Hugo (where Chloe Moretz takes my heart for the first time!). So WHY this film didn't receive an Oscar? It's Controversial content. MAYBE his controversial film since the Last Temptation of Christ. But hey, this film got a Breast Picture Award from 'mr that have a skin taste' site. I wonder why this film not given an X rated by MPAA? Maybe it's goes after they release The Director's Cut in 1080p BluRay with runtime 230 minutes. Haha. <br/><br/>Four, the ""20 important hilarious scene of the Wolf of Wall Street"" but sorry i'll give you just three. Mat McConaughey is really rob an Oscar from Leo in this film, his only less than 10 minutes appearance is really hilarious. Leo just give a laughing smile to him. ""The entourage of Jordy"" is the hilarious when they meeting, briefing, and when give a report about their sex party cost to Rob Reiner. Jeez, thats just LMAO. The last three is the queen, the ravish Margot Robbie from PanAm stewardess who gives a 'total service' to the film. I hope she could repeat a performance like this in her next film (for the opportunity of the career, )<br/><br/>It.s nice to review in here, exercising my writing. Thanks.

"davideo-2","10","1","5","3 March 2014"," An electrifying central performance drives along a Scorsese masterpiece
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young man determined to get ahead and live the high life come what may, and so he travels to Wall Street, the financial epicenter of the world in the 1980's to make his mark. Treated like an underdog on his first day, he's lucky to have financier extrordinarie Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) spot his potential and take him under his wing, teaching him the key to success lies not in mere stocks and shares, but in selling investor's worthless or inaccurate pieces of paper that you've convinced them will net them loads. After losing his job in the Black Monday crash of 1987, he takes Hanna's advice and hooks up with former toy store worker and neighbour Donnie (Jonah Hill) and, after assembling a seemingly no hope bunch of co conspirators, they set up their own company and before long have reached the top and engage in a life of none stop debauchery, decadence and excessiveness beyond most people's wildest dreams, until FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) and his team start to dig in to whether Belfort's practices are legal.<br/><br/>Eager as he is to convey yet another tale of a morally skewered individual and their inherent rise and fall, Martin Scorsese has nevertheless taken rather a gamble in these financially destructive times by bringing this real life tale of Jordan Belfort, the wheeler and dealer to end all wheeler and dealers, to the big screen. In an age where there are those struggling even to keep a roof over their heads, seeing someone who indulged in such mind blowing greed and extravagance may be a tough pill for many to swallow. But it's testament to his style and delivery that, while it can never really be said we come to like Belfort, something about his self belief and arrogant determination and indeed the have-everything world he creates makes him such an immorally appealing fellow that we never get to hate him either. If the richest people in the world really are just one per cent, and this is how they live, then it really isn't much of a mystery how everything is so unevenly divided.<br/><br/>Now quite rightly regarded as one of the finest actors of our generation, in a career with many high points, this is the role in which DiCaprio will surely leave his highest cultural mark in the world of cinema. He injects a manic intensity and ferociousness to Belfort that at times is simply magnetic, mesmerizing as he thunders like a lion across the screen, as a man whose wild arrogance, immorality and desperate zest for life literally charge him like a battery. It's the finest role of his I've ever seen, and it's a shame it seems he's missed out on his Oscar for it, all I can say is whoever beat him must still be living their part now. But special mention must also be given to co star Hill, who I've only known for making well known comedies, but he seems to have taken DiCaprio's lead and attempted to be as full on and direct as him, to very nearly as great effect. As a double act, they set the screen on fire in a way you couldn't imagine. Also one not to forget is McConaughey, in what can only be about a ten minute role, who fills that brief time marvelously, espousing on to DiCaprio the self believing mantra that will transform him in to a God like figure in the boardroom, with a cult like audience in front of him.<br/><br/>Scorsese seems wrapped up in the style of Goodfellas, with DiCaprio doing voice over for most of the film and sounding almost exactly like Ray Liotta from that film, and acting much like him too, both playing real life men who refused to be constrained by a life of mundanity and were willing to use illegal, immoral means to rise above it, climbing high but falling that much harder due to their own lack of self control and addiction to risk. He occasionally veers away and talking directly to the camera just for that extra dramatic impact.<br/><br/>With the Black Monday crash of '87 being such a big event at the start of the film, it's a wonder no reference is made to Michael Douglas in Wall Street since that film came out that year. TWOWS is just a superb effort in it's own right, driven along by DiCaprio's best ever performance and a startling view of how the other half live that will blow your mind. *****"

It falls with a great power on the tape to expose all wicked characters, definitively dying under classical «Hey, Mrs. Robinson» and, even in their last minutes at large, screaming something about annual salary; and show, how Patrick Denham, discreetly grinning, is leaving picture on the saving train of honesty, or happiness, if you want. <br/><br/>And who will dare after that to say, that Scorsese did for the cinematography less, than Nabokov for literature?<br/><br/>9,5 from 10"
"joshavanhoudt","9","1","5","6 February 2014"," The corrupted American dream
","The Wolf of Wallstreet depicts the life of Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), a stockbroker who corrupts or is corrupted by, depending on your viewpoint, the financial Valhalla that was Wall Street in the 1990s. As a young, ambitious broker in a major company, his youthful enthusiasm quickly develops into ruthless ambition, fuelled by his boss, a short but powerful role by Matthew McConaughey. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie portrays Jordan in this transformation. All the remnants from his ordinary middle-class life, including his car, house and down-to-earth girlfriend, are promptly shed and replaced by the Wall Street equivalent, including the stunningly beautiful but opportunistic Naomi (Margot Robbie). <br/><br/>Jordan's life appears to be fantastic, with more money than he can spend, despite all his efforts to that end, a family man by day and a young god with drugs, alcohol and prostitutes by... well, also by day. However, he is unable to control his never-ending greed and his high-speed life starts to spin out of control, until the bubble bursts and his empire crumbles before his eyes.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wallstreet is a rollercoster ride, in many ways analogous to Belforts life. The extravagant three hours of running time fly by, taking the viewer from New York halfway across the world to Italy and back, showing us all the riches and all the pitfalls of his decadent life. <br/><br/>The question has been asked whether it is morally acceptable to sponsor this criminal, which Belfort undoubtedly is, by viewing his movie en masse. This is nonsense from a juridical point of view, since Belfort was convicted for his crimes and served his time, and he is allowed to return to society like any other convict, but moreover, it is not what this movie should be judged on.<br/><br/>This movie shows us the temptation of unlimited wealth. Jordan's life attracts and deters, invokes admiration and disgust. And it is not just the crooked soul of a lone Wolf. Even once ordinary people like Donnie Azoff, played by the excelling Jonah Hill, contribute to Belforts disgraceful excesses. <br/><br/>Jordan's philosophy is most strikingly characterized by an early scene in which we see him driving his flashy red car. The car was white however, says Jordan's voice-over, and hence it promptly shifts colour. You can shape life, like you can shape the car. You can have the fast, beautiful life embodied by that white Ferrari, if you want it badly enough. The corrupted American dream."

","It creates magic when Martin Scorsese in absolute top form once again teams up with an absolutely brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio . "" The Wolf of Wall Street"" is an incredibly intense and tragic-comic tale of the American (s) dream. The movie is about money, greed and laziness, yes actually if all the seven Deadly Sins collected . But it is also , in true Scorsese 's spirit of dreams , brotherhood , loyalty and betrayal. Jordan Belfort ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) is a young man who quite early in life discovers his talent to sell and the ability to motivate others. After a successful but short career on the stock market , he finds his niche a little to the side of law and morality. Soon he is his own boss with your own staff , and the success that follows is larger than the previous one's imagination allowed . The film is based on the book of the same name. It is written by the real Jordan Belfort and is a true story about the rise and fall and his least improbable life as corrupt stockbroker and boundless enjoys life in the latter half of the 1980s. It is told exclusively from Belfort own perspective. Sometimes turning the character at the camera and speaks directly to us , sometimes we hear his voice over the nicely edited images . With tongue in cheek DiCaprio is completely brilliant as the hungry Belfort who can not get enough. Of something . He is anything but sympathetic and often downright unbearable in their actions . But with DiCaprio's charm , he is still their flaws despite a sufficiently amiable individual who ( at least initially ) lurking over the audience on his side , while the FBI sniffs at his heels."
"robearbarrett","8","1","5","21 January 2014"," ""Quaalude Fuelled Entertainment""
","There are few films that would have been as widely anticipated this year as The Wolf of Wall Street, it's a strong cast of performers that you can see went all out in this picture to create the sheer chaos inspired by the real life memoirs of Dicaprio's character Jordan Belfort. Many critics have cited this 3 hour tale of the debauched stockbroker as glamorising his life of excess. I couldn't agree less. This is a film that in my opinion does not feature a protagonist, I doubt many viewers can relate to Belfort and I think that is where The Wolf of Wall Street really excels. We are not supposed to condone his actions, there is no attempt at redemption on his behalf and although Belfort may possess the odd admirable quality I don't believe we are expected to sympathise with him.<br/><br/>From what we are expected to believe as humble beginnings we see Belfort advance from the innocent or perhaps naive young accomplice of Mark Hanna to the human embodiment of greed and corruption with very little time to adjust. Although only a cameo appearance from Matthew McConaughey his performance as Mark Hanna, brings some cocaine induced energy especially in one of the stand out scenes known as 'lunch humming'. The addition of characters like Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) Belforts number two and the rest of Stratton Oakmont deliver this film the necessary comedic exchanges along the way in which would otherwise be a very dark film with very little to lighten the mood of the viewer. The consistent drug abuse and sex is relentless which gives this film a real edge and the slick cinematography gives some depth to what we witness on screen.<br/><br/>The film's most engaging performances are provided by Dicaprio and Jonah Hill who share many scenes of Quaalude fuelled comedy most notably the overdose golf club scene close to the end of the film and the various slow motion 'highs' throughout. However it's Dicaprio's moments expressing the frustration of a man who is never content and the anger/desperation portrayed particularly in a scene near the end where the character Naomi announces her want to divorce him. It's a concoction of cocaine charged domestic abuse and panic on Belforts part, and it surprised me when this gained a laugh from a few audience members. I think that proved that maybe one of this film's small downfalls is that sometimes it's too easy to get caught in the far-fetched excess and therefore lose some sensitivity.<br/><br/>Maybe this won't be regarded as Scorsese' finest work but it will more than likely go down as his most controversial, it would be unfair to try and compare this with previous efforts such as 'Goodfellas' because it's not attempting to be as diverse and challenging. The Wolf of Wall Street is a film with unlovable characters and I don't see that as a flaw, why should we always have to empathise with the characters we see on screen this film does nothing to glamorise the lives of those involved we merely view their narcissistic escapades and are left with an understanding of the cliché that money is the route of all evil, but ultimately we are entertained and I can't see anything wrong with that."

"The_moan_of_all_moans","9","1","5","19 January 2014"," Never mind 12 years a Slave; Watch this instead.
","The Wolf on Wall Street was beyond spectacular; it was mind blowing. If Leonardo Di Caprio doesn't get this best actor award (even saying this without seeing ""Dallas Buyers Club"" which isn't out in UK) i will be completely disgusted. He shows absolutely everything in this film. He leaves everything out there; the passion and conviction is astonishing. And the rest of the cast does well to keep up with his perfect performance. It is absolutely contagious; i must have been smiling almost all the way through; one of those ones where you realise you're smiling without knowing so and you feel a tad aware that you may look strange if someone was to look your way. Well that was how it was through 2 hours 30 of the 3 hours. Whichever place Jordan Belfort (Di Caprio) finds himself emotionally sets the pace of the film. If he's upbeat (on a heavy dose of drugs) then the film is upbeat. If he is down (after a heavy dose of drugs) then the films slows. It is intense, hilarious, classy, dirty, controversial, pragmatic yet hectic. It isn't afraid of boundaries; in no way wary of repercussions. It is fearless. <br/><br/>All i have seen for the last month is that a certain ""12 Years a Slave"" is going to win best film at the Oscars this year. That Chiwetel Ejiofor is favorite for Best Actor. That Steve McQueen may as well polish that mantelpiece of his because there's going to be a Best Director Academy Award placed on it. And after seeing Wolf on Wall Street....well i somehow managed to reserve my judgment and opinion on that and waited until i had seen it.....Well the verdict is in.....<br/><br/>....12 Years a Slave is not deserving of those awards. I normally try to see sense in situations where an award goes to a film/actor to whom i thought it should go elsewhere. For example i thought Best Actor should have went to Joquain Phoenix last year instead of Daniel Day Lewis, but hey Lewis was astonishing as Lincoln, so it was fine. When Argo got film of the year ahead of Django i was a little upset, but then again Django was full of politically incorrect, derogatory remarks and racist dialogue so it couldn't have possibly have won best film......wait ......isn't that what 12 Years a Slave has? Oh but that was based on real events....so of course that MUST win. NO!!!!!<br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate in giving the 3 awards i mentioned previously directly to The Wolf Of Wall Street. Now i won't jump the gun and say it's ""the film of the year"" as it is January and let's face it, there's a long way to go , but what i will say is it a welcoming breeze of fresh air in the dusty, rehashed world of movies. Not a remake, not a rip off, not recycled. Just a spectacular example of film making. Thank you Martin Scorsese."
"rubenm","9","1","5","19 January 2014"," Captivating performance and cinematographic abundance
","Question. What is this film about? Is it about greed, like the film Wall Street? Is it about exuberance, like The Great Gatsby? Is it about money, like Margin Call? Is it about white collar crime, like The Thomas Crown Affair? <br/><br/>The way I see it, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is about conscience. Or, to be more precise, about the absence of conscience. Jordan Belfort doesn't have a conscience. He is a ruthless manipulator, who doesn't seem to care about others. He has no decency, no moral compass, no respect for anybody. He would be the perfect villain in any film. <br/><br/>But in 'The Wolf of Wall Street' he is not the villain, but the hero. He is the guy you love to hate. Everyone secretly admires a person like Jordan Belfort. Who wouldn't want to give the rest of the world the finger, and just do whatever you feel like doing? In Belfort's case, that means getting filthy rich, by all means necessary. The stock broker you work for goes bankrupt? You start your own brokerage. You find a woman who is more sexy than the one you're married to? You file for divorce. The FBI is investigating you? You bribe them - or at least try to. And in the mean time, you are enjoying a life full of drugs, drink, women, fast cars and easy money. Even if you wouldn't want a life like that, it's fun to watch. <br/><br/>Despite all their talk about 'not glorifying Belfort', there is no doubt that Scorsese and DiCaprio are doing just that. Take the scene in the Investor's Center, where Belfort calls a client and talks him into an investment in worthless penny stocks. The brokers around him fall silent, stand around in admiration and congratulate him on a great deal. Belfort is not shown as a despicable human being, but as a smooth operator. Even after he gets arrested and locked up, Scorsese shows him as a winner, playing tennis on the prison grounds and talking about how even there money can buy you anything. <br/><br/>Of course, there is nothing wrong with that. Movies glorifying criminals are usually great. 'Bonnie and Clyde' is a great film. So is 'Pulp Fiction'. And so is 'Scarface'. They make the audience suspend their normal ethics about right and wrong. When Bonnie and Clyde are killed, you feel sorry for them, although you know they deserve it. <br/><br/>The glorification of Jordan Belfort makes for a great film. Both Scorsese and DiCaprio are outstanding. The film contains so many great scenes, I don't know where to start. The restaurant scene ('Do you jerk off?') has the potential to become classic. So does the Steve Madden speech ('We should all suck your dick'). Also great is the Tarantino-esque conversation when Belfort teaches his friends how to sell stock ('I've never seen a Buddhist Amish'). But the absolute showstopper is Belfort crawling on all fours, wrecking his Ferrari and saving the life of his overdosed business partner. <br/><br/>DiCaprio's performance is so captivating, you almost forget to pay attention to the cinematographic abundance in this film. Already in the first few minutes, Scorsese shows how movie-making is done. We see a commercial, we switch to reality, the motion stops, the image changes, we hear the lead character talking to the audience, a car changes colour - all in one fluent succession. The film continues that way. Scorsese lets Belfort break the fourth wall by talking directly into the camera, he shows dazzling tracking shots through the trading room, and he even lets people think aloud. Add to that lots of sharp, funny dialogue, excellent fast editing and a great cast, and it's clear that 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is hard to beat as the best film of the year."

"billm-4","8","1","5","18 January 2014"," Very good but very overlong
","The Wolf of Wall Street has a cracking script, superb acting, top notch technical work in all departments and masterly direction binding the wonderful ingredients together. The sheer exuberance and energy behind most scenes indicate that all involved had a whale of a time making this movie. Its extravagance of style matches the total lack of scruple and restraint on the part of the title character, Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>Why not give it a perfect 10 out of 10? Well, the sheer length. It really is not necessary to have a three hour movie when the subject matter is less than epic. Much of it is shamelessly squalid and we really don't need multiple episodes of sexual excess and drug overdosing to rub the truth in. You can see any number of scenes which are redundant as far as story development and character portrayal are concerned.<br/><br/>Scorsese has been criticised for glamorising the lifestyle of a most unsavoury crook. I think that is beyond ridiculous. You might as well criticise real life for being unfair. The anti-hero, brilliantly portrayed by DiCaprio, did have a fantastic time at other people's expense and has largely got away with it. He served a short prison term for numerous monstrous and pitiless frauds which would have merited multiple life sentences in any decent system of justice. He is now enjoying a globe trotting career making loads more money as an inspirational speaker. He is subject to a restitution order to make a trivial contribution to the brutal losses he inflicted on his victims. But he is failing to repay even that penalty! Blame the feeble US justice system. Well, maybe not. We don't want too many bent financiers, bankers and politicians to serve huge prison terms, do we? One reviewer noted the contrast between the anti-hero's lifestyle (travelling on a 170 foot yacht and private jets) and the life of the dogged, incorruptible investigator who pursues him...and travels on the New York subway. You can hardly blame Scorsese for telling the truth. When I see the salaries paid to British police and other investigators compared with the wealth enjoyed by the scum they try to bring to justice, it restores my faith in the decency of so many ""ordinary"" people.<br/><br/>The only moral and storytelling criticism I would offer is that Scorsese shows very little of the impact of Belfort on others. True, his first wife's grief at his shameless whoring and philandering is very touching, if briefly portrayed. When he lost his first job on Wall Street, she had been willing to sell her engagement ring to make ends meet. Her loyalty and genuine unselfish love were betrayed. His second wife and their children are also shown as suffering from his insane drug abuse and promiscuity. But I could feel only a fraction of the sympathy for her that I felt for his first wife. Wife No 2 knew, or should have known in one part of her mind, that she was marrying a ruthless cheating chancer. But no doubt she deluded herself that he would settle down, turn over a new leaf, etc.<br/><br/>As for all Belfort's financial victims? At best, they are voices on the other end of a telephone sales pitch. None gets even a cameo appearance to portray the rage and despair they must have felt. Maybe some were rich and could absorb the losses. Maybe some lost everything. Maybe some were driven to suicide, as happened with at least one of Bernie Madoff's victims.<br/><br/>I have not done any digging to see the painful stories behind the Wolf's success. And Scorsese was not making an expose documentary on the mechanics of large scale fraud and the effect on the victims. The focus is quite properly on the title character with the brutally apt nickname. Very few directors could produce such an eyepopping, guilty pleasure."
"BeneCumb","8","1","5","14 January 2014"," Greed and insolence will destroy everyone... Eventually
","Anyways, this is the main idea of this long movie... A certain panoramic epic, more drama than comedy (well, tragedy for thousands but they are not visible). Evidently, the tandem Scorsese-DiCaprio is fond of strong characters within vicious glamor and alternating activities - the movie in question is another example. Although I am not sure if most of viewers would regard it as an warning movie - hedonism and life-fast- die-young principle are too popular among the younger and middle-aged audiences.<br/><br/>The plot is covers almost two decades and is rambling at times, but as based on memoirs with real events and characters, it adds credibility and diminishes suddenness - as we know in advance what happened to this company and its leaders. Directing is skillful, male cast is rather strong, but focused on totally on Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort; Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff is interesting, pity that Matthew McConaughey had so little part. Female characters could have been of several levels, mostly visible are bimbos, beautiful, but identical.<br/><br/>The biggest shortcoming is the length - over 3 hours (with commercials) in the cinema is physically hard; in my opinion, some under-plots and drug scenes could have been skipped. I did not get bored yet, however.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is worth watching, and Academy Award nominations will certainly follow (winning is not sure as competition is high this year).<br/><br/>...Well, if you do something illegal, do it alone and unobtrusively... Or not."
"arnopont","8","1","5","11 January 2014"," entertaining and strong message
","Reading a lot of negative reviews i found the need to comment. Most reviewers don't like the fact that the movie doesn't criticise the immoral behavior of the main characters and the lack of attention for their victims. <br/><br/>In my opinion Scorsese does have attention for the victims (society) by criticising the greed, and passivity of most normal people today. This couldn't be more clear in the last scene where we see a shot of an audience full of gray mice, hoping to get rich but lacking any form of confidence to actually be somebody (this.. is.. uhhh.. a beautiful pen), like a mirror towards the audience in the theater room. Scorsese is like.. you deserve to get ripped off by people like Belfort because you let them. Also, all the immoral behavior we have seen before, is meant to further criticise the behavior of the masses, these are the things you wish for, this is what you get. To me the movie was great because Belfort got away with it, and that's societies fault, we are the ones that are praising this kind of behavior (kind of hypocrite to deliver such a message though a $100mil piece of hollow entertainment, but that's a different discussion). <br/><br/>Overall I think the scenes where funny and entertaining. I know the displayed behavior is immoral, I don't need to have the movie explain that to me. The fact that this movie didn't bore me with the obligatory moral made it funnier, more exciting and more ridiculous. The events are completely over the top, together with DiCaprio acting, his character suffers from increasing delusions of grandeur and it just gets crazier. The movie could have been shorter because the plot is not that elaborate, but to me the length was fine because the movie succeeded in having the craziness build up in such a way that I was entertained the whole time. I think the movie tried to show emptiness through repetition like in spring breakers and the bling ring. The main difference is that this movie manages to be entertaining in the process. <br/><br/>Not everything was great though. I already knew that Belfort was getting away with his crimes by turning on his friends, so when he was given the wire I was like "" great! now we finally get to see what a rat this guy really is"" and then he passes this note to Donnie.. so now I have to believe Belfort is a loyal guy after all? Not sure what the movie wanted from me at that point. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie could be less insulting to my intelligence as a viewer and explain a bit more about the depths of the criminal practices, now the movie is like ""I don't want to bore you by making you think, just believe me.. this sh*t is illegal"". Actually, because it was far from subtle (they could have just skipped it altogether), this is probably Scorsese saying ""you guys don't want to think anyway... take these tits"". <br/><br/>Also, I can understand this movie is not for everyone, women won't like the way that women are portrayed here and I can't blame them. Drug use and prostitution are glorified (which I think is funny) I can assume that to a lot of people it isn't. <br/><br/>What sticks to me after seeing this movie is that both victims and criminals on wall street are guilty of greediness. The main difference is that the victims are passive sheep, hoping to get rich without doing the effort, while the criminals work their asses off at the expense of having a life filled with love. In the end: don't be a sheep, don't be a criminal, do something that you love and gives you satisfaction, like the FBI agent when he over thinks his success in the train. <br/><br/>Conclusion: the movie contains enough criticism towards society, delivers a message about how to live your life, is subtle about it, and manages to be funny for 180 minutes. If you're not offended by a pair of breasts, prostitution and drug use, definitely go and see this one."

","Take 'Animal House', 'Glen Gary Glen Ross', 'Casino', and 'Wall Street', puree in a blender, then add lots of nudity and drugs, and you have a pretty good picture of this picture. The first thirty minutes is repeated throughout the next 2 1/2 hours. No one really changes their spots over the course of this epileptic frenzy of greed. Except maybe the FBI agent who dogs Leonardo DiCaprio and takes stock of himself at movie's end. The Wolf Of Wall Street excels in reaching new heights of outrageousness and personal degradation in the pursuit of money. It is hard to say whether Martin Scorcese is accurate or making a parody of the broker class. I lean toward parody. The director, as usual, brilliantly controls a vast, complex environment and draws excellent performances from his entire cast. The dialog is excellent, if vulgar, and recalls the 'Casino' style of exposition by Joe Pesci. So is this movie worth seeing? From the standpoint of style, yes. We have never seen human sin pushed to this level since maybe 'Caligula'. Ultimately, 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' offers nothing but obscene, if often hilarious spectacle. It is utterly contemptuous of anyone who would ever dare to invest in anything."
"Catrician","7","1","5","3 January 2014"," An above average approach to a below average genre.
","The Wolf of Wall Street is, I believe, an auteur's take on breaking conformity with a very conforming film. Scorsese's latest flick stars frequent (mediocre) collaborator Leo DiCaprio as a Wall Street stockbroker who invents the rules of the market as he goes along, to unmatched success and unmatched downfall. Does this story sound like a typical kind of film? We've seen it with Raging Bull, City of God, and countless other gritty R-rated flicks throughout the past thirty years or so. As such, a format like the typical rise-and-fall plot allows for little use of creativity.<br/><br/>Scorsese, I believe, recognizes this. The Wolf of Wall Street is not particularly gritty as far as violence is concerned, and one never cares a large amount about any of the characters, as they do in a film like Raging Bull, or, in a more similarly themed, 2013 film starring DiCaprio, The Great Gatsby. I'm reasonably sure that this was an intentional choice on behalf of Mr. Scorsese, as he makes other artistic decisions to defy the shallow mold of a genre which he is confined to. Wolf's predictability is easy to tell; from the minute the audience sees Jordan Belfort bragging about his life, the inevitable end is only a long three hours away, and we anticipate it will conclude with Belfort much less wealthy, possibly having learned a life lesson.<br/><br/>But there is no life lesson in Wolf. Scorsese's self-indulgence rivals even the great Fellini's at times; the difference being that Fellini is so great a director that I don't particularly mind Fellini's over- indulgence of whatever film aspect he chooses to obsess over, whereas with Scorsese, I feel as though he is not a fully mature filmmaker (or rather, he has hit-or-miss maturity), with Wolf being a little low on the maturity scale. Yes, it's got humour, it details rags-to-riches-to- rags, but I don't feel as though there's quite enough creativity to hold up Wolf to the genre that it's inevitably placed in, as there is in City of God or Raging Bull. The reason why those two films are superior to Wolf? We care immensely about the characters in the first, and the acting and grittiness of the second.<br/><br/>The ability to sympathize with characters in a film is no mandatory requirement; but when one makes a character study three hours long with little to really go off of as far as identification goes, it certainly helps. Belfort is never in any real tension - but do we, the audience, actually care? My answer is not particularly. <br/><br/>Many critics fault Wolf's excess in profanity and partying as immature, and while I agree with them to an extent, I don't feel as though it's a nail in the coffin for the film at all. Those opposed to these critics cite that the film is a dark comedy or a heavy satire of this exact debauchery that the film depicts, but I don't fully buy that. Say what you will, but there is no excuse for the amount of raw excess in Wolf, except for indulgence on the director's part. Unlike many satires, however, Wolf is very funny; but I feel that much of its humour stems more from individual comedic situations rather than a satire of the high class as a whole."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","5","2 January 2014"," Pretty wild!
","I have to say, I'm rather surprised by the amount of controversy for this, somewhat. There is quite a lot of graphic material shown, but not to the degree that I had heard. Maybe it's just me? Regardless, I'm also surprised by the critical reception to this, it's something I would've thought is a bigger hit with critics. Maybe it's just because I absolutely loved it though. It's absolutely hilarious but it gets its point across pretty strongly. Some scenes in this are absolute riots and among the most memorable in recent history. <br/><br/>As for the performances, outstanding all across the board. I don't think I've ever liked Dicaprio more. The runtime also isn't a huge problem, and part of that is due to the fantastic pacing."
"yashmishra91","8","1","5","2 January 2014"," Great one, with few clichés
","Wolf Of Wall Street (English): Well, director Martin Scorcese's magnum opus is indeed an engaging flick undoubtedly with a good narrative, but the director who literally converted the 1962 Satyajit Ray directed Bengali hit ""Abhijaan"" into the classic ""Taxi Driver"", this time puts up great amount of ""inspirations"" from the Mani Ratnam's 2007 Hindi Classic ""Guru"", despite the film's screenplay based on the book by the same name written by Jordan Belfort. The low points of the film lies in its additional dose of explicit as well as emotional quotient which actually make the film draggy in the second half especially. Rest of all, the film scores because of its screenplay by Terrence Winters which has a good developmental graph and some style factor too, based on the Classic Hollywood style narrative, then comes the production design work by Bob Shaw and Ellen Christiansen who brilliantly showcases the best of the times, then the music score (Various) which have been well placed in the film. Then we have the brilliant characters having grey shades and adding great support to the protagonist and his moves, the comes the splendid performance by Leonardo DiCaprio who carries the film well on his shoulders and he continues his brilliance and then the narration by Scorcese, which makes the film engaging and worth a watch too! My rating would be: 4/5."
"ghost_dog86","9","1","5","29 December 2013"," The Real American Hustle
","This entire film is on cocainein a good way.<br/><br/>By now Martin Scorsese can write his own ticket. But his newest film, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", based on self proclaimed born entrepreneur Jordan Belfort's own bestselling book about his rise and fall in the stock market scene of the late 80's through the late 90's, is surely the most vulgar and outlandish Scorsese film to date. It is a true wonder how ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" doesn't pull an NC-17 rating. But if that sounds like a knock, it's quite the opposite. The sheer ballsy-ness of this production is in fact, inspiring. It is inspiring to see a master like Scorsese evolve and constantly look to push the boundaries of film.<br/><br/>If there is one thing Scorsese knows how to do, it's how to take fascinating characters who have lived spectacularly eventful lives and create a fascinating and eventful movie. And the character of Jordan Belfort is not only the wildest character Scorsese has put to screen, but is arguably his most interesting and complex character as well. Sorry, Henry Hill and Jake LaMotta. Played by one of the most dynamic actors working today, Leonardo DiCaprio who is absolutely unleashed, it doesn't hurt that ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" also contains the best ensemble cast of the year. Jon Bernthal, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Favreau, P.J. Byrne, Jean Dujardin, Joanna Lumley, Kyle Chandler (in his best role to date) Rob Reiner (in his best role to date) newcomer and Australian born actress Margot Robbie (who fakes a substantially better New Jersey accent than Scarlett Johansson in ""Don Jon"") and Jonah Hill (and his fake teeth) if it were at all possible, should all receive Oscar recognition for their parts in this film.<br/><br/>While I still believe ""American Hustle"" contains a more flushed out script, because of how unapologetic Terence Winter's writing is in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", he should (barring a spectacular upset) garner the Oscar for best adapted screenplay of the year. That said, as much as I enjoyed the flow of this particular plot, shockingly there isn't a whole lot of story for a three hour movie. Hell, 50% of this movie is dedicated to sequences containing wild sex/drug orgies. Also, similar to a ""pure comedy"", the plot of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is highly tangential. Hence, it is about an hour longer than it needed to be, as during most sequences Scorsese allows his A-list actors to riff for minutes at a time, with no real purpose other than to evoke laughs. That said, with the lack of story, there is enough entertainment value to fill a four hour movieso, there you go.<br/><br/>Greed is still good. Maybe the primary reason why ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" works so well is because of a certain something (a motivational adrenaline pump) within it. That same certain something which makes everybody stand up and shadow box in their living rooms after watching ""Rocky"". Seriously, at one point, during the conclusion of one of Leo's rallying the troop speeches, I was so pumped up and motivated, that I wanted to go out and make a few cold calls myself.<br/><br/>Final Thought: This high octane, hilarious, bonkers script on horse steroids, in conjunction with one of the greatest directors alive doing some of his finest work, in conjunction with a cast that seemed to all be feeding off of one another's energy, is the reason why ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the most fun I've had in a theater all year."
"dvc5159","8","1","5","24 December 2013"," Cash, debauchery and the pursuit of narcissism
","A third into the film, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) walks and talks to the camera as it tracks along the Stratton Oakmont office floor showing the exaggerated and frantic goings-on in just another day's work. Belfort tells to the audience that the office is about to release an initial public offering stock (IPOs) and proceeds to smugly lecture them about the term, but halfway through he cynically asks that we probably ""didn't understand what he said"", smiles, and disappears within the rabid office crowd.<br/><br/>It's this stone-cold cynicism that defines Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", and it permeates throughout nearly the whole movie up until the final 15 minutes. We watch and wince in parts awestruck, in shock and in double takes (sometimes all three at once) as we witness the rise and fall of Belfort as he confidently narrates and provides commentary on the current situation being shown. Like two of Martin Scorsese's more popular films, ""GoodFellas"" and ""Casino"", ""Wolf"" relies on a cynical narrator who comments dryly on interesting situations. Like both movies, it has the protagonist working his way to the top for the first half of the movie - ""Wolf"" chronicles his beginnings by being advised by his boss (a brief but hilarious Matthew McConaughey) on his first day of work on the benefits of drugs and sex on the job; selling penny stocks for thousands after said job didn't turn out well; opening a firm with his ragtag pals and new partner Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill); and dumping his caring first wife (Cristin Miloti) and goes after a gorgeous fashionista (Margot Robbie). Once Belfort hits the top with the release of an IPO, in typical Scorsese fashion, it all goes downhill from there. The feds start paying attention, with one no-nonsense agent (Kyle Chandler) hot on his tail. Cracks are shown in the organization, especially Belfort and Azoff. Suddenly the hedonism inconspicuously transforms into the critical, and the actions of Belfort and his crew are then placed upon the judgment of the Feds and us, the audience.<br/><br/>All of these sequences are directed, written, shot and edited with a hedonistic glee and critical eye, never bucking down to genre conventions and techniques, always on the move. Scorsese hasn't been this lively since ""Casino"" and it shows with the terrific and brisk direction, extreme content and perfectly-timed and well-chosen music to go along with the madness that is Stratton Oakfort. To be able to contain such an impressive cast without them outweighing the real center of the film - DiCaprio - as well as juggling acts of debauchery with a critical eye on the desires of human beings - that is the feat of a great filmmaker. To be able to do so with such gusto and energy with a boldness not seen since the '70s, that is a remarkable part on Scorsese to not buck under the political correctness of today. If it happened like that, then it happened like that, why the need to neuter? This is not just on the part of Scorsese, but the very well-written screenplay by Terence Winter which crackles with whip-smart and sharp dialogue throughout; and Rodrigo Prieto's camera-work which bursts out a wide array of colors in every scene, going against the current norm of bleached, gritty looks in films and concerns itself for making the film look as vivid and lurid as Belfort's mind.<br/><br/>""Wolf"" doesn't slow down the moment the film starts. What follows for a whopping three hours are one cynical and narcissistic act of debauchery after another. Not that the film uses its suggestive content (sexuality, nudity, drug use and language combined border on the hard R side) to wildly bombard the audience with excess, but a key role in ensuring the film is never boring is the editing by Scorsese's editing muse, the great Thelma Schoonmaker, who paces these acts so accordingly they seem like circus troupes of insanity lining up one after another for a performance.<br/><br/>The center of the whole film, not just the editing, nor the writing, nor even the direction or the amazing ensemble supporting cast (which includes Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Jon Bernthal and Jean Dujardin among others already mentioned), but the absolutely brilliant performance of DiCaprio as Belfort. Like Scorsese here, DiCaprio goes completely for broke in this performance, playing a despicable man so self-obsessed that both his best friend and worst enemy is himself. DiCaprio makes it a miracle to actually make us laugh at this character with his insane Nicolas-Cage-like performance (there is a 15-minute sequence involving DiCaprio and Hill, both coked out and arguing, that had the entire audience rolling with laughter throughout). He drinks, he parties hard, he snorts cocaine, he has wild sex, he gets a drug-induced trip, even in one scene he gets a candle put in an, err, interesting place. And the next day he's off to work in a suit after a snort of cocaine, as if nothing happened the previous day.<br/><br/>Like all great actor-director collaborations, they always work off each other's strengths to create something exceptional, and DiCaprio's and Scorsese's tandems bounce off each other perfectly, creating exceptional entertainment and an in-your-face look at how depraved the human obsession can really get. This is the kind of lifestyle that the brilliant documentary ""Inside Man"" told us about, but were afraid to show us. Now I know how it feels like, and although it is hilarious, it is also very, very startling."

","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>Wall Street and its ""greed is good"" philosophy has always been such an easy target. With its luxurious life style excesses and its wheelers and dealers always on the make, the rise and fall of one man seems only par for the course.  Such is the case of Martin Scorsese's manic and fully energized film, The Wolf of Wall Street. <br/><br/>The film is good to a fault, the fault being an excessive amount of excessiveness, both on the screen and behind the camera lens. Clocking in at three hours, The Wolf on Wall Street starts to outstay its welcome rather quickly. The frat-boy shenanigans and high testosterone level just wears you out rather than grab your interest.<br/><br/>Based on the real life memoirs of Jordan Belfort, the film tracks the beginnings and the end of this trader and con artist who bilked many unsuspecting clients from their life savings. Played by Leonardo DiCaprio, we follow this amoral character and his illegal dealings whose schemes seem to be so over-the-top and outlandishly stranger than non-fiction. That becomes the film's fatal flaw as too many liberties have been taken from the actual facts that the film borders on inanity and loses all credibility as the film reaches its conclusion.<br/><br/>The Wolf on Wall Street takes its title character, Jordan ""Wolfie"" Belfort, and parades his hedonistic antics front and center. His exploits are highly exploitive and wholly inappropriate, from his dwarf throwing party and steady stream of drugs, alcohol, and sex to his fast expensive cars and even faster expensive women.  He trades in one loyal wife for a sleeker and more buxomly model. He apprentices and corrupts an nebbish assistant (well played by Jonah Hill) who is more than willing to sell his soul for a price.  In fact, everyone in this film has no moral compass, including Scorsese who relishes in this outrageous behavior to the point that the director appears to take a perverse glee with the numerous gratuitous shots of full frontal female nudity and orgasmic debauchery on the screen.<br/><br/>In the film, Scorsese treats his subjects as white collar gangsters sans the violence, familiar territory for this director. The director has his signature swooping camera-work (fine work by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto) and flashy editing which is perfectly suited for this type of film. His journey into their orgasmic drug-induced world is still an engrossing adventure that is thrilling to experience  but also disturbingly unsettling. He is a master filmmaker and his film is so well executed and a wonderful comic diversion mainly due to DiCaprio's marvelous performance.<br/><br/>The actor throws himself fiercely into this role and he creates a fully developed and charismatic scoundrel. He delivers his many tirades and spiels with an edgy bravado and, in one scene while high on Quaaludes, DiCaprio shows off his fine comic timing with tightly controlled slapstick movement that is quite impressive. Strong support is contributed by Rob Reiner, Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, and especially by Margot Robbie as Wolfie's trophy wife.<br/><br/>Still there are far too many scenes that go on and on needlessly to the point of overstatement and tedium. More judicious editing would have only improved the finished film. The screenplay by Terence Winter truly captures the avarice motives of the stockbroker's well and has wonderful dialog even though some of the character's action remain unexplained in their unbridled admiration for Jordan.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is always entertaining but its excessiveness and overwrought narrative makes the film a loud and bloated exercise in expert filmmaking that never carries any emotional impact. The film huffs and puffs and eventually blows its own house down with its own pretentious ambitions.

"abouhelier-r","8","1","5","30 December 2013"," The Wolf of Wall Street
","The Wolf of Wall Street promised to be THE film of this late 2013 year and indeed, I can tell you that it was a successful gamble. After Django Unchained and The Great Gatsby earlier this year, Leonardo DiCaprio is joining (one more time) Martin Scorsese in one of the most overwhelming film ever produced. The carefully set scenes of money, sex and drugs are efficiently paced by a non-stop and breathtaking rhythm. Which stops three times, based on several important parts of Jordan Belfort's life. His involvement in taking Steve Madden company public, his first divorce and when he tries to flee with his daughter. During the whole film a sort of sadistic atmosphere settles, little by little we can see the evolution of Jordan's character. He begins as a greedy trade connector and rise till his successful life as a wealthy stockbroker. A parallel narration is settled between Jordan and us as if he's trying to justify his criminal actions, it can be related to his thoughts, conscience or inner morale. It makes me think a lot of Kevin Spacey's character in House of Cards, who talks directly to us. In Wolf of Wall Street, Belfort is trying to explain why he behaved like that. None of the FBI's point of view is shown, only the ""bad guy"" is display here which give him more credibility. He doesn't appear like a real white collar criminal, like a real threat, because all he does is having fun doing what he loves the most: earning money. Moreover this year must be very prolific for DiCaprio. Leo's acting all along this more or less three hours long film is BRILLIANT and I don't know if it's Scorsese direction or just his talent but it makes the film works efficiently. Pointed out the moral and cultural decadence more than just the economic part of all this process. His ""Empire"" is compare to America : where you could choose to be who you want to be in a country where all you have to do his choose which opportunity you want. And obviously America always win. Jordan Belfort's fall involves both his private and public life. As on the one hand Jordan's wife is tired of all his excess (drugs, pills, sex, alcool, etc.) and decides to divorce. And on the other hand his implication in crime and widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, as a result he is convicts of more than twenty official charges and sentenced to thirty-six month imprisonment. Wall Street under steroids."

","An ""X"" rating could be justified; but otherwise it is a delightful romp steered expertly by DiCaprio who delivers a character with extremes from hilarious to pitiful. Clearly he is developing into one of Hollywood's most watchable male leads. It kept occurring to me that he had worked hard on this movie, not drifting from one scene to the next. Not only were his lines the stuff of legend, his antics were exhaustive (although some must have been a hoot to film). If on-screen sex - simulated or maybe even real - offends you, there is no way you will be entertained by this movie and its additional display of excessive drug use, lust, greed, and/or the debasing behavior at virtually every minute of this 3-hour movie. All that said, as a red-blooded American male, I loved it all . . . it reminded me of ""Hangover"" with a business twist. And DiCaprio has grown from an awkward boy star to revive memories of the likes of Clark Gable, Bogart, and Cary Grant; in fact, he can even summon up comedic antics not seen since Jerry Lewis."
"rtp4242","8","1","5","28 December 2013"," The Wolf Of Wall Street. A great movie, a bit long in the tooth.
","At age 22, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DeCaprio) gets a plum job with a prestigious brokerage. He is taught the ropes of being a successful broker by Mark Hanna. (Matthew McConaughey) Hanna's advice to Jordan, take a lot of drugs, pleasure yourself twice a day and separate your client's cash from your client. As soon as Jordan gets his series 7 license, black Monday occurs on October 19th 1987, and Jordan finds himself out of a job. He works for a while in a small brokerage on Long Island, where he sells penny stocks to unsuspecting clients , making 50% commission. A friend, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) is so impressed with Jordan's take home pay that he quits his job to become a broker. It is then that Jordan starts Stratton Oakmont in an abandoned auto garage. He staffs Stratton with old friends from the neighborhood, most of them small time drug dealers. Nicky Koskof (PJ Byrne) nicknamed Rugrat, because of his bad hairpiece, Chester Ming, (Kenneth Choi) Robbie Feinberg,(Brian Sacca) and Alden Kupferberg (Henry Zebrowski) join Jordan and Donnie at Stratton, and by promising to sell blue chip stocks and really selling lousy penny stocks, Jordan and his cohorts rake in lots of money.<br/><br/>Jordan agrees to speak to Forbes magazine for what he thinks is a puff piece, the Forbes reporter nicknames him the Wolf Of Wall Street. Not only doesn't this hurt his reputation, lots of newly minted brokers want to work for Stratton. Jordan realizes that the next big step for the brokerage is to sell an IPO, initial public offering of a newly formed company. Donnie is friends with Steve Madden, (Jake Hoffman) woman's shoe designer who wants to take his company public. Stratton Oakmont takes the company public, and Jordan puts 85% of Steve Madden stock under his control, which is illegal. By this time both the SEC and FBI are investigating Stratton Oakmont for shady securities practices. As Jordan's professional life deteriorates, his personal life is in similar disarray. Jordan has already divorced his first wife, and is having difficulties with his second wife, Naomi (Margot Robbie) because of Jordan's predilection for hookers. Jordan and Donnie also snort massive amounts of cocaine and take Quaaludes to come off the high. To say the least, these vices mess with Jordan's judgment, but he still can get out of serious jail time if he pleads guilty to a few minor SEC violations and steps down from Stratton, will he do it?<br/><br/>I like The Wolf Of Wall Street a great deal. I expected to see Oliver Stone's Wall Street, and instead I saw a much funnier take on the Wall Street culture, some of it was laugh out loud funny. Sometimes, I think it was too funny for its own good. Jordan Belfort is a real person, he did swindle lots of people out of their money, and at times, I felt like the movie treated his transgressions much too lightheartedly. By the time the movie switches to a more serious tone, the pacing also slows down quite a bit. Martin Scorsese, who directed this movie, didn't need so much detail in telling the story, and could have done a good bit of editing to help with the pacing. Because it's directed by Scorsese, The Wolf of Wall Street reminded me of Goodfellas. Henry Hill and Jordan Belfort are very similar, they both put on the facade of being pillars of the community, while in reality they craved debauchery. Scorsese is extremely good at showing the dichotomy between the public and private lives of both men.<br/><br/>The acting is good. Leonardo DeCaprio is very good as a man whose moral compass is broken, and who only cares about fulfilling his hedonistic needs. DeCaprio turns from good time Charlie to raving lunatic in a flash, and that's not easy to do, a lesser actor could have blown that role very easily. He also does the New York accent very well. Margot Robbie does a really good job in a tough role as Belfort's second wife Naomi, she plays Naomi as a very manipulative woman using sex as a weapon, but and she also stands up for herself when she needs to. She also handles the accent well, even though she's from Australia. I cannot for the life of me understand the casting of Jonah Hill in this movie, he plays Donnie Azoff as a complete moron, a goofball looking for his next score of money or drugs. Hill has never failed to annoy me with his frat boy antics in any movie he's in. The streak continues. I'm similarly puzzled by the casting of Rob Reiner as Jordan's father. Reiner plays the role strictly for laughs, which adds to the confused tone of the film. <br/><br/>Overall, a very good film, a bit long, and sometimes confused tonally, but still very good.<br/><br/>For more howlingly good reviews, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

","I am sorry to all of those who are offended by this movie but, go watch something else. This is by far my absolute favorite movie of all time. It is entertaining from start to finish with an amazing cast that makes it even better. Perfectly directed! Perfectly acted! Story is perfectly told! It is just overall the perfect movie in my opinion, for I can watch this over and over and it never gets old. Thank you Scorsese you continue to show us that you are an amazing director!"
"TheGoforth","1","1","6","8 August 2019"," Did Scorsese realise that most fans of this movie celebrate and admire the characters?
","Young heterosexual males make up the core audience of this film, which seems to be the main demographic of Scorsese's filmography and not much of a testament to his range. With that in mind, everything that Scorsese would claim he wanted to show as a vice is in fact celebrated as a virtue by the movie's audience and this is why the film fails in my opinion. Unlike the masterful ""American Psycho"" which superbly presented this particular environment as ridiculous and used humour at the expense of its characters, Scorsese seems to craft ""Wolf of Wall Street"" in a way that makes men in the audience want to identify with the roles and emulate the behaviour. It gives me a sickening feeling that so much money went into a movie so devoid of intelligence and humanity... even ""Goodfellas"" had redemption in the sense that Liotta's narration was portrayed as jaded... no such luck here, with the smug and smarmy DiCaprio setting the tone for everyone else's performance. This film is the biggest moneymaker of Scorsese's career but I feel he really lost all integrity as an artist for making it. It's just an excuse to make an excessive, lurid fantasy film for men under the guise of being a morality tale. It tells us nothing, it offers us nothing. It is hollow and toxic."

","If you like profanity, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, anal sex and more then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>I also thought that swearing in front of a 2 year old child was uncalled for. Doing drugs in front of a child was not kosher either. Wrecking the car and watching the child get head bashed in was not kosher. Story could have been told in one hour or less. All the negative stuff took precedent over the storyline. I really don't believe all this as true. I can't understand why this movie has a high rating. Does not say too much for the modern day human. This movie is almost legalized porno. Tis a shame."

","""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."" Henry Hill's famous line echoes through Jordan Belfort's ""I always wanted to be rich."" The Wolf of Wall Street is Martin Scorsese's fifth collaboration with a never-better Leonardo DiCaprio and although it doesn't quite match the energy of Goodfellas, it is Scorsese's most accomplished film since.<br/><br/>Unlike Scorsese's previous works, it's the dialogue that is the core to this feature. Not only does The Wolf of Wall Street feature 569 uses of the f-word - breaking a new record in cinema history - ""You wanna know what money sounds like?"" But it's lines like this that grab the audience's attention and set the tone for the film.<br/><br/>The attention to detail, along with a soundtrack that ranges from Foo Fighters to Simon & Garfunkel, is nothing short of pure genius. Throughout the film you'll notice deliberate continuity errors as well as carefully selected lens changes that reinforce each characters drug fuelled mental state. The fast paced editing, whip pans, crash zooms and freeze frames also contribute to the madness that unfolds on screen which makes The Wolf of Wall Street an epitome of pure cinema.<br/><br/>The entire Quaaludes scene is utterly jaw-dropping yet hilarious thanks to DiCaprio's superb improvisational skills. Not only is this the stand out scene of the entire film but one of the most shocking too. It's no wonder the MPAA had a heart attack over the explicit content on show but despite what they may have said, The Wolf of Wall Street certainly doesn't promote such a crazed lifestyle.<br/><br/>As expected, Leonardo DiCaprio excels as Jordan Belfort. The enthusiasm he brings to the role, in particular, shines through his character's motivational speeches that are as slick as Belfort's black hair and sharp suits. His performance is so convincing you will have to fight the urge to jump out of your seat to start cheering to his every command. This is undoubtedly the performance of his career and it will be truly shameful if he doesn't get to walk away with his long overdue Oscar this year.<br/><br/>Prepare to bow down to the aptly named ""Duchess"" Margot Robbie who is the films breakout star. Not only is she a beauty that provides the humour and honesty but she also becomes the films emotional conscience. Jonah Hill plays Belfort's pastel wearing sidekick Donnie Azoff who, as always, gets some of the biggest and broadest laughs. Matthew McConaughey comes and goes, but his presence is strong until the very end all thanks to his memorable dinner scene with DiCaprio.<br/><br/>It may be a touch too long, but each scene as entertaining as the next. An unbelievably funny, bold and outrageous epic marking Scorsese's most controversial film to date. Expect to be beating your chest for days afterwards."

","There is not much to add about this film, which has been already said. Have you ever watch Barcelona play football? Well, this is similar in motion picture. Excellent work by everyone, excellent portrayal of Wall Street and its way of life. I wanted to have that kind of life, I went to the USA and New York City, but I was prevented from having it. It is a shame from people who consider themselves Wall Street insiders not to permit outsiders to get into their world.<br/><br/>This film well portrays how few have a lot of money and they want more, and how they do not permit for outsiders to have a piece of cake.<br/><br/>Acting is fabulous, Leonardo di Caprio matured to be one of the great actors of out time, directing is fantastic and all about this film is shining. May be for touch it is too long, but how can you tell this kind of story in short amount of time? <br/><br/>Message for those who have so much money: Convert it to cash as much as you can and give it to those who need it. Not to the organizations, but to poor and those who can not make money for different reasons. To the individuals to solve their day to day problems. Don't overdo it, keep enough for yourself, how much you really need, but the rest you should give it away. You will make a lot of friends and happy people. :)"

Not sure where to start, in fact no matter how much rambling I do there is no way to show how amazing this movie is without you seeing it for yourself at the cinema...it's just pure brilliance. It's witty and sometimes dark humor is matched evenly by its brutality and cinematic excellence, which makes for quite possibly one of the best movies you'll see. Martin Scorsese has, well, done it again! By all accounts this is amongst his top work. Leonardo DiCaprio is just incredible, a very engaging performance. It's safe to say he has nailed it, he definitely deserves the Oscar finally! Jonah Hill is the best I've ever seen him, and well so is everyone else. The script is solid and absolutely amazing, and so is the direction. I've seen three amazing films so far this year, American Hustle, 12 Years A Slave and this...and, I have to say...this film edges it to top spot out of all of them. Incredible. A must see!"

Who cares about the truth if you could get an enjoyable, funny piece like that?<br/><br/>Comedy crime at its finest. Indeed Scorsese's best work since Goodfellas. If you look at both of the movies, they have the same core, those people who do bad stuff and how they f*cking enjoy it, yet this might get them f*cked up. <br/><br/>Some people are whining about the hardcore nude scenes and the hard language, but f*ck it, Scorsese played his cards so damn well to get a fine job.<br/><br/>And oh, gosh, Leo was shining; I might have misjudged his performance because I was half-asleep when I tried to watch the first hour of it, I thought he was great, but when I got to watch it all over again, I didn't believe he was THAT great. He showed some good skills. Jonah is one of the funniest actors you would ever watch, the dude's face would make laugh for no reason.<br/><br/>And I really need to mention that I wished McConaughey to stay on the screen for more than just two scenes, the dude is so catchy. I totally forgot during his minutes that this movie was about Leo, he did stole the light and I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The movie is about the Wall Street society, and I liked that it was all focused on them, and just them. He didn't seek your sympathy with anybody, though it could have been easier to get with those who have been defrauded, because yes, the movie didn't have a deep emotional or philosophical core, but you wouldn't always look for that, sometimes you just need fun and fun you get."
"Hellmant","10","1","6","6 January 2014"," A highly amusing but deeply disturbing look at the American dream of excessiveness and self obsession!
","'THE WOLF OF WALL STREET': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio's fifth film collaboration together is this dark comedy biographical film based on the life of self-made millionaire Jordan Belfort (it's also based on his book of the same name). Scorsese directed the movie and Terence Winter wrote the screenplay (Winter was a regular writer for 'THE SOPRANOS' and previously worked with Scorsese on another popular crime show called 'BOARDWALK EMPIRE'). DiCaprio plays Belfort in the film and it's his second time playing a crazy self-made millionaire in the same year (following 'THE GREAT GATSBY' from last summer). Jonah Hill, Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Spike Jonze, Ethan Suplee, Jean Dujardin (of 'THE ARTIST' fame) and the gorgeous Margot Robbie all co-star in the movie. The film is highly amusing but it's also a deeply disturbing (and completely honest) look at the American dream of excessiveness and self obsession.<br/><br/>The film is narrated by Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), who often speaks directly to the camera, as he explains how he rose from the middle class to become one of America's most successful stockbrokers (and make millions). We meet many of his other crooked but brilliant cohorts along the way, like Donnie Azoff (Hill) and Nicky Koskoff (P.J. Byrne). Belfort was married twice and had a daughter but could never quite settle down and stop his crazy sex and drug habits. His many illegal business tactics eventually attracted the attention of the FBI. <br/><br/>The movie once again supports the popular belief that in order to get ahead in this world you can't really care about anything; the more you're willing to compromise your morals the more money, sex and popularity you'll achieve (that's what people ultimately respect). It's sad but true. Of course there's always exceptions to this accepted way of life but they're very few and far between. DiCaprio is once again genius in the lead role and Scorsese's directing is (once again) masterful. The supporting cast is all excellent as well (especially McConaughey who's had an amazing last couple of years). It's perhaps a tad too long at three hours (no movie really needs to be that long) but the running length fits the main theme of the film (excessiveness). The movie is especially entertaining because it does appeal to the weakest part of human nature: just living life to the fullest without caring about anything. There are so many hilarious drug and alcohol abuse scenes (which is one of my biggest temptations and weaknesses) and the movie is just a blast to watch (even if there is too much of it). It's definitely not for everyone but I'm always surprised to see people walking out of a movie like this (just a third of the way into it, on it's thirteenth or fourteenth explicit and outrageously crude sex scene) like they didn't know what they were paying to see! The film is a masterpiece and Scorsese and DiCaprio prove once again why they're one of the best cinematic teams working today (perhaps even better than Scorsese and De Niro were)!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s"

However, his illegal activities soon attract the attention of authorities. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, who appears in nearly every scene of the movie, delivers his most enjoyable and riveting performances to date. He excels at portraying real, larger-than-life figures (such as Howard Hughes and Frank Abagnale Jr.) and certainly merits an Oscar nomination for this role. Jonah Hill, who first showed some serious acting chops in Moneyball, rises to greatness in this film. He is amazing as Belfort's friend, confidante, and business partner, Donnie Azoff. I felt he delivered a brilliant performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination as well.<br/><br/>Although the film is a full 3 hours long, it moved at a quick pace and never seemed to drag. It's also very humorous and quite simply a joy to watch. Based on Belfort's book of the same name, The Wolf of Wall Street provides an unflinching and often unflattering examination of Belfort during these crazy years of abuse and debauchery. At it's simplest level, this movie is a powerful reminder that no amount of money can buy true love, loyalty, friendship, or happiness."

","I will say this right off the bat. 3 hours didn't seem like 3 hours but I could definitely feel it in the last 1 hr of the movie when my body started to get uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Leo is Leo and he deserves an Oscar nomination. The plot and everything in the movie is well done just like Scorsese usually does. For those that don't know, this is a Wall Street movie. If you have seen Boiler Room, which was actually inspired by Jordan's story over 10 years ago, or Wall Street, with the original king of Wall Street Gordon Gecko, then some of the movie is predictable. You go from poor to rich and then you get the FBI after you.<br/><br/>However, this movie is excellent and tells the story from a slightly different view. People whine about the nudity but let's be serious. It wasn't that bad.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this a 9/10.

","We must address two things when talking about ""Wolf"": first, the 3-hour runtime. That's long, and at points the film loses focus and wanders. Second: it's rated R, but the explicit amount of nudity, sex and drugs are tapping on the door of NC-17. However, ""Wolf"" is much more than these foibles. Bursting with life and youthfulness, ""Wolf"" is utterly and undeniably engrossing; a kinetic, spastic and hilarious peak behind the curtain of the debauch of America's top 1%. ""Wolf"" is the true story of Jordan Belfort, whose lack of morality helped make him and his friends some of the richest, shrewdest, and crudest brokers in the world. Every turn in the story is planted in some sort of sin, a chance to sell something to someone. And while the filmmakers are clearly condemning this behavior, in true Scorsese form he doesn't allow us to sit on our high horses above these people, but instead forces us into their environment, and at times even rooting for them. The performances are stunning. McConaughey is off-his-rocker brilliant. Hill is gone in his funny, neurotic role. At the center, Dicaprio gives his best performance to date, masterfully playing the monster behind everything with fervor and abandon. Add in the energetic editing and camera-work, ""Wolf"" contains some of the most memorable scenes of the year. This is first-rate, oddly refreshing filmmaking that sticks to your ribs. Scorsese has stayed current and relevant for going-on 5 decades, making films like an excited younger man is behind them. If not for the moments of unnecessary explicitness, this would be a nearly flawless masterpiece."

","This flick is the most bloated crime film since director Brian De Palma's 1983 remake of SCARFACE, which actually clocks in 10 minutes quicker than THE WOLF OF WALL STREET. As the WOLF, Leonardo DiCaprio tries to break Al Pacino's SCARFACE record for scenery chewing, doing everything short of yelling ""I'm King of the World!"" again. Wall Street villains are a dime a dozen; the only movie-worthy story would be if an HONEST broker could be fabricated plausibly. WOLF director Martin Scorsese's message is stated overtly here more than once: America is ONLY for people with money, and NO ONE CARES how many lives you ruin to get it. Furthermore, once you have enough money to support 1,000 people comfortably, it's impossible to lose the respect of the American government or the majority of Americans. Mr. Scorsese has tons of money himself, so he knows that no matter how many dwarfs he throws at the screen--or totally full-frontal nude chicks, instances of child endangerment, and drug overdoses--America's critics will lap this up like pigs at the slop trough."

","The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best recent Scorsese movies I have seen. It is entertaining, well directed and phenomenally executed. It is a roller coaster of a film that engulfs you from start to end. The acting is excellent, perhaps one of Di Caprio's best; and not to forget Jonah Hill's brilliant performance that allows him to display his sense of humor while staying true to the stock broker character that he plays. It is almost as if we as the audience are on the same adrenaline rush that the characters are throughout the film. With the fast paced and thrilling nature of the Wall Street setting of the film, there was absolutely no moment to even realize that it was three hours long. The essence of wall street trying to be presented, was thoroughly depicted not only through the dialogue and screen play, but was also brought to life through the visual imagery of the film. The chaos, corruption and greed associated with wall street was effectively conveyed throughout the scenes, ranging from the carnival like atmosphere of the office to the excessive and lavish sets. I am uncertain of how accurately this film depicts the real life events it is based on, but the film definitely conveys what it is set out to in terms of the wild, overly consuming and greed infused nature of wall street."
"pshanosky","8","1","6","1 January 2014"," It sure isn't Goodfellas, but it isn't as bad as some reviews seem.
","Full disclosure off the bat here: I've owned the book written by the gentleman (Jordan Belfort) that this movie portrays for years, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Most reviews I see that have a strong negative impression seem to be misguided at best, as FIVE seconds of research into the book or character could have alerted anyone as to the content of this movie.<br/><br/>Now, as far as dark humor goes I am a big fan, and Scorsese's venture into this arena is certainly successful. Leo gives the performance of a lifetime, and Jonah Hill manages to pull off a role that I thought he was terribly miscast in. Should you expect this movie to be relevant to finance, you'll be disappointed. However, it was listed as a comedy for a reason. I work in the industry and had no qualms with this film.<br/><br/>The supporting actors did fantastic jobs for the relatively short scenes they were allowed. Matthew McConaughey, Jon Favreau, and Rob Reiner all did a fantastic job with what they were handed, contributing to some laugh out loud moments. This is NOT to say that the movie is without flaws, however. This 179 minute picture could be 30 minutes shorter, and even for a single 20-something male the amount of nudity was not really needed. I have no problem with the concept of attractive women, but if the scene is boring or serves no purpose then stick to the original 6 sex scenes. Additionally, the conclusion of the movie seemed to appear from nowhere, without significant drama or build-up. However, this being a comedy, I don't expect much else.<br/><br/>All things said, the movie is humorous, laugh out loud funny at points, and draws a little bit of satire out of the script as well. Great watch, and another good performance from the Scorsese/DiCaprio duo."

The performances are fantastic, it was a side of Leonardo DiCaprio that I haven't see before. Jonah Hill was also brilliant and added the necessary laughs when they were needed.<br/><br/>But don't expect a happy go lucky movie with only celebrations.

McConaughey's performance was fantastic in my opinion, basically being the epitome of all the brokers for the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Moving to the middle of the film, I found it to drag on in terms of content, as stated before, but I feel the long drawn out scenes were good fit for the movie, juxtaposing the fast paced world of Wall Street.<br/><br/>Overall, this great movie, I believe, could be considered among some of Scorsese's greats, not the best, but great, like many of his films have proved to be."

","'The Wolf of Wall Street', Martin Scorsese's new bio pic about a 'get- rich-quick' stock broker is also a commentary about the influence money has on people. It is not un-like Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' in that it is more objective than it is propaganda. Many of the types of scenes used to entertain in other films (specifically sex) are instead used here as a form of documentation. Whether the viewer is entertained is of little importance to the filmmaker. Scorsese can get away with this. He is perhaps the most brilliant motion picture director of our day. He has 'license' to do so, as did Kubrick. His name alone prompted me to see this film. Some have characterized this film as propaganda. They see it as an attempt to display the evils of corporate greed, when, at present, socialistic theory is becoming a reality in American economics. Their case is justified. Hitler did the same with film - as did Stalin. And, when understanding Scorsese's very liberal politics, one can easily come to the conclusion that the incentive to make 'The Wolf of Wall Street' was to influence en masse. If that be true, then one can also make the assertion that 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a docudrama about America's obsession with material wealth, sex, and drugs. This would be a more logical assumption. And, it falls back on the accusation that Scorsese doesn't care so much about entertaining as he is about informing. Like 'Eyes Wide Shut' it is an accusation and a mirror: a secular attempt to make immorality unpleasing. As well-made as this film is, the story will not be appreciated. With all of its nudity, sex, and reckless depictions of drug usage, it can easily be described as a tragic story about one man's destructive obsession with making money."

","Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Dicaprio collaborate once again for The Wolf of Wall Street, and the duo once again knocks it out of the park. As matter of fact, this is Martin Scorsese's best movie in years and this is perhaps Dicaprio's best performance of all time. If you can stomach the constant glorification of drugs, prostitution, adultery, money laundering, and midget tossing, you're in for a real treat. If you have religious convictions, you might want to stay away from this film. The Wolf of Wall Street is swimming in sin. Sweet, savory sin.<br/><br/>Sex, sex, sex. Quaaludes, quaaludes. Cocaine, cocaine, and midget tossing. This movie is filled with what some would call ""filth"" and others would call ""treasures"". It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, because lets face it: this movie has the potential to offend at least several groups of people out there. Feminists might be turned off by the sexual representation of many of the female characters. Religious people will scoff at the unruly nature of the Wall Street Wolves. Government kiss-asses will throw their hands in disgust over the middle finger this film waves at them. During my public viewing, I heard gasps and noticed a lot of people walking out in the middle of the movie. But Scorsese is a man with a legacy, and he didn't let the potential to offend people stifle his creative vision. If you the viewer allows yourself to enjoy the film, you will find a film with great acting, groovy music, and top notch cinematography. Scorsese still has it.<br/><br/>Although Jordan Belfort's controversial life isn't one to imitate, there is a heck of a lot of inspiration that I drew from the man's passion and leadership skills. What he did was illegal, but it was also impressive. He built an empire from scraps, and carried himself with enough confidence to build up his foot soldiers. Ultimately, his illegal activity catches up to him, but he was fortunate enough to survive the wasteland left in his wake. When you're an animal as fierce as a wolf, you take what you want, and you not only survive, you thrive."

","The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the most anticipated movies of the year, mainly because it features the famous director-actor duo of Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, who have previously worked on many good movies, like Shutter Island and The Departed. This movie is based on Jordan Belfort's biographical book of the same name, and Belfort himself helped DiCaprio prepare for the main role. It's important to point out that, because it was independently financed, the movie features lots of nudity, drug abuse and over-the-top sex scenes, which might make the viewing uncomfortable for some.<br/><br/>Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) starts his career at Wall Street but is soon fired because of the stock market crash in 1987 (known as Black Monday). He manages to get a job in an investment center and, being the most successful broker, he teaches his colleagues how to sell. Soon, realising his potential and finding a partner – Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) – he opens a brokerage firm, Stratton Oakmont, where he and his colleagues start selling penny stocks and frauding people – all the while making more money than they ever imagined, and spending it on drugs and prostitutes.<br/><br/>DiCaprio plays the perfect antihero: Belfort is a liar, he cheats on his wife, he steals money from people, he is constantly drugged out of his mind and so on. Still, it's very difficult to hate him, and I think most people actually envy him: who wouldn't want to have so much money, you can throw $100 bills in the trash without blinking? DiCaprio's performance is wonderful, and I hope he'll finally win the Oscar he deserves. The supporting actors find themselves somewhat in his shadow, but do a terrific work nonetheless – especially Jonah Hill, whose experience in comedies fits the dark humour of the movie perfectly. And because this movie is filled with humour, I had no problem with its length: you don't even realise it's 3 hours long because it's so entertaining.<br/><br/>Like I said, the movie features lots of drug abuse and sex scenes, which some people may consider pointless or whatever, but I feel it doesn't make any sense (and is also hypocritical) to consider it bad just because of this – which is an attitude many people on the internet seem to have. Also, this movie does not promote immoral behaviour. It's like saying slasher movies promote killing: it's a ridiculous and ignorant way of bashing a movie when you have no solid arguments. Finally, if you go see this movie, you're going to get sex, drugs, violence and lots of swearing, all of it wonderfully incorporated in a great biography. The Wolf of Wall Street is not for everyone, but it's a great movie I recommend to everyone who isn't easily scandalised.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"
"abisio","Null","1","6","26 December 2013"," The first Scorsese comedy; and really good at it.
","If you consider this movie as a comedy; it is probably the best one of 2013. You are going to laugh very loud with this one and feel not guilt; because what happens here is real and quite serious. Jordan Belfort is a real person; it was one of those stock brokers that made tons of money scamming people (really ? or just doing what stockbrokers do ?). As in any moral tale this guy went to jail (otherwise you will never hear about what happened) for not paying properly to his major partner; Uncle Sam. The moral dilemma of the movie is that if this guy kept doing his job but pay his taxes he would never went to jail (in fact he did not go a hell hole). On the first few minutes; Mathew McConaughey in an outstanding cameo that really deserves him another Oscar; basically defines the whole movie. He basically describes how greed make people stupid and how smart people profit on that. After that outstanding moment, we enter in a full rage of orgies, drugs, more orgies, much more drugs and a series of debaucheries rarely seen in an American mainstream movie. I am pretty sure that there is more nudity and sex in this movie than the sum of all American movies in 2012, 2013 and perhaps next year too. It is not really too original; you will predict everything that will happen and how it will end; but this time Scorsese decide to go for laughs and Di Caprio, Hill, and most of the male cast went for it; making something fun and original out of something predictable. Di Caprio is outstanding ; completely believable as an ambitious youngster and then as a greedy and charismatic and egomaniac. Hill is always fun; but his character is not really half important. Kyle Chandler is very good as an FBI agent who might be not so convinced or perhaps is too coward to be bribed (or the book and / or movie did not dare to tell the whole truth). Jean Dujardin shines as the Swiss banker that basically hates his customer. The women here are not particularly interesting. Cristin Milioti (as Jordan's first wife) is able to give some personality to an otherwise underwritten character. Margot Robbie as Naomi (Jordan's lover and second wife) start as a bitch and we do not get anything else from her or her character. In brief; and excellent comedy of a very serious subject; that could have benefited from some trimming ; but otherwise always funny."

"dpickett93","10","1","7","1 April 2014"," Leonardo Dicaprio is so underrated
","I feel so sorry for Scorsese and DiCaprio. All the hard work and money that was put into this great film that was only nominated twice in the Golden Globes and as far as I saw rarely in the Academy Awards. I have seen (and own) just about every Oscar-nominated film of 2014 and I have to say ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (which is a comedy) is a wonderful film and once again one of Scorsese's best work. I love that the film was basically 3 hours. It took me on a real adventure about the life of Jordan Belfort. ""American Hustle"" did not have enough comedy to become the best in a category with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". Leonardo DiCaprio once again is snubbed of another Academy Award but he seems so humble and loves his work so much that he just wants to produce go material. All an all the film is perfect. This is my first film rating of 10 out of 10 which I never give."
"bob-rutzel-1","8","1","7","30 March 2014"," Enjoyable
","This is based upon actual events as told by Jordan Belfort in his books on his life. Many names have been changed in here. <br/><br/>Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) builds his empire with penny-stocks defrauding stockholders and raking in millions. <br/><br/>The movie is 3-hours long and it went pretty fast because the pacing, dialogues by all and the narratives by DiCapiro as Belfort were very good. <br/><br/>When a movie is based upon real life over-the-top partying and drug addicts we should be aware that what we see and hear may offend. We see Belfort with a partying life style and hooked on drugs. The partying or more correct term ""sex-orgies"" show up many times. Nudity abounds as do simulated sex scenes and lets' not forget sex talk throughout and the accompanying language. <br/><br/>Still we understand that most of what we see and hear did actually take place according to Jordan Belfort's books on these parts of his life. Mr. Scorsese, the director, opted to show all and tell all.<br/><br/>Did we need to see the clients who were defrauded? No. If this was brought in the movie may have been 1-hour longer. Just hearing about those defrauded was enough. We didn't need to see and hear any sad stories. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio was nominated for Best Actor and he could have gotten it, but he ran into a buzz-saw by the name of Matthew McConaughey in the DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. McConaughey had a small part in here and was extremely good. Actually, Leonardo DiCaprio should have gotten the Best Actor Award for many of his previous movies. As I have said before and will say again: he is a class act and he makes everyone else better. <br/><br/>We do hear some good lines with humor, but we also see some silly and stupid sight-gags and keeping in mind these may have actually happened, we cannot fault Hollywood this time. Many of these instances involve Jonah Hill as Belfort's partner Donnie. I found these scenes to be extremely annoying. Jonah Hill, I believe, still thinks he is a comedian. Not a chance. When he slows down and performs in a good dramatic fashion, he is very good. <br/><br/>Take from this what you will, but I did find it to be enjoyable. <br/><br/>If you want to know more about Jordan Belfort, look him up in Wikipedia. (8/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes, kinda when someone gets punched. Sex: Yes, throughout. Nudity: Yes, throughout. Drug Use: Yes, throughout. Language: Yes, throughout."

"wil-dawson-flowers","10","1","7","19 February 2014"," Sell Me This Pen...
","Let me start by saying I am a HUGE DiCaprio and Scorsese movie fan. Films like Shutter Island and The Departed are absolute thrill rides for me. I turned 17 this weekend and decided to go see WOWS...which is a PERFECT acronym for the title because this crazy film does indeed make yourself gasp and say ""wow"" quite a bit. This is the most unusual Scorsese film I have ever seen. And I believe it works for a couple of reasons. The true story is about the convicted con-artist Jordan Belfort (played by my boy Leo) and his rise and fall in the stockbroker business. Leonardo DiCaprio is INCREDIBLE in this movie. He plays a sex and drug craving D-Bag better than I have ever seen. This is definitively the next role people will remember him for. This is not your Jack Dawson you know and love. This is a man who knows what he wants and gets it. PERIOD. DiCaprio completely sells this character and makes you laugh till it hurts. Along with his unexpectedly well casted sidekick, Jonah Hill as Donnie. The partner in crime. I have read other reviews stating that this film is TOO vulgar and inappropriate. Well ladies and gentleman if you think that this movie is vulgar and promotes drugs and crime...you forget the film is based on the man behind the book. OF COURSE its going to be glorified and with good reason too! This movie isn't for the faint of heart. It was almost not put into theaters for goodness' sake!!! As soon as I heard about the film I knew it was going to be the next R rated movie that pushes the boundaries...so that is no excuse. Second the film has no plot because what is the point? Its a movie about someone's life and what they did in that life. This movie was made to put DiCaprio on that stage winning that Oscar. And it is damn well deserved too! This movie does not ever feel like it's too long. The dialog and improvisations of the characters makes it all worth the while. In fact, I think the movie could have been even longer! So the bottom line is you either hate this movie, or you love it. I for one loved it, not even because of DiCaprio's performance, but the spirit of the film. Scorsese wanted the best result possible, and he got it. I may have been ""scammed"" by Mr. Belfort to see this movie, but frankly I don't care. I had a blast and I hope you will too!"
"xpxmelody","10","1","7","14 February 2014"," ""Catch me if you Can"" meets ""Goodfellas"", turned up to 11
","Everything about this movie was perfect from start to finish. Leonardo DiCaprio never ceases to amaze me, Jonah Hill was hilarious, Matthew McConaughey was brilliant, and Scorcese delivered his best film yet. Leo and Hill have a really great chemistry and I look forward to seeing more films from them. McConaughey has really impressed me with his most recent films and has also become one of my favorite actors. If you combined Goodfellas with Catch me if you Can, but turned up the drugs and offensive humor to 11, then you have The Wolf of Wall Street. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and absolutely loved it. It's no doubt that Leo really stole the show, and keeps you entertained for the full 3 hours. If I could, I would RATE this movie an 11. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, and you may want to skip it if you are a p****."

He shows so many faces.<br/><br/>The supporting actors are great too. Matthew McConaughey doesn't have much time in the movie but his character is unforgettable. Except for Jean Dujardin who is crushed by the casting, hard to shine in an American movie.<br/><br/>Many people say that there's too much drugs and sex in this movie but it appears for a purpose the images are not there for free. It's part of the reality of the environment of these guys. It cannot be eluded.<br/><br/>I think it's one of my favorite movie of Scorsese along with Casino."
"wvisser-leusden","10","1","7","9 February 2014"," growing to be much more than an excellent film
","Having been in successful circulation for just over a month, it surely looks like 'The Wolf of Wall Street' will grow much bigger than being just an excellent film.<br/><br/>It's about the first years of the 21st century, an era when the financial responsible people behaved themselves utterly irresponsible. Thus causing severe financial damage, that had to be paid for with taxpayer's money. Generating in its turn a severe government cost-cutting, that hit the poor & less-gifted among us in the first place. This rude betrayal of public confidence has sowed considerable mistrust, sharpening appropriate laws considerably. And will complicate honest business for a long time to come.<br/><br/>The financial disaster from 2008 will probably be remembered in 2114, just like we remember us the Wall Street crash of 1929. <br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Eisenstein's 'Aleksadr Nevski' (1938) symbolizes Adolf Hitler's threat to Communist Russia. Antonoini's 'Blow Up' (1966) symbolizes the Swinging Sixties in London. I expect that 'the Wolf of Wall street' will in the same way symbolize the financial disaster from 2008."

The film is based on a true story, its a biography but its one of the funniest films i have ever seen. Jonah is amazing and earned his small payout and should also be acknowledged on awards day. Its a drug fuelled crazy 3 hours which fly by leaving you in stitches of laughter at times and utter amazement at others.

The scene of him getting high on Quaaludes and then driving his car is a classic. Who knew Leonardo DiCaprio could play funny with a straight face and his portrayal of a Wall Street stockbroker is both dazzling and spellbinding. That the story is based on an autobiographical book by the real Jordan Belfort just adds poignancy and weight to the movie. I will be seeing this movie again.<br/><br/>Another reviewer said: ""By far the Best Movie of the Year, Best Actor, Best Director"". No argument from me. This movie has Oscar written all over it.<br/><br/>The movie is also a frightening expose about what went wrong with our economy in the last decade. These arrogant greed mongers all deserve jail time and the loss of their ill gotten gains. <br/><br/>I knew someone who worked for a brokerage firm and ​he ​describes the floor just the way it was presented in the movie​. He was even told to ramp up the enthusiasm by jumping onto his desk. He said he made a lot of money but got out because of his conscience.

A raw view of the imagined life of the roaring 80s and 90s and is noted to have the highest mention of the f-bomb, a mere 506 times in a movie. Full of hedonism and illegal money operations until the federal government shut him down. The Wolf of Wall Street is long at a bit over 3 hours, but it is a fast pace ride.

","I can't think of any other word to describe this film because that's just what it is, brilliant. Leonardo portrayed Jordan Belfort perfectly. His performance was believable and not in any way over the top. The scene where Naomi tells him he wants a divorce is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen from him. Together, Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job showing the change in Jordan throughout the film as he gets more and more money-crazed. At pretty much 3 hours, it's quite a long film but I found myself so completely enthralled by the story that I didn't notice the long time frame. I didn't think this movie was something I would enjoy because I never enjoy movies with large amounts of drugs and sex but it's definitely one of the best movies I've seen all year (Including 2013). I 100% recommend this film, it's absolutely brilliant."
"freelancegavin","8","1","7","18 January 2014"," Review
","I was intrigued to see this movie, as I love films around financial excesses, in fact any film about excesses and this did not disappoint. Then I did my research and noted it was directed by one of my favourites; Scorcese. It had all the ingredients of his previous films, a Goodfellas of fiscal greed with the same nuisances and peppered with similarities to the latter film. It was almost a penny stock pastiche. I have always loved Scorcese's style but it feels though it was gritty and shocking, in parts, lacks a little edge and style but more to this later. jonah Hill absolutely stole the show and for me makes the whole film. He was the quintessential fat friend who jokes around to DiCaprio's dashing lead. The sets were well done, the shocking boat scene was very realistic and you felt gripping all in all I think this film is quite iconic - a definite classic. It was brash and definitely split the audience, men loved it, women gasped, covered their eyes, turned away in parts, and men roared out loud laughing. I quite like the fact this was a boys film. Some parts had the shocking brutality you'd expect from Scorcese - true machismo grit. <br/><br/>The three hours flew but it would have been a ten out of ten, for these facts; Bit done with Leonardo DiCaprio's Tom-Cruiseesque acting cite him jumping on Oprah's sofa roaring acting moments. It lacks a bit of depth there, a gripping scene in which Jonah Hill is ill was really moving, raw and tinges of almost humour as you watched them so high you were laughing with them until tragic moments almost occur. But DiCaprio's divorce argument with second wife, though his wife was excellent and Karen Hill Bronx twang voice to match, but he just wasn't angry enough or dark enough or enough close ups on his face as his life unfolded. <br/><br/>Another thing missing and this is noticeable a strong musical element, perhaps this was intentional but it really didn't sweep you in, as say a monologue at the beginning of Goodfella, Ray Liotta stops talking directly into the camera...boom... da da da ""I go from Rags to Riches"". There are some of the best one liners I've heard in a movie in a long time, but the opening monologue is pretty poor, and so I must say is the ending. It just falls a bit flat. Go see it, but force the producers to cut in some classic movie gangster music here and there and some old classics. I loved it that much I'll keep the line ""there's no nobility in poverty"" on my DiCaprio and Hill framed print I'm making. The pairing of the two is iconic."
"eezie2","8","1","7","15 January 2014"," Well Done!
","Overall, Leonardo did a terrific job. Captivating, funny, and engaging. Truly a star of the times. The plot was gripping, with due humor at strategic times, but really dragged with all the drugs, sex and rock & roll we all knew from the 80's. Believe me, I was there and do remember the times. Unfortunately, as good as this was, a 30 minute partial cut of some of the party scenes would have enhanced a super story instead of dragging it on. Yep, it dragged in a few places, yet the acting kept a flow that will give it it's higher rating. Scorsese knows how to direct, and this is a more than worthy movie to watch. I only suggest you do it at home when you can fast forward through the overdone party scenes or make more popcorn. 8 stars from me."

Leonardo DiCaprio once again acted the sh*t out of this thing, as did everyone else. It really is brilliantly acted, and you know what, the plot is pretty good too. It keeps you interested, it keeps you watching, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It keeps you wondering: 'Oh my god, what's going to happen next?' But I'm a radical, a rebel, a socialist. Yes, f*ck you and your dysfunctional capitalism. I hate Wall Street and its fraudulent business, its lobbyists in politics, its sleazy little ways to bypass laws and rules. The FBI will certainly not get on Wall Street's case, this movie is way too optimistic.

"jmoney-2","8","1","7","6 January 2014"," A brilliantly absurd parody of greed, corruption, addiction and immorality
","""This movie contains graphic violence and sexual content,"" warned the young man at the ticket window.<br/><br/>""Do you have to give that disclaimer all the time now?"" I asked.<br/><br/>""Only for this movie,"" the young man replied, shaking his head. ""So many people are walking out and demanding their money back. I mean, what do they expect?"" he shrugged. ""It's an 'R'-rated movie."" I nodded my head in agreement. Yes, The Wolf of Wall Street is an ""R""-rated movie, I thought to myself. But not just any ""R""-rated movie. It's an ""R""-rated movie directed by Martin Scorsese, the man who brought us such controversial films as The Last Temptation of Christ and the ultra-violent Taxi Driver. That anyone would be surprised by the explicit content of one of his pictures - let alone one clearly marketed as a dark comedy about the hedonistic lifestyle of a wealthy stock broker - is slightly dumbfounding to me. To put it more succinctly, anyone who's easily offended should probably go see Walking With Dinosaurs instead.<br/><br/>Yes, the amount of nudity, drug use and foul language in The Wolf of Wall Street is a little excessive. But it's a movie about excess. It's an over-the-top parody of greed, corruption, addiction and immorality. And it's told using many of Scorsese's signature flourishes: tracking shots, a narrator speaking directly into the camera and a pop music soundtrack. It's Goodfellas in the stock market.<br/><br/>It's also the cap stone of Leonardo DiCaprio's self-described unofficial trilogy of movies, each set about 60 years apart, that focus on wealth and the lengths men will go to in order to ""hold on to and achieve wealth."" In Django Unchained, he played an evil southern plantation owner. In The Great Gatsby, he was the titular 1920s bootlegger. This time, he gives a full-throttle performance as real-life former brokerage firm owner Jordan Belfort, who made millions in the 1990s through so-called ""pump and dump"" stock schemes and high-pressure boiler room sales tactics.<br/><br/>Nearly all of Belfort's actions are despicable, destructive, immoral and irresponsible. The joke is that each one is worse than the one that preceded it. The three-hour movie could have made its point in less time, but the film never drags and is never dull. Instead, it constantly builds. Each (reportedly true) episode of debauchery and criminality is more absurd than the one that came before. Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter (Boardwalk Empire) don't exactly glorify Belfort's extravagant and sex-and-drug-fueled lifestyle. Rather, it's a cautionary tale. Partying may be fun for a while, but poor choices lead to poor consequences, if not remorse and regret. The sex scenes are all played for laughs, and very often, the joke's on DiCaprio's character. And the drug scenes clearly show that taking Quaaludes is a great way to wreck your expensive sports car.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great. As Belfort's business partner, Jonah Hill gives the best performance of his young career. Matthew McConaughey (who's already likely - and deservedly - in the running for a 2013 Academy Award for his lead role in Dallas Buyers Club) steals a scene early on, playing Belfort's mentor. And Rob Reiner (who famously spoofed Scorsese in This Is Spinal Tap) makes a welcome return to the screen in a funny role as Jordan's dad.<br/><br/>There's been much criticism of the fact that Belfort's victims are barely acknowledged. But that's not surprising since the movie is told from Belfort's point of view. The real-life Belfort apparently never spent a single second thinking about all the lives he was ruining, so why would his on-screen doppelganger? The movie examines how people can lose compassion for fellow human beings when enormous sums of money are at stake. In the end, the movie forces the viewer to confront the unsettling question of whether we all secretly want to be Jordan Belfort."
"thewillt08","10","1","7","4 January 2014"," And the Oscar Goes to....
","One of these days Leonardo DiCaprio will get an Oscar. If he does not get one for Wolf of Wall Street than I think he may as well quit. Martin Scorsese and DiCaprio team up again and produce another Oscar worthy film. This duo has worked a lot in the past and they bring greatness on the big screen. Wolf of Wall Street follows Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who rose from very little to become a multimillionaire. Through all the illegal work and illegal drugs Belfort becomes a huge success but has struggles with the law. Jonah Hill delivers his best performance to date and once again proves to Hollywood that he is a talented actor. This movie has a lot of hype and for once I think it added up.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio once again proves why he deserves a million Oscars and why he is my favorite actor. He puts all the effort he can muster into this role. He was so good he made a three hour long movie feel like it went by like a breeze. I did not get tired of this movie, I could have watched for a few more hours. I wanted to watch for a few more hours. I forgot I was sitting in a movie theater. That is how into this movie I was. It was funny too. I did not expect this movie to be as funny and as raunchy as it was. It was amazing but I'm surprised it got away with as much as it did.<br/><br/>I knew DiCaprio had range but it takes a lot of talent to play this role. I couldn't think of a better man to play this role than DiCaprio. I think it was meant for him and I think this is finally the time he gets recognized by The Academy. The character himself was very complex and had a wide range. Jordan could make you laugh, cry, sympathize with him or somebody else, make you want to hit him in the face, or even motivate you to do something better. His character starts out as a normal guy starting out and he has respect for the job and the people in it, in a matter of scenes we see his transformation into the snarky businessman he is. He turns into a jerk but you still root for him and want him to succeed. <br/><br/>This movie does have a flaw and I think that is the beginning. The movie starts with Jordan already being a huge success and then going back to his beginning. The only thing that saved the entire segment was Matthew McConaughey. He was hysterical and the fist bumps to the chest was brilliant. He teaches Jordan everything but then it ends and then he starts his own company. I don't really think it was necessary. It did introduce the minor characters and have the great diner scene but it took away from the character Jordan. He is shown as this big shot at first and then he is normal. It was weird to see and I personally felt it hurt the movie just a little bit. <br/><br/>The whole cast worked their asses off, especially DiCaprio and Hill. Jonah Hill is a fantastic actor, and he is fat again. I love fat Jonah Hill. Thin Jonah Hill could not have pulled this off. Every scene he was in was great. He is one of those actors that can be funny in one scene, like his first scene in the diner. He can be serious, like the scenes in Switzerland. He can also be both, like the scene when he and Jordan take way too much drugs. That scene was the best acting I have seen on a long time. Both Jordan and Jonah Hill's character have a pill addiction and they take too much of a stronger version and they were higher than anyone I have ever seen. The crawling around and attacking on the phone was supposed to be a serious moment but it was so funny. The seriousness of the situation was there but it was still funny. <br/><br/>I almost wish I worked in that office. These guys looked like they had a blast at work. If Jordan was my boss I would buy and believe everything he said. When he was at the microphone giving his motivational speeches I felt like I could be a stock broker. I honestly thought about stopping WillyT Reviews forever and going to Wall Street, well not really but it was that believable. <br/><br/>Overall, Wolf of Wall Street was a damn good movie. I don't think it was an instant classic but it will do good come Oscar Season. I think DiCaprio gets the win for best actor. The movie itself gets at least a nomination for best picture. Scorsese gets the nod for best director and Jonah Hill for best supporting role. I don't think they will win but what do I know? In a few years this movie will probably be forgotten or overshadowed by another great movie but for now it is a gem and a masterpiece. This wasn't just a good movie for the comedy or the sex or the drugs. All of those things mixed in well to a good story with fantastic characters. Add the direction of Martin Scorsese and you get The WillyT Seal of Approval."

"jtindahouse","10","1","7","3 January 2014"," The best film I have seen in a long time!
","When I initially saw 'The Wolf of Wall Street' was to be three hours long, I was disappointed. I had looked forward to it for a little while, but usually struggle with films pushing over the two and half hour mark. Finally tonight I worked up the courage to go in there and endure the three hours. Little did I know it wouldn't be an issue in the slightest. In fact the next three hours would be some of the quickest of my life.<br/><br/>What a movie! The direction, the writing, the acting - all beyond belief good. Scorsese has outdone himself, DiCaprio has outdone himself, in fact the whole cast outdid themselves. Jonah Hill, in far and away his best performance yet (miles better than 'Moneyball'), was Oscar-worthy good. He and DiCaprio battled for scene dominance time, after time, after time and the winner was the audience. Matthew McConaughey was also brilliant in his brief cameo. His appearance is so early in the film that some could be forgiven for forgetting he even appeared by the end (three hours is still a long time no matter how fast it goes by).<br/><br/>The movie is hilarious from start to finish. It tells the story of Jordan Belfort and his rise to fame and fortune through stockbroking. I hear it's creating a little controversy (especially in the United States), and it has to be admitted it does push boundaries. The levels of drug use throughout the film are quite amazing at times and the amount of sex and nudity are admittedly high. But that's why this works so well. It seems Scorsese had almost complete freedom to tell the story the way he wanted, something I wish so many more directors had the opportunity to do.<br/><br/>It takes brilliant pacing from a director and editor to make a film go by so quickly, and I can't remember a case of it being done this well since 'The Dark Knight' in 2008. Let's hope DiCaprio and Scorsese collaborate many more times in the future because when they do it's pure gold."

","Here, I thought the world would never see another gangster movie like Goodfellas, but I was wrong. Terence Winter and Martin Scorsese come together to give us a Wall Street gangster who is aware of the viewer in his narration, similar to to our old friend, Henry Hill.<br/><br/>The 3 hour movie is a gratuitous romp of cash, drugs, sex and late 80s rock and roll. The viewer gets to jump into Jordan's shoes and root for him while questioning our loyalty to him when meeting the FBI, his wives, children, associates and clients. <br/><br/>The film is criticized for glamorizing the drugged out womanizing thieving lifestyle of Balfort, but tgis criticism neglects to notice the plot roller coaster which **mild spoiler** ultimately wraps up in the same way Henry Hill's does.<br/><br/>Sure, a 75 year old academy member and a screenwriter yelled ""shame on you!"" to Marty and Leo at the premiere, but at the screening of Casino, people yelled ""Crap!"" and ""pornography!

","I have used IMDb for the last few years for all my movie insight regarding reviews, ratings, upcoming movies, or just to prove my friends wrong about an actor in a movie. I have never written a review for a movie but this film compelled me to do finally do so. First off, let me start off by saying that Leonardo Dicaprio is mine top 3 actors of my generation(Im 27) and have always been a fan of his versatility. It has always boggled my mind how he has never won an Oscar. With so many brilliant performances that I could spend all day talking about. <br/><br/>But moving on to this film. Wow, this is his defining moment for Leo. Having read the book and being very intrigued on the life of Jordan Belfort, Leo nailed him. From the beginning stages of him as a young 22 year old, eager to learn stockbroker, to an out of control drug addict leo was nothing short of phenomenal. Sometimes i wanted to jump through the screen and join them because of how much fun they were having. It was a great insight into the rise and fall of a prominent figure on wall street in the late 80's/early 90's. <br/><br/>Also the supporting cast was excellent. Although only in the movie for 10 minutes, Matthew McConaughey was awesome as a veteran wall streeter with some interesting but absolutely hilarious voice. Jonah Hill, made me laugh every time he opened his mouth, definitely provided a majority of the comedy, which was a lot as this was the funniest film i have seen since wedding crashers. Margot, although a rather newcomer to the screen, was also very good. Hailing from Australia, i was extremely impressed of how well she executed that Jersey/New York accent. Spot on.<br/><br/>Overall for a movie with a running time of 3 hours, it went by as if it was only 2. A pure non stop adrenaline rush. Scorcese, at his age, has still got it. If leo doesn't win best actor, i would be amazed. I don't know what else you could have asked for in a performance. Great all around film and would encourage anyone to see it, 18 and up of course. <br/><br/>Rating 5/5"
"cantlon-jack","Null","1","7","26 December 2013"," Sex, drugs, and... penny stocks
","It's safe to say this wasn't what I expected it to be. I did not go into this movie expecting it to be as comedic as it was, so I was a little thrown off when (without giving away any details) it drew laughs during some of the most dramatic sequences. I also was not anticipating it to be quite so obscene (it does not go 20 minutes without showing breasts nor 30 seconds without saying ""fuck."") <br/><br/>What I was expecting was more of a typical, up and down drama in which Dicaprio bends but does not break under pressure as he methodically conquers his enemies. Sure, some of that is there, but this is not a movie about up and down action. Almost all of the three hours focus on the ""up,"" and rightfully so. It seems that the idea was to take the audience on a fun-filled ride like the one the main character is experiencing- with very few thoughts of consequences and plenty of debauchery. The Wolf of Wall Street is over the top and apologetically so, and the mood and pacing fit the message that it ultimately conveys."

"vicky-bahl","9","1","8","12 January 2014"," 3 hours well spent for a true Scorsese fan - a visual and vocal treat!
","Let me start by saying that this movie is great - but you need to be a fan of Mr. Scorsese's cinema to enjoy something like this for 3 hours. The difference between a Scorsese movie and just another good movie is that Scorsese won't stop short of depicting the real truth (no matter how visual or vocal it might be) on the big screen. <br/><br/>This is in-your-face cinema for people who love to be very close to ""what really happened"". I believe that Mr. Leonardo DiCaprio was a great choice to play Jordan Belfort, a common man who is hungry for success and money is the drug that functions best for his system. Mr. Scorsese's gets the best out of DiCaprio and he excels in his role, all the way from amazing scenes where he is giving a speech to make his firms employees feel motivated, to the scenes where too many drugs are in his system while he needs to get behind the wheel. It looks so real that I felt that he needs to actually have drugs in his system to act that way.<br/><br/>Apart from DiCaprio, Margot Robbie looks stunning as she plays the role of Belfort's wife. <br/><br/>Don't think twice before going to this one is you are a fan of Mr. Scorsese's cinema such as Goodfellas. Avoid it if you don;t want to hear the F word like a million times and watch sexually explicit content - but in short - that's what makes it real. <br/><br/>9/10 without a doubt!"
"estebangonzalez10","9","1","8","11 January 2014"," Overblown and excessive, but hilarious
","""My name is Jordan Belfort. The year I turned 26, I made 49 million dollars, which really pi$sed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.""<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is an overblown energetic and hilarious film about these egocentric, greedy, immoral stockbrokers that we are supposed to hate, but ultimately end up rooting for because we have spent so much time laughing with them. These guys make Gordon Gekko from Wall Street look like a saint. Martin Scorsese is a genius; he can basically direct any movie he wants to and make it appealing. This is his follow up to Hugo (which was a brilliant family film) and he takes a 180 degree turn here with The Wolf of Wall Street and makes a comedy about these egocentric rich characters who have no moral boundaries, who spend their time getting high, objectifying women, and which should have been rated NC-17 because their excesses are constantly repeated over and over again on screen. If there is one word I'd have to use to describe this film it'd be energetic. The film is so energetic and you get it through each one of the brilliant performances in the movie. This is a filthy dark comedy, but one that will stick with you and have you question yourself for having rooted for these characters. I understand the comparisons with Scorsese's Goodfellas in that the characters wrongful behavior is what we become attracted to and makes the film so edgy. I'm not supposed to root for these guys, they are the villains, they do terrible things, we are all their victims, but then why do we want them to get away with what they're doing? These are all questions that only begin to come up long after the credits have rolled and eventually you realize that these guys deserved far worse punishment and got away too easy (but wait that is what really happened with all these Wall Street stockbrokers that almost ruined the country), and that is why Scorsese is such a brilliant director because he is so subtle in getting his message across and does so in such an energetic and funny way.<br/><br/>At age 22, Jordan (Leonardo DiCaprio) received early training from his boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) and eventually gets a stockbroker license, but the company melts down on his first day and he's left in the streets again. His wife, Teresa (Cristin Milioti), recommends him a job at Investor Center, which happens to be a very unprofessional small establishment that only deals with penny stocks, but has incredibly high commissions. Jordan is a natural and pitches sales so well that he rises to the top easily again. One day a neighbor named Donnie (Jonah Hill) comes up to him and asks him how he makes so much money, which leads him to decide to get into stocks and work for him. The two find a garage and set up their own business bringing along some of their friends: Robbie (Brian Sacca), Alden (Henry Zebrowski), Chester (Kenneth Choi), Nicky (PJ Byrne), Toby (Ethan Suplee), and Brad (Jon Bernthal). Jordan teaches them how to pith the sales and over the years the company grows at a very high rate and even gets marketing from Forbes Magazine where Jordan is nicknamed as the Wolf of Wall Street. These guys don't care about their clients and will tell them anything just to make a sale, and do a bunch of illegal things along the way which eventually gets them into trouble with the law, specifically FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who begins to follow their every move. Along the way in the midst of all the parties, sex, and drugs, Jordan falls for the beautiful Naomi (Margot Robbie) and eventually divorces his wife and marries her. The film continues to follow Jordan's excesses as he becomes more and more addicted to drugs, the most powerful of all being money.<br/><br/>Scorsese makes several great statements in this film about the world of Wall Street, similar to what he did with the gangster world in Goodfellas. He doesn't shy away from their egocentric world portraying numerous scenes where the characters are getting high, having sex, and getting rich at expense of the rest of the world. He also makes it clear that money is the most dangerous and addictive drug of all, and these men don't know where to draw the line. There are several scenes that truly stood out for me like the scene where Mark teaches Jordan what the business is really about, or when Jordan and Donnie meet for the first time, or when Jordan meets with Agent Dunham in his yacht. In the midst of all the crazy debauchery, these small conversation scenes work so well giving the characters more depth. There are also hilarious scenes like the one where Jordan and Donnie suffer from a delayed drug side effect, mixed with some very dark scenes as well like when Jordan has a huge fight with Naomi portraying him at his lowest point. The performances in this film are also incredible, Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best and funniest performance to date, the scenes where he gives his employees pep talks are mesmerizing, Jonah Hill is also at his best and has some extremely funny and insane scenes, they both truly deserve Oscar nominations for their work here. Matthew McConaughey is no longer a surprise, he has been exceptional in his latest films, but he has a very small role here, Margot Robbie gives an outstanding performance in a world where females are completely objectified, Rob Reiner is funny as Jordan's father, and finally Kyle Chandler also stood out for me as the only character who seemed to be morally incorruptible. They all bring so much energy to this film making the three hours go by fast despite being overblown and repetitive."
"varun-mentor","9","1","8","6 January 2014"," Roller-coaster ride through the secondary wall street!
","Martin Scorsese's craft is unmatched and he has done it time and again reinventing the protagonists in their career best powerful performances. Obviously, when you have Jack Nicholson as The Departed lead, then the comparisons are pale, but when he picks Leo or Ray Liottas of the world, rest ensured, he is going to secrete the maximum outta lead roles. Going into theater, I had good background information being through with Wall St brokering and trading rooms myself as well Boiler Rooms functioning. I had a decent idea about Belfort's history too and his past and present situations. However, if I just consider this movie from the fictional point of view, I must say its quiet believable but when I correlate the movie in a toned down real events version, I would say, the situations depicted are massively outrageous. And all of this anchored on the towering performance by Leo.<br/><br/>Movie starts with Belfort's firm's teaser and is intelligently interwoven with past and present instances. Standing at shy of 3 hours duration, the movie only gets better and better as the time progresses and it is hard to take your eyes off the screen. Best parts of the movie for me were when Belfort addresses this staff on his firm's floor on multiple instances. Screenwriter for this movie researched on Belfort, and put him in a room full of Scorsese's crew to assess the hold of the people Belfort has, that is exactly what has transcended in the performance delivered by Leo during these scenes and its, to say the least, gripping.<br/><br/>I am amazed by the performance delivered by Jonah too. He has come a long way from being a rookie performer to a neck to neck performance with lords of the craft. Maybe it is Scorsese effect. Or may be he is getting better too. However, despite the controversies movie is going through, it is a must watch just for the sake of the career best performance by Leo. Rest of the story kinda ultra exaggerates the spiraling out lifestyle portrayed by quick money makers on Wall St. If you really are looking to learn the nuances and inside story of Wall St from 'this' movie, you might be in a wrong theater. ]\"

","Sex, drugs, money. This film contains lots and lots of all three of those things. Some may say that the amount of it is gratuitous and unnecessary, but I think that's the point. These Wall Street guys had these things in excess, so why shy away from that? Scorsese directs this similarly to Goodfellas or Casino, but in a way that seems more fast paced and wild. It almost seems surprising that a an older director such as Scorsese could direct a film that seems so fast and full of youth, but he does it. The film is three hours long, but I enjoyed every minute of it. It's hilarious, shocking, entertaining, dramatic and overall, amazing. Don't miss this film."
"Nothinggrandproductions","9","1","8","4 January 2014"," An extremely well-done dark comedy and satire
","Cocaine. Money. Hookers. Corruption. Just a few aspects of Wolf of Wall Street, Martin Scorsese's follow-up to Hugothat's a weird transition. Right off the bat, this movie knew what it wanted to be. A black comedy that immediately begins with Scorsese's traditional narration that perfectly fits the piece and then for a surprising change4th wall breaking which I didn't see coming but ended up enjoying. It follows the real life story of Jordan Belfort, (Leonardo DiCaprio) a stockbroker who made it big really quick. It is 1987 and he seems like a normal guy, he's married, doesn't do drugs, isn't rich but is trying to make his way up. A seemingly normal guy although we know he isn't from the start since it opens with a scene of his later life.<br/><br/>His boss, Mark Hanna is played masterfully by Matthew McConaughey in a small role who is absolutely hilarious and he recommends a lifestyle of drugs and sex. Unfortunately, the firm Jordan works at fails after Black Monday, he is out of luck and works at a small firm instead and that is where it all begins. Tricking people into buying cheap stocks thinking they'll make it bigand that is where the movie explodes into absolute insanity and hilarity. Giant parties filled with an obscene amount of drugs and hookers. And just scene after scene of comical material. Jonah Hill plays Donnie Azoff who is essentially Jordan's biggest partner after they meet one day and is one of the biggest pieces of comical relief in the film.<br/><br/>The movie has the typically great camera work that is in every Scorsese film, nothing that'll blow you away like some of the long takes in GoodFellas or the beautiful cinematography in Taxi Driver but still good nonetheless. I think the strangest thing to come from this movie and the critics of it is that the movie is supposedly condoning a crazy lifestyle portrayed in the movie with all it's drugs, sex, etc, I find that completely ridiculous. There are points in the movie where Jordan is a pathetic mess and the entire time while watching it, I was just waiting from him to become pathetic. So, I don't see it at all condoning the crazy lifestyle because it isn't and is rather satirical. The main purpose of this film is to give us a look into this man's absolutely insane life and it does a fantastic job while being extremely entertaining and fun. Overall, I think this Scorsese's funniest film, I found myself laughing through nearly all of it and just having a general good time, additionally, I loved the ending a lot because it was a nice callback to something previously in the film and gives you something to think about. Oh, and can we give DiCaprio his Oscar yet or?"

"mattdunsmore","9","1","9","18 January 2014"," A Howling Success!
","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" may be one of the most refreshing films in years. Recently Hollywood has been shipping out many unoriginal films that do not have much flare or ambition to them and Comic book/super hero movies have been thrown at us that are entertaining but fall flat in creativity. However Martin Scorsese shows us in this film that films can still be captivating, engrossing and have very rich and clever dialogue that by the time you have left the cinema the motivational speeches of Jordan Belfort are imprinted in your mind. <br/><br/>To help bring the script to life we get an amazing performance from Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort who really delivers his lines with such enthusiasm that you believe every word of his speeches are the truth. DiCaprio really gives an Oscar worthy performance. The supporting cast also do a fantastic job. <br/><br/>The film follows Jordan Belfort who goes to Wall Street to be a stock broker and quench his thirst for money. He then starts his own firm and uses illegal methods to gain millions of dollars. He uses these millions to create his decadent and lavish lifestyle with havoc and laughter ensuing. However the same greed that made him rise to be a multi-millionaire will be his downfall.<br/><br/>As I said the film follows this pattern of Belforts rise and fall which is also the same in previous Scorsese films such as ""Goodfellas"". To anyone who has seen ""Goodfellas"" they may feel that the Wolf of Wall Street is the exact same movie and on paper and so you will probably be able to guess how the film ends before even stepping into the cinema. However do not go into this film expecting a plot twist halfway through or something that redefines the way films are made. The film should be loved for the the engrossing and hilarious journey through greed and corruption that it takes you on as it really is a thrill ride without any explosions or tense moments and it should be praised for managing such a feat! The equivalent of gun fights and car chases in an action movie are sheer dialogue and wit in this film.<br/><br/>Although I personally felt that the film may have been a bit too long, I felt that three hours is a bit too much for this movie to handle. We are shown two hours and thirty minutes of non stop outrageousness which at a point becomes a bit overwhelming and some scenes feel like they are just there to emphasise how insane these peoples life styles were and could easily be shortened down because you understand this message about two hours into the film. Despite this the film does save itself at the last thirty minutes. <br/><br/>Overall ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" is Martin Scorseses greatest film in years with all round great performances. This film has been a seven year project and you can tell that a lot of time, dedication and effort has went into making this film as good as it possibly can be, it does stumble at parts but it truly is a howling success that makes you want to beat your chest while humming."
"nooneishome747","10","1","9","18 January 2014"," A great movie. Nothing more, nothing less.
","As a Martin Scorsese fan, this is a film that I was genuinely excited for and it did not disappoint. An amazing film that is among my favorites of 2013. Leonardo DiCaprio gave a performance that is not only the best of his career thus far, but one of the best displays of acting I have seen in the entire Scorsese catalog. I am convinced that if DiCaprio does not win the Best Actor Oscar for this performance, he never will. Jonah Hill (an actor who I admit to not seeing any of his other roles) as Donnie impressed me. His role is one that is just as manic, depraved, and zany. It is easily the most insane Best Supporting Actor nominee since Heath Ledger's Joker. Both actors sucker you into this life of depravity through their charm and smooth tongues.<br/><br/>As a satire with incredibly black humor, there was hardly a moment in the film where I was not laughing. In fact, I cannot remember the last film where I laughed anywhere near this hard on the first viewing. A particular sequence late in the movie (which I won't spoil any details) involving Quaalude's will most likely go down as one of the funniest sequences in any film. It is a testament to just how entertaining this film is (as well as skillfully edited) when you consider that although it runs a minute shy of 3 hours, the film seems more like a 2 hour/2 and a half hour film.<br/><br/>The criticisms of the film glorifying Jordan Belfort is, to me, total hogwash. Just because the film does not demonize him in black-and-white terms does not mean it is a glorification. In fact, I would go on a limb and say that DiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is the biggest jerk in a Martin Scorsese film since Jake LaMotta from Raging Bull. As for the film not showing the victims of Belfort's schemes, the film is based off of a memoir that is told from Belfort's perspective. With Belfort being a greedy, selfish pig, it is doubtful that he would even give any thought to the people whose lives he ruined and the movie shows that. By leaving out the victims side of the story, you show that it isn't because they don't matter (their lives were ruined), but rather that the film's antagonist couldn't care less about them.<br/><br/>With the film being crammed with explicit sex scenes, rampant drug use (there are only two scenes in the 3 hour movie where the main characters are sober), 500+ f-bombs (and at least 2 uses of the c-word), and orgies (both homo and hetero), I am VERY surprised that this did not receive an NC-17 rating. In fact, if it were not for DiCaprio's presence, I am inclined to believe it would have been NC-17. This is CLEARLY for a mature audience."

Just because the movie has a lot of sex and drugs doesn't mean that is a horrible film, the sex and drugs has to appears because that's how the story happened, remember that is a true story.

"sesht","Null","1","9","4 January 2014"," Back to what Marty does best
","Perhaps a review will be better-timed if I get to watch the actual theatrical version that played in normal geographies. Forgive me if I my opinion loses whatever's been lost in translation. This is pure Scorsese-schlock, even vintage Scorsese (not when he veers off-track, in a good way, expanding his range, like he did with 'Hugo', and to a lesser extent, with 'The departed'). Cases in point - Casino, Goodfellas, The Aviator. The first thing I think of when I'm asked to sum up my impressions of this one in a word? EXCESS. Main character engaged in excess? Check. Lots of swearing? Check (not that he tosses them in gratuitously - everything has a purpose). Bimbo wives with brains that can get nasty? Check. Hard-to-look-at+hard-to-look-away-from bursts of sudden, misogynistic violence? Check. Scorsese does what he does best, as does Dicaprio (his pay phone sequence - one of the best to be committed on celluloid, though knowing how snippy the censors were, I'd be hard-pressed to know if I saw it in its entirety), and this could well be the spiritual sequel to 'The Aviator'. Dicaprio's fantastic (I don't really know how well this performance compares with Ejiofor's), but this is Not really stretching the range he's displayed in 'The Aviator', 'Inception', 'The departed' or 'Shutter Island' (I hear range's something Will Forte has exhibited in 'Nebraska'). My recommendation - Watch it, preferably on the big screen, certainly in a normal market/country. If you don't have that option, ............................... there's really no point watching it."

","Wall Street happens to be one of the financial districts in New York. It houses one of the largest stock exchanges called the New York Stock exchange along with other financial headquarters. You love the environment in there; it is pretty assumed that you go on a money minting spree. Martin Scorsese's 'The Wolf of the Wall Street' simply puts the emphasis on the Wall Street atmosphere, portraying the real life character of Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio); who was convicted of fraudulent crimes for exploiting the stock market.<br/><br/>Craftily scripted by Terence Winter, based on the book called 'Jordan Belfort', Scorsese evinces the character of Jordan Belfort as an orgy youngster having an unstinted appetite for money (earned legally or illegally doesn't matter) and heavily addicted to cocaine, alcohol and sex. On losing his job owing to stock market crash in 1987, Belfort trains a group of good-for-nothing folks to sell some of the useless commodities to some rich high-profile traders. Establishing a new firm called 'Stratton Oakmont', Jordan Belfort creates a befitting milieu to flourish what it is right to be termed as a 'moneymaking business'. <br/><br/>Going along too well with the wind of incoming wealth, Belfort divorces his wife Teresa only to marry Naomi; the only girl who can satisfy Belfort's ever growing lust. Scorsese does focus on sizzling intimate moments between the couple. A life rife with drugs, booze, magnificent bungalows, sleek sport cars and libidinous prostitutes slowly comes to a halt when the FBI steps in with their investigation. As showcased in most of the Scorsese films, the entire hurly burly in the major part of the movie is interrupted with planning & effort by the police.<br/><br/>Unlike films like 'Taxi driver', 'Casino' & 'Goodfellas', 'The Wolf of the Wall Street' is devoid of the ultimate theme of redemption. In spite of that, the film lends us rolling-on-the floor-laughing moments coupled with sheer display of acting to the point of caricature by Leonardo DiCaprio. The formula of opulence coupled with laughter & poignancy has worked quite well on the celluloid. Matthew McConaughey has a remarkable role as Mark Hanna; the guy who titillates the spark of minting fast money which has ignited in Belfort's mind.<br/><br/>Even though having sizeable movie length, it never seems to dull the audience and keeps them in an uplifted mood throughout. The Wolf of the Wall Street is smart, adept and uproarious. A shrewd script blended with high brilliance; Martin Scorsese makes it laudable and discernible among others."
"janeblevins","9","1","9","30 December 2013"," One Hell of a Movie
","This is a highly entertaining movie even if the partying occasionally drags down the action (no matter how wild, a party is a party right?). But Leonardo DiCaprio is riveting as a fast talking, talented, loud mouthed stock broker wannabe who rises (and parties) hard and fast. But what makes the movie sing is that EVERYBODY in it delivers. Scorcese brings together great cinematic talent. He's obviously untethered by big production houses (he is driving the script and you feel that) and the result is one of the most riotous, fast paced and entertaining comédies noires to come along in ages.<br/><br/>But some viewers may find the movie is too long, Scorcese's longest ever, clocking in at exactly 3 hours, I didn't feel the length because the acting is really first rate and the characters do develop even if they don't exactly learn from their mistakes.<br/><br/>The other criticism is that it's shallow, like a big party. I can see where that's coming from but my impression watching was not so much shallow as comedy noire. Scorcese does make you feel like you're in the party (there's a few slo mo scenes that just pull you in) But the story is genuinely hilarious and tragic at turns even if the person telling it is a shallow creep with monstruously shallow, selfish, party loving friends <br/><br/>And I personally really appreciated Scorcese's feather light moral touch. In the end, the spectator has to decide what to think of the anti-hero his band of vapid merry swindlers, or maybe not. You can also just enjoy the ride."
"nick_williams470","10","1","10","10 January 2014"," A Great film which holds the audience on tenterhooks
","I had been eagerly awaiting this film as soon as I saw the trailer, which I believe i watched numerous times. A film which promised another collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, without the restrictions of a major production company being involved was surely a great film in the making, and it did not disappoint.<br/><br/>Scorsese has directed this film directly, and has spared no expense in showing the extravagance which surrounded Jordan Belfort throughout the period of his life which the film depicts. The way in which Scorsese has changed Belfort's memoir's into a screenplay is brilliant, and surely must be in contention for best screenplay throughout the awards season. <br/><br/>The cast, in particular DiCaprio, were absolutely fantastic. I had my doubts about Jonah Hill being in this film but he was also brilliant in his portrayal of Donnie Azzof, his comedic timing was brilliant, and some of the one liners which he produced, many of them were improvised, were utterly hilarious. The way in which Hill and DiCaprio act together is very impressive, they have clearly gelled together well. My only criticism in terms of casting is that Matthew McConaughey's character is not in the film more, he played the role brilliantly and Mark Hanna was a great character to watch but he is only in the first 30 minutes of the film which was disappointing. <br/><br/>Although the film is very 'full on' in terms of sexual content and drug use, I believe that it was a huge gamble for Scorsese to make this film so full of this content, I believe that it paid off as I left the theater thinking about all of the things that Jordan Belfort did, personally I wonder how he is still alive. <br/><br/>All in all, I absolutely love this film, It was well worth the wait and I believe it should do very well during the awards season. It is well worth putting aside three hours of your life to watch this film, you will not be disappointed."

Along with DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, who plays as DiCaprio's trusty sidekick in this movie does an amazing job at surprising watchers that he actually does have true talent in the acting category. <br/><br/>With all that I have said in my short review, this is a must see.

Definitely not for everyone though due to the excess sex and drugs galore.

He is such an unlikeable but at the same time likable douche. Jonah Hill was Hilarious and i think this is his best performance to date. Like i said before the Sex and Drugs is overblown almost every second there is somebody either thrusting or moaning. The lead characters consistently take Qualuudes and are almost always stoned off their asses. In the office area their is so much going on naked marching bands, a chimpanzee and Jonah Hill swallowing a live goldfish.

"bschmidt1996","10","1","11","10 January 2014"," Scorsese's boldest and ballsiest film to date!
","Though it's structured identical to GoodFellas, The Wolf of Wall Street is the most original film I've seen in years! The screenplay is flawless, the performances are amazing, the direction is sharp and ambitious, the cinematography and editing are beautiful, the everything about this film is perfect!<br/><br/>The screenplay I thought was brilliant, but it was also very interesting. Terence Winter doesn't waste your time. Usually with these financial films I feel myself being bogged down with all of this mindless technical jargon, but Winter doesn't do that here. There actually sequences where Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) talks directly to the viewer, and he goes on a tangent, but stops himself and actually says ""Ya know what? You don't care about this."" A ballsy choice.<br/><br/>The performances were one of my favorite aspects of the film. Scorsese has a talent for pulling brilliant performances out of DiCaprio, but this was unlike anything I've ever seen. He was crazy and disgusting and rude, but he was also sharp and witty and very original. The other two major standouts for me were Jonah Hill, who really caught me by surprise here, and Matthew McConaughey, even though he's only on screen for about fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>There are so many scenes in this film that I could talk about, but I won't because I'm not sure I know what to say to do them justice. I will say though, during the overdose sequence, I couldn't help but feel that I was watching cinematic history being born. That's going to be that one extraordinary scene that people remember and talk about for years and years to come.<br/><br/>I haven't even scratched the surface with this film, but I don't know that I know how. Martin Scorsese is my favorite filmmaker of all time, and he certainly out did himself here. Many great films came out in 2013, but this is the only one that I can say with the utmost confidence is a masterpiece! The most bold film achievement that the studios have released in my lifetime!"
"meeza","10","1","14","6 January 2014"," Crash into this one now!!!! Rich with entertainment!
","Howl can you not like this Wolf!!! Anyways, many critics are enamored with Martin Scorsese's stockbroker saga ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" while many others have called it a despicable, slimy ruthless flick. I am with the former. Undoubtedly, this is the most entertaining movie of 2013, even with its outlandishness and all. The narrative is based on the real life exploits of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who rose to riches in the stock trade but not without a few corruption trips to the market, if you get my thrift. Belfort was also an avid drug addict, with his preferred drug of choice being the quaalude; yep, Jordan was definitely a boy in the lude. Oh! Jordan was also profoundly hooked on hookers; so he got plenty of action ""under the Belfort"". Leonardo DiCaprio's magnetic performance as Belfort is Oscar-worthy and it's a shame Leo's stock has not risen enough to be a frontrunner for the Best Actor Oscar chase this year. DiCaprio knocks it out of the ballpark! Jonah Hill was outstanding also as Belfort's right hand man of corruption Donnie Azoff. Hill should also be in the moneyball I mean money for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Other stock worthy supporting performances rose from Kyle Chandler as an FBI Agent chasing Belfort's wrongdoings, Rob Reiner as Belfort's sympathetic father, and Matthew McConaughey with yet another scene-stealing performance as a Belfort mentor. Margot Robbie was not extravagant as Belfort's second wife Naomi, but Robbie did not rob me of any eye candy viewing. Terence Winter's screenplay was sure a wonderland of outrageous entertainment. And what can you say about the legendary Scorsese. He has delivered again in vintage Marty form. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" reminded me of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"" with a stockbroker corruption landscape. So thump your chest and get psyched up to 180 minutes of pure, zany entertainment with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". ***** Excellent"
"antesdespues","8","1","15","18 December 2013"," A sex-and-drug-fueled comedy with some stellar moments
","Martin Scorsese's newest biopic 'The Wolf of Wall Street' details the career of Wall Street broker Jordan Belfort in the late 1980s and 1990s, as well as his lurid sex life and prominent drug use. This film was not what I was expecting - it is actually funny, and focuses more on the comedy genre rather than crime or drama like Scorsese's previous endeavours 'Goodfellas', 'Taxi Driver' or 'The Departed'. Leonardo DiCaprio is in fine form, carrying the film as the corrupt and womanising (but still likable) 'wolf'. <br/><br/>Using the breaking of the fourth wall and narration techniques, 'Wolf of Wall St' is a gross- out comedy that breaks the barriers of sex and drug use in film (multiple orgies and scenes with a hell of a lot of cocaine - mostly together - make for a very R rated viewing). Sex in 'Wolf' is what drugs and violence are in 'Goodfellas'. <br/><br/>The film seems to focus more on Belfort's personal life rather than the bulk of it being about his professional one, with excellent supporting roles from Margot Robie as a gold- digging 'duchess' (who really does stand out in a stellar performance) and Matthew McConaughey in his fleeting role as Belfort's mentor. Audiences will not get what they are expecting from DiCaprio's performance, although he is brilliant he is more there to induce laughter rather than heartbreak or drama. <br/><br/>'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a devilishly fun watch, with laugh-out-loud moments and a great script that lets you suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ridiculous moments of the film (keeping in mind it is a true story!). Scorsese masterfully goes back to his roots and directs this tale of corruption and greed; a hilarious way to end off this year's film season. 8/10"
"cinephile-27690","2","0","1","14 May 2020"," It Appalls Me That This Movie Is Praised So Highly.
","I have written this review for The Wolf of Wall Street many times and I fail to show how much I loathe this movie. No matter what, no words would or COULD satisfy my animosity for it. But as I am trying to improve my review writing, I am trying again to critique this movie.<br/><br/>Now before I rant on it, let me take a deep breath and talk about the positives. Wolf's plot is very interesting, and that's why this is a 2 and not a 1. The story follows Jordan Belfort, a real life Wall Street stockbroker, and his rise and fall in power and wealth from scamming others. This within itself is pretty interesting and it kept me going for it's 3 hour run time.<br/><br/>The acting can be good too, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a decent performance as Jordan, and Margot Robbie as his second wife Naomi is good as well, not to mention very attractive to look at. The cinematography is also very good, and as a result it's a very polished and nice looking movie, camera wise.<br/><br/>That's where my praise ends, so get ready. The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the most disgusting movies I have ever seen, and one of the worst as well. The movie is filled with so much profanity, sex, and drugs that it appalls me that it's only Rated R, and not NC-17 or X.<br/><br/>First, let's address the language. Excluding documentaries, this has the most F-bombs in any movie, clocking in at 569 uses of the F word. That's roughly one F bomb every 20 seconds, and that ignores all the other curse words in the movie. So there is barely a script without the coarse language.<br/><br/>If your script is dependent on words you would discourage someone from using outside of a movie, then you have no script. Now, I don't care if a movie HAS swearing, I'm not a prude, but this much is not necessary. I know this is not a Disney movie, but still, that's ridiculous.<br/><br/>In fact, I do enjoy The Departed and Good Fellas, both profane movies from Martin Scorsese, who directed this as well. But those 2 movies COMBINED have just a few F bombs less than this, and that's uncalled for.<br/><br/>I mentioned that there is drug use. The characters snort lots of cocaine and take pills and stuff like that. This bothers me the least, but I am not going to condemn profanity and sex and condone snorting coke.<br/><br/>Anyways, that leads me to said sex. This nearly bothers me as much as the language. This movie contains multiple orgies, one in slow motion, and one with all guys(which I luckily can't recall well). Also, women are unfortunately more naked then men are in these scenes.<br/><br/>Jordan has a friend named Donnie, who's played by Jonah Hill. He's such a pervert, and therefore very unlikable. In one scene, he masturbates in public at a party as a result of drunkenness. He is stopped, but that's still pretty gross. Oh, and his on-screen penis was fake, so women have to show their bare breasts but men don't have to show THEIR privates? That's not right.<br/><br/>In one scene, Donnie sees a woman with money taped on her(something I won't dig into, since it's off topic), and he says he can tell her what to do because she has his money on her boobs. I couldn't believe that such a sexist statement was made.<br/><br/>We also learn that Donnie married his cousin just because she was hot. That is pretty nasty. He also jokes that if he had a ""retarded"" child he would set them out into the wild. Then he says he would actually put them in a home instead of raising them. I had a challenged sister, and I have autism spectrum myself, so I did not appreciate that. Sure, bang your cousin but don't raise the result of that! That's an awful plan to have.<br/><br/>Jordan also cheats on his wife, and he beats his second wife for wanting a divorce.(Because THAT will make her change her mind!)<br/><br/>I could name many other sexually immoral things that this movie contains, but you get the idea. I will name one more thing though-3 minutes into the movie, after some off screen oral sex, Jordan blows cocaine off of a woman's BEHIND to arouse her! I am NOT kidding about this, but I wish I were!<br/><br/>That leads me to another point-my Grandma that I live with saw this and explained that to me. She saw half of the movie with me, and she may have hated it more than I do.<br/><br/>Because I hate this movie for it's perverted nature, I was teased by others for it a few times. This has made me hate it more. In fact, I have been told that such cursing and nudity is what made it ""awesome"" for them. I am especially amazed when women tell me that they liked this, because in this movie, women are not people, they are just objects to drool over and have sex with.<br/><br/>I have heard defenses of The Wolf of Wall Street that it's the point to show these disgusting acts to expose them. Do I need to see orgy after orgy to get that these people take part in orgies? Do you think I am so stupid that I need to hear hundreds of profanities for it to click in my mind that these people curse often?<br/><br/>There are some camera mistakes too in this that others have pointed out. When Jordan and Donnie meet for the first time, there is a shot when Jordan talks but there's no lip movement. Also, before Jordan beats his wife, we see him pant-less in one shot, but as soon as he needs to stand up, he magically has pants on. Gee, I wonder WHY? This is not something that a master like Scorsese should be guilty of.<br/><br/>I could go on and on and never satisfy my feelings against this movie, but I have improved. Please never see this movie, as it fails to show Jordan's fall negatively, and we rather are supposed to enjoy the ride. The tone and critical and audience praise contradict the supposed ""goal"" as well, as does the Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Please see Silence for a great modern Scorsese movie instead, and forget this one's existence. Sadly, this movie is stuck in my mind forever. By the end, I didn't know who was cheated more, the penny stock buyers, or myself."

I have a friend who worked on Wall Street for a decade during the 90's, and I met him when he was one of the managers at the supermarket I worked at. I asked him why he quit working on Wall Street, and he told me ""Because I got tired of seeing people kill themselves after losing their money"". Well, I didn't really believe him until now. My God, what happened here? I can't believe how cold, greedy, and self-destructive Wall Street brokers are! I was so offended that I shut it off after an hour, and had to continue it the next day. I'll admit it's not my idea of a good time. Still, I'm going to give it a passing mark, because it held my interest; I didn't dare delete it until I saw the end.

It highlights some of the extremes of excess told in a way that Jordan Belfort would tell his own story.<br/><br/>Wolf of Wall Street plays like a rollercoaster from one extreme to another. Its extremes keep its viewers attached to the screen not wanting to miss a single second. Chaos reigns supreme in this film.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio did an astonishing job portraying Belfort. He grunts, yells, and f*cks his way to what should have been an Oscar win. Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie also deliver award-worthy performances.<br/><br/>Many kudos to Martin Scorsese for what he did for the screenplay. This movie isn't like Martin Scorsese's bread and butter films, but he delivers and then some. His approach in this film is both refreshing, hilarious, and an absolute thrill.<br/><br/>The moral message underneath the film also shines upon the second visit. The film also (subtly) asks if it's ok to celebrate villainy and excess. Of course, the audience wants to cheer for the protagonist. But upon further thought, the viewers, like many of Belfort's victims have allowed him to pull another wool over our eyes. The image of excess covers the true financial crimes that Belfort committed.<br/><br/>5/5. Favorited. I wouldn't recommend to watch with family and kids, though."
"bbewnylorac","6","0","1","5 March 2020"," Not as good as it's hyped up to be
","I get it that the creators of this film are trying to portray disgraced stockbroker Jordan Belfort's unabated, untethered debauchery, but I felt there did need to be some balance.
Maybe a character with some moral compass?
Or what about a few scenes portraying the investors who Belfort ripped off?
Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine did this better by telling the wife's story, and her encounter with her sister's angry ex husband, who was financially ruined by a Belfort-like investment character.
I just fear that some viewers will watch Wolf of Wall Street and think that Belfort didn't do too badly from his practices, apart from a short stint in jail. He had a fun time and made a lot of money. They will laugh at his drug fuelled antics.
There was one speech Belfort makes to his workers where he says something like, ""this is America"" and that making a lot of money is why they are here. It's a strong message - asking the audience, are these really our values? But my guess is that the message would have gone over most viewers' heads.
I was also appalled at the depiction of women throughout the film. They're disembodied bodies. Sure, Belfort's strippers and hookers may very well have been like that.
But I just found it degrading, and always from the male point of view. And why was Margot Robbie so nude all the time when Leonardo Di Caprio was dressed or seen from behind?
And again, there was no balance - what about a scene in how the women involved felt?
I really hope most people who see this film see how appalling Belfort is, but I'm not convinced."

","A film that is based upon a true story should not feel contrived, but director Martin Scorsese has created a film that diverges so far from reality by its very construction that it feels indulgent. The main character, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), narrates ad nauseum throughout the film. Early on, we see a red sportscar. Belfort says he didn't actually drive a red car; his was white. This might be an attempt at playfulness, but it serves to undermine the veracity of the script. And the viewer is left wondering for what purpose.<br/><br/>Belfort is a worthless human being, devoid of decency. As such, he is one-dimensional. He seems to exist solely as an object of hate for the audience. His self-analysis consists of pronouncements designed to shock, like the rebellious declarations of a teenage hooligan. ""I love drugs,"" he says, as if his drug-fueled debauchery splashed over every frame of the film is not enough evidence.<br/><br/>It is said that Scorsese encourages his actors to go off-script, that he likes adlibbing. That seems to be the case here, and the result is an unconvincing parody.<br/><br/>One performance worth celebrating is Margot Robbie as Naomi, Belfort's wife. Once again she demonstrates she is one of the best actors of her generation. The over-the-top performances of other actors only serve to emphasize her solid depiction of a believable character.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film, but those who see Wall Street as a villainous, monolithic agent for evil might enjoy its cartoonish aspects."

","Never has there been a better celebration of the excesses of life than this gem! I can only find fault with the brief glimpses of nudity and sex scenes, which are well spread out and numerous, but always portrayed as a tease, and never long enough to be titillating. Margot Robbie was not allowed to be the sexy girl as she should have been. She played the trophy wife, but was very unappealing and unlikeable in the role. That aside, this is a buddy movie, where you call your friend up and say, ""you won't believe what they did in this thing!"" There are so many scenes that are just outrageous! This isn't meant to be strictly biographical, because it wouldn't have sold very well. The supporting actors and actresses are outstanding. This is a must-see!"

","The Wolf of Wall Street is 3 hours long, and it's 3 hours of pure comedy, great drama, and epic crime.<br/><br/>The film is about Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Dicaprio) takes a big job at a Wall Street firm. He has a lieutenant, Donnie (Jonah Hill) and later on meets the woman of his dreams, Naomi (Margot Robbie). As Jordan makes a fortune by extracting investors out of millions, him and his goons partake in sex and drugs, and the FBI soon close in on Jordan to give him a downfall of his career.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is a very great film and I would say it is the best film of 2013. It may contain loads of sex, nudity, drugs, and even holds the record for the most uses of the f word, but all of that does not hurt the film. The story is very good and like most of Scorsese's films, it's based off a true story. I never read the story this film was based on, but it had to of been pretty epic.<br/><br/>The acting is very great. This is also my favorite DiCaprio film without a doubt. He was awesome in films like The Departed and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but this is the film I feel is his signature role and plays a character that is both funny and cool. Jonah Hill is an actor that I think is okay, but he did a pretty solid job in this film, delivering some pretty good humor to the screen. Margot Robbie did a beautiful job as well. She has always been one of my favorite actresses, and she really has a great role here.<br/><br/>With great acting, well developed story, and another great direction from Martin Scorsese, The Wolf of Wall Street is a huge cinematic ride."

","The Wolf of Wall Street is a film of indulgence, packed full with copious amounts of booze, drugs, language and sex. As all of that may suggest, the enjoyment of this film relies heavily on the frame of mind you're in when you watch it, more than most. You've got to be ready for debauchery and scandal, for characters that are so charismatic that you forget they're awful people and you hate yourself for liking them.<br/><br/>If you're open to it, this is an incredible film, filled with exceptional performances , visuals, sound and just a general cornucopia of goodness.

"michaeltrivedi","8","0","1","2 October 2019"," One of the Best Films of All Time?
","The Wolf of Wall Street is filmed in a way that would appeal to a younger crowd. It's a new, modern way of making films. The scenes are shorter, things go faster. There's less emotion that way, and more ""go go go"" vibes. This movie is most similar for me to those vine videos.<br/><br/>That being said, it's also a great all around story. It depicts a man rising the ranks of Wall Street, only to purposefully get entangled into illegal activity. The character makes a killing through this, becomes recognized far and wide, and eventually meets his defeat.<br/><br/>Leo DiCaprio is great as the Wall Street banker. And this is also a great vehicle for Margot Robbie, who is exploding in the movie business now. Jonah Hill is memorable as well.<br/><br/>What makes this movie great is how it jumps from one place to another rather quickly. The parts are not necessarily needed to make the whole, but they are so humorous and fun to watch that the audience does not care. It adds a bit of glamour into the Wall Street business, which is essentially crunching numbers and taking phone calls.<br/><br/>I would definitely say this is one of the greatest movies of the 2000s so far, if not all time? I don't know, but it's a helluva ride.<br/><br/>8 stars"

This is a true story, of that you can be sure. A few viewers might find the rampant and reckless disregard of morality a bit off-putting, but I honestly think that this movie could have gone further... they didn't show any child prostitution and not any bestiality either, BOTH of which occur on a regular basis in the circles of the hyper-rich elite.

","Wolf of Wall Street was far longer than it should have been. Yes it's a Scorseses but this story did not warrant 2.59 minutes to establish itself. Jordan Belfort and company were obviously out of control, drug abusing, power and money mad characters did Scorseses have to keep reinforcing that with useless scenes? There were at least 2 instances where, fully aware of Jordan's personality, that needs to be reinforced? Did Jordan really need to be shown with the dominatrix? And with Aunt Emma? I contrast this with Casino, 2.58 hrs, every bit of that time has purpose. But Deniro, the focus of the movie, had Pesci to support him. DeCaprio was brilliant as the focus of the movie but had no one to support him. Jonah Hill?!? No. He was good but not good enough. The SEC, sure. But an expanded FBI plot line would have given Decaprio some help.

","The Wolf of the Wall Street- the story of the rise and fall of a corrupt stockbroker Jordan Belfort, directed by Martin Scorsesse is by far the greatest Scorsese film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>With a runtime of almost 3 hours, the surprising thing is that you won't be tired of this epic. With outstanding performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill, which landed them an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and a great script by Terence Winter, this movie might never get old and can be easily considered as one of the greatest movies of the 20th century.<br/><br/>Although I've given this movie a 10/10, the main drawback or the flaw in this film might be the ending, with a moral-less tale. I think so this might be intentionally done and maybe it was just left for interpretation for the audience. On one end, this might seem a glamorized version of the corrupt stockbroker. But on the flip side, this also serves as a cautionary tale about ""money won't buy you happiness"".<br/><br/>In the end, this film might not be everyone's cup of tea, but still give it a try-- you won't stop appreciating the hilarious performances and the non-stop humor!<br/><br/>Have a good day :)"

","The Wolf of Wall Street goes for three hours but by the end of the film it only feels like its gone for two. Martin Scorsese presents the audience with the fast paced, energetic, drug and sex fueled rise and fall of Jordan Belfort the wealthy stock broker who made millions off scamming people out of their money. Scorsese uses the movement of the camera, fast edits, snappy dialogue and the excess of Jordan's life including naked women, drugs and money to hook the audience into this world of indulgence. It fully emerges you into Jordan's world and shows just what exactly Jordan would do with his scammed millions. Leonardo DiCaprio brings a stellar performance as the drug fueled Belfort with him being calm and cocky for the most part until he doesn't get something his way or has a little to much of his drugs (the quaaludes scene being especially memorable) . The rest of their cast holds their own with Margot Robbie and Jonah Hill bringing their A game to the film with Robbie playing the no nonsense Naomi who stands her ground against Jordan and Jonah Hill as Donnie, Jordan right hand man.

"PCT1970","9","0","2","7 May 2019"," Greedy Wolf
","Arguably one of Scorsese's best to date. The film examines individuals consumed by the want of money and the richness it brings. In this case the richness that is depleted from humanity. DiCaprio portays the most narcissistic character this viewer has ever witnessed on the silver screen. It's astonishing that it's based on true events. The film tells the story of Jordan Belfort who starts his own brokerage firm and bilks his investors out of millions of dollars with an idea that started with penny stocks. He starts the firm with his cronies that follow him from his beginning and their loyalty is unflappable. This proves to be crucial when Belfort's rags to riches meteoric rise catches the eye of a dogged SEC agent. He is on to Belfort and is hell bent on taking him down. While Belfort's lifestyle of debauchery and belief of being untouchable continues the agent is closing in. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it is virtually impossible to pick a favorite. Excellent direction, screenplay, soundtrack, cinematography, costume, editing and acting. All of the artists involved deliver superlative performances. DiCaprio, Hill, Chandler and Robbie stand out. However it is DiCaprio who is commanding and mesmerizing. The plot is outrageous, uproarious, insightful, explorative, ingenious, sublime, intelligent, duplicitous, captivating, poetic and has a cathartic ending. To this day you'll hear fans of this film quote such famous lines as Belfort's, ""Sell me this pen"". This a a timeless masterpiece and remains one of the very best in it's genre."

","Power...money...greed...corruption...sex; these materialistic elements and more are rolled into one in this biographic portrait of Jordan Belfort, an ambitious and initially idealistic young stockbroker who works on Wall Street in the late 1980s, until he finds quick success and decides to branch off on his own. His success comes at a price though, and he quickly gets plunged into a reckless lifestyle where the money rolls in and the party never stops, even when the federal government gets wind of his underhanded dealings. To say that this is not for all tastes would be a drastic understatement; overlong, unapologetically profane, and unabashedly sleazy, this never attempts to sugarcoat the behind-the-scenes world of Belfort's lavish, hedonistic lifestyle, but despite how off-putting it is at times, it's never dull, with crafty direction from Scorsese (very similar to his work in Goodfellas), enough twists and turns in the story to keep things from becoming redundant, along with a great cast and knockout performances from DiCaprio, Hill, and Robbie. A good film that's for select audiences only. ***"

","This film tells the story of Jordan Belfort and how he made the fortune that funded his life of excess. After a brief prologue where he explains that he made millions and consumed vast quantities of various drugs we return to his first day on Wall Street; he is on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder but he knows he wants to get to the top... then a market crash puts him out of work. Instead of working at a prestigious Wall Street firm he ends up pushing penny stocks, basically junk, to people who can't really afford the losses they will surely face. It is profitable though and he quickly realises he can make a real fortune selling junk to rich people. He teams up with similarly minded people and creates a 'respectable' firm; soon he is dubbed 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and everybody wants to work for him. He gets a new wife, a large yacht and does even more drugs... his main problem is how to secure his money so that the authorities can't get it when they finally catch up with him... and he knows they will one day if he isn't careful.<br/><br/>This film is all about excess; it could take a prurient view but instead it revels in it... Jordon Belford and his friends may be drug-taking womanisers were few if any morals but for three hours they are good company. Belford is a charismatic central character; at times he reminded me of Charles Foster Kane, from 'Citizen Kane' at other times he was more like Tony Montana from 'Scarface' without the violence. As fast as he rises it is clear that he will ultimately fall. Leonardo DiCaprio is on top form as Belford; I can only suspect that the amorality of the character stopped him getting major awards. The supporting cast is solid too; most notably Margot Robbie who is great as Naomi, Belford's second wife; and Jonah Hill as Donnie, his closest associate. It must be stated that this film isn't for the easily offended; there is prodigious swearing, lots of drug taking, a fair amount of sex and nudity and a small amount of violence... if you aren't offended by that it is a lot of fun. Given that I'd certainly recommend it to anybody wanting an entertaining romp of a movie."

","Debauchery and excess are not only key themes of this three-hour bio-pic but also inherent qualities of it, as it continuously skirts the line between sincerity and satire in order to honestly evaluate its unlikable yet engaging protagonist and the compelling situation within which he finds himself. Though 'The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013)' never does much to punish the people who perpetrate greedy acts of criminal grandeur, it also never flinches from the unglamorous sides such an immoral life undoubtedly produces and, as such, allows the audience to decide whether or not they condone what they see (though it's pretty obvious they shouldn't). This leads to an eclectic and compelling mix of both breezy comedy and downbeat drama that, if nothing else, should at least keep you entertained. 7/10"

","OK, so I went into 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' with no expectations and it really impressed me! I guess I shouldn't be too surprised - it is Scorsese! He's definitely a master director, with the film paced perfectly and the three hour run-time actually flies by, with barely a minute wasted. I also liked how DiCaprio occasionally broke the fourth wall and spoke directly to the audience - works well here.<br/><br/>It's a true story, but I assume some creative liberties have been taken, as usual. It's basically a story of greed, ambition and ego, all played out on Wall St, New York in the late 80s and early 90s. There's some great supporting actors as DiCaprio's fellow stockbrokers/advisers, none more so than Hill, but it's great to see McConaughey, Reiner, Favreau and Suplee helping out.<br/><br/>While a film about stockbrokers doesn't sound too exciting, I can assure you this is - it has debauchery, drugs, alcohol, ridiculous chanting, sex - approximately a new pair of boobs to look at every 5min - life-or-death situations, a decent score, plenty of laughs (particularly the country club scene!) and a fitting conclusion."

","Perfect, just perfect. I'm watching this movie just as the revelations of sexual abuse in Hollywood, epitomized by the flagrantly lascivious behavior of Harvey Weinstein, is bringing revelations by the dozens from former abused victims. It's reached the point as I write this that actors like Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Spacey have been outed, and lo and behold, Leonardo DiCaprio has been exposed for having employees under contract to his production company sign off on non-disclosure agreements so they don't reveal the type of language and behavior that occur during project development meetings. No doubt many of those meetings wind up like the debauchery fests on display in this film.<br/><br/>Not only that, but when the elites of the movie entertainment industry rail against the greed and the selfishness of the one percent, and mount their pedestals for gay rights equality, the filmmakers here have no trouble castigating the poor schleps who have to work at McDonalds, and depict a gay orgy gone wrong at Jordan Belfort's (DiCaprio) swinging pad. The hypocrisy on display here is so self evident that it's embarrassing. At least they didn't have the gall to take on the Second Amendment here, that would have been the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>And leading the charge is DiCaprio himself, taking mean spirited delight in brandishing his no-holds barred assault on making money and taking no prisoners. Not to mention the ever self righteous Rob Reiner as Belfort's old man, lecturing Jordan on the proper way to treat 'his penis and her vagina' on the younger Belfort's wedding day. Nor did he have any trouble referring to natives of India as ""...dots, not feathers"". There, I knew there was something else; liberals decrying racism go racist when it suits them just fine. The fall back position is that it's in the script, or they're just actors or comedians doing a job. Yeah, that's principle on display alright.<br/><br/>I guess by now you can tell that I hated the film, but it was actually pretty well made to elicit this kind of response from me. It was also pretty funny at times. particularly when it devolved into moments of self parody. That's why I can give it the rating I did and still excoriate the hypocrisy involved. I have to admit, as much of a phony I think DiCaprio is, he did a superb job and Jonah Hill was outstanding as well. Probably the most fitting scene that illustrates the absurdity of the greedy and mendacious lifestyle on display here was when The Naomi sank in the ocean waters with a little chop, one of the best moves one might catch this side of The Titanic."

","Scorsese The wolf of wall street ""I would wish for any one of my colleagues to have the experience of working with Martin Scorsese once in their lifetime."" These lines are from world famous by legendary actor Daniel Day-Lewis. Martin Scorsese who is famous for his noir films like Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street. He handled many plots, time and social upheaval. Handling a character is his forte. Many directors from US work according to story and then create the character. Scorsese never give importance to story. This revolutionary director who make his film around the character, for him character is the most important factor. Film is about the character and his psychological landscape. His films offer us an exclusive glimpse of society, social scenario and its impact on character's mind. We surrender ourselves to the screen and scream with a character because we never realize when his character becomes our alter ego. The Wolf of Wall Street is a film about Jordan Belfort's memoir. Jordan Belfort who worked as stockbroker and who is convicted for stock market manipulation. He has spent 22 months in prison. Now he works as a motivational speaker. Jordan who was greedy for money and who committed many frauds to experience all his whims and fancies of as a mortal. In this film we find anxiety, emptiness and despair amid the rampage of group hysteria throughout the film. As Scorsese say, ""As you grow older, you change."" These lines come true when we watch films. This film showcases the characters of William Shakespeare's characters from tragedies and comedies. Representative stories of great men and their downfall, facing trial, drugs, daughter get kidnapped, car crash ultimately he become vulnerable. He realizes his self destructive urges. This showing us how the world works, everything comes up with a price. Belfort gets scared once he goes to jail. Thus the Machiavellian Belfort, an anti-hero of late-capitalist finance selling the lure of wealth as an alchemical panacea , may be our equivalent of Richard III or Iago - who also charm us and immobilize our moral instincts by taking us into the confidence of their villainous schemes. Rothstein has much in common with Shylock, hated by his Italian associates as a Jew, and finally incited to self-destruction by a contradictory human passion for family. conceivably the damaged and driven, yet heroic Hughes that Scorsese and DiCaprio showed us resembles Coriolanus - a mother- figure of immense power whose uncontrollable personal demons shape our destiny. We can call it a psychological capitalist epic. It could be compared with Citizen Cain. It is a film with a serious subject when we are living in the time of fast change. 2008 financial collapse of financial world made him make this film."

","Well I finally watched this film because my husband bought it on blu ray. All I can say is what an amazing film! Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of real life stockbroker Jordan Belfort. The movie is based on a memoir written by Belfort. When he was working on Wall Street his company was engaged in a lot of corruption. What I loved about this film was the acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, he really played the part well. Also I liked how the film had comedy through it even though it deals with some intense themes. I wasn't such a fan of Jonah Hill, I find he tries to hard to be funny. I think the film really shows the extremes of what people will do for money and of course the consequences of having too much of it. The only thing I didn't like was the excessive swearing, but the film is known for it's bad language. I gave it 9/10. It's a long movie also, so make sure you have a lot of time."

"JackVenturo","10","0","2","3 January 2017"," Three point of view review.
","I LOVED this movie, but my reasons for loving it go deep, first lets hit the surface, I'm a fan of Martin Scorsese, always have been and I love almost everything he does, ""Casino"" is one of my favorite movies, I watch it once a year at least. The Love for ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" goes beyond entertainment, like all of Martin Scorsese movies this movie has heart.<br/><br/>Jack ""The Film Lover"" says... ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" completes the DEGENERATE TRILOGY! That's Right Part I ""Goodfellas"", Part II ""Casino"" and Part III ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" the story of an innocent man gaining everything he wanted and more and losing it all. Gaining everything he thought he wanted only to find out the life he gets after he loses everything is in fact what he really needed. (1) Henry Hill in ""Goodfellas"" Always wanted to be a gangster and after committing crimes and becoming addicted to cocaine he lost everything and went into witness protection to live the rest of his life in peace and make money from his story. (2) Sam Rothstein in ""Casino"" was a gambling man who wanted a life of power and money he got all of it and more, and after committing some crimes and getting addicted to power and money he lost everything and retired to San Diego to live the rest of his life in peace and make money from his story. (3) Jordan Belford in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" wanted money and did everything in his power to get it, committing crimes and getting addicted to cocaine he lost everything went to prison and came out the other end to live the rest of his life in peace and make money from his story.<br/><br/>This is why I loved this movie, to me it was the final chapter in the poem that Martin Scorsese has been writing, and it sends a clear message. You think you know what you want but once you get it you find out you were not prepared for it so you lose it. It's a classic opera! A modern day Greek tragedy at its best and it's beautifully acted by everyone, I won't even begin to discuss how great Leonardo DiCaprio was, is, and always is! I don't need an Oscar to tell me he is amazing. Jonah Hill didn't even resemble Jonah Hill, he was great! <br/><br/>Other people will like this movie because of the money aspect without catching the true meaning of the money aspect, MONEY was the main villain! Take away the money? And you have a movie about a cocaine fueled hobo who beats his wife. <br/><br/>The money did not buy anyone happiness because they were all degenerates, and to be a Scorsese degenerate is a beautiful thing, ""Taxi Driver"" was a HERO! Think about it along those lines and you will see that all of these characters are just like you and me, give them an inch and they get addicted to cocaine! <br/><br/>Jack ""The Filmmaker"" says I did get a bit tired of the narrating style and the fast passed action, I know this is part of the story telling but I feel like the movie was really bright and really sunny and the lighting was very clean, this I think was done on purpose of course what it does is it makes you feel uneasy (Dark things are happening in broad daylight, bad things in bright places) but Martin Scorsese always plays with lighting and I think he could have played a bit more with this one so we don't feel rushed. The narrating style of talking straight to the camera was a bit off putting too but again I think that was the point, to make you uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Jack ""The Parent"" says NO!!! RUN AWAY! Don't let your kids even see the DVD case! Seriously DUH! No kids! It is great fun to watch alone! In the dark when you are really depressed and that's it!"

High weight deals strategy and not exactly lawful off camera control reared a lot of twenty-something tycoons, and Belfort fabricated himself a realm at the highest point of the store. His ascent and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street, in light of the diary of a similar name.<br/><br/>Under most conditions, the activities of Belfort and his colleagues (counting Jonah Hill in a howlingly clever turn as Belfort's business accomplice) would be seen as disgustingly detestable, yet Martin Scorsese outlines this story of eagerness with a comedic focal point that permits us to snicker at things we presumably shouldn't discover hilarious. Whether it's an awkward endeavor at fisticuffs between two characters overdosing on Quaaludes, or the order of whores utilizing securities exchange wording (""blue chip"" hookers make you wear a condom and regularly acknowledge Visas), the film is crazy from beginning to end, and once in a while vacillates in its mission to engage the group of onlookers for three hours.<br/><br/>Belfort figures out how to misdirect himself and his buddies into supposing they can live like this eternity, yet the gathering of people knows better, and Belfort's possible comeuppance is not really amazing. However, the way is cleared with cleverness, particularly in a scene on board the head honcho's extravagance yacht, where he surreptitiously offers a couple of FBI operators everything from alcohol to young ladies to real money in return for their hush. What's more, we should not overlook his discipline for shakily guiding a helicopter into the terrace of his bequest at 3am, getting under the skin of his trophy spouse (Margot Robbie)."

","De Caprio is the heart of the film, a daredevil whose motivation seems to be a misguided desire to acquire as much money as possible. He lives his life as a constant dare, using and abusing the investments of others, gambling with his personal relationships and his own health. He constantly endangers his life and those who are closest to him. It seems like he is capable of stopping this fall, but he keeps sinking and sinking. We could say he has a survivor's nature, but he carries with a very intense death wish, too. Usually, it's easy to understand how people like him become so successful. There's gotta be a bit of charisma to their natures, so that we can see how they seduce the rest of the world into following them. Unfortunately, the main lead here lacks that quality, and in one of the worst casting choices in recent history, what we get is a man who is not full of life and youth. He himself become his own iceberg as he reveals his ""age"" early in the film, and De Caprio hasn't looked that youthful in decades. This is not to say that De Caprio doesn't try, but he's not a good fit for this role. About three years ago, in ""The Social Network"" we could see the recklessness and drive of man who could lure you into a trap. There's no way that seems believable here, especially when you see the people he surrounds himself with. His wolf can't cast a spell, and he can hardly bite.

","Martin Scorsese's controversial film, The Wolf of Wall Street, is not for the faint of heart. It contains graphic nudity, some graphic violence, frequent drug use, and it drops the f-bomb 506 times, but if you can stomach it, Scorsese will hold your attention throughout the entire 179 minutes (just send your kids to their rooms). Young Jordan Belfort begins his career on Wall Street as a stock broker and is met by a list of unmentionable acts to commit. Wall Street and a brief counseling from a certain Matthew Mcconaughey turns him into a drug and money obsessed man who goes to great lengths to get what he wants. This movie is comparable in length to those of The Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series, but if you can't sit through those without being bored, this film may still be for you, and I highly encourage you to give it a watch. In lamest terms, from the plot, to the acting, to the cast choice, I give The Wolf of Wall Street ten out of ten stars, all the way.<br/><br/>The cast choice is one of the best features of this film. Whoever chose the cast for this film was a genius. Leonardo Dicaprio, Oscar-less at the time, gave an unbelievable performance. It is a mystery to me how his single Oscar (how he has only one Oscar is equally mysterious) did not come from this movie. His extremely convincing acting is one of the main things that won me over for this movie. His portrayal of a self-absorbed, drug addicted starlet could not have been conveyed any better by anyone other than Dicaprio. His performance was a must see. The supporting roles were also chosen very wisely. Belfort's crazy best friend, portrayed by Jonah Hill, will keep you laughing the whole time. In fact, it's said that at times, Hill legitimately made Dicaprio laugh while the camera was rolling with his witty and just blatantly hilarious demeanor. And how could we forget about Margot Robbie? She was clearly typecast for her role as Naomi Belfort. The casting for this film is, bottom line, excellent and is what makes up a huge part of this movie's success.<br/><br/>The brilliant plot of The Wolf of Wall Street will keep you heartily entertained and make you forget that you've been sitting in the same spot for 3 hours straight. As soon as you think Jordan is going to be arrested, he magically escapes from the hands of the law like Houdini. You wonder how in the world Naomi married him after he cheated on his first wife with her. Your ass may literally fall off from laughing so hard. Need something to get your mind off of your loneliness, or something to watch to make you feel like you're on top of the world? Watch this movie. Scorsese's directing makes you feel like you are present in Belfort's life. You may feel like you need to studiously read the bible after watching this film. You might feel like you need a bath. You may want to spontaneously do a line of cocaine. You may want to yell at someone in that god awful Northern accent. That's what makes this movie great.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something to do because your boyfriend dumped you and this is the first lonely Friday night you've had to experience in a while, please watch this movie. Words cannot describe the grip this movie will hold on you. I strongly encourage you to give this movie a view. Hopefully it will immediately hold a special place in your heart like it does mine."

"PimpinAinttEasy","8","0","3","23 August 2016"," Sensory assault on a completely new level .....
","Films like Goodfellas and Casino predicted Wolf of Wall Street in the way Scorsese's films would be made and edited. The voice-over narration talks us through the sensory assault filled with interesting camera angles, fast cuts, violence, beautiful women, scenes of drug abuse, alcoholism, gluttony and even cartoons. The background score is filled with catchy punk rock versions of famous songs. Scorsese takes the sensory assault to another level in Wolf of Wall Street. It is entertaining as hell. But the film does not work in its entirety.<br/><br/>For starters, Di Caprio is no De Niro/Harvey Keitel. I have always been suspicious about Di Caprio's ability to carry a film on his shoulders. I personally think he overacts and is a liability in every single film he has made with Scorsese. He really has not fulfilled the early promise that he showed in Basketball Diaries and This Boy's Life. Somehow he seems to be ill at ease as an adult actor. Jonah Hill has improved a lot and does a decent job as Di Caprio's sidekick. Margot Robbie makes a sensational debut. She is stunningly beautiful and sexy.<br/><br/>I loved the film's ending when Scorsese turns the camera on us. By showing the investigator sweating it out in the subway train and the common people looking earnestly at Jordan Belfort, Scorsese asks us - What do we really want? Can we honestly say that we are repelled by Belfort's lifestyle? Can we? I guess not. <br/><br/>(8/10)"

"zitomirsin","10","0","5","12 May 2016"," Scorsese explains how to make a comedy
","One of A best and wildest nonsense (?) Movies I've watched. Black comedy which can be found in nearly every Scorsese film here is reaching its peak. The Wolf of Wall Street is strawberry on the cake. The cast, which is led by the brilliant DiCaprio has made this film truly special achievement of its genre that should not be missed in any case.<br/><br/>DiCaprio has once again proved that it can handle almost any role, but that role of ""psychotic madman"" (Django Unchained, The Aviator, Shutter Island) is definitely the most appropriate for him, and combination of them can be seen in this masterpiece. As listed for each film, but for this most definitely, Leo could, and for The Wolf of Wall Street just had to take the Oscar (with due respect to Matthew McConaughey, of whom more soon). He brings some incredible moments and his way of acting is so good that you'll think he is in fact Jordan Belfort himself. Also his narration is so cool that you'll think he's actually near you.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill is excellent as his best friend and a major participant in all the craziness but also businesses. A way that they meet is ultra funny and the next scenes are all amazingly ridiculous , dialogues are some Tarantino moments, alcohol, nudity and white powder are more and more present. It was nice to watch and enjoy all the scenes of Margot Robbie and the male audience will definitely repeat them several times .. Man, the whole film should be repeated several times! Other members of the cast are also fantastic in their roles, but I have to pick Matthew McConaughey which absolutely dominates the scene at any moment when he appears. Although overall that is very short period of time I would give him the Oscar for best supporting role and Leo would get one for main role then.<br/><br/>This is not a classic film about Wall Street with numbers, stock exchange, outsmarting customers (there are, in some crazy and funny way). This is madness in a thousand ways. The realistic picture of life of rich people.<br/><br/>Scorsese shows pure example how to make three hour of ""straightjacket comedy"""
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","0","5","26 April 2016"," Debauched, depraved, delightful
","1. I gave this movie 6/10 when I first watched it two years ago. What the hell was wrong with me?<br/><br/>2. I didn't want DiCaprio to win the Oscar in 2013 because I thought McConaughey was more deserving (and Ejiofor was more than both). But now that the Internet got him an Oscar for The Revenant, I think its a huge shame because this is where DiCaprio's strengths lie. Jordan Belfort is a loud, bombastic, debauched, deranged, hyperactive animal - and we love him every moment he's on screen. DiCaprio invests him with an animalistic energy that dips into humanity's id and just lets himself go crazy. <br/><br/>3. Without DiCaprio's performance, this three hour movie would feel its length. That's why The Revenant killed me - it was just painful waiting for something to happen. Here, there is ALWAYS something happening.<br/><br/>4. Props to Jonah Hill for his fantastic performance as well - likely the finest of his career. His big, gleaming fake smile and his equally depraved behaviour is a perfect compliment to DiCaprio. The best scenes in the film involve Jonah Hill, who gets an even stronger reaction out of you with his frustrating behaviour. But in the film's more serious moments, there is that Goodfellas camaraderie between Azoff and Belfort that makes the characters feel like real adults who lived.<br/><br/>5. The rest of the cast is also up for the challenge, with talented TV actors like Kenneth Choi, Jon Bernthal and Ethan Suplee appearing memorably amongst Belfort's chums, Oscar winners Matthew McConaughey and Jean Dujardin stealing the show in small roles, and directors like Jon Favreau, Spike Jonze and Rob Reiner stopping by an being generally excellent (Reiner is particularly memorable as ""Mad Max"" Belfort). McConaughey's scenes are hypnotic in their excellence. But the real standout is Margot Robbie, who I watched when she was on Neighbours and love seeing her breakout into the main stream. <br/><br/>6. Robbie is completely intoxicating, thanks in part to the film's makeup and costume team. The comparison with Cristin Milioti as Jordan's first wife is a subtle but clever one - despite Milioti being cute as a button, the film makes her look just a little bit too frumpy or standard compared to the luxurious Naomi. <br/><br/>7. A lot of the film was improvised, which pads the run time a bit but the fun that everyone is having is incredibly infectious. The things that are unforeseen, like a kitchen island during the Quayludes scene, contribute even more to the film. The continuous and excessive swearing is magnificent. <br/><br/>8. Scorsese and his cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto dart around the film with freeze frames, slow-motion, tracking shots and multiple lenses to show up the drug high scenes. It is really impressive filmmaking. <br/><br/>9. The use of music is great as well, especially with the McConaughey humming replicated into a musical score to play over key moments. <br/><br/>10. This is Scorsese's best movie since Casino, possibly even better. It is full of manic energy, the mood of each scene is unbelievable. DiCaprio is an actor to be treasured, and I hope Scorsese has one or two more of these still in him."
"missrri","9","0","4","1 April 2016"," ''A Cautionary Tale'' played incredibly by an unchained DiCaprio
","I postponed watching this film for a couple of years for it seemed too long and the plot was already everywhere on the internet. But when I finally found enough time to watch it in full, oh boy, was I surprised! I can see why many people hated this film as it goes against morals and religion and traditional thought patterns, but to free-thinking, religion-less people like me, this movie was a blast! I laughed to tears at some scenes, and almost wept at one particular scene, and let me tell you, I'm not a shallow person, and I'm in fact hard to impress by contemporary cinema. People tend to forget this film is meant as a purely entertaining adaptation of a book based on one's life with the intention to raise awareness on the consequences of crimes. It's not just about the hookers and the drugs and the recklessness! As the real Jordan Belfort himself has stated, he hopes this film to serve as ''a cautionary tale'' and that people will also appreciate the work of genuine and talented stockbrokers (not just their sins and crimes) - remember the ''sell me this pen'' scene? I already knew Leonardo DiCaprio could act phenomenally, but his performance in ''The Wolf of Wall Street'' seems of another superior calibre. Despite his constant yelling and orange tan, he poured out his soul in this one, as always, He even damaged his back for goodness's sake for the crawling scene that he had to shoot for an entire week and then needed a chiropractor! He impersonated Belfort incredibly, without being ridiculous, without trying to mimic his voice or gestures, added a personal touch to the story, and he came up with the idea of doing this film in the first place! DiCaprio read the hard copy of Belfort's book (while vacationing on his yacht probably), and he thought it would make a great film, so he contacted Scorsese and you can guess the rest. Keeping the audience engaged and laughing or crying for 3 hours shows the hard work that was put in the making of this film (extras included) and it does not fail to impress. A must-watch for DiCaprio and Scorsese avid fans!"

I don't plan on watching it a second time though"". <br/><br/>For the ones saying it's abysmal: There is no character that you're going to feel sympathy for, or feel is the hero of the movie. That's just not what kind of film this is, and you're better off knowing that going in (I did). The graphic nature of certain scenes were not out of place (there is constant vulgar language, and several scenes of graphic nudity). <br/><br/>For the ones on the flip side: This is NOT DiCaprio's ""crowning achievement"". He's good, don't get me wrong, but I've seen better performances out of him. That's not something I ever expected to be saying, but he's really developed into a phenomenal actor. I thought that Jonah Hill did a much better job than I expected, and that was a nice surprise.<br/><br/>My final verdict? Ignore 90% of the reviews on here, go watch the movie and decide for yourself.

"anaconda-40658","9","0","3","23 March 2016"," DiCaprio's Wall Street!
","The Wolf of Wall Street (2013): Dir: Martin Scorsese / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Rob Reiner: The fifth teaming between director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio is another high level gem. It regards the pursuit of power particularly over those of lower status who fall victim to the deceitful exploits. DiCaprio plays stockbroker Jordan Belfort who rises to the top of the stock market using his ability to pitch sales entwined in deceit to merge ahead. He coaches other low income nerds and eventually they go from being on the low payroll to forking in thousands a week. Belfort divorces his wife in favor of the gorgeous Naomi. He has a large mansion, a helicopter, and a massive yacht. He also has the FBI veering in sending Belfort's confident demeanor into paranoia. If there is a flaw then it's the handling of Belfort as a father, which seems to come suddenly and becoming almost an afterthought until a crucial climatic sequence. DiCaprio gives Scorsese another brilliant turn as someone high on money, greed and drugs, which leads to a hilarious drug and drive sequence that further accounts to his downfall. Jonah Hill is scene stealing amusing joining Belfort in the promise of wealth and drugs. Margot Robbie is beautiful as Belfort's frustrated wife who grows weary of his down spiral exploits. Matthew McConaughey appears briefly as a broker who trains Belfort. Rob Reiner is given the small but pivotal role as Belfort's father who warns him to quit while he is ahead. The wages of sin is death even if it is via reputation. Score: 9 / 10"
"robert-259-28954","9","0","3","16 March 2016"," Greasy good.
","If you're looking for classic Scorcese, this is your movie. As many have noticed, it paints the many wolves of Wall Street for exactly what they are... scumbags and thieves in 3- piece suits. The first thing I noticed was Scorcese's homage to one of his own films, the titular ""Goodfellas,"" where the protagonist (DiCaprio) gives a personal voice-over tour of the shenanigans of his entire crew, which by extension, numbers in the hundreds, the sleazy underbelly of the young turks who, by their singular obsession for wealth at any cost, seem to clearly be having the time of their lives. As you will quickly see, the over the top glitz, combined with unfettered hedonism, goes along with business in the most delightfully debauched ways, making the gamut from hardcore drug and alcohol addiction, to more sex than you'll see in the average whorehouse. But as always, Scorcese manages the delicate balancing act between hardcore violence and overt law breaking with the chemically-fueled ecstasy of a life steeped in greed unburdened by guilt. And that is perhaps the closest he comes in the entire film to offering some sort of deliverance from the orgy of excess that this movie depicts so graphically — that there is always a bill to be paid for this kind of lifestyle that can be as extreme as the perks. But what is most troubling is just how many people out there seem ready, willing, and able to pick up the tab for this kind of thinly-veiled crime. Along with the superb supporting cast, this is DiCaprio's film, a delirious tour de force that will leave you gasping."

It's all party, booze and drugs until the FBI and police department get involved which involves money laundering, a wire and heated arguments. There's also the aspect of Jordan's lovelife where he cheats, is addicted to sex and even kisses his wife's Auntie (who is busy laundering money for him). This film is not very predictable, apart from the fact that nearing to the end of the film you can pretty much guess what is going to occur to Jordan, his family and his friends too.<br/><br/>You might learn a few lessons from this film, be disgusted or thoroughly entertained.

","With his latest film, The Wolf of Wall Street, Martin Scorsese has directed yet another modern classic. Like 'The Aviator' before it, his latest collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio is another exceptional character study of a successful playboy whose flaws bring his world crashing down around him. Based upon the autobiography of the protagonist, Jordan Belfort, the story charts the career of a fraudulent stock broker as he works his way up the ladder of Wall Street from lowly telephone operator to the head of his own company, and the inevitable crash that follows.<br/><br/>The film opens with Belfort breaking the fourth wall to directly introduce the viewer to his life at its peak. He presents us with everything he has achieved and - by frank admission of his vices - everything he stands to lose, before whisking us back to the start of his career. This sets the tone of the film perfectly from the outset: Belfort is the stock we are investing in: an unstable commodity who will fluctuate wildly because he is an obvious liability. Over the course of the film he continues this trend. And in sharing his truths with us and us alone, he makes us complicit - bringing us along for the ride whether we like it or not. So we become another one of his marks, sucked in by his charisma.<br/><br/>The acting is first-rate. Even from those in the smallest parts like Belfort's private investigator Bo Dietl, playing himself with a relaxed, unforced authenticity as he appears to improvise dialogue about security risks with DiCaprio. In fact, the seamless improvisation by much of the main cast is what makes this film so enjoyable to watch: McConnaughey's thin-faced, wandering-eyed, semi- hippy financial guru whose brief appearance is so compelling that it predominates much of the film's accompanying trailer; the boardroom scenes where dwarf-tossing and excessive lunch bills are discussed (to the enjoyable outrage of veteran improviser Rob Reiner); Jonah Hill's outstanding confrontation with Jon Bernthal in the parking lot when he reaches for every insult he can think of, and DiCaprio's exquisite quaalude-riddled, epic 10 metre journey from the doors of his country club to his Lambourghini - which is about as good a visual metaphor as you'll see in modern cinema for the argument that no amount of money can buy even a shred of dignity. It is DiCaprio's subtly mesmerising central performance that anchors the debauched madness when events become borderline unreal. He goes from naive first-dayer, to bug- eyed, drug-addled, vein-popping chauvinist financial compere - and all the way back again, notably for a scene in which he suavely tip-toes his way through a verbal minefield to make a savvy proposal of bribery to a federal agent.<br/><br/>This mastery is expertly cultivated by Scorsese; an auteur who seems to have a preternatural ability to determine when his actors are in full flow, how to inspire their confidence and how best to capture them on film. He does this particularly well in a series of scenes beginning with Hill's character (Donnie) and Belfort each taking a particularly powerful type of quaalude. Believing them to be duds, they each take a few more - despite having been told by the supplier to take only one. The dialogue hints that this course of action is a bad idea, but the audience is distracted from this notion by a sobering phone call to Belfort that draws him to his country club. Here, Scorsese slots in an establishing scene of Belfort making the journey, getting out of his car and striding into the building - which seems almost superfluous. Belfort uses a payphone and conducts a tense conversation, absorbing the viewer entirely. Gradually, Belfort starts slurring his words. It suddenly becomes apparent that the quaaludes have kicked in. Then the aforementioned return journey to the car occurs and the task of navigating the steps that previously appeared to be so simple is given a comical, Herculean level of difficulty when juxtaposed with the apparently-unnecessary establishing scene from earlier. It's this kind of complete attention to detail that makes Scorsese's films a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Another example of this occurs shortly after; when Belfort arrives home to warn Donny that he should not be using the house phone because it is tapped. But, due to both his and Donny's intoxication, Belfort cannot make this concept clear to Donny, who is in the process of trying to conduct a call, but failing for obvious reasons. So the exchange is essentially just the primordial bellowing of cavemen, and the most incomprehensible business meeting in cinema history. It is also satisfyingly ironic - given that anyone listening in to the phone call would be unable to glean any information whatsoever from a conversation conducted in that state. At one point Donny begins to choke and Belfort leaps on top him. Then Belfort pauses for a flickering moment, as if he is considering leaving him to die - it would solve his problems if Donny has incriminated him in any way. But he continues and begins performing CPR. There is no allusion to this in the dialogue or narration, and whether or not this was intentionally scripted or improvised by Scorsese or DiCaprio does not really matter. What matters is that it is so creative, and shows such an excellent collaborative rapport between a director and his actors."
"jkikianis","7","0","2","9 December 2015"," Not Amongst Scorsese's Best, but still a Good Movie
","This is a well crafted film and displays the many frequent qualities seen in the Scorsese style. The structure of this film is very clever and intricate despite the basic story following the same structure and characters arcs found in both Casino and Goodfellas. The leading men of all three films seems to following the same exact arc with slight variations in each. The film, while well constructed, is often tough to watch. The only line of dialogue I can endorse by anyone in the film is when Rob Reiner's character says ""This is obscene"" in response to seeing how Jordan Belfort and his hooligans live. I don't usually find issue with the qualities that give films like this an R rating but I found that this film was celebration of these people that are simply despicable. The film glorifies the excess of drugs, sex, and criminal stupidity. Of course the performances are good all over the board and all the actors do great work with the horribly unlikeable characters they represent. The film has extreme tonal inconsistency and seems unfocused on what the film is trying to accomplish. I found myself taken out of the story due to the many tangents and subplots that the film explores entirely for the reason of making the audience laugh. The movie is funny but became extremely distracting due to the unfocused layout of events. The movie is 3 hours long in a film that feels like at least 2 and a half hours of sex and drugs along. While the film is well crafted for what it is I would recommend it only to a very particular audience that is comfortable for the very adult and graphic nature of the imagery and the dialogue."

Incredibly, Leo's portrayal of him is so good, that you find yourself rooting for him, despite knowing that he is the one in the wrong. It is easily one of DiCaprio's best roles, and its snub by the Oscars is shameful. Jonah Hill also impresses while Margot Robbie makes an incredible leap into the spotlight.

I wanna talk about Jonah Hill first- THIS GUY IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. I've seen him the Jump Street franchise, and he was great there. But in this film, he's OUT-STAN-DING. This guy gave the best performance of his life there, he was more than excellent, he had such a dramatic side in him I've never seen before but now thanks to Martin I finally saw it. Now let's talk about DiCaprio- This guy, is just mind blowing. There are very few people in the world who can act like him, and it's super difficult to act like him. Even if you've been in more than 50 movies, and actor like DiCaprio- there will never be anyone as outstanding and excellent as him. I saw him in Inception and he was absolutely great but here- HE IS MAGNIFICENT. He can make you buy buy a banana for 500$ and you won't even know what just happened afterwords. In my opinion, he is truly the greatest actor ever. He sales every performance, he can make you laugh at any time, he can make you drop your jaw if he feels like it and that's why I think Leonardo DiCaprio is the greatest living actor in cinema history.

You are watching and then you are searching for real people in that movies. I want Leonardo Dicaprio has a Oscar. Why not? He is really professional. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review :)"

","Wolf on Wall Street has everything a classic Hollywood movie needs to be successful these days drugs, sex, money, and comedy. Unfortunately for this movie they really don't help the plot or character development which is its only downfall I can think of off the top of my head. The comedy is surprisingly good Jonah hill is definitely a good choice and DiCaprio absolutely nails his part as Jordan Belfort. As a DiCaprio fan this is one of my favorite DiCaprio movies if not my favorite. All together the film has a perfect mix of comedy and drama to make for an exceptional film. A classic crime movie where the fuzz win in the end.<br/><br/>The film does lack character development. For example all Donnie Azgoff (Jonah Hill) does in the movie is drugs and sex, we don't get to know him or anything about him he's just simply thrown into the story and he sticks until the films conclusion. Overall the film is one of the best films of this generation, Martin Scorsese is a genius director and this is another genius film"

","This movie is a great movie the action the comedy and the witty banter is great. The actors are really good also there is never a dull moment in this movie. It is action packed, funny and a great comedy. I would recommend it for anyone but mainly for teenagers/young adults. There is plenty of fun and comedy in it and it shows you a lot of stuff you would be shocked about. It is so funny the only thing I see wrong with it is it almost lasts 3 hours long and thats its downfall. But overall i would rate this movie 8/10 due to as its probably one of the best comedy's currently out there at the minute. I was quite shocked how well Leonardo DiCaprio plays this role due to as he doesn't do these kinds of movies overall the actors are amazing and the amount of work has went into this movie is crazy your in for a treat would highly recommend to sit down relax and enjoy the movie because if you like comedy and fun this is the movie for you."

","I think that this is the best movie Leonardo DiCaprio has ever done. His performance is absolutely fantastic. He plays his role great, with a lot of character. I haven't read about the real story, but heard a little from the real Jordan Belfort. So the movie is great and it's typical Martin Scorsese. He's good at making real stories into films. This is an astounding movie and i recommend this movie to everyone, because this movie is the best of 2013. Martin Scorsese did it again. He chose Leonardo DiCaprio as lead actor, which Leonardo did great. They do work really fine together. One of the most funniest scenes and best scenes (maybe spoilers), is when Naomi and Jordan are mad at each other. You will see that, when you see the movie. You have to see it, if you are a true fan of Leonardo and Martin of course."

","Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is abashed and shameless, exciting and exhausting, disgusting and illuminating; it's one of the most entertaining films ever made about loathsome men. Its star Leonardo DiCapriohas compared it to the story of the Roman emperor Caligula, and he's not far off the mark.  Adapted by Terence Winter from the memoir by stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who oozed his way into a fortune in the 1980s and '90s, this is an excessive film about excess, and a movie about appetites whose own appetite for compulsive pleasures seems bottomless. It runs three hours, and was reportedly cut down from four by Scorsese's regular editorThelma Schoonmaker. It's a testament to Scorsese and Winter and their collaborators that one could imagine watching these cackling swine for five hours, or ten, while still finding them fascinating, and our own fascination with them disturbing. This is a reptilian brain movie. Every frame has scales.  The middle-class, Queens-raised Belfort tried and failed to establish himself on Wall Street in a more traditional way—we see his tutelage in the late '80s at a blue chip firm, under the wing of a grinning sleazeball played byMatthew McConaughey—but got laid off in the market crash of 1987. He reinvented himself on Long Island by taking over a penny stock boiler room and giving it an old money name, Stratton Oakmont, to gain the confidence of middle- and working-class investors. Per Wikipedia, at its peak, ""the firm employed over 1000 stock brokers and was involved in stock issues totaling more than $1 billion, including an equity raising for footwear company Steve Madden Ltd."" Belfort and his company specialized in ""pump and dump"" operations: artificially blowing up the value of a nearly worthless stock, then selling it at a big profit, after which point the value drops and the investors lose their money. Belfort was indicted in 1998 for money laundering and securities fraud, spent nearly two years in federal prison and was ordered to pay back $110 million to investors he'd deceived.  You can tell how much Belfort cares about his people by the way his narration segues from an anecdote about a broker who fell into a spiral of misery and shame: ""He got depressed and killed himself three years later,"" Belfort says over a photo of a corpse in a bathtub trailing blood from slit wrists. Then, without missing a beat, he says, ""Anyway..."" The brokers classify prostitutes by cost and attractiveness, referring to them as ""blue chips, ""NASDAQs"" and ""pink sheets"" (or ""skanks""); they're warm-blooded receptacles to be screwed and sent on their way, much like the firm's clients, including shoe mogul Steve Madden, whose deal Belfort describes as an oral rape. The directorial high point is a Belfort-Azoff Quaalude binge that spirals into comic madness, with Azoff blubbering and freaking out and stuffing his face and collapsing, and Belfort suffering paralysis during a panicked phone call about his money and then crawling towards his car like a nearly-roadkilled animal, one agonizing inch at a time.  But the film's vision goes beyond cultural anthropology and antihero worship. When people ask me what the film is about, I tell them that like a good many films by Scorsese—who overcame a cocaine problem in the early '80s—at its root, it's about addiction: a disease or condition that seizes hold of one's emotions and imagination, and makes it hard to picture any life but the one you're already in. Many people get a contact high from following the exploits of entrepreneurs, financiers, bankers, CEO and the like, and when such men (they're nearly always men) get busted for skirting or breaking laws, they root for them as if they were disreputable folk heroes, gangsters with fountain pens instead of guns—guys who, for all their selfishness and cruelty, are above the petty rules that constrict the rest of us. Such men are addicts, egged on by a cheering section of little guys who fantasize of being big. We enable them by reveling in their exploits or not paying close enough attention to their misdeeds, much less demanding reform of the laws they bend or ignore—laws that might have teeth if we hadn't allowed guys like Belfort (and his far more powerful role models) to legally bribe the United States legislative branch via the nonsensical ""system"" of campaign financing. After a certain number of decades, we should ask if the nonstop enabling of addicts like Belfort doesn't mean that, in some sense, their enablers are addicted, too—that they (we) are part of a perpetual-motion wheel that just keeps turning and turning. In the end ""Wolf"" is not so much about one addict as it is about America's addiction to capitalist excess and the ""He who dies with the most toys wins"" mindset, which has proved as durable as the image of the snarling gangster taking what he likes when he feels like taking it.  There will be a few points during ""Wolf"" when you think, ""These people are revolting, why am I tolerating this, much less getting a vicarious thrill from it?"" At those moments, think about what the ""it"" refers to. It's not just these characters, and this setting, and this particular story. It's the world we live in. Men like Belfort represent us, even as they're robbing us blind. They're America, and on some level we must be OK with them representing America, otherwise we would have seen reforms in the late '80s or '90s or '00s that made it harder for men like Belfort to amass a fortune, or that at least quickly detected and harshly punished their sins. Belfort was never punished on a level befitting the magnitude of pain he inflicted. According to federal prosecutors, he failed to abide by the terms of his 2003 restitution agreement. He's a motivational speaker now, and if you read interviews with him, or his memoir, it's obvious that he's not really sorry about anything but getting caught. We laugh at the movie, but guys like Belfort will never stop laughing at us."

What is it, something in the water? Something to do with dream time? There are some things man was never meant to know.<br/><br/>As the real life bastard, Jordan Belfort, DeCaprio gives an exceptionally good performance. Belfort has one outstanding talent that, like musical genius, will never show up on a standard intelligence test. He's a charismatic salesman. He can sell you anything. He's smooth and energetic, and he does a lot of dope to keep him that way.<br/><br/>His entire life is based on a single premise, stated thus by Mr. Micawber in ""David Copperfield."" ""Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery."" <br/><br/>Money in his world seems to buy happiness, just as it seems to in real life. Would he have any hope of marrying someone who looked like Margot Robbie if he'd been a poor but honest gas station attendant? In your dreams. When he loses his dough and has to sell the house, she leaves him abruptly, dispassionately, rationally, pragmatically. DeCaprio is broke? Good-bye, DeCaprio.<br/><br/>The acting is very good on everyone's part. The structure is familiar enough from Martin Scorcese's earlier work that it's comfortably reassuring. We kind of know what's coming. DeCaprio will make a lot of money doing illegal stuff, then lose it, and wind up maybe not much wiser but at least still breathing after he rats on his friends.<br/><br/>The acting and the story are nearly flawless, yet the movie doesn't entirely click, and the cause is the direction. It's as if everyone's battery, including Scorsese's, had been overcharged and sparks were flying everywhere. There's virtually no violence but its absence is made up for by noise, lots of noise, lots of long arguments in which all parties scream at one another. Insane ebullience. No office of stock salesmen has ever been run like DeCaprio's -- people screaming and running around, snorting coke and dropping Ludes, and multiple couples banging away doggy style on the desk tops. The booze flows like Niagara. Erg for erg, joule for joule, decibel for decibel, I don't think this movie has ever been beaten.<br/><br/>The dialog is very uneven. DeCaprio's narration is okay. It's a familiar device. But then a snippet of Robbie's voice over takes place, never to be heard again. Tha't clumsy editing. We don't learn too much that we don't already know when DeCaprio gives his evangelical speeches. <br/><br/>Maybe the best conversational exchange is a very quiet and intimate one between DeCaprio and an FBI agent who is making what they call a ""threshold interview."" Both DeCaprio and the agent, Kyle Chandler, are phenomenal, their expressions and inflections unforgettable, as DeCaprio -- oh, so cleverly, so oleaginously -- offers Chandler a bribe without ever saying so. It's a simple scene. And it's believable in a way that the office orgies are not.<br/><br/>I like Scorsese's work. He's one of a handful of directors, like the Coens, doing original stuff today. He needs to calm down. But ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is eminently watchable. There is another memorable scene, not to be missed, when DeCaprio is strung out on some dynamite Ludes and must roll down a brick stairway and crawl to his car."

"Screen_Blitz","9","0","5","25 May 2015"," Top-notch Martin Scorsese film with a fantastic performance by Leonardo Dicaprio
","Many know Martin Scorsese for his critically acclaimed crime-dramas such as Taxi Driver (1976), Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), and Gangs of New York (2002). Some might have never guessed he would take a leap into the comedy genre since his 1983 black comedy, King of Comedy. Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Dicaprio make their fifth collaboration in The Wolf of Wall Street, an intelligent biopic comedy about crime, corruption, and cheating against the law enforcement, that should have landed multiple Oscars.<br/><br/>Based on true events set in the late 80s and early 90s, Leonardo Dicaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker who takes a job at Wall Street, only to get laid off when the company suffers a severe downfall. In an effort to regain wealth, Belfort raises his own financial company, Stratton Oakmont, with the help Donnie Azoff (played by Jonah Hill). He begins living a life of extreme wealth, sex, and drugs by defrauding financial investors that eventually draws unwanted attention by the FBI. Leonardo Dicaprio gives one of the most mesmerizing performances of his career. He has long-lasting impressions with his performances on many of Martin Scorsese films such as Gangs of New York, The Aviator, Shutter Island, and The Departed. In this film, he does a job at being funny, charismatic, and faithful on his portrayal of Jordan Belfort. Many scenes left me laughing hysterically, but at the same time, shocked by some of Belfort's actions. There are several scenes include Belfort gets high on hardcore drugs like quaaludes and cocaine. I was pretty shocked by these scenes but most of the time, they're funny. Jonah Hill also gives a hilarious and decent performance as Jordan's Belfort'a assistant. Martin Scorsese did an amazing job on mixing his unique style of filmmaking with a comedic tone. <br/><br/>Yes, the film runs for three hours but it manages entertaining throughout its time. Many viewers however, have expressed negativity for the excessive sex and nudity that goes on the film. The film does push the envelope with frequent sexual content and nudity from both genders. However, it never gets extreme to the point where it makes the film look pornographic. This film also now holds the record of the most F-bombs used in a film. Nonetheless, the film is very enjoyable, funny, and a must-see for everyone. But when I mean everyone, I don't include anyone under the age of 17. Overall, I was pretty disappointed that this film didn't land any Oscars, especially Leonardo Dicaprio (although he was nominated). This film deserves more than what it received. It is wild and astonishingly entertaining comedy done by the surprising comedic efforts of Martin Scorsese, and stands as one of his best films since The Departed."

","Last night, I finally watched last year's 3-hour-long The Wolf of Wall Street, which purports to tell the true story of Jordan Belfort, a guy who got rich beyond his wildest dreams of avarice thanks to the empire he built by fraudulently selling worthless penny stocks. The film garnered a great deal of attention when it opened because it showed the debauchery of Jordan's life, as well as the life his fellow get-rich-quick traders lived. There were beaches full of cocaine (apparently the actors sniffed up powered Vitamin B), mountains of Quaaludes, oceans of alcohol, and swarms of naked prostitutes, as well as few tossed dwarfs. It wasn't titillating, it was mind-numbing.<br/><br/>As I commented to my wife, the movie was too much debauchery and too little plot. By the beginning of the third hour, I was desperate for the FBI to move in and just arrest the guy so that we could all be put out of our misery. Unless you are a glutton for punishment, I recommend that you skip the whole movie and just watch the first and last half hours, which will tell you everything you need to know about one crook's rise and fall.<br/><br/>last night, my son saw Noah, a movie that has aroused the ire of traditional believers because of the way it turns God's message and moral on its head. While my son couldn't care less about whether the movie twisted the Bible, he does care about good entertainment. This was not, in his estimation, good entertainment. Or as he said, and I quote, ""Noah was a terrible movie. It was really stupid and boring. It was the worst movie I've ever seen.""<br/><br/>When I pressed him for details, I got a garbled recital about Noah's stupid belief that he had to kill all of humankind, about his plan to murder his grandchildren, about unbelievable bad guys and animated rocks, and generally about a frenetic, yet boring, mess of a movie. This was a two thumbs down and then some."
"classicalsteve","8","0","5","16 May 2015"," Goodfellas Meets Wall Street: Explicit Sex, Mind-Numbing Drugs, Gobs of Money, and Endless Expletives
","When I saw ""Good Fellas"" during its initial release in 1990, I thought I had seen the goriest violence (outside of a horror film) and linguistically filthiest language I had ever witnessed in a film. While ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" was not as graphic in the violence department, it makes ""Good Fellas"" seem tame in the language department. Also, the sex scenes are so over-the-top and explicit, this film probably would have garnered an X-rating a few decades ago. It was almost too much, but luckily the story was compelling enough and the excellent performances by Leonard DiCaprio and Jonah Hill convincing enough that it still works fairly well as satisfying cinema.<br/><br/>The film centers around true-to-life penny-stocks trader Jordan Belfort played by Leonardo DiCaprio and his associate Donnie Azoff (Johan Hill) and how they built a multi-million dollar penny-stocks mini-empire which not only violated SEC rules of trading but engaged in securities fraud and money laundering. In typical Scorsese style, the story begins with the voice-over of Belfort, telling his story about eight years of his life in penny stocks trading and eventual securities fraud through his firm Stratton Oakmont from circa 1988 to 1995. Four things seem to drive Belfort: endless sex, gobs of money, constant drug-induced highs, and the endless spewing of expletives.<br/><br/>Belfort begins his story by telling us about the wealth he has achieved engaging in penny-stocks trading. He has a beautiful wife, a beautiful home, a beautiful car (not red but white) and endless amounts of cash in the bank. He can also have his way with just about any woman he desires, and he does, despite the fact he's married to a beautiful model who has family connections to English/British royalty. He seems to have it all, but it wasn't always this way. Time rewinds to the late 1980's when he was married to a different woman while renting an apartment in New York and gets his first position at a stock broker firm. There he meets Mark Hanna (Michael McConaughey) who explains the rules of the game: solitary vices, sex, and getting as much money as possible from clients. This firm sells respectful grade-A stocks to wealthy shareholders. Shortly thereafter, the firm busts as a result of the infamous ""Black Monday"" crash of 1987.<br/><br/>Belfort then becomes part of a firm trading in penny stocks, worthless low-trading stocks which may or may not have tremendous investment potential. He trades in a so-called ""boiler room"", a place usually in a low-rent district which sells penny and risky investments to lower-end investors. The one upside is brokers of penny stocks earn a 50% commission than the usual 1% offered at respected brokerage firms. Then an idea occurs to him: what if they can trick higher-end traders to buy the many penny stocks? They'll trade the high-end stocks to higher-income investors, gain their trust, and then manipulate them into buying thousands of shares of penny stocks, i.e. worthless investments.<br/><br/>Donnie Azoff (i.e. Danny Porush) played by Jonah Hill, a neighbor in Belfort's apartment complex asks to be in the business and eventually becomes an important partner in the firm. They rename it Stratton Oakmont Inc. to sound more official and legitimate. The firm grows as a result which leads to an exposé in Forbes Magazine where the article labels him ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". As the money grows, so does Belfort's desires for more money, more sex, and more Methaqualone, or Quaaludes. And so does his need to use more expletives in practically every other word he utters. The story forms an arc about how he keeps gaining more and more, climbing higher and higher, but simultaneously digging himself a deeper in which to take a huge fall.<br/><br/>So many of the Scorsese devices are present in this film: the voice-over (as mentioned), introductions and short biographies of the major characters, in this case those working at the firm, the height of the characters' successes, all leading towards the climax in which authorities eventually enter the picture. The entire form and arc of the story closely resembles ""Good Fellas"" and ""Casino"". I would almost rate the film a ""5"", but it gets a ""4"", not because of what it leaves out but for having too much other things. I thought the many sex scenes and endless expletives became overwhelming. They started to detract from the main thrust of the story. There were parts where I wanted to understand better their financial schemes and see less of the sex. Also, Belfort engages in many speeches to his traders, some of which were too long-winded. Whenever the characters enjoy a major success, there would be along speech followed by a huge party and orgy-fest with lots of explicit sex bordering on pornography. I think once or twice would have been plenty, but the parties and orgies are so numerous I lost count. Still a compelling film with an outstanding performance by DiCaprio and honorable mention to Jonah Hill."

","The Wolf of Wall Street is about the real life character Jordan Belfort who used to be a big Wall Street broker who engaged in illegal activities during the 80s and got himself arrested. The film is based on the book of the same name written by Belfort himself. Like Scarface, this film involves a character who comes from a humble background, a 'former member of the middle class'as he is called in the film, but who has huge ambitions and a relentlessly fierce vigour to become a big-shot and become rich. It is quite clear that under the circumstances that Jordan has grown up in, money is something that he views as a God and so when he arrives at Wall Street to work for his first brokerage firm, he feels a sense of fulfillment. Another film that I was really reminded of was 'Goodfellas'. A thematic connection between the two films can be made by one line from each film. In Goodfellas, Henry Hill says 'I always wanted to be a gangster' and in The Wolf of Wall Street, Belfort says 'I always wanted to be rich' and these two lines tell you everything that you need to know about these two characters.<br/><br/>However this film isn't really about Wall Street and the stock market. It is really about addiction and the perils of uncontrolled ambition. But like pretty much all of Scorsese's films, this is not at all preachy or melodramatic. Scorsese portrays the vulgar, obscene antics involving drugs and hookers and the unrestricted misogyny of Belfort and his partners in an unapologetic manner. Many people have complained about the fact that the style of storytelling is exaggerated, over-the-top, and extremely loud. But it is clear that this is intentionally so. The film about such obscenely undisciplined individuals has to be equally undisciplined and loud, because otherwise the whole point of effectively portraying the excessive nature of their actions gets lost. However Scorsese still uses some scenes to make us not empathise, but understand why these people feel the need to act like this. <br/><br/>When Belfort has the conversation with Mark Hanna, a senior partner of the firm that he starts to work for after arriving at Wall Street played by Matthew McConaughey, it is clear that he wasn't as hollow as he became later, but McConaughey's character acts like the character of Mephistopheles and gives him all the advice and tips which Belfort absorbs and ends up selling his soul to the devil. We also see Belfort himself then taking up the role of Mephistopheles and alluring others into this mad world of stock broking. <br/><br/>Although the film uses the concept of excess in a lot of ways, but Scorsese still manages to use some tender scenes to somehow humanise this character of Belfort who seems so inhuman, like the scene where Belfort shifts his focus to stealing from the rich instead of the poor because that was what his wife asked him to do, or the scene where we get to know why he hired an employee called Kimmie. Belfort was once a human, but he was seduced into this whole other world where he lost his humanity and became a greedy wolf who wanted nothing but money, drugs and sex.<br/><br/>Scorsese over the years has received a lot of stick from a section of audiences and critics for using very objectionable, unlikeable people as his protagonists. Although he enjoys exploring the worlds of these people and almost makes it fun to watch them live their lives doing questionable things, but he never shows people escaping the consequences of their actions. His films have a moral fibre attached to them that can be seen by going beneath the violence on the surface. I thought Belfort's fate was very similar to the fate of Jake LaMotta in 'Raging Bull'. Belfort's perseverance and ambition makes him successful and very rich, but his inability to control this ambition and his inability to control his multiple addictions leads to him losing all that he had and everything falls apart. Scorsese also makes a damning indictment of the US justice system by showing how you have a chance to get away with anything as long as your pockets are full.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street looks like a typically characteristic Martin Scorsese film. His unique style is all over the film- the tracking shots, the fast movement of the camera and the voice-over by DiCaprio. The film also has the characteristic fast editing by the regular Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker. The film is 3 hours long, but it feels much shorter due to the energy of the script. But having said that, I don't think the script is perfect like Goodfellas. There a few scenes here and there which could have been better written and some scenes could have been shorter.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio has never been funnier. He uses a lot of physical comedy in this role when he needs to, but also efficiently portrays the more sombre emotions. The speeches that he gives in the office meetings are absolutely mesmerising. He uses the microphone in those scenes like a rockstar and exudes limitless energy and charisma. Jonah Hill brilliantly plays an odd but fascinating character who becomes a partner in crime for Belfort. Margot Robbie also deserves praise for her performance. <br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is the kind of film that we have seen Martin Scorsese make before. He has explored these themes of greed and indiscipline and how it can destroy someone, but I'd much rather watch Scorsese repeating himself than another one of those pointless superhero films or those clichéd Hollywood romantic comedies."

The film is undoubtedly long, however, you manage to see all aspects of Belfort's life, from conning rival businesses to cheating on his wife with hundreds of prostitutes while trying to raise a child simultaneously. This manages to express the world of sheer excess of money, wealth, lifestyle and power that he eventually lives in. <br/><br/>Jordan admits that he has an awful drug habit, this is strongly shown in the film and there are also lots of graphic sex scenes. These may be seen as an element of excess, however, some viewers may find offensive. However, Scorsese uses his years of marvellous experience to use a clever technique in which he uses awkward editing sequences to depict a impression of realism, for example when Belfort is high, the editing is disjointed to try and create a realistic depiction. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is hugely successful and Leo deserved to win the Oscar. It is brilliantly entertaining and wild. One of the best and most exciting films I've seen in a long time."
"pendenquejohn","7","0","3","25 April 2015"," Quite good...
","I watched this movie with a friend for the first time and actually this is quite a funny one on a dramatic subject if you ask me. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting is quite brilliant throughout all the film. Margot Robbie though is quite reduced to 'invisibility' even if she did influence DiCaprio for the most in his life as a trader. Her dialogues were quite innocuous, short and reduced to the 'wife of' and in that sense I really didn't find her interesting. That said, she is really one beautiful sexy Australian. However, the overall actors were funny, witty and entertaining throughout and were not losing their thread as the movie kept going on. <br/><br/>It is actually quite difficult to judge the story in itself, since, at first it is based on the real life of certain traders and two on the difficulty of judging something for which you have assumptions but no real evidence of. In that sense, I was easy to blow this out of proportion but the movie was able to keep quite a sense of reality. Certain scenes however, hyperbolic, were completely unrealistic e.g. the sex scenes on the working place. <br/><br/>This film could be watched almost as an ex-trader giving an autobiography about the life in Finance, wall-street related to strong drug abuse, utilization as women as objects... since traders in real life do not talk about these kinds of subjects.<br/><br/>The movie though is 'desperately' long and does give the feeling that that you are losing the comedy side of it with time. After a moment me and my friend started watching our watches and telephones because we felt, as a natural reflex, that it was taking forever. Regardless, I really wanted to watch this film and was quite happy that I was able to see it."

","This literally is a perfect movie! Its absolutely hilarious in its own sick sadistic way that only Mr Scorsese knows how to capture in film. His narrative form of story telling really excels in this movie. In my opinion this is Scorsese's best movie. Better than Goodfellas and even better than Casino. The amount of drugs, profanity and sex in this movie surely isn't for everyone, but when you realize how well it goes with the story and just enjoy the story for what it is with an open mind you will then see the geniusness behind this film, it definitely leaves you asking yourself ""did this REALLY happen?"" but it all did. Watch documentaries and look up on Wikipedia ""Jordan Belfort"" and you will be amazed as to how accurate this movie is. A definite must see. Amazing from beginning to end."

After that, though the performances are great - DiCaprio demonstrating a surprising flair for slapstick - the whole thing seems to slip down a gear. Or Two.

"rbfazio","6","0","2","22 February 2015"," Good, not great
","Having just recently watched this film after hearing so many great things about it, I was left a little disappointed.<br/><br/>It started off great. A young guy who starts off with nothing and ends up becoming a multi-millionaire blah blah blah...don't get me wrong, there is some very motivational stuff in there but by the end of the movie it left me thinking one thing. This has been done before - I know it's a biography that is based on the famous Stockbroker Jordan Belfort, but did we really need this movie? There have been many ""Jordan Belfort's"" in past movies - Wall Street (both), Boiler Room and to some extent Glengarry Glen Ross that have very similar based characters.<br/><br/>The characters in the film were very good. Leo was great as usual, Jonah Hill also did a great job and I was very impressed with Margot Robbie (who played Jordan's wife Naomi) who with every scene almost stole the limelight from her much better known co stars.<br/><br/>I've always liked Leo as an actor, and I've always thought that he would become the next big mega-star, like a De Niro or a Pacino but I'm not so sure any more. There is one thing that keeps bugging me about him - he looks the same in every movie I can remember him in! (Apart from his earlier work of course.) I just saw Inception earlier in the week and although they are 2 completely different movies, he could have easily walked into each set without getting changed or fixing his hair! Then I also remembered The Great Gatsby etc etc. (I know there are other recent films that he doesn't look the same, but I'm just trying to make a point.)<br/><br/>This brings me to my final thought about the film. Matthew McConaughey, who played Stockbroker Mark Hanna at the start of the movie would have played a great (and I think better) Jordan Belfort than Leo. Although he wasn't in the movie for very long at all, his performance was outstanding, and to be honest I was left a little disappointed when he stopped featuring...<br/><br/>So, to sum up, good movie (not great), entertained throughout even if it did go for almost 3 hours, but it's been done before."

I thought the movie was very funny and interesting. I love how it really gets you in the mind of the characters as well as your own. What i mean is the whole time i was watching the movie all i kept thinking of is, if this where me what would i do with all that money? Or would it change me the way it did him? That it really got me thinking about it so i got hooked and started looking up jobs in stocks ha! Thats how you know you are really into a movie if you finish watching and all you start doing for the next hour or so is looking up ways to become a millionaire and do the things that they did. I searched so much crazy stuff after watching this movie that i had to clear the history so that anyone who used the computer after me didn't think i was crazy! Anyway, overall i loved the movie i think it was very well thought out !"
"Apologi","7","0","3","15 February 2015"," In this case it would have helped if Scorsese would have taken more artistic liberty in his interpretation
","I am a great fan on Scorsese's previous works depicting the rise and fall of a power hungry individual. I was expecting to see something like Casino and Goodfellas all again, but in the end was left disappointed. Granted, there were many similar pieces in the built-up of this picture. Some of the scenes were mind-blowing in style and energy. But the grand picture was missing. In the blu-ray extras Scorsese and the actors discuss the movie, and it may give an explanation for why I felt this is the case. It seems that Scorsese and DiCaprio went for a too documentary approach on the material. In the interviews the original book was described as not any great work of literature. Without having read it I can say that in my opinion this is reflected in the movie. There is a lot of flashy glitter on the surface, but deep moral questions remain untouched. In a sense, the movie does not have a heart. It just focuses on glitzy lifestyle and the persons remain empty. One cannot very well connect with them. In my opinion it would have helped, if one would have explored more of agent Denham's side of the story and his motivations. So, to sum up, great cinematography and great individual scenes do not make make up a good movie, if the grand plot is weak. This is, in my opinion, unfortunately the case with this movie. Scorsese should have taken a more active and independent approach on the source material instead of just trying to copy it on the silver screen."

Greed for money is above everything and you must do everything to get it, otherwise you can get a job on McDonalds, as it's said in the movie...<br/><br/>I liked the way Martin Scorsese directed this film, but I also agree with some people who say it's a bit long. 3 hours is a bit too much indeed, even to a story like that! But, on the other hand, I did enjoy the aggressive way he built the plot, with lots of explicit scenes of sex and drugs. I think he shows these worlds of corruption and greed in a hard but vibrating way, with great doses of enthusiasm I would say...

","I have a little bit reservation about the overt sexuality, which is the reason why I didn't rate this title more than 8/10, but the movie is overall very good. It is another high quality work by Martin Scorsese who had gained numerous acclaim in last several decades. Every scene is well crafted and deserves to be watched more than once. The acting is also brilliant, although not as outstanding as those in Dallas Buyers Club.My favorite thing about this movie is that it didn't teach us anything directly, but let us choose our own moral interpretation. Some audience may think it promote worship of money, but I find it inspiring me about the reality of fortune. Why did Jordan still live a good life after deceiving so many people and so much money? Yes, Jordan is a liar. A goddamn f**king liar! But the fact that most people fancy the money very bad provides the environment for such a goddamn liar. Even though Jordan quits his dirty business after serving in prison, he can still make a living easily with most of his techniques he used in the previous dirty business!"
"ekaneco","9","0","3","12 February 2015"," That's Scorcese from ""Mean Steets""
","Forget the nice Martin Scorcese from ""Hugo"". In ""Wolf of Wall Street"" it is the director of ""Mean Streets"" who is in charge, taking to the screens the shocking biography of Jordan Belfort, the stock market unethical ex-millionaire. The heavy revelations of his history have allowed Scorsese to be as daring as his creativity allows him.<br/><br/>The movie takes us by surprise with the abundant use of drugs and the constant presence of sex and orgies scenes, even not being explicit. Not to mention the filthy tactics used by Belfort to get rich. And it all happened in real life, which is astonishing.<br/><br/>So, Scorsese uses a whole bunch of resources, which fit the over the top life of the millionaire. Among them, we find voice over narration by the main character, image freeze, talking directly to the camera, slow motion, unexpected camera angles. For instance, we watch the character driving a red Ferrari and, suddenly, the narrator says that it was white–like-Don-Johnson's-one-in-Miami-Vice, and the car changes its color.<br/><br/>Jordan Belfort's actual talent was to be an amazing salesman. Therefore he made success starting to sell penny stocks, which payed him big commissions. The big issue is that he had learned from a former employer (played magnificently by Matthew McConaughey in a small part), in one of the best scenes of the movie, that he should not care if his client made money, the important thing was to sell and receive the commission. In the end, these unethical practices would lead him to FBI investigations and finally to his ruin.<br/><br/>""Wolf of Wall Street"" is flamboyant like the 1980's (great work of art direction) and especially the way Belfort lived. Played by Leonardo Dicaprio, longtime fellow of Scorsese in many productions, the character grows increasingly mad during the film. He leaves his nice looking wife (Cristin Milioti) for the knock-out call-girl Naomi (Margot Robbie), and dives into sex and drugs dependency. And endless greed.<br/><br/>If ""The Departed"" was acclaimed by critics and public and ""Wolf of Wall Street"" not that much, that can only be explained by the unpleasant subject of the latter. It is a dirty movie, but a brilliant one."

","The Wolf on Wall ST. is a movie about a man who survived. He started out his life as a pretty decent man, then he lost his job and with almost zero prospects, he ended up in the Penny Stocks business and from day one he was able to pull himself out of unemployment to having a constant job. The led character was labeled the Wolf. The movie was original in the sense of cinematic experience. The theme of the movie was pretty sordid - with ripping off others as the main element - but the lead character seemed to not have a clue to his defective character - and this actually made him a sympathetic character. I do not think that, for one minute, did he think that what he was doing was wrong. I believe he thought it was justified. Is this the zone of a sociopath, or just an ambitious human being - who seemed to be operating well in the cut-throat America. If he was at fault in his acting and thinking - whose fault would that be? The whole American culture? Is this not, in a way, the Jim Morrison gene? The gene of destructive- self destructive ultimately .... America - even though it often seems like a Dream - the City on the Hill - but actually America is probably the most cut-throat boom or bust country in the world in 2014 New York had 50 thousand homeless people - I believe that some of those individuals, if not all, where victims in one way or another of the boom or bust fast-paced commercial environment of America. In a way The Wolf on Wall St is like a modern day Western / Cowboy movie - only this time the protagonists and the villains seemed to have blurred roles. This movie is really a nightmare - but the way it is filmed - was mystifying and hence switched the nightmare into a kind of dream."

","Despite the fact that this movie was extremely long (three hours), and that it was filled with twist, turns and a lot of crash, I really liked the story overall and I really think that it was well written. <br/><br/>First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan (Belfort)in the movie; who is probably one of the best actors in the industry as far as I'm concerned really showcase his talent as a public speaker. His energy through the entire movie doesn't matter if it was under the influence of drugs, really transferred and passed through the audience. You just felt re- energized by listening to what he had to say. The movie in a way had a really great sense of humor in the person of (Jonah hill) who was Jordan main partner in the scenery. Honestly, even though it wasn't the best way of portraying success by showcasing corruption, sex and drugs, the moral of the movie was that it didn't really matter how your path of success looked like, as long as you believed in yourself and those around you, it was possible to make it happen.<br/><br/>Therefore, I also think that there were another moral in that story. which was, money can not guarantee happiness and that we saw it towards the end when the entire empire that Jordan created collapse with his wife wanting to divorce, the lost of some of his business partner and some friends and for most, him going to jail. My only regret is that they could have get rid of the language used (vulgar) and some of the drugs and sex scene, and it would have probably be even better and accessible for a larger audience."
"D_Burke","8","0","2","4 February 2015"," ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" Smiles, But Shows No Teeth
","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is tremendously entertaining. When watching this movie in a theater, and you resist using the bathroom even after imbibing a medium Cherry Coke, you know it is the sign of exceptional storytelling.<br/><br/>This movie's narrative structure is similar to ""Goodfellas"" (1990) and ""Boogie Nights"" (1997) in that the first half of the film is fun to watch as you witness the rise of the antihero protagonist and the supporting players. Especially if you greatly dislike the protagonist and resent his rise to power, if the second half is hard to watch, you know you are seeing something good.<br/><br/>However, although the story arc is similar, it's not quite as great as the aforementioned films. Granted you witness great acting from almost everyone involved, and eye-opening moments.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie never got past the excesses and to the true consequences of the protagonist's actions. Even then, the movie seemed to be mostly preoccupied with the high lives these stock-brokers were living, and virtually ignored the lives they ruined on their way to the top.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is Jordan Belfort, an ambitious man who takes a job as a stockbroker on Wall Street. Unfortunately, despite having a dynamic mentor (played by a superb, scene-stealing Matthew McConaughey), it is 1987, and the stock market takes a plunge that puts him of work.<br/><br/>Soon afterwords, he takes a modest job in a boiler room selling penny stocks. It turns out that Belfort is not just good at selling these worthless intangibles: he's great at it.<br/><br/>Eventually, he starts his own company with shady children's furniture salesman Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) and other compatriots from the boiler room, where they employ the pump and dump scam to their advantage. When they amass enough money, they begin to give their firm a respectable name, Stratton Oakmont, and make money hand over fist using the same marauding techniques, only on a larger scale.<br/><br/>I'll be the first to admit that stock trading and the tribulations of Wall Street are very foreign to me. If I see a movie like ""Wall Street"", I don't know what the numbers scrolling across the NYSE mean. I could only rely on the faces of Michael Douglass or Charlie Sheen to know if the overall news was good or not.<br/><br/>To the film's credit, I could understand how Stratton Oakmont amassed their wealth. I can also understand the illegality of their trade, and I'm certain that most audience members with no Wall Street familiarity will not be lost.<br/><br/>Even if one hates these people for their avarice, and the immoral and reprehensible lives that they lead as a result of their accumulated fortune, one cannot deny how entertaining it is to watch these shenanigans. Their charades may not be appealing, especially when the Securities and Exchange Commission begins to take note of their activities, but they are still engrossing.<br/><br/>However, the party lasts a little too long at a running time of 180 minutes. This movie could have easily been cut back 40 minutes by taking out a party scene or two. Another scene where Belfort meets with corrupt Swiss banker Jean-Jacques Saurel (Jean Dujardin) could also have been shortened significantly.<br/><br/>Plus, with these people living so high off their riches, it is impossible to believe that no one got hurt financially in the process. Belfort lived the high life (both figuratively because of his wealth, and literally because of his excessive drug use), but there had to have been lives that were ruined because of his schemes.<br/><br/>Still, as far as acting goes, DiCaprio himself owns this film, and it definitely is among his best performances. His breaking the fourth wall is done enough so that it is not redundant, and his motivational speeches to his firm members are incredibly over-the-top, but appropriately so given his character.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill was decent as Belfort's right hand man, although his performance sometimes became a little too comically inappropriate, as if he was playing the fat guy who falls on his face the same way he has done in lesser comedies (excluding ""Superbad"" (2007) and ""21 Jump Street""). However, the scene where he nearly chokes to death when high on Quaalude was scary for me to watch.<br/><br/>That same scene, where Belfort is also dramatically debilitated from the same kind of Quaalude, received some laughs from the audience in my theater, but I didn't find the scene funny at all. It was one of the most memorable drug scenes I've seen in a mainstream movie, but like Uma Thurman's heroin overdose moment in ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), and Julianne Moore's hyper, heartbreaking, high-on-cocaine ""too many things"" scene in ""Boogie Nights"" (1997), it made me never want to try drugs.<br/><br/>On top of stand-out performances by Margot Robbie as Belfort's trophy wife, Rob Reiner as Belfort's profane and no-nonsense father, and McConaughey's brief but memorable role, the ensemble cast succeeded for the most part in making greed look ugly. When the firm hits their chests and chant an innocuous but catchy quasi-tribal tune, they make true fools out of themselves, but are too busy conforming to care.<br/><br/>While ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a memorable movie, it doesn't quite reach the emotional depths of director Martin Scorsese's previous movies like ""Raging Bull"" or ""Goodfellas"". In the latter film, when Henry Hill's life takes a turn for the worst, you can feel him crash and burn.<br/><br/>Here, Jordan Belfort eventually falls, but appears to hit a bed of roses. He story ends with consequences, but he just ends up not as wealthy as he used to be.<br/><br/>This movie leaves with the implication that Belfort lived his high life so well that the tab he had to pay wasn't all that steep. Somebody had to pay the rest of that bill, and probably did, but you wouldn't know it from seeing it here."
"cherold","9","0","3","28 January 2015"," Great movie with a fantastic performance by DiCaprio
","This is a terrifically fun movie. Martin Scorcese offers pitch perfect direction in which nothing is just for show even though for the title character, everything is for show. Jonah Hill is surprisingly good as a jittery stockbroker, although it's hard to believe the guy on which he was based was that odd.<br/><br/>Above everything else there is an absolutely amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. He is clearly taking great delight in portraying the psychopathic fabulist who build wall street firm out of a bunch of penny-ante drug dealers. Of particular note is a wonderful sequence where he attempts to function in a state of complete drug-induced collapse. He is funny, charming, and disturbing.<br/><br/>This is essentially one of Scorcese's crime dramas, albeit with less violent criminals. Here the bad guys get on the covers of financial magazines, and when they go to jail, it's at cushy white-collar prisons where they play tennis all day. <br/><br/>The culture and the people and the lifestyle horrify me, yet I'm sure many will look at a life of hookers, blow, and stealing everything that isn't nailed down and imagining that life for themselves. That's the sad thing about this movie; for some people it's pretty much the American dream."

","The Wolf of Wall Street is such a crazy, dynamic movie based on the true happenings of Jordan Belfort, a rich, drug-happy Wall Street investor who essentially defrauded everyone on Wall Street. Scorcese is known for taking films to another level, and he certainly does that here. The 3- hour film flies by with the drugs, booze, and more drugs as we see how corrupt Wall Street can be. This is Scorcese's craziest film to date, and that is surprising with his impressive filmography. <br/><br/>Martin Scorcese's film is about the events that landed Jordan Belfort in prison for thirty-six months for investment fraud. Rising from the humble beginnings of a penny investor, he moves his way up the ladder using not so legal methods as he is aided from the help of drugs, women, and alcohol. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio made have provided his best acting performance to date, which is impressive with his resume. He looked like he really had fun and he gave us one with no strings attached. The opening scene with him though is impressive with the little help of cocaine. Jonah Hill gave a fine performance as Jordan's drug-addicted, right-hand man. Matthew McConaughey had a brief, but excellent performance giving Jordan the workings of Wall Street. Finally, a star was born in Margot Robbie. She is just a goddess acting as Jordan's second wife. It helps that she is very pretty as well. <br/><br/>Overall, The Wolf of Wall Street is another excellent film to add in the resumes of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorcese. It also may be their most fun and craziest film to date. It's a very long film, but the length doesn't that bad because the film is stocked with so many interesting points. As a film based on Wall Street, only the 1987 film ""Wall Street"" may exceed this film in quality, although the tone of both films are sharply different. This film is a fun ride and part of me wish that Leo finally won the Oscar he deserves, but maybe next time. I rate this film 9/10."

Three hours running time and not even any second is in excess, everything goes so smoothly you wonder how can people make boring one-hour and a half running time movie but yet here is a master in the possession of all his means.

""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a fast paced adventure into excess riding on the backs of others' money.

I felt no remorse for this arrogant narcissist and enjoyed watching the collapse of his world around him. Jonah Hill, what can I say? Not a huge fan regarding his earlier works, but very impressed now. His portrayal of Donnie Azoff was chillingly spot-on.

The fat and skittish Jonah Hill is hilarious. Jon Bernthal wears an awesome mustache as one of Leonardo's criminal friends and he is not in the movie nearly enough. Margot Robbie who plays Leonadro's new wife is actually a good actress and there is depth to her character but it looks like the movie is well aware of what her role is in this movie: eye candy.<br/><br/>The writing is absolutely amazing both in terms of humour and the portraying of the selfishness and pride of the main character. The dialogue is pretty good but the humour is in the acting and the visual presentation rather than just jokes.<br/><br/>This movie looks good, in part due to all the sides of the rich life, including all the boobs, but also due to how the scenes are structured, the cuts and flash backs.<br/><br/>The crazy does get a little old. This movie has many inventive and fun looking scenes, but the over-saturated gang-bang drug-induced scenes get old after the third time you see them and lose their effect. Also, seeing how much drugs the main character takes, it is clear that this film takes creative license with the realities of drug abuse.<br/><br/>I do not have a whole lot to say about this film because I was having too much fun watching Leonardo Di'Caprio chew this movie to analyze the details.

The time: I thought that a three hour movie would be a full three hours of ""must haves."" Surely the film editors would have cut it down more if each minute wasn't entirely necessarily, right? Wrong. I mean, all in all it was a very well put together film. Mind blowing to know it is based on reality. But three hours? This was no Gone with the Wind. I mean, I wish at least an hour of it was Gone with the Wind, if you know what I mean. <br/><br/>3. The plot: Okay, so we have to have some leniency since it IS based on reality and all, but I thought the high points were somewhat difficult to spot. Perhaps because the entire film was like watching a very illegal party, in which you have no idea what to focus on, but it seemed to wrap up nicely with the pen idea, even though that too was anti-climatic. I was expected a grander finale, I suppose. <br/><br/>4. The language: I'm not the type of person to be too easily offended, but the language in the film was so plentiful, It feels like the swear word ratio is significantly higher than it needed to be. We get it, they're materialistic, self- serving, assholes. <br/><br/>5. DiCaprio: Okay, I know I already mentioned him in #1, but you have to give this man props. If I were to recommend this film, it would be for this guy. <br/><br/>6. Overall: It was entertaining. Not the best movie I have ever seen, but I feel it was well done. Could have easily ended in 2 1/2 hours, and maybe even 1 hour and 45 minutes though. Just saying. <br/><br/>If I had to describe the film with an analogy, it would be a like watching train wreck. A very beautiful, expensive train wreck. One so horrible, you can't bare to look...but you look anyways, because amongst the chaos is beauty. The destruction is a sad tragedy you cannot look away from. It's the Lana Del Ray song of movies."

","Power, drugs, excess, debauchery, criminality, downfall, backstabbing, ruin, and the moral of the story is that when the party's over, you cash in your chips and sell everyone out to keep out of jail, and spend the rest of your days suffering the misfortune of being ordinary, as if that's a worthy punishment for being criminally despicable.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? That's because I just described the same tale told in Scorsese's far superior Goodfellas, over 20 years earlier. At least in that film you have the stigma of the Mafia, a culture which it captures with pinpoint accuracy. In this one you just have one self-aggrandizing twit's personal recounting of his life, slathered with what felt to me like generous amounts of exaggeration and outright bullshit.<br/><br/>Go watch American Hustle instead. The acting, which is the saving grace of this film, is just as good in that one. Marty should know better than to retread the same turf. Just because it's not a mafia movie doesn't mean it's not rehash. I expect better from him than Tarantino."

","I admit to having cackled outloud at several points in this movie, so it was definitely good for a laugh. Was it a great film? No, it was *very* derivative of Goodfellas: the tone, the direct narration of the central protagonist, the problematic (making the viewer sympathize with a loser criminal, etc.). <br/><br/>Many people have complained about the graphic and in some cases repulsive sex scenes in this movie, but I believe that the director was attempting to convey a reality of which most people are ignorant. Having watched Enron: The smartest guys in the room (which is a documentary, but very well done), I gather that the pervasive use of prostitution and drugs on Wall Street is no joke. Still, the opening seemed a bit gratuitous, and I imagine that it probably drove some theater-goers away.<br/><br/>To be honest, I did not know that the main character here was a real person (again, same as with Goodfellas--Henry Hill was/is (not sure whether he is still alive...) a real person) I actually felt that The Wolf of Wall Street story paralleled the Enron story and that the main character was intended to be a fictionalized version of the former CEO of Enron. <br/><br/>In some ways, this movie reminded me also of Animal House, what with the frat boy vibe and superficiality throughout. The sophomoric behavior of the traders and the scathing critique of the entire stockbroking profession are bound to upset some people. My half-brother happens to be a stockbroker. Is this what he does? Really???? <br/><br/>All in all, The Wolf of Wall Street was somewhat entertaining and did shine a light on an unscrupulous group of greedy degenerates. Are stockbrokers always like this? Let us hope not, but Scorsese obviously does not think very highly of their profession. No harm done--and I did laugh-- but I will not watch this three-hour movie again."

No wonder the film was independently funded. Which mainstream studio would want this product? But director Martin Scorsese, now in his 70s, has given us another powerhouse of a movie. It was nominated for five Academy Awards although it did not win any.<br/><br/>Set over no less than three hours, this is the true-life story of American stockbroker Jordan Belfort and based on his memoirs of the same name. Leonardo di Caprio, in his fifth collaboration with Scorsese, gives a storming performance in the eponymous role with some wonderful 'inspirational' speeches. The impressive cast-list includes Matthew McConaughey and Jonah Hill as fellow money-men and Margot Robbie as Belfort's second wife, while cameo roles include Rob Reiner, Joanna Lumley and even - in the final moments - Belfort himself.<br/><br/>This is a black comedy which lampoons both the acquisition and experience of being rich. It could be argued that the film is moral in that it records the reality that Belfort served 22 months in federal prison for a ""pump and dump"" scheme that led to investor losses of approximately $200 million. But ultimately I was saddened by the movie because it represents the perpetrators of this huge scandal as amiable buffoons rather than ruthless crooks and it has nothing to say about the misery suffered by so many gullible, small-time investors."

The film doesn't show the victims of the scams so gives an incomplete picture. It humanizes the characters in Big Business and to some extent makes villains of the Government agency characters although in my opinion both Finance and Government as a whole exploit large sections of the population in their own ways BUT are good to their own (people ""in the loop""), or external parties when it is beneficial to their interests! Aside from that - it's a great film, well shot, a colorful cast of characters with a fair share of hilarious moments. I've given it a high score for entertainment value and the themes explored."

","I am sorry to say that Scorsese finally made a terrible mistake. He went ahead and made a remake of his two previous masterpieces, Goodfellas and Casino and sort of made fun of himself, which could have worked, but comes awfully close to failing. Explanation: The movie has very little to say, other than there are people who think it's fun to be bad guys.<br/><br/>Let me also point out that although the movie feels like a Scorsese movie, there is not that immediate sense of emotions that you almost always get from a Scorsese film. Here it almost feels like Scorsese is saying, well I finally won on Oscar, so to hell with all you. The movie almost feels like a big wind up with no release.<br/><br/>There is an appalling amount of scenes that go on forever until I finally said to myself, enough already. It starts almost at the beginning, where we are introduced to Matt Mcconaughey. It's an inspired bit of casting and you have got to admire him for sending himself up as really weird. But as the scene goes on it, it goes on and on. Another one is where DiCaprio is giving his pep talk. It reminds me of the speech from Glengarry Glen Ross, just stretched out endlessly.<br/><br/>But enough. I don't want to trash Scorsese, because he is the most influential filmmaker in the world. Let me put it this way: Nice try, but you have to make a story that's different the next time."

","Poor ol' Leo, what does he have to do to get his Oscar? Here he teams up (yet again) with Martin Scorsese to play the real life (well, Hollywood adapted) tale of Jordan Belfont – a New York stock broker of dubious morales – who lives life in the fast lane (and swears a lot).<br/><br/>If you like Leo and/or Scorsese then this is for you. It's an exercise in excess. From its excessive foul language to its excessive nudity and even its excessive (three hour) run-time – everything here is over the top. And it's pretty good.<br/><br/>Scorsese does what he has been doing best lately, i.e. getting a good performance out of Leo and piles on his trademark monologues and tracking shots, while filming grown men behaving *very* badly. Leo seems to be on overdrive and cranks up his acting to the max, screaming, shouting and generally working himself up into a manic frenzy. Both of which are pretty fun to watch.<br/><br/>If you want to know what 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is like, think the characters from America Psycho and put them in the setting of 'Wall Street' and add the foul language from Goodfellas then you're sort of in the right area.<br/><br/>It's pretty entertaining. You may not like all the characters (in fact you probably won't even like a single one), but you'll probably enjoy watching them fall from grace with a bump. Just as long as you can tolerate the shouting, the drug-taking and the nudity then you'll get something out of this.<br/><br/>My only complaint was the length. Yes, three hours was a little too long in my opinion (apparently it had been trimmed down from FOUR hours!); I felt a few of the scenes had been dragged out a little too long and a little more ruthless editing might have been in order.

","You never know just how much you missed someone until they come knocking on your door. And with The Wolf of Wall Street, Martin Scorsese bulldozes his way through your living room and tears down your house in a shower of dust, debris and Quaaludes. Yeah, lots and lots of Quaaludes. There were groans when Marty announced that his next project would be bringing the book The Wolf of Wall Street to life after being offered it to him by Leonardo Di Caprio. What about his passion project Silence? The Sinatra biopic? Or the long-awaited The Irishman? They seemed so much more interesting than spending two years developing a story that not many people really care or know about. However, it was new. It was a crime film. It was Scorsese. So I was interested. After IMDBing the film for month with the news that 'the mob' would play a heavy part in this story of corruption and greed, I was a little confused by the first trailer. It shows the stars going crazy with sex, drugs and poolside parties. Then the movie's online description changed – 'The mob' description had been moved and the film was now also billed as a comedy. Huh? But I was expecting gangsters in suits and FBI corruption. This mindset did tarnish my first viewing of the film slightly and though I do think TWOWS does have flaws repeated viewings showed me that this film is quite simplybrilliant. Let's start with the cast. As per usual with Scorsese his most questionable casting decisions often turn out to be the best. Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie are excellent. They were really superb. As was Matthew Mcantspellhisname's cameo and the rest of the supporting cast. They all had a real drive of ecstasy that was essential to the tone of the film. I wouldn't be surprised if half of them were on ecstasy while filming. It's like everyone is in on some kind of inside joke with all the tongue-in-cheek performances. The start of the show is of course Leonardo Di Caprio. He is fuelled with so much energy in this and plays off wonderfully with Hill and Robbie. I've never been Di Caprio's biggest fan, and my main criticism of him has usually been a failure to actually become the character. For example, take Scorsese's previous collaborator – Robert De Niro. In his prime he was in films like Taxi Driver, where you don't see Robert De Niro, you see Travis Bickle. The same with Raging Bull – He is Jake LaMotta. In Casino – Sam Rothstein. Heat – Neil McCauley. Once Upon a Time in America – Noodles. And so on and so forth. Back to Di Caprio, and when I watch Shutter Island I only see Di Caprio acting, not Teddy Daniels being. In The Departed, I see Di Caprio acting. In Gangs of New York – Di Caprio. Inception – Di Caprio. Titanic – Di Caprio. There have been some stand-outs such as Blood Diamond, but overall I've never been too impressed with him. However, with the release of Django Unchained and The Wolf of Wall Street he seems to be having more fun than before where he always took serious and moody roles. I've found his performances much more favorable in these and though I still don't think he channeled Jordan Belford, this is the best performance of his career. And anyway, who says the character on screen has to mirror all characteristics from the person on whom it is based?<br/><br/>Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/movie-review- the-wolf-of-wall-street/"
"jimbo-53-186511","6","0","1","24 August 2014"," Starts out with a bang, but seems to misfire somewhat after the first 20 minutes
","The Wolf of Wall Street starts off strongly; we immediately get an insight into what becomes of Jordan Belfort's life once he hits the big time - the start of the film was entertaining, exciting and fast paced. The early scenes where Jordan makes his first steps into becoming a broker with McConaughey were great - again these scenes were fast paced coupled with sharp dialogue and I felt that the film was progressing nicely. The film started to lose momentum once Jordan decides to go it alone. I'll attempt to explain some of the problems that I have with this film; <br/><br/>This film clocks in at nearly 3 hours long and the problem was that at times it felt longer. If you're really engrossed in a film then 3 hours will fly by, but that's not the case with this film. The film seemed to be very repetitive (numerous scenes involving drug taking, sex, profanity). I've got nothing against any of these things, but when they seem to become a forerunner for the film at the expense of both plot development and character development it does become a bit worrying. To me, it seemed a lot of the times that everything involving Belfort's character was over-done (how many times do we need to see him wasted? How many times do we need to see him pop pills, take drugs etc). It was interesting at first in order to understand his gradual descent from hero to zero, but again it became repetitive and just seemed to act as 'filler' for the already over-long running time.<br/><br/>There were things I liked about this film; first thing is that it's very stylish. Scorsese has a gift for making films his own - he has his own style and had I not known anything about this film before I started watching it I'd have been pretty certain that it was a Scorsese vehicle. The editing, directing, and music were all top notch.<br/><br/>What really saves this film is the acting and full marks go to DiCaprio, Hill and the gorgeous Margot Robbie. Hill and DiCaprio were perhaps a little over the top at times, but I'd rather that actors put too much effort in rather than too little. Another big factor working in favour of this film is that despite its misgivings it is at least entertaining and wasn't boring (I only looked at the time once during this film and for me watching a 3 hour film that isn't bad).<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is a good film where it's only real faults are in its somewhat repetitive nature, it's over-long running time, and it's also a bit thin on character development. However, if you're a fan of Scorsese's earlier films like Goodfellas or Casino then you'll probably enjoy this film. If you're not a Scorsese fan or a fan of the aforementioned films then this film is unlikely to change your opinion."

","The overall storytelling was entertaining yet heavy handed. The overuse of the f-bomb was funny for about the first ten minutes of the movie and just became plain juvenile. Leonardo Dicaprio did a phenomenal job at playing a chrematomaniac, however the movie was overshadowed by many jump cuts to scenes depicting drug use and sexual acts. While I'm aware that this was essential to the story line, they could have been integrated more smoothly into the plot line, instead of seeming as intrusive as they were. The movie was not as funny as I anticipated and had some very ""dry humor"" to put it lightly. Basically you'd have to be doped up on drugs yourself to laugh at some of the pathetic attempts of comedic relief they provided. Besides the for mentioned the movie's production quality was for the most part well done and aspects such as: character development, camera angles, screenplay, and quality seemed overall a plus and both director and cast/crew should be proud. I DO NOT recommend this movie to people under 17 or over the age of 53, and or light hearted church folk."

It doesn't try and teach you anything, it just concentrates on his life which is a good thing.<br/><br/>Jordan is not a very nice man, but I can understand why people wanted to be around him. He looked after his friends well, but he also dragged them down with him. Sometimes he did a nice thing and his heart was in the rig place, but other times he was as mean as they come.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was good, but it dragged on too long.

You see, accidentally or deliberately, it pulls the strange trick of making me enjoy it while simultaneously making me feel bad for enjoying it.<br/><br/>Like many Scorsese films (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Aviator), The Wolf of Wall Street is a deftly drawn portrait of an exceptional character, who faces pressures and trials very different to those of everyday people, and reacts in ways no ordinary person would. Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is uniquely driven, but he is also self-centred, greedy, shallow and essentially immoral. As played by DiCaprio, he also has enormous reserves of charisma.<br/><br/>The film follows the essential plot of Goodfellas, charting Belfort's rise and fall. He does abhorrent things to gain success, enjoys that success, and eventually has his comeuppance. Part of me hated him and delighted in his downfall, but another part was drawn in by his personal magnetism, and I found that my gut reaction was to smile when he did well, and be unhappy when he did badly. I was slightly angry with myself for siding with this monster against his victims, and slightly angry with Scorsese and DiCaprio for making me feel this way, no matter how subtly and impressively it was that they did so. I left the cinema feeling a little bit soiled.<br/><br/>For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk"

You shouldn't of course read Jordan's bio from other sources because that would ruin part of the satisfaction from the movie.<br/><br/>There is not much to be expected from this movie unless you watch it without reading any summaries or maybe reviews because it makes the plot predictable and probably you will know what is going to happen but not exactly in detail so that's what this movie delivers to it's viewers - a detailed story. This reminded me a lot of the movie The Social Network where we see how Facebook has been created and things get rough there too, we already know sorta what's happened but we need to see it in details, to zoom in the story and get acknowledged.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this movie has a comedy genre included. There were many funny moments which literally made me laugh out loud but most of them were inappropriate for young people due to their sexual content. Naked hot girls(LITERALLY COMPLETELY NAKED), boobs, a lot of filthiness and obscene words..like seriously Di Caprio's every third word was f**king but that did not make the screenplay cheesy - contrary. But those funny moments had some tension. Sometimes I just wanted to skip a scene because it seemed too boring or filled with redundant tension.<br/><br/>The acting - perfect. Every actor did a cool play out there especially Di Caprio. His character was very impulsive and he played it fantastically. Sadly he didn't get Oscar again..FILTHY ACADEMY! I mean...Titanic received 13 Oscars and Di Caprio as the main role did not receive any. Inception received 4 Oscars but they missed Leonardo's outstanding performance again. Blood Diamond, Catch me if you can were similar - award winning while the fantastic main role actor got NOMINATED WOW.<br/><br/>In every biographic movie there is big progress and change in the main character and that appeared here as well. From poor but ambitious young lad to the king of stocks and trades. This movie also shows well how cocaine, drugs, sex and alcohol addiction can affect somebody overall which is a lesson for young people. The drama in this movie wasn't skipped. There were some strong moments and I liked the synergy between the actors. This movie is 3 hours long and I'm not sure if it was good enough for such a long movie.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a funny bio of Jordan Belfort with a lot of sex and drug scenes plus alcohol, some of them were odd but still made me laugh and have a good time, it had some drama in it, tension and the story was well presented. At moments I got bored/frustrated and wanted to skip some scenes. Di Caprio, as always, was brilliant and the writers drove an amazing screenplay for the brokers.<br/><br/>Acting - Outstanding 10/10 Plot - Predictable because it's a bio but Jordan's bio is very interesting 7/10 Screenplay - Brilliant, driven well and the brokers had amazing speeches 10/10 Presentation - Well done but there were some scenes which bored me or had odd tension which made me skip them 8/10<br/><br/>Gave it an 8/10 at average. Thanks for reading!"

","The Wolf of Wall Street. Leo DiCaprio as the main character of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who conned his way into being one of the most successful brokers in Wall Street... illegally. The movie is full of nudity and obscenity, they show buttocks, women breasts, sex, or a combination of those almost every 5 minutes of the whole 3 hours of the movie... wew.<br/><br/>In an overall neutral standpoint, I give it a 7 out of 10 score. The story streams itself in an irregular way by starting jumping (and humping, literally) on to the time when Jordan is on his prime, then slings back on to the time when Jordan's just beginning to tip his toes on Wall Street.<br/><br/>The narration is backed well by the monologues that Leo's Jordan reads directly to the camera addressing the viewers. With the words choices such as those, I'm sure they'll crack some laughs on the audiences. The buildup of the story is nice, it really made good use of the 3 hour duration to develop the characters, even the supporting characters like Jonah Hill's Donnie and others like Brad and even Rugrat Nicky.<br/><br/>But especially, Leo succeeded in building Jordan Belfort's character that I myself even believe that I don't have to read the book on which the movie was based to get to know the real Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, but the way I see it, the gimmick ""sell me this pen"" may come from the book, and may be the only closest thing one can take home as a sales lesson from this movie. Also, I was curious on why did Matt McConaughy only get a part that lasted for only 1/6th of the movie. Matt was great in this movie. He went total on it by shaping his body way thinner to portray the addiction.<br/><br/>The rest of the 3 hour was story buildup and a lot of comedy. The scenes of ""cerebral palsy phase, the flight to Switzerland, and Donie's ""she's perfect"" scene was all hilarious comedies that also builds the story well. There is drama in the movie, but it is very clear that Director Martin Scorcese and Co-Producer Leo DiCaptio were not intending those to be a heavily emphasized points in the movie. The divorces, persecution, and jail time was only a brief silent moment compared to the rest of the whacked-out serotonin-dosed movie.<br/><br/>In the end, for me the movie was good overall, but it doesn't really deliver anything more than a wacky dose of entertainment. It does really prove Leo can handle wacky comedy too beside his usual action or thriller."

","If you are so familiar with Scorsese's works, you would be aware that he always attempted to bring out great movie for each decade. In the 70s, he gave us Taxi Driver, the flawless masterpiece Raging Bull in the 80s, Goodfellas in the 90s and The Departed in the 2000s. Could The Wolf of Wall Street be possibly his own movie classic of this decade? Or would it be Hugo? I cannot exactly decide, both are inarguably great cinemas. But nonetheless, ""Wolf"" is top notch – well directed, well written, well-acted, well edited and on top of all that, it is a story well told. Come on, take this ride. It is a lengthy movie which runs for three hours, but it will never tire or bore you out for the tiniest bit, and you have to witness the irresistible fun that Scorsese has for us through ""Wolf"", and what could I say? Scorsese has done it again.<br/><br/>""Wolf"" tells a story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), basically depicting the rise and fall of him, which involves crime, corruption and the federal government. DiCaprio is in his top form here. His energy, his charisma, his charm, all tells a story of an awfully fantastic acting performance. Is this Dicaprio's best performance thus far? Probably. But still, despite being swaggy, 'dicky' and everything, I thought his performance is only near-perfect, but not perfect. In my humble opinion, Dicaprio's work for Wolf is not the best of the year. Chiwetel Ejiofor or Matthew McConaughey delivered better performance for 12 Years a Slave or Dallas Buyers Club respectively.<br/><br/>""Wolf"" also pictures an impressive performance by Jonah Hill. Jonah plays Donnie Azoff, who is Belfort's right hand man and also his closest friend. It is pretty comical, that his presence in the film reminded me of Joe Pesci. Jonah never opted for Pesci's acting style, absolutely, but such recollection could be placed on the fact that ""Wolf"" is a Scorsese's picture. Australian actress Margot Robbie wonderfully played Belfort's wife, Naomi the duchess. Her thick accent, her energy, her anger, have charm and sense of realism all around. McConaughy and Dujardin too play their parts very well, despite having a short period of screen-time.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Terrence Winter is buzzing like that deadliest bee ever alive and too crazily energetic. Boom! Boom! Boom! All bred from its awesomeness, it never stops. Packed with fun and also funny, funky, clunky, and above all, unnatural.<br/><br/>""Wolf"" is one of the most controversial movies of the year, or possibly of all time. I find it disturbing that some labelled ""Wolf"" as ""doesn't pass the morality test"" or ""A celebration of villainy or immoral behavior"". I was like: Seriously, not even close! I am so positive that this group of people has failed to discover the bigger picture of ""Wolf"", and have miserably missed out the aspects that Scorsese is trying to portray through ""Wolf"". I humbly believe that it is more of a denunciation, instead of a celebration, and corruption, greed and lies, all lead to one ultimate outcome: downfall.<br/><br/>""Wolf"" is brave, competent and provocative. Scorsese is 71 in age, but what he has had pull out here is an amazing feat. Any other directors would have easily messed out ""Wolf"", and Scorsese's exploitation and exploration of ""Wolf"" is so fascinating and spot-on. All this shows his love and dedication for movies, he hits the jackpot again, but this time with a wolf, The Wolf of Wall Street.<br/><br/>Score: 3/4<br/><br/>(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)"

","Some films leave an aftertaste. The aftertaste from The Wolf of Wall Street (besides how much fun the crew must have had trying to keep a straight face during some of Leonardo's antics...) is the frank exposure of the pure sham behind the entire stock market scene. How truly shallow is the American dream? How freely will business ""friends"" betray each others' well being and personal trust? How empty is the greedy search for material wealth regardless of the social or environmental costs? Martin Scorsese scores 100% for the riveting portrayal of how a sheep of a man, an uninitiated adolescent, was hiding in a wolf's clothing, and how the model is envied by shallow men throughout the world, fooling them perhaps all the way to their graves. Thank you Martin. Thank you Leonardo. For the wake up call. Makes me want to invent an entirely new and different culture to live in..."

","When this film starts, we immediately taken back to the ending of ""Goodfellas"". Our lead character in monologue turns to the camera and talks to us. Those last 25 minutes were chaotic, choppy in editing, and simply a drawn out non-explanation of ""what went down"". I stated that Scorsese can't stop himself from biting off too much and that describes much of The Wolf Of Wall Street. Our screen relationship with our lead is also a bit dishonest as with ""Shutter Island"" where we meet another inmate at the facility but later find out that never happened, much like our 1 mile ride home in the white Lambourgini. A good nod on the change of color on the original discussion but we're all over the place here. We are left unfulfilled at the end of how to view our lead as hero or villain, ala ""Taxi Driver"" and with no real commentary on that. We also have a ton of over the top nudity while of the actual crimes committed we are told we don't care about how Wall Street works. Is this a biography, a thought piece, an action adventure? I wonder how Marty would answer. As far as Leo, his movies are always entertaining and usually educational in shedding light on subjects we may be unaware of. I wanted to know more am=nd am disappointed at a great opportunity lost. Ten minutes less debauchery (which you could easily cut without losing your perspective) and ten minutes more on the genius of the individual thinking outside the box, ""not selling stocks but selling pencils"" could have elevated this film. We have an FBI Investigator on the edge of learning his take after it all goes down, but we see him still in the subway looking at blank faces.... one would have been mine... what did you learn as the audiences' perspective?"

","I heard good things about this movie and while I did enjoy TWOWS, it did lack a proper story and also, character development. I could sum the film up in two words: cocaine and sex. I feel that the film could have been more about the actual stock market and how Jason actually manages to build Stratton up, rather than watch him and Donny (Jonah Hill) sniff cocaine and have sex with hookers. Although this was funny, it began to grow stale and predictable. De Nerio is very good as always it must be said; much better than Inception. Overall I recommend that you do watch TWOWS but don't be brainwashed by the fact that it's in the IMDb top 250."
"targa9","5","0","3","31 May 2014"," One long, vulgar, celebration of Macho Hucksterism
","I just saw and was quite disappointed in Scorsese's latest. In short, it was just one long, profane, loud, and ludicrous propaganda piece for macho American hucksterism, a long cocaine, sexed-up all-night party prepared for nerds in ties dressed up to act like slick stock salesmen. At times I thought the badly-cast characters (Jonah Hill was a prime mistake) were taken straight from Steve Carell's ""The Office"", because of the many completely unfunny-yet-see-how-awkward-this-is moments. Also Scorsese's f-bombs and several fellatio references seem to work well in mob movies, but are not convincing in NYC business world. Sure, I get it, it's about the mighty dollar, so people can curse and be as vulgar as they want; but there was nothing but a continuous stream of depravity celebrating this base idea, with absolutely no letup. DiCaprio is very good, and gave it his all, and Scorsese can control a camera like no one else, but his music left something to be desired, but worst of all, the entire film seemed like an out-of-touch artist trying to make a film about a culture which he hasn't a clue about how it actually operates. Very few of the scenes were convincing at all, in how people would act or speak in the business world, even when they were trying to do underhanded stuff. Also, almost no attention was paid to the actual scams, and how they worked, and the real culture of Wall Street; there's no insider view"" to this world. Instead, the only ""insider view"" we get is into a farcical frat-boy mentality of a particular Long Island boiler-room operation owned by Belfort, the caricature minions of which treat him like a demigod, everyone having public sex, urinating, doing lines of coke, and treating all women as hookers. Even if this is lifted directly from Belfort's book, it is not a convincing portrayal at all of how things actually went down. Scorsese seems to be allowing himself to be merely the filmic transmitter of Belfort's self-serving book about his tawdry, and probably highly-embellished, if not fabricated, escapades.<br/><br/>There was a moment in the film, however, when DiCaprio's character made a speech about success and how poverty isn't noble, and how if you believe that you can go work at McDonald's, which sorta made me self-conscious about my own position in US society; after all, I am American.<br/><br/>Scorsese makes a very good-looking movie, and can do over-the-top drug scenes, with some good humor (the quaalude scene at the WASP club was hilarious), but everyone acts like a macho thug, and seems to have none of the inhibitions normal people have in their speech or behavior, to the point of it being ludicrous. <br/><br/>Casino was a great piece of entertainment; my favorite Scorsese movie. Scorsese can do the ""underworld"" sleazeballs really well. But this shtick doesn't transfer very well when doing the business underworld; it's just too sloppy and blunt to be convincing. You can't put a tie on some cursing, oversexed Neanderthal and expect him to look like a convincing sleazy stockbroker. <br/><br/>Gotta love that DiCaprio, though. He just gets better with each film."
"Joxerlives","6","0","2","24 May 2014"," Unfettered excess in all its' exhilaration and disgust
","Very, very interesting film, the makers trying to do for Wall Street what they already did for the Mafia. And much like Goodfellas it is both absorbing and repellent at the same time, in a way we envy theses characters, they are the 'movie stars with (financial) muscle'. In every other way we are utterly repulsed by them and all the fast cars, booze/drugs and easy sex with hot bimbos in the world doesn't make up for the sheer vulgarity and nihilism of people for whom enough really never is enough in every sense of the words. Their office seems a nice place to work in some ways, strippers and marching bands in their underwear as a weekend treat but hellish in others, the fact that the financial magazine does a hatchet job article on the boss only to turn him into a hero for the unapologetically greedy is very telling.<br/><br/>Great performance from Leo DiCaprio showing (alongside his role in J Edgar)that he can play a great deal more than just the pretty boy hearthrob of Titanic. Jonah Hill is also fantastic and it shows a great deal of courage on his behalf to play such an infinitely dislikeable character with practically no redeeming features whatsoever. Lovely to see Joanna Lumley too, effortlessly bringing some refined British class to all this brashness, very different to her last role as the comical Dutch receptionist in Eurotrip. <br/><br/>Criticisms? It goes on far, far too long, there was obviously so much source material they just didn't know what to discard, you could carve out whole sections without losing any of the story. It's also hard to know where we stand on this all, the central character seems to be just fine with it all in the end and the FBI investigator seems to be the one having second thoughts of his lost opportunity.<br/><br/>So a good film but a little too OTT."

Belfort selling his story, motivational bloviation and now this film, not through the telephone but now through the television/movie screen.<br/><br/>And the bird is flipped repeatedly in other ways. Having the helicopter rescue crash comically in the background while the party moves to the rescue ship stuck out to me. Oh well, lives are lost, financially and otherwise. So what, did you get the ludes.<br/><br/>Just because Scorcese swallows this crap, we shouldn't. There's the ride on the subway at the end for the FBI agent, why didn't Marty have the agent have a hole in his shoe and step in some vomit on the train.<br/><br/>The government really needs to step in and stop Scorcese from making any more films with DiCaprio."

I would not recommend watching this with your parents kids. The movie kind of avoids a story line, and it's pretty bland. It has some comedic moments and also some drawn out, Goodfellas like scenes. Also like Goodfellas, you see it from Jordan Belfords point of view. Oh yeah, Martin Scorcese directed this. Although I'm late on reviewing this... Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing as usual and doesn't upset in acting as the Stock Broker from Long Island. Also a very surprised performance by Jonah Hill which really brought a lot of hilarious scenes Into the movie. There is am extreme amount of sex, and doing drugs, and plenty of cursing... Averaging a F word every 7 seconds. <br/><br/>Even if you do not know the story of Jordan Belford, it doesn't really surprise you that he gets arrested in the end. I mean, if he didn't end up getting arrested in the end we would honestly realize how horrible this world is.

","Mmm, disappointed was the first thing to came to my mind, then mmm no, is Scorsese. With exceptions of very few films (Hugo, Aviator, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver...) I think that Martin is perhaps the most overvalued director.<br/><br/>A lot of extra footage making too long movies, heavy for no reasons, full of things that doesn't seem have a reason. They are bad movies, no, they are great. no. However, his movies are hard to pass through them, a hardness that remind me the stream of consciousness in the literature, but when Virginia Wolf used Mrs. Dalloway to get into the women mind, innovating, trespassing boundaries and values of her time.<br/><br/>Scorsese, well he is heavy, difficult, for What? for a decent movie in the best of the cases. 3 hours movies that can be reduced in the half, actors push to overacting, shouting, cheap violence, cheap turns. And not because the guy is not talented, he can recruit interesting crews, find excellent scripts, he knows how to use the camera.<br/><br/>In my opinion he spent that talent, because he believes too much in him, in his way, in his idea, don't listen anything from anyone, don't question himself; that he could be forgetting smth, that he could be making some mistakes, even he can't quit to some shots that are completely unnecessary. An attitude maybe just compared with Woody Allen's, but the good Woody, well, he does that to run away from the Hollywood formula, with yes, a lot of bad results.<br/><br/>But Scorsese doesn't run away from any formula, it looks Hollywood, is heavy, long, expensive and at least for me, make me regret the 3 hours that I invested in his movies, at least I watched this in my computer and not in a cinema where I will regret a little bit more. And don't get me grown, this movie is good but I could live my life without suffering it.<br/><br/>P.s. This Leonardo Dicaprio doesn't deserve the Oscar, the one of Django Unchained yes. This symbionts, Scorsese / DiCaprio, Nolan / Bale, Burton / Deep, Allen / Cruz, are wasting the time of multifaceted talented actors and encourage them to don't leave one unidimensional way of acting, I mean Johnny Deep can't stop being Captain Sparrow in every single movie.

","Like its cocaine-fueled characters, Martin Scorsese's 'The Wolf of Wall Street' has an almost manic energy. But despite clocking in at nearly three hours, the whole affair (also not unlike its characters) feels rather shallow. Maybe that's the whole point. To explore superficial characters superficially. If that's the case, then this film is a rousing success.<br/><br/>'The Wolf of Wall Street' is very much a kindred spirit to one of Scorsese's other films, 'Goodfellas'. Like that film, 'Wolf' is narrated by its lead character as he rides the exhilarating highs and crushing lows of life on the wild side. DiCaprio once again proves why he might be his generation's best actor as he carries much of the film with the strength of his tour de force performance. The script is witty and the supporting cast strong, but this film likely doesn't work without DiCaprio.<br/><br/>The biggest fault many will have with this film is that it not only makes these people likable, but it fails to pronounce judgment on them after so much debauchery and dirty deeds.

I feel the drug use was not overdone, considering it fit with the story line on how drug driven Jordan Belford was. The main issue was the constant unnecessary sex scenes. I felt like I was watching what was one step away from a pornographic film. Martin Scorsese must have taken the day off those scenes were filmed and let his 13 year old nephew direct for him. I felt the movie just was a huge waste of time, watching Jordan either have sex with his hot wife or snorting coke and swallowing lemons with Donnie.

","There has been a lot of argument among critics as to whether Scorsese endorses or condemns the wretched excess portrayed in this movie. It depends, I think, on the viewer's own values.<br/><br/>More than anything else, the movie reminded me of the Samuel Johnson quote that Hunter Thompson used as the epigraph to Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas: ""He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man."" Belfort and his crew are a certain kind of American man, and their beastliness is an effort to assuage the pain of being where they are on the social scale.<br/><br/>From watching Nancy Meyers movies, I've learned that how they consume is evidence of rich people's inner state. Money multiplies choices, and enough gives you the chance to do whatever you want. So the question becomes – what do you want? For Jordan Belfort and the (mostly) guys he recruits, the answer is life as a permanent beer commercial. All they can think of to do with the money is to buy sex, to buy drugs, and to buy stuff that shows everyone else you can afford to buy it. If you're a 23 year old lower middle class young man, as Belfort was at the beginning of the movie, the prospect may well be irresistible. For someone else, maybe not so much. I found their behavior to be grotesquely funny and Belfort, his crew and his trophy wife to be objects of disdain – the cast of Jersey Shore on steroids, who have no idea what to do with what they have, and who cannot communicate without bluster and obscenity. <br/><br/>These are people who obscurely sense that they are looked down on by their betters, who are enraged by that fact, and who gleefully act out their rage by theft and by flash consumption. There's one scene that makes the rage clear. Belfort invites the FBI agent pursuing him down to his yacht at the World Financial Center marina. First he offers food, then drink, then financial assistance. When the FBI man quietly calls him on it, Belfort drops his cool Master of the Universe act, tells the FBI to get the f* off his boat, and ends by tossing $100 bills at him to show how rich he is. Belfort can feel the agent looking at him like pond scum, and he can't stand it.<br/><br/>We see almost nothing of how Belfort and crew make the money. Speaking through the fourth wall, Belfort, which is to say Scorsese, repeatedly tells the audience that we don't care about how it's done, or what it means, and only want to see how it gets spent. What we are shown is the con man's contempt for the mark as someone just as greedy as he is but much, much stupider. As far as Belfort is concerned, the guy on the other end of the phone deserves to be swindled because he thinks of the stock market as a magic genie that will make him rich without effort or understanding, and because he is too stupid to know what he doesn't know.<br/><br/>Belfort is more disconcerting than Henry Hill or Frank Costello because he's a lot closer to us. These other Scorsese protagonists are blue collar thugs who make their money through physical violence. Belfort starts out middle class, and he makes his money through a fraudulent variant on what is otherwise legitimate activity. It's a lot easier to imagine ourselves, or our kids, doing what he does, which makes the respectable upper middle class viewer uneasy.<br/><br/>He's also more disconcerting than Irving Rosenfeld because he doesn't know his place. Rosenfeld believes in the small time con as both safe and sufficient. Belfort wants to be somebody. He's moving up the financial food chain from pump and dump to underwriting IPOs, and he wants his Long Island boiler room with the fake WASP name to be recognized as a real member of the club. He's also desperate for adulation – he walks away from a deal with the SEC because he can't stand a future without the adoration of his crew. But he never learns how to wear the mask of respectability, as Madoff did. He deliberately refuses to learn because he thinks enough money will force the establishment to accept him on his own terms, without needing the veneer of respectable manners. He is white trash rich and proud of his trashiness."

","I like Scorsese and DiCaprio, but this was just plain boring to me. <br/><br/>The narration was reminiscent of ""Goodfellas"" - which unfortunately only reminded me of how much better a picture that was. <br/><br/>I just felt like, ""Who cares about these people?"" <br/><br/>Any point about Wall Street corruption was lost in the overall boringness. <br/><br/>Just not a story that intrigues - unlike ""Wall Street,"" which really was a movie of its time and became iconic of the '80s. <br/><br/>I really wanted to find something redeeming about the movie, but I just couldn't. <br/><br/>That is not to say it was completely horrible (although it fell well short) - just expected more from Scorsese and DiCaprio. <br/><br/>""Departed"" is definitely one my favorite movies of all time, as is ""Goodfellas."" See where I'm going with this?"

","I have always been very skeptical about those ""get rich (quick?)"" seminars we see advertised and formed my own conclusion that, if you're a charismatic orator and, perhaps, an author of a best-selling motivation book, and highly overrate your own value, it isn't hard. You don't need to be good in business (legitimate business, that is). All you need to be is a good con artist.<br/><br/>I have heard it said that, if you make an A4 size flier with your picture filling most of it and just something like, ""MARVO the world's greatest hypnotist is coming to (your town)"" along with dates and venues in small type at the bottom and get a whole pile of them letter-boxed, even if you have no idea about hypnotism, you can do this. A couple of days after the fliers have been delivered, just go and knock on some doors until someone says, ""Wow!! You're that hypnotist on the flier I got the other day!"" Then just look the person straight in the eye and say, ""Sleep"" and they will fall down right there in front of you. The person saw the flier and believed what it told them so that, when they saw the person whose picture was on it, they were already pre-programmed. And that, in a nutshell, is how con- men work.<br/><br/>And that is also what ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is all about. How Scorsese made it last for three whole hours is certainly testimony to his expertise as a director. But, strangely (for me) I thought he really missed the boat as far as the film's full potential was concerned. Maybe Bob Guccione would have done it better because he would have REALLY shown all the porn scenes without bed sheets and subtle camera angles to hide the juicy bits. Whether the movie would have been better for that is, of course, debatable depending on where you stand with regard to both porn and accuracy. (Maybe there is a directors cut version!)<br/><br/>As it is though, ""Wolf"" is nothing more than (I presume) an insight into just how corrupt the world of big business is and makes me glad that I have never been there. It is nothing more than three hours of gratuitous profanity, drug abuse and naked debauchery and definitely not worth the time.<br/><br/>How it got nominated for an Academy Award mystifies me. I can only assume that some members of the Academy related to it in some way."

Im also fascinated by the fact that he has worked with this script for so many years. There were very few smart female characters in leading roles in the movie, would have liked to see some more.

"seaview1","9","0","2","1 March 2014"," The Temptations of THE WOLF OF WALL STREET
","Director Martin Scorsese's ongoing collaboration with actor Leonardo DiCaprio has yielded highly entertaining, prestigious films (The Departed, The Aviator). Their latest venture is the true, astonishing tale of Wall Street crook Jordan Belfort whose appetites for money, sex and drugs are a detailed observation on greed and temptation.<br/><br/>An eager, young executive, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), experiences the Wall Street disaster of 1987 which wipes out investors and costs him a job. Anxious to bounce back, he discovers the art of selling unregulated penny stocks and starts his own brokerage. Soon he is making a lot of money often at the expense of low income earners but also wealthy clients, and with the help of some cronies including new follower, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), begins to expand exponentially into a major force in the financial world. The emotional stress and pressure heighten his need for women, sex, drugs and then drugs upon drugs. As his excessive lifestyle spirals out of control, the FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission begin investigating his company's illegal activities that signals the beginning of the end.<br/><br/>DiCaprio (Inception) gives his all as the out-of-control executive whose wealth is surpassed only by his defiance and greed. It is interesting to contrast his younger, innocent broker with his later, drug addicted shark. With maniacal fervor, he inspires and rallies a company's corporate culture. You are mesmerized by his bold, flamboyant salesman and yet, you look for any semblance of redeeming qualities. In a sense, Jordan is a metaphor for our corporate society's love of money and its ultimate corruption.<br/><br/>Hill (Moneyball) really shows a good range as Belfort's second in command. Can this be the same Jonah Hill who had a supporting role in Knocked Up? Matthew McConaughey has a memorable supporting role as a mentor to Belfort, and their scene together at a rooftop restaurant where McConaughey shows a ritual of self motivation is a hoot.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie is well cast as the beautiful woman who captures Jordan's heart and more. Rob Reiner has an amusing supporting role as Jordan's dad who sees the company as a sinking ship. In fact two other directors, Jon Favreau and Spike Jonze, have bit parts or cameos. Playing an FBI agent, Kyle Chandler, who has become the go-to actor for government types, is a good foil in his scenes with Jordan aboard a yacht.<br/><br/>There are some memorable vignettes such as the outrageous attempts to smuggle millions in cash to Europe, the crazy office parties, and an especially hilariously pathetic attempt by Jordan to drive home at the same moment he has a very bad drug reaction. When the justice system corners him, Jordan faces a decision not unlike the protagonist in Prince of the City. You know how this is going to go down, and when it does, it is an astonishing reversal of fortune.<br/><br/>At three hours, it is constantly engaging and well paced from start to finish courtesy of veteran editor Thelma Schoonmaker. The sweeping camera shots and rapid cuts show Scorsese at the top of his craft. He tells much of the film through DiCaprio as narrator and voice-over. In fact much of this film will remind you of the style and structure of his Good Fellas and Casino, and the ending recalls another Scorsese classic, The King of Comedy.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, despite excellent performances and a strong narrative, this film has scenes that are bordering on NC17; some scenes are so over the top in suggestiveness and explicitness that it would be hard to believe if it wasn't true. The film's depictions may lead some to question the filmmakers' intent, but Scorsese, without passing judgment, wanted to honestly show greed and power at its worst in the boardroom and the bedroom. Consider The Wolf of Wall Street as a supremely effective, cautionary tale of abuse of wealth at a time when such behavior flourished unchecked. You might not like the passengers on this flight, but it is a fascinating ride."

","I myself I jerk off at least twice a day!! The moment Matthew McConaughey delivered that line I was all ears and hooked on to THE WOLF OF WALL STREET. Coming directly of DALLAS BUYERS CLUB still clearly many a pounds lighter Matthew McConaughey plays a cameo in the Martin Scorsese bio-pic lashing out some of the best advice I am yet to hear on the wide screen. Condensed with Voluptuous beauties, Sex, Drugs and Alcohol THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort who was born in the Bronx and grew up on Bayside, Queens. Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) starts his career as a broker at L.F. Rothschild. 19th October 1987 Belfort finally becomes a licensed broker and the market crashes taking Rothschild down with it. Belfort reach out for jobs with his thoughts of ever being a broker hastily diminishing until his wife circles out an advert in the papers calling out for salesmen. Belfort's transformation from a cub to a wolf thus begins as he enters through those doors signing up employment with a penny-stocks firm in Long Island. Along with the contract his habits, his personality and his motivation takes a turn and story worth watching is born. Veteran Director Scorsese and DiCaprio collaborate for the 5th time and indeed have concocted what I will probably rate as one of the captivating movies of the year 2013. The race to the Oscars indeed is neck on neck and each one has the pedal to the metal with the finish line just yards ahead. DiCaprio having won the Golden Globe for the Best Actor in a Leading Role still falls at number 2 in my books for two reasons. First being that although he is indeed in a role of a life time and in pristine form of acting, he falls short of his own feat of J.EDGAR (DiCaprio can do better –He has proved so) and secondly his efforts does not have enough momentum to oust Matthew McConaughey who is my number one contender at the Oscars. Turning back to the faultless performance of DiCaprio, was he in reality on drugs or is he just that good? Seated in the audience the rush of the cocaine and whiskey and the sheer adrenaline of having everything in life literally at your fingertips is captured right from the core. Going to the movies is all about the experience and DiCaprio delivers a front row seat experience to Belfort's life, his work, his absolutely stunning wife, his women, his drugs, his cars, his mansions and his craftiness. Without discussing Jonah Hill I cannot sum this review up it just does not feel right. DiCaprio maybe the spliff for the high. Jonah Hill is the fire that lights it up. I could not stop laughing every second of Jonah Hill on screen. Let me just say that you will love his teeth and his 21 Jumpstreet attitude. I chuckle as I write this and so will you enjoy the Hill madness indeed. 2 time Oscar Nominee Jonah Hill has reached his career high thus far this time surpassing his performance in MONEYBALL from 2012. Mr.Hill you have clearly outdone yourself and your fans are clearly overwhelmed with this performance but sadly we think it does not have enough punch to surpass a certain Somali Pirate who is eyeing the same prize as you. Better luck next time. Lastly Mr. Scorsese; Oscar winner or not his caliber of directors is a rare breed. In Fact in my times and in my eyes and in my limited exposure he is indeed The God Father with his mafia of Spielberg, Allen and Cameron to name a few. Wouldn't it be the perfect night if he bags all the awards come Oscar night. Sadly I am certain it wouldn't be so. The entire best sir!<br/><br/>Verdict This could not have been done any better. Front Row Seat to a DiCaprio and Hill Massacre of the Wall Street. Wall street never looked more real!!

"ndalcortivo","9","0","3","21 February 2014"," Wolf of Wall Street
","Everyone knows that Leonardo Dicaprio and Martin Scorsese are incredibly talented at what they do and when you put them together, great things happen. They have created works such as ""The Departed"" and ""The Aviator"" and are ahead of their time with their methodologies. The story of Jordan Belfort's rise and fall is one of the most interesting and exciting of its time. The hype surrounding this film since the release of the first previews has been astounding. This film has been in the works for seven years and the time commitment is well represented in the quality of the film. Belfort's character is difficult to play. He is an ambitious and hardworking man who loves to have a good time. I could not think of a more worthy person to portray his character than Leonardo DiCaprio. Rarely do you see a non-serious side of DiCaprio, but this movie made me realize that he can play any role you put in front of him. He had you feeling empathetic towards Belfort while he was stealing from the lower class and buying yachts named after his supermodel wife. You watch DiCaprio's character change as the movie progresses. In the beginning he is a naïve stock broker who had just passed his certification exam. Then he meets Matthew McConaughey's character, Mark Hanna, who is an already successful broker. Hanna teaches him that in order to be successful in the business, he needs to learn to relax by essentially just becoming a sex addict and coke-head. It turns out that Hanna is right. When Belfort switches over to the 'not so naïve' side of the business he finds success. During this time period you witness Belfort change into the greedy, money, coke addicted, quallude loving adultrist. But somehow when the Feds were getting closer to convicting him, you felt bad for him. Few actors can have this effect on you and DiCaprio is one of them. DiCaprio was the star of the film, but he was complemented perfectly by being paired with supporting actor Jonah Hill. Hill played the character Donnie Azoff who was Belfort's business partner. Hill played his normal self who was of course, hilarious. But he was also very serious in certain scenes and it added to the complexity of his character. Together Belfort and Azoff were a power-pairing of coke, qualludes, and hundred dollar bills. But not only were Belfort and Azoff party animals, but their who office was. Their company, known as Stratton Oakmont, would be a madhouse during business hours and essentially a strip club afterhours. Scorsese found a way to capture the true character of the company by showing Belfort giving empowering speeches during the workday and then throwing ridiculous parties that involved strippers and live tigers. Lets face it, a film with a one hundred million dollar budget can pretty much do whatever it wants. Most critics are saying that Scorsese went over the top and the movie was too vulgar. To be honest, they are right. But you can't say that it was not interesting. I loved every second of the 179 minutes thrill ride. It bounced from scenes of Belfort and Azoff smoking crack in a parking lot to Belfort with his wife and child back to Azoff blowing a line off of a strippers chest in the middle of a workday. The dialogue was extremely vulgar and I enjoyed every curse word that they said. The movie has a ton of character and I admire the work that Scorsese, DiCaprio, and Hill put together. My only qualm with this film is that it was insanely long. I said earlier that I loved every second of the ten thousand seven hundred and forty that were depicted. But I believe that Scorsese could have accomplished the same feats in a two hour time slot. A critic from Entertainment Weekly said that ""But the director also has to know that his film could have used some trimming. Clocking in at just a minute under three hours, Wolf starts to repeat itself as we're given one scene after another of men behaving badly. If you're feeling charitable, you could argue that the movie's running time is meant to mirror its theme of excess. Then again, you could also say that it's just way too long. There's a reason roller-coaster rides last for only a few minutes."" All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I would watch it again in a heartbeat. I give it an A-."
"thiago_barbosa","9","0","2","20 February 2014"," The Wolf of Wall Street
","It is difficult to keep your eyes off and stop following Jordan Belfort 's career (Leonardo DiCaprio) in The Wolf of Wall Street. All the ostentation and lack of scruples of the character excited the backstage of a market that puts in motion billions per year, and we are not talking about the entertainment industry. There's more money in Wall Street than can be counted and the stock brokers are aware of the possible sales and commissions. Jordan appears initially as a mere employee, willing to learn with Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) the main techniques to be successful in the profession. In one of the best scenes in the film, Mark advises the premature Jordan to act before the market, it isn't a matter of sharing profits with clients, but extorting them and ensuring a fat commission.<br/><br/>There's no time to put the teachings into action, with the crash of the Stock Exchange and the crisis, the inexperienced Jordan loses his job, ending up in a smaller company that negotiated penny stocks. Capable of selling contact lenses to the blind, the stockbroker stands out when he opens his own business. After that, the hills of money and illegality grow in Jordan's career, an addict to Sex, Drugs and Money. Scorsese builds his film based on the career of a character with ups and downs, like the ones he had portrayed in Casino and other productions. But there's something special about Jordan Belfort, who amuses himself and enjoys his wealth as few, being bold as to face the spectator, dialoguing directly to the camera, becoming a master of whom he once was a disciple.<br/><br/>Any fan of Scorsese's work will notice similarities among many of his films, but it is curious to realize that if Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci were younger, they would probably play the roles of Jordan Belfort and Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), respectively. DiCaprio and Hill's engagement reminded the films where Martin's work as director is exquisite. The hyperboles in The Wolf of Wall Street point out how gambling in the stock market is disastrous when many get poor and a few get rich. In this case, it isn't a matter of praising consumerism and drug use, but confirming their rampant use in society.<br/><br/>The intensity of the film also highlights its editing, which uses different languages in an effective way, moving between TV and cinema, despite the loss of momentum in the last part. Merits of Thelma Schoonmaker, an old collaborator in the montage of Scorsese's work. Technically, we have a very good film, with a challenging director, even though he's stuck to the bases that made him famous. These are non- tiring 3 hours, with a really varied soundtrack.<br/><br/>Taking this theme to the movies and making fun of it must not have been fun to the sharks of Wall Street, but it will definitely amuse the sardines stuck in the net. Finally, Jordan's greed bumps into FBI and his system based on addictions collapses. Fun gets to an end, even if the essence remains, other stockbrokers are ready to take the lead and sell the best thing America has to offer: Dreams and Illusions.<br/><br/>http://arrotos.com.br/2014/01/18/o-lobo-de-wall-street/"

Most women were behind the scenes as secretaries not traders. Typical boiler room flick with good acting. The beginning is very funny with Matthew Mc. Not shown in the movie his role actually owned 25% of Jordan Belfort's business but bailed after 2 years. He eventually served jail time too. <br/><br/>Most surprising aspect was that Belfort only served 22 months in federal prison. Didn't Martha Stewart get more than that for insider trading?

","The Wolf of Wall Street is a fantastic movie with a very well well developed storyline, an outstanding cast and very impressive character development. Its an unexpected film from both Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio to do, it's absolute filth without a doubt and has an 18 rating for a reason, but I think exploring these dark themes captured the true story of Jordan Belfort in a very realstic way, it took you deep in to his life in an intense manner to convey to the audience how surreal it really was, they were given creative freedom to do whatever they wanted and they certainly use this to full effect, without sugarcoating anything. There isn't a single performance in this movie I didn't enjoy, everyone gives it their all, DiCaprio delivers one of the highlights of his career, Jonah Hill's performance was definitely the funniest, and he has also has many intense and dramatic scenes where he proves once again that he can do serious roles and go beyond comedies like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. Margot Robbie was also one of the best actors on this film, she is very new to Hollywood but she seemed very confident, she is a very promising young actress who has a great career ahead of her. Matthew McConaughey also does a great job, he has been proving lately that he really can act in some big and challenging roles, he is in this movie for a very short period, but it's one of the best few minutes of the whole film and sets the tone perfectly, would have loved to have seen more of Mark Hanna, it says on the trivia that he spent two more years working with Belfort, sadly that didn't happen in this film, which I think would have been great to give him more screen time, his performance was outstanding. The only real problem I have with this movie is that the characters are very unlikeable, although this did make sense, we could have had some moments where we sympathised with them, and also it is a little bit longer than it really needs to be. Wolf of Wall Street is an outstanding movie that I would recommend to all moviegoers of a certain age. <br/><br/>Follows the true story of Jordan Belfort as he rises to power in Wall Street and turns in to a corrupt criminal in the process, dragging his company and everyone involved down with him. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio Worst Performance: Christina Jeffs"

","I spent most of the movie with an incredulous ""You've got to be kidding me"" reaction, but no joke, the whole story is based on the true life of the real Jordan Belfort, who professes to have really done all the things as portrayed in this movie. Regardless, the movie is wonderful, albeit over the top, with a great cast of characters. Leonardo DiCaprio does a fantastic job as the conniving money-hungry Belfort. Early on, we see the character of Mark Hanna, played by Matthew McConaughey, introduce Belfort to the world of Wall Street with a chest thumping, grunting chorus that would make Tim Allen proud. Belfort teams up with a short overweight poser named Donnie Azoff, played by Johah Hill, who becomes his second hand man. The cast of characters grows, including a wonderful performance by Jon Bernthal of Walking Dead fame, as the bruiser Brad; and relative newcomer Margot Robbie as Belfort's trophy wife Naomi; and Rob Reiner seemingly coming out of retirement to play Belfort's meat-head father. The ongoing narration hearkens back to Scorsese's earlier film Goodfellas, which was a bit too unoriginal and a lazy approach to storytelling. Nonetheless, Belfort takes the audience on a harrowing ride as his life spirals upwards and predictably downwards through fits of drug abuse and wanton sex, all while the feds try to lock him into their sites."
"samjmarz3993","9","0","3","17 February 2014"," How can anyone dislike this film!?
","Personally it's a shock to me that this film can receive any criticism at all... In all honesty, there was no immediate appeal to watch The Wolf of Wall Street when it first came out, however there were two key ingredients that compelled me to watch it, those being ol' Leonardo and Martin Scorsese. I mean, The Departed alone would bring anyone to watch a film with the two of them combined. But I digress. After watching the film, I did my (often rare) nod of approval, basically meaning that it was definitely worthy of all the hype that surrounded it. Yeah, people could argue that the whole story surrounding Jordan Belfort was in indeed despicable and at times completely insane, however this only makes for an exhilarating storyline; just to see what kind of madness revolved around such debauchery. Some people may also argue that the misogynist values of the film are over-used, but surely a true story should include all the facts? No doubt there is a lot of drug use and sex in the film, but it only demonstrated how out of control the enterprise had become under Jordan's leadership.<br/><br/>But either way, in my opinion, I thought the film was shockingly brilliant, another masterpiece from Mr. Scorsese. Everything you could want from a film: excellent performances from lead roles (including Jonah Hill, who surely deserves Best Supporting!?), a shocking storyline and laughable scenes along the way. 9/10 from me, job well done boys and girls."
"CMTiago","9","0","2","17 February 2014"," Scorsese reaches yet another level with this outrageous outing
","Unapologetic and completely wild, The Wolf Of Wall Street is another landmark film from legendary director Martin Scorsese. Excess is a understatement when it comes to this story of American capitalism and its consequences. Jordan Belfort rose to extreme wealth and chose a lifestyle incomparable to the regular way of living. He was filthy rich and made sure everyone around him knew that. If I were to separate this movie in parts it would be 3. Start, Climb and Fall. Belfort experiences these three stages and you feel part of him changing in every one of them.<br/><br/>Being a passion project from Leonardo DiCaprio, it is quite understandable the amount of heart and soul he put into this film. Leo is explosive,huge and just breathtakingly grand in the skin of this Wall Street king. Throughout the long running time you just feel that everyone around Belfort just follows him and ultimately end up imitating him. Matthew McConaughey pops in for a brief cameo and for me, it seemed that he was the starting point of Jordan's transformation. In one scene we still notice that JB is a little green to this new world. What follows from this first meeting is the beginning of a road that leads to a downfall of epic proportions. Jonah Hill is a believable best friend to Belfort, if you can call him that, while Margot Robbie is a woman that while associated with the lifestyle, stands above it all in the end.<br/><br/>Marty presents all his trademark tools to tell this immoral story. Despite feeling that you have seen this before, you will witness it all happening again but in a different way. The script is filled with words that basically describe the feeling of being powerful. Jordan Belfort doesn't kill or hurt people. He grows financially due to some illegal processes. Maybe that's why I felt that Jordan's punishment didn't really feel deserved. Don't get me wrong he is a despicable human being, but despite his flaws you just don't want his journey to end. You enjoy this world as long as you're watching it from a distance. The Wolf Of Wall Street is a movie that exemplifies human behavior at its lowest, but are you going to do something about it? No. You just sit back and watch them fall on their own.<br/><br/>Rating 8,5/10"

","A seemingly stern film, The Wolf of Wall Street is actually hilarious. Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill present a chemically perfect duo that flawlessly deliver both serious and funny scenes. Though the numerous nude scenes create controversy among many viewers, Scorsese was able to tone it down enough to make the movie very enjoyable. DiCaprio is known for many serious roles, but from the start he is an adrenaline junkie who feeds off sex, drugs, and his favorite vice - money. He meets his flawlessly compatible partner Donnie Azoff when Donnie is struggling to make ends meet. Throughout this three hour film, they run into many problems that will either make you laugh or put you on the edge of your seat. With the addition of the other founding members of Stratton-Oakmont Inc., you'll surely love this movie. If you can handle sex and drugs and enjoy the hilarity and talent of this cast, you'll love The Wolf of Wall Street."
"Kicino","8","0","2","17 February 2014"," Totally entertaining, full of testosterone and black humor
","While Michael Douglas gave an award-winning performance of ruthless Gordon Gekko who is still haunting after all these decades, Leonardo DeCaprio shows his best performance to date of a hyperactive, egoistic yet charismatic broker who is willing to do anything to get rich on Wall Street.<br/><br/>I bet Leonardo will snatch the Oscar for his role here. Never would I have imagined he would play such a character when I watched the Titanic years ago. Even though DeCaprio has played a versatile of roles, I would never have imagined he could be someone like this: so abusive, arrogant, decadent, greedy, and yet confident of himself. He is just as capturing as his sales skills are in the movie. <br/><br/>In addition to this, his role indulges himself in drugs, women and getting rich – by any means. All these qualities do not sound very appealing but when you put these onto DeCaprio, he suddenly becomes a capturing character.<br/><br/>The scary part is that all these drama are based on a true story – of Jordan Belfort who helps writing the script and even stars in this movie – after he was convicted of Federal crimes in defrauding investors and served terms in jail.<br/><br/>It could be ugly with all these crimes and abuses but the way director Martin Scorsese and script writer Terence Winter handle it is full of black humor and you cannot help laughing and wondering in awe while learning these bitter lessons. <br/><br/>DeCaprio literally shines in several classic scenes – one in selling penny stocks to some innocent working class John Doe on the phone (played by director Martin Scorsese himself); another in slurring speeches and crawling into his race car after an overdose of an expired drug; another in giving motivational speeches and pushing a captive audience to sell; or talking suggestively and condescendingly to FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) on a yacht during an investigation. <br/><br/>When the movie first started, DeCaprio is like an innocent boy next door. But after closes his first sale and is taken to lunch by his supervisor Mark Hana (Matthew McConaughey), his testosterone gradually increases. When they are humming and pounding their chests in that Manhattan restaurant, I really feel I see two primates. Soon, we witness his gradual evolution into a wolf.<br/><br/>This movie is full of testosterone. Very aggressive, rough, ruthless, and corrupted even when it is portraying women. But at the same time it is fun and hilarious when you see how self-destructive, crazy and soulless these people are, in the name of making money. <br/><br/>The duration is over three hours but it is so engaging that it does not feel that long. What an intense life Jordan Belfort has. He, and as DeCaprio portrays, is a hyperactive, dominant, ruthless, indulging smart-ass with an extremely sweet tongue. And he never quits! He even betrays his friends and colleagues to protect his own butt. Probably not very dependable and not likable with such a horrid lifestyle. But the reality is, he wrote about his dramatic ups and downs in a book which this movie is based on and is now giving speeches around the world after he is discharged from prison. <br/><br/>This movie cannot be so successful without an excellent supporting cast who can otherwise very well be top comedians. Jonah Hill gives a liberating performance from Moneyball. He elevates himself here as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's second in command, someone Belfort trusts but is actually smarter than he looks. Jean Dujardin plays the role of a cunning Swiss banker Jean Jacques Saurel who has tons of tricks to launder Belfort's money. His facial expressions and heavy accent pushes the comical elements to the highest level. Beautiful second wife Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) demonstrates that a pretty and sexy woman can also act and shows a variety of emotions.<br/><br/>The monologues during meetings/encounters are excellent in depicting the hilarious hypocrisy of these scumbags. I guarantee you would laugh and nod at the same time. <br/><br/>Lots of nudity, graphic sex scenes and drug taking shots. Yet they are all relevant so keep young children away. This is entertaining and relieving to watch because you would laugh, enjoy the carefree lifestyle without having to bear the consequences. Who knows, maybe along the way you will pick up some skills in sweet talking/persuasive speaking too. Highly recommended."

","I went into this movie expecting a Scorsese a dramatic film about crime and corruption. At times that is exactly what you get when watching this movie and for the rest of the time its just plain hilarious. <br/><br/>The story follows Jordan Belfort's rise to riches through corruption of the stock market its a very funny roller coaster ride. DiCaprio is on fire in this movie as he always is when teamed up with Scorsese. For such a long film your never not gripped. Jonah Hill is equally great as Belforts side man Donnie Azoff. You actually wont believe some of the things these guys get up too and the fact its based on a true story makes it even funnier.<br/><br/>5 stars ***** The accidental comedy of the year.<br/><br/>The only thing wrong with this film is Matthew McConaughey is not in it long enough but for the time he is in it he is chest beating great. <br/><br/>http://raroe.wordpress.com/"
"ohashmawi","Null","0","2","16 February 2014"," It's a very funny movie, one of Scorsese's best, it's filled with great performances as well. If you can handle the sex and drugs, you should check out The Wolf of Wall Street
","So, The Wolf of Wall Street, I actually already did a review for it, but I decided to watch it again, and after my second viewing, I thought I didn't really do the film justice, so I'm making another review. This is actually a really great movie, it's funny, electric and overall really enjoyable, so let's get started:<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is impeccable, Leonardo DiCaprio is incredible in the movie, it's like he was born to play this guy, you know, just like how it feels with most of his performances, but there's something about this one, he is absolutely amazing in this movie, you start to see Leo as Jordan Belfort, he really deserved an Oscar for this role, if Dallas Buyers Club had been in another year, he would have won for sure. He truly is one of the best actors today. Speaking of Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew MacConaughey is in this movie! That guy is awesome, seriously, he turned his career around, he's awesome here. His scenes were the best, seriously, he was absolutely hilarious, Jordan's lunch with him was easily the funniest scene, it sucks that he was only in the beginning. Jonah Hill gave the best performance I've seen from him, he was great in Moneyball, but I think this role destroys his acting in Moneyball, he is awesome in the movie, he's really hilarious, just like DiCaprio and MacConaughey, the scene where he and Jordan begin experiencing the side-effects of the Lemmons, wow, that part was comedy gold. Jordan's wife, Margot Robbie was great in this movie as well, it's the first time I've heard of her and I'm pretty sure she'll be offered lots of roles after this. That last fight with Jordan was incredibly acted, just like DiCaprio, not to mention she is incredibly gorgeous. The one person that I didn't like was Jean Dujardin, he kind of dragged the movie down during his scenes.<br/><br/>The writing in the movie is first-rate, Terence Winter is a great writer, the dialogues he comes up with are great, just like in Boardwalk Empire. The jokes in the movie are great, it's incredibly funny, really great. Sure there were a lot of sex scenes, but I actually respect the makers of the movie for showing the life of the Wall Street people in such detail. The one problem was that the movie was a bit inconsistent with the tone, mostly during the Switzerland scenes. Although the movie was very funny, the best parts were beginning and the end, the middle was pretty weak, especially, once again, during the Switzerland scenes. I really hated that part, Jean Dujardin wasn't great with the comedic timing there. Other than that, the writing was very good.<br/><br/>The effects were impeccable here. Seriously, I didn't even notice that there were many visual effects here, expect for the boat scene of course. I was really surprised after watching that video which shows the effects in this movie. <br/><br/>The directing is amazing, Martin Scorsese is one of the best director living today, his camera work was very nice, the way he shot things, especially during the drug scenes was awesome, when they're using the luudes, really great work.<br/><br/>Whoever decided the soundtrack has great taste, it went along incredibly well with the movie, and they were songs that I would never have thought of, like the scene where everyone's busted, and they play ""Mrs. Robinson"", or the boat scene where the glass breaks and that Italian song comes up, those where great choices.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is really great, it sucks that it didn't win anything at the Oscars, it's a very funny movie, one of Scorsese's best, and has DiCaprio's finest performance. And I give it an 8.6 out of 10."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","2","15 February 2014"," Going all out
","The narrative opens in a somewhat familiar manner, the protagonist introducing himself via VO in a ""present"" mode then flashes back to how he started. The substance (no pun intended) of this introduction however can be characterized as pulling all the plugs, going all out, with obscene (in more ways than one) riches, marathon sex and drug, drugs, drugs.<br/><br/>Then, the flashback shows Jordan Belfort's (Leonardo DiCaprio) entry into a prestigious Wall Street broker firm at the lowest rung, received by the a most obnoxious character who for a second looks like the boss but is really just a most obnoxious senior co-worker. The boyish, completely disarming reception of the assortment of verbal insults tells you right away that Belfort is going places. The real boss turns out to be a congenial mentor played by Matthew McConaughey, a sales zealot. This is a cameo performance that is certain to win an Oscar, if there were a category for cameo performances. But don't feel sorry for him, at least not until March 2, and ONLY in the unlikely event that he does not win this year's Best Actor (defeating, ironically, DiCaprio).<br/><br/>Moving briskly, the narrative continues to the first day after Belfort's rapid acquisition of a broker's license which turns out to be Black Monday. Darwin's theory has never been so convincingly and conclusively demonstrated when Belfort joins a Mickey Mouse brokerage firm and loses no time at all to turn disaster into opportunity, using his superb selling skills to earn lucrative income by peddling penny stock. To his co-workers, it is an eye-opening demonstration of the magic of how a telephone and a voice, when used expertly, becomes the ticket to riches unimaginable. Note that this is completely unethical loading trusting clients with garbage stocks. Note also, however, that this is absolutely legal. The illegal stuff comes later, his final undoing.<br/><br/>The three-hour roller coaster ride with Belfort from rags to riches and then downfall does not feel long, thanks to Martin Scorsese's jubilant energy from beginning to end, at times oozing, at other times bursting. Matching him scene by scene is DiCaprio's brilliant delivery. Due credit must also be given to a huge supporting cast, too many to be mentioned one-by-one, with the exception of Jonah Hill who has received an Oscar nomination playing Belfort's loyal sidekick. The other 3 nominations completing a total of 5 are Best Picture, Best Directing and Best Screenplay (adapted)."

","Cynical, bacchanalian, dirty and mean, but at the same time gorgeous and hilarious... This is how I would describe Wolf of Wall Street! And, in my opinion, Leo definitely deserves Oscar! When you watch this movie, you will understand me! His acting is just amazing, he is a brilliant actor! I've been waited for this film for a long time (I guess since last February) and yesterday I finally went to see it. I was impressed; this movie surpassed all my expectations! Wolf of Wall Street narrates Jordan Belfort's (Leonardo DiCaprio) story: the way he made from being a poor guy who had nothing to becoming a rich stockbroker with no limits and then we see how easily he loses all this due to his dirty life full of parties, sex and drugs. I would say this movie represents this story about American dream: America is a land of opportunities. The same was said by Belfort himself. You can get easily everything you want and next moment you can easily lose it all. And the paradox is that you can have it back as easy as you lost it. When I was watching Wolf of Wall Street I noticed the similarity in story line with Aviator also by M. Scorsese: a young man who does everything to get rich, then when he gets it, he starts leading a decadent life, suffers from different types of obsessions/fears, etc and loses everything. But then he restores his reputation. The point is that Martin Scorsese knows how to ""serve"" his movies: he shows everything how it is with no exaggerations, with all details – good and bad. Martin knows how to reproduce the epoch where the movie takes place. May be, that's why all his movies are so contradictory and receive reviews of different kind. My general opinion is positive. This movie is really great! Even if you don't like the story, you will definitely love Leo's acting!"
"debiger","10","0","9","11 February 2014"," Very good movie
","As a business person I really loved this movie. However, sometimes I didn't see the connection between one scene and the following scene.<br/><br/>For example there is that scene where the guy says in the restaurant to Jordan: ""Tell you what. You show me a pay stub with $72,000 on it, I'll quit my job right now and I'll work for you."" - I just didn't see why Jordan would have hired a guy just like that. If that's how it happened in real life, fine. If they left something out it was a mistake because those connections are important to me.<br/><br/>Anyway. It's a good movie with lots of business lessons and very powerful conversations as we got used to it from Martin Scorsese. Sometimes a little bit exaggerating but I like it that way anyway.<br/><br/>The thing that bothers me is that at the end of the movie the real Jordan Belfort introduces Leo as Jordan Belfort. I think it should have been the other way around. I know it's not a Jordan Belfort sales training commercial, but it would have made a lot more sense to me. Anyway. Good job!"
"DjfunkmasterG","9","0","4","11 February 2014"," Shouldn't love this film... but I do
","I am a Scorsese fan... from pretty much seeing The Color of Money, up-to Wolf of Wall Street, the man has made some great flicks. His older stuff I cam across as I began embracing all things Scorsese and I just find his work memorable.<br/><br/>Wolf of Wall Street is not the best Scorsese film made, but for some reason it resonates more for me than his previous work. Yes he has some gems... Goodfellas, Casino, Cape Fear, Mean Streets, The Departed, but only 2 of his films stick with me on a daily basis, GoodFellas and Wolf.<br/><br/>When it comes to sitting down to watch a Scorsese flick I know I will get great story telling and some entertaining moments from a cast hand picked by the man himself because he knows they will work great in the role.<br/><br/>While Leo and Scorsese have worked together 5 times now, I found this instance to have been their best work together. Sure The Departed is a good film, but Leo really did a fantastic job with this picture.<br/><br/>The excess on display in TWOWS is pretty much gratuitous at every level imaginable. I don't think I have seen a film celebrate excess quite like TWOWS,and while I should frown upon the exploits of Befort and Stratton Oakmont, and morally I do, I can also imagine what it was like for the real players. It looked like a great time, and they way Scorsese captures it made me enjoy it from the viewers perspective.<br/><br/>Money is the most powerful drug in the world. I don't care who you are... we all need it, we use it and yet it is harder to get than the illegal street kind. So when a movie celebrates money as a drug, it changes the dynamic. Only 2 films have captured this... Wall Street and TWOWS. Both have done it perfectly, but only one can come out as king.<br/><br/>Take a talented cast, a world class director, an over the top script about 80's Wall Street excess and you have a film that not only entertains, but just leaves your jaw on the floor because you would never believe they really pulled this kind of stuff. (Not the scam, everything else) 9 out of 10"
"iamchrisallan","8","0","1","9 February 2014"," Roller-coaster of debauchery
","Drug fuelled, high octane debauchery from the start. It may well be 3 hours long but it's such a fun ride it really doesn't feel like it. Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant as Jordan Belfort and he is ably supported by Jonah Hill in what must be his best performance to date.<br/><br/>The writing is excellent and some of the dialogue reminded me of Quentin Tarantino at his best. Those nonsensical, drug filled conversations were very reminiscent of the tipping scene in Reservoir Dogs. The uncontrollable hysterics of the newly rich, quaalude fuelled brokers was so well acted as to make me suspect that some of the actors may have done a fair bit of research.<br/><br/>The scene in which Belfort takes too many out of date 'ludes and loses all control of his body in an attempt to drive home was a highlight of the film for me.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to finish"
"Gremlyn70","8","0","2","8 February 2014"," Thoroughly enjoyable film
","I really enjoyed this film, possibly for all the wrong reasons as I suspect the actors did too. Not sure if it was a long advert for complete debauchery, materialism and capitalism or intended as a rueful to trigger rumination in the viewer. Sure it is the latter, but there was comedy and empathy for the most part, with predictable consequences so cleverly catering for either viewer. DiCaprio roared in this film with an evangelical assurance. Plenty of accolades earned from the supporting cast too. Worthy of 10 for the first 3/4, then a slight slide. I decided it's best not to let the thought of very highly paid actors riding on the backs of a very able and willing support cast along with the vagaries of Hollywood blur with the moral story of the film, there are some vital issues raised as the film attempts to pontificate about it mother country. Take them or leave them. I took them."
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","0","3","5 February 2014"," Polemic Yet Still Pure Scorsese
","Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a master manipulator. Trained to be a Wall Street stockbroker, Belfort's life hits a small inconvenience when he is let go after the market collapses, forcing him to take a job at a penny stocks firm. That's when he gets an idea, if stockbrokers get 50% commission based on lousy penny stocks, why not sell them as if they were the greatest thing since 401ks. He starts his own firm, hires his own crew of borderline criminals and kicks the party into high gear.<br/><br/>Based on a largely true story about a scurrilous financial figure nicknamed ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", Martin Scorsese's newest feature largely succeeds in lampooning the financial markets of the eighties andwell the ones we still have today.. In fact the sheer lunacy of stock trading and market manipulation is summed up elegantly by Matthew McConaughey's character at the beginning of the film, ""It's wazy it's woozie, its fairydust."" The name of the game is to put the client's real cash into your pocket, while leaving them with imaginary money tied up in the stock market. Right? Right. So just two and a half hours to go.<br/><br/>After the principle theme is introduced, the rest of the film consists of Gordon Gekko Jr. and his conspirators making a name for themselves. That name is unbridled excess which actually leads to some inspiring moments. Between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill's characters, the two do more drugs than a hippie crack den culminating in an overly slapstick moment involving a completely out of it DiCaprio driving a Lamborghini. There are constant parties, cheerleading, marching band playing and tons and tons of sex all throughout; it's all quite mesmerizing.<br/><br/>It's also quite numbing after a while when the audience comes to the realization that none of this is leading to anything. Scene after scene of debauchery spliced with sardonic undertones and cheeky narration and soliloquies does not a good movie make. The fact that Wolf of Wall Street (2013) has been getting polarizing reviews can be seen as a testament to Martin Scorsese's waning capabilities as a director.<br/><br/>Yet I wouldn't count out the old master just yet. Perhaps Wolf of Wall Street was meant to be polarizing. There is not a single redeemable character with maybe the exception of Belfort's wife Naomi (Margot Robbie) and that is done on purpose. We as the audience are not meant to find Belfort's antics amusing or heroic, though he considers himself a twist Robin Hood. We're meant to be appalled by the character and disappointed when he gets his inevitable slap on the wrist. Belfort is Gordon Gekko done right; the master of a universe we don't want to live in.<br/><br/>Scorsese's condemnation of the Wall Street stockbrokers are in may ways harsher than Henry Hill of Goodfellas (1990) or Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull (1980). Belfort's id gets him into a heap of emotional and personal turmoil yet the true tragedy is he's left without catharsis or redemption unlike Ray Liotta who keeps his family or Robert De Niro who enjoys a crowded auditorium after the credits roll. There is no pat on the back or promise of reemergence. Belfort is forced to live in modesty and obscurity.<br/><br/>But Belfort did have his supporters among the audience that I saw the film with. At one point in the film Kyle Chandler's straight edge FBI agent in so many words tells Belfort he's going down. One audience member found it appropriate to blow a raspberry while the others including myself looked his was with scorn. Thinking about it, I realized that audience member was actually rooting for Belfort and the board members of Stratton Oakmont. Did he choose to ignore the inherent evil in what Leo DiCaprio was doing? Or was he seduced by his wily charms and excessive lifestyle? While being bombastic and lurid, The Wolf of Wall Street, like all good art, lets you decide for yourself if all the bacchanals and drugs were worth it. In one truly masterful coda, Belfort's comeuppance, Stratton Oakmont's dismantling and Kyle Chandler's train ride home are accompanied by a cover of Mrs. Robinson by The Lemonheads. Each tableau conjures images of The Graduate's (1967) final repose of Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross sitting in the back of a bus with the look of ""what now"" on their face. It's a good way to end a movie like The Wolf of Wall Street, I only wish it ended sooner.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

","Another review of an Oscar Nominated Film, The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) is a Martin Scorsese film. With that you've said a lot. First, you know it will be a serious well made film. Unfortunately, you also know that you've seen this style before. This is a great film. It is compelling, interesting, and hard to look away from. At the same time, it seems very familiar in its style, like a dream you've had before. Not that you didn't like the dream, but it does seem somehow familiar. The ""great"" film inside of The Wolf of Wall Street, however, is hidden inside a three hour long ""good"" movie. There are great things about the film, but it seems like we're riding a wave of Scorsese stream of consciousness here that is not to be stopped. About an hour of trimming would have given us the GREAT film we were looking for. I know that some important episodes would have been left on the cutting room floor, but this is about entertainment. And the entertainment value of the film would have been enhanced by the cuts. I like the film, but I didn't, in fact, love it. I will say that it has about the funniest 15 minutes in any film this side of Monty Python when a drug induced episode calls for some slapstick humor that had me rolling in stitches and hoping it would end before I exploded. Funny as can be and worth the price of admission. <br/><br/>Highly recommended, and one of the best films of the year. HOWEVER, I consider it a weak year in the best picture category."

Don't get me wrong, there is a decent plot-line, but this film is all about the experience it creates for the viewer. It takes you through the characters highs and lows and forces you to enjoy what you may chastise.

","1987 bought us Oliver Stone's Wall Street, and in turn inspired thousands in wanting to become the next Gordon Gecko.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas' Oscar-winning portrayal of the film's villainous antagonist was brutal but honest, and the motto ""Greed Is Good"" was reflective of a decade of the ""quick-buck"" culture.<br/><br/>That being said, it is easy to see why Jordan Belfort, the man who's memoir has inspired The Wolf Of Wall Street, became so heavily embroiled in the world of stock brokerage, and eventually financial crime.<br/><br/>The Wolf Of Wall Street tracks the life of Jordan Belfort, an ambitious young salesman whose ambitions seem to far outweigh practicality and realism, in what is quite literally a twisted rags to riches tale of excess and corpulence.<br/><br/>Somewhat ironically we meet a fresh faced Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the same year as the release of Stone's picture, setting up the as vulnerable and naive yet driven and determined to succeed and provide for his family.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the film we follow Belfort's evolution from ""lower than pond scum""(as described by the first Wall Street stockbroker we are introduced to) to President and co-founder of Stratton Oakmont.<br/><br/>A combination of bad choices and bad luck (in addition to what may be described as karma) however soon begin to signal Belfort's life unraveling and the metaphorical waves literally begin to consume him.<br/><br/>The character of Jordan Belfort is fascinating, and it is near-on impossible not to feel some semblance of pity and sympathy during the harder times which are endured.<br/><br/>While demonstrating chauvinistic, selfish and sexist traits at times, DiCaprio maintains a sense of charisma and appeal which make Belfort relatable even when committing his most debaucherous acts.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why parallels to ""Wall Street"" have been drawn. Covering almost identical subject matter from a near identical time frame, even the character of Gordon Gecko is alluded to during a particular scene, demonstrating a clear awareness of the context and influences that evidently shaped Belfort into becoming the titular ""Wolf"".<br/><br/>The parallels to Stone's 1987 picture are evident throughout, however we see far more semblance and similarity with Scorcese's previous work such as Goodfellas than of Stone's fictitious tale of Bud Fox and Gordon Gecko, in particular with regards to the first person narrative and non- linear story arc.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie provide exemplary supporting performances as best friend Donnie and (2nd) wife Naomi respectively, but neither can take away from the mind-bending show DiCaprio gives as the titular ""Wolf"" spanning emotions from incredulous anger, to slapstick physicality and drug-addled stupor.<br/><br/>While admittedly overlong, there is argument to suggest the hefty three- hour run time is justified and reflective of the characters need for excess and corpulence - I don't particularly buy that argument as the film does feel baggy at times, however given the fantastical nature of Belfort's story it is understandable that Scorcese would want to include as much as humanly possible for such an ambitious biopic.<br/><br/>Other than length, my only other reservation with the film was believability. Based on the aforementioned memoir, some scenes show a level of self-referrentiality and awareness of the fact that the story is told form Belfort's first person perspective. Where the contrast is not actively shown on screen however, it does sometimes become difficult to sift fact from Belfort's clearly wild and unwavering imagination.<br/><br/>Critics of The Wolf Of Wall Street have lambasted it as indulgent and over-aught, and it is clear to see why this is the case. After all, Scorcese does not attempt to depict the victim's of Belfort's immoral and illegal activity and therefore provides no perspective by which to judge his questionable actions.<br/><br/>Without contextualizing Belfort in this way, it is easy to see why some have felt a lack of engagement and/or empathy with/for the films anti- heroic protagonist, however I would argue that one does not need to agree with or even necessarily like any given character in order to engage with, feel empathy for and/or learn from.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to any Scorcese fan or in fact anyone who enjoys black comedy and is not averse to the (not-so) occasional bout of sweariness, sex and illegal substances.<br/><br/>If for nothing else though, see this film for Leonardo DiCaprio giving the performance of a lifetime."
"The-Sarkologist","7","0","1","1 February 2014"," Scorsese Still has his touch
","Sometime I wonder if an author, writer, or director, can continue to produce quality material long after they have produced their masterpieces, and what this movie tells me is that Martin Scorsese still has it. I have always admired the films that have come out of the mind of Scorsese, and this film is no exception. What surprised me though is that there were actually quite a few laugh out loud moments in this film, which is a first for me when it comes to Scorsese, because most of the films that I have seen of his tend to be deadly serious. While this film is itself serious, there is quite a lot of light hearted moments, and I must say that DiCaprio has certainly come a long way since the days of his want to puke teenage characters. However, if you do take a look at most of the films that DiCaprio has been in it is quite clear that he is interested in taking the decent rolls in the decent films.<br/><br/>This is the story of Jordan Belfort, a kid that pretty much took Wall Street by storm, and it exposes the true nature of the greed that dominates the financial industry. I read an article in the Australian Financial Review where a number of stock brokers were incredibly offended at this movie because they thought that what it did was really stain the name of their profession (as if their profession wasn't stained anyway). However, what I suspect is that what Scorsese has done is lifted the veil on the industry to expose it, and the industry has reacted in the way that would be expected.<br/><br/>I am not surprised that the industry is full of sex and drugs, that is what happens when you end up making more money than you know what to do with, but also what happens in a lot of cases is that when you fly high, you crash hard. While the brokers may be crying foul and unfair, we must remember that a lot of this cowboy money making attitude was occurring even in 2007 before the global financial crisis. However, what is clear is that the people who end up being busted and convicted, end up being little more than scape goats. The real crooks are the ones that sit in the board rooms running companies that are exploiting the resources of the Earth and polluting the land in which we live, while living comfortably in their gated communities.<br/><br/>Much of what went on here was still going on in 2007. In Australia we enacted laws in response to pretty much ban commissions for selling stock because what that would do would interfere with the ability of the broker to be looking out for the best interests of their clients. It is clear, and we are told from the beginning, that the job of the broker is not to make money for their clients, but to make money for themselves. In fact, as is also clear, the big money is in the so called penny stocks, the stocks that are too low to be listed on the major indices, and as such find it very hard to raise capital from investors, so they offer brokers large commissions to brokers to flog it off to unsuspecting investors, but the reason that they are so low is because they are high risk stocks that are more likely than not to not actually pay off."

","Very rarely does a film weave in AND out of Best Picture of *insert year* territory, but Wolf of Wall Street manages just that.<br/><br/>Accomplishing exactly what No Country For Old Men did years ago, this film was the greatest work of cinema in the calendar year----until the final act. That cursed final act that ultimately prevented this from becoming the Wall Street version of Goodfellas and Scorsese's best movie since The Departed.<br/><br/>The first two acts was a man's man's man's man's film. It was ballsy, it was gutsy, it was directly in your face, out of control, and so full of testosterone you become unsure if you can handle it all. It threw you right into the world of Wall Street where there were no signs of softness and Martin Scorsese directs this with a certain rampant speed and attitude that made it all the grittier and edgier. The language, sex, immorality, and take-no-prisoners approach to life within the broker industry was in full display and even though it got jarring, it was still breathtakingly entertaining to watch. The script held nothing back, and neither did the editing, directing, and especially the acting.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the best performances of his career, and gives it an energy and furor that would make 90s Jim Carrey impressed. He threw everything he had in this role, as it required a stamina that very few actors can successfully manage. Even Daniel-Day Lewis couldn't provide a taste of the mayhem that DiCaprio provided. The rest of the cast excluding Jonah Hill (Who really, really bogged the movie down a bit) were also superb, especially Matthew McConaughey in a role that was far too short.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was blazing and skipping around like an indecisive teenager using an IPod shuffle, the amount of detail was staggering, and there wasn't a single dull moment. Although our lead character was a terrible human being, you couldn't help but be mesmerized and slightly jealous at all his success, while also be enthralled at the cutthroat business he was engaged in.<br/><br/>And then came the final act.<br/><br/>This movie already had a heavy Goodfellas vibe from the getgo, bringing with it a predictable aura that brought the movie twisting towards a downward spiral that never recovered. If the first half felt like an adrenaline shot to the chest, then the latter half felt like a full bottle of sleeping bills taken simultaneously. With the shift in tone and pace, all the setbacks from earlier were suddenly being put out in full display. The editing suddenly looked weaker, the script suddenly lost focus, and the movie got repetitive, really fast. There was a great sequence of physical comedy from DiCaprio that forgave all the issues temporarily, but it was immediately followed by multiple failed chances to finish the movie in a strong note.<br/><br/>Easily 35-40 minutes could have been cut, limiting the movie's predictable final act. But before you know it you are watching the slow descent into despair that muddles heavily after the animated testosterone-laden personality of the first half. Scorsese should know better, instead of coming off like a gambler who doesn't know when to quit while he is ahead and ending the evening dead even. Wolf of Wall Street is wildly entertaining, but being half a spectacular movie shouldn't earn you Best Picture, no matter how good the opening half is.<br/><br/>But Best Actor however..is definitely, definitely here."
"quincytheodore","7","0","3","28 January 2014"," An acquired taste, enjoyable but not without curses and high dose of substance.
","More than a cult or circus than white collar con one might expect, The Wolf of Wall Street is littered with endless profanity, excessive drug abuse and possibly censored fornication, and quite delightfully so. The movie sometimes uses sarcastic tone in light of its depravity, but occasionally turns rather dark on the almost veneered anti-heroes as they rise and fall by the riches. Acting is undeniably superb, especially from the lead Leonardo DiCaprio, it keeps the long movie, in which hours spent getting high on various substances, entertaining.<br/><br/>Story revolves around Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his motley crew as they strive for opulence in expense of everyone else. It's a very crude display of alcoholism and addiction, Belfort is often seen bragging of his own compulsion and the cast is portrayed high for majority of the movie. This is supposed to be satiric as the downfall eventually comes preceded by uncanny signs of mental decline, but the amount of exposure to substance consumption is staggering. This is also the case with the use of expletive; the movie has delivered words that are usually bleeped in spade. It's safe to say that it's been a long time a cinema movie spams such generous amount of profanity.<br/><br/>The whimsical focus does attract attention; it's more relatable with realistic, albeit harsh approach. Martin Scorsese is a master of the trade, he makes such gritty black comedy and the scenes, even though corrupted, have lively charm in them. It also sports more humor than most of his works. Leonardo DiCaprio brings a top notch performance; he has done everything that could be asked of him, perhaps more. At times he looks like a raging preacher driven by wealth, other times he drools uncontrollably in his inebriated state, making audience wonder if he's actually under influence.<br/><br/>Some of the better moments come as DiCaprio narrates them as Belfort. It's pretty insightful to the character and practically how a person would normally react. Cast does decent job, but aside Jonah Hill as Belfort's sloppy right hand, the rest of the firm is a bit one dimensional, amplified by the everlasting plague of being stoned to death. Margot Robbie as the love interest and sex icon is admittedly gorgeous; she brings a pint of silliness, but gives a quality performance on latter scenes.<br/><br/>The movie's three hours span is overly lengthy; I believe there are some debauchery acts that could be reduced, for repetition of people merrily intoxicated may overstay its welcome. For a comedy, it does provide some great chuckles along the way. Script and screenplay are certainly good, but it lacks the layers of deception, and substitutes or even ignores complex trickery with abundance of drug usage and sexual indulgence."

","There is really not much to say about this one. Di Caprio is as brilliant as expected (that man can do any job perfectly. I'd like to see him in a SF movie or a horror, just to confirm his brilliance or to find an exception.). Mr. Scorcese did a routinely extraordinary job (being, obviously, predominantly involved in Boardwalk Empire) and the rest of the cast follows correctly. Writing was also extraordinary, considering (it shows!) thin source material (book by the main character). Even the duration is not too extensive, although one could cut out, say, half an hour of irrelevant material, erratically put here and there. The greed and being eager to show off are so common characteristics of humans and ever thankful material to write (and make movies) about, although worn out. So, nothing new here. Capitalism at its worst (although, one could say, being rich and all, that it's OK). As long as there is money... (and yes: women DO fall for rich guys, disregarding everything else about them). One thing, though: too much swearing (showing uncontrolled emotions), waaaay too much."

","Great exposition of the excesses of Wall Street. A warts-and-all examination of how greed corrupts and drives people, and of the more hedonistic side of human nature. <br/><br/>Superb story-telling by Martin Scorsese, aided by Terrance Winter's (of Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire fame) excellent screenplay and Jordan Belfort's own book. <br/><br/>Yes, it is three hours long, but it doesn't feel like it. It is that engrossing and fast-paced. The only time I did feel it was a tad too long was near the end, as some of the run-ins with the law and legal wranglings seemed like padding.<br/><br/>Hilariously funny at times, while still preserving a biopic's sense of drama. In some ways, this is a minor problem, as you veer from screamingly funny scenes to dead-serious scenes, and you keep waiting for a punchline.<br/><br/>Excellent performances all round. Will be interesting to see if Leonardo Di Caprio finally gets an Oscar, as the Academy seem determined to never give him one...<br/><br/>Jonah Hill almost steals the show though. Well deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. His transformation into a dramatic actor is complete.<br/><br/>Good support from a host of stars, not all of which have prominent roles: Rob Reiner, Matthew McConaughey, Jean Dujardin, Kyle Chandler, Joanna Lumley, John Favreau, Shea Wigham.

"mayburyg","8","0","3","27 January 2014"," The Wolf of Wall Street - ""That's America man!""
","This is a great film – a class act. <br/><br/>However, the 'blogomentary' about whether Jordan Belfort was a scumbag or not or whether this film glorifies his real-life escapades is missing the point. Scorcese's and DiCaprio's achievement with this epic, monumentally amoral cinematic portrayal of American decadence, degeneracy and depravity is immense and - oddly or not - immensely satisfying. <br/><br/>It is a film after all; first and foremost it should be viewed in this light, albeit one that is truly deserving of an Oscar for Marty and for Leo (and I would argue, for the screenplay and possibly a few other categories to boot, (e.g. production design, cinematography). <br/><br/>And if we think Belfort is a ""scumbag lowlife"" who just happened to live the high life at the expense of others, it's scary to think that there are not only plenty more ""Belforts"" out there like him, but that they are - individually - even bigger ""scumbag lowlifes"" than him. And collectively? Well, let's not even go there shall we? <br/><br/>In the end, Belfort was a bit player, a bottom feeder in the Great Ponzi Scheme that is Wall Street. At least he got to pay a penalty (of sorts, anyways). Which is much more than we can say about the bigger, much more amoral ""scumbags"" that brought the financial system of the world to the brink, and most of whom (Bernanke, Summers, Geithner anyone?) were called in by firstly Bush Two – and his Judas-goat successor, Obama – to 'fix' the system after it went pear shaped. To paraphrase one of the characters in The Wire when questioned why players kept allowing the character 'Snotboogie' in the neighbourhood crap-game despite his penchant for skimming the booty and scamming the other players - he replied, ""that's America, man!"" <br/><br/>And without a radical revolution in the way America 'manages' its wholly dysfunctional financial system just for starters - not to mention a complete overhaul of the anomalous values and warped ideals underpinning the much touted 'American Dream' that seem to inhibit anything remotely resembling institutional reform – the ""Belforts"" will just keep on a-coming. Without that aforementioned reform, it will be like playing ""Whack-a-Mole""! <br/><br/>For every 'chancer' like Jordan Belfort, there are a 10,000+ suckers, marks and mugs out there inhabiting the American Dreamscape who will readily buy into someone else's get rich quick scheme/scam because they are unable to resist the siren call that soundtracks that Dreamscape"". If we allow it to do so, Scorsese's achievement lets us reflect on that unnerving, disturbing reality, and maybe, just maybe, give some of us pause about where we are going and what we are prepared to do to get there.<br/><br/>In simple terms, this is one of the best films I've seen in years - as acidic social commentary and darkly, pitch-black satire alone it works a treat, and then some. After much of the dross we get inundated with that passes for quality storytelling/filmmaking, to some degree it has restored my faith in the ability of the movie business to actually make films that mean something and are relevant to the modern world. Indeed, WOWS is one of modern cinema's greatest amorality tales, although I'm not sure that was what Scorsese intended. <br/><br/>As for entertainment, well I for one was royally entertained. For those who do view it and feel the same way and yet might be worried by that, then maybe you should view it as a ""guilty pleasure"". It works for me. For that matter I didn't realize Scorcese had such a flair for comedy. I was pissing myself at some of the scenes.<br/><br/>For further deliberations on the American Dream not too far removed from Belfort and his cohort - and other amorality tales from the Land of the Doodle Dandies - go here. <br/><br/>http://poxamerikana.wordpress.com - then Search ""State of the Disunion Part 1"""

"johnnymurphy15","8","0","2","27 January 2014"," A crazy, satirical account of over indulgence.
","Like Goodfellas and Casino, Martin Scorsese goes back to his portrayal of big time criminals, but this time taking place in the worlds most notorious financial district, Wall Street. Stylistically, we see the familiar devices including freeze frames, elaborate set design and camera set ups, self aggrandising narration from the main character and of course, a story of extreme excess. Money is of course the driving force for all the things it can afford, in this case, lots of sports cars, designer suits, a high maintenance blonde wife, a mansion, drugs, prostitutes etc. This is the life of Wall Street trader and big time swindler Jordan Belfort (Leonardo Di Caprio).<br/><br/>Scorsese does what he does best and portrays another character highly addicted to excess by showing his rise to being a big time swindler and all the excesses that comes along with it, to his world falling apart as the huge amounts of drugs impairs his focus and others around him, as well as attracting the attention of tenacious FBI agent Denham (Kyle Chandler), who eventually brings down Belfort's empire and puts him in a position where he has to 'rat' on his fellow cohorts for a lesser sentence.<br/><br/>The film seems to have gained an equal amount of praise and criticism. Much of the criticism is directed towards how it is a shallow and empty film which does not do enough to criticise Belfort's lifestyle. I personally thought that much of Scorsese's intention was to plunge the viewer into Belfort's over-indulgent, manic, materialistic world where money transcends morals and everything else meaningful. Scorcese and writer Terence Winter do not hold back at all. The office parties which include prostitutes and drugs in monumental proportions, the long speeches glorifying the 'greed is good' philosophy which makes Gordon Gekko look like Castro, the general obnoxious and misogynistic behaviour drug induced or sometimes through just being high on power are all portrayed to be so over the top that it becomes an entertaining and satirical look a life of over excess. Many scenes can be highlighted, like Mark Hanna ( Matthew McConaughey) who is Belfort's mentor explains the importance of masturbating twice a day to cope with the stresses of being a broker. There are many scenes of drug taking which gets so excessive, he becomes a coked up mess. One extended scene when he takes a rare sleeping pill which effects an important conversation on a payphone about how the FBI have Belforts phones tapped. When he eventually looses the ability to speak and control of his bodily functions, we see him crawl to his sports car to drive home to try and get his business associate Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) off his phone. What we see is a scene so crazy and shouty, not to mention tragically pathetic, it is manically hilarious. Basically, I think we are invited into look at this mans over the top life and rather than be disgusted at his behaviour, I found it to be so OTT to the point of farcical. The narration of Belfort's schemes are intentionally confusing as financial schemes often are to swindle people who do not know any better. We hear Belfort attempt to explain to us exactly how he is doing this, but during a piece to camera narration, he directly assumes to the audience that he has lost us. I do admit some people will find this film a difficult watch as 3 hours is a lot of time invested into such an unlikable character. I personally don't mind watching films about characters I don't like as there is a side of me that is curious to see how they live and how they justify such appalling morals and behaviour. The fact that there is no moral judgement or no realisation of the Belfort's errors only reflects the honesty that people like that are borderline sociopaths who do not give a s**t about anyone but themselves. A scene which highlights this is one of his rousing speeches towards the end where he claims he helped people when they applied for his firm. He says in what seems like a genuine heartfelt way that he loves each and everyone of one of his employees. However, he does not show this when he rats them out at the end so he can get a three year sentence. It shows he is a coward and that he has no real love for anyone. <br/><br/>Like most films, Scorsese gets the best out of his actors. Leonardo Di Caprio puts on a visceral over the top performance which is probably the performance of his career. Jonah Hill is proving more than ever that he is not just a Judd Apatow regular, but a versatile actor to be taken seriously. He plays someone that is equally unlikable and chauvinistic and does it with aplomb. Sometimes Scorsese takes risks with newcomers, but I think it pays off with ex Neighbour's star Margot Robbie. Will she be the new face of god-awful romantic comedies or will she continue to pick up credible roles? I believe she has the talent to do the latter. Also Rob Reiner is great as 'Mad' Max Belfort, Jordan Belfort's father. He maybe mad, but is often the voice of reason. Matthew McConaughey has some of the films most memorable moments, even though he has around 5 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>It may not quite rank along the dizzying heights of Scorsese's best work, but it sure does in my opinion work in it's own right. It is a significant film of it's time where people are increasingly loosing the trust of the banking system. I think this portrays the madness and the depravity of what went on and still continues to happen in Wall Street while still being entertaining and often very funny.<br/><br/>See My Reviews at www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com"

"jamesashleysmith-884-910475","7","0","1","27 January 2014"," Outrageous film, Genius acting, but is it too long?
","The Wolf of Wall Street sees Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite for the first time since Shutter Island.<br/><br/>After seeing the trailer I was thoroughly looking forward to what looked like a hugely entertaining film about greed, greed and erm, more greed. So what's the premise, well it's pretty simple. Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), and Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), set up a business together selling anything and everything to rich people with too much money. The film charts their success and shows the ridiculous things that happen behind the​ ​closed doors on Wall Street.<br/><br/>The film starts at a furious pace and the viewer is thrust straight into the crazy mix that is Belfort's world. You see dwarfs being thrown at targets, naked women walking around the office and a monkey handing out payslips. ​Just like my Monday morning. ;)​<br/><br/>So is this film what you expect, well I would say yes​,​ it is. It is stupid, outrageous but most importantly entertaining. You laugh out loud in most scenes but then remember that this guy is a real person. It makes you a little sick but I guess that's the idea. <br/><br/>DiCaprio is perfect as the lead role and is totally believable as this arrogant, money grabbing​ Lothario​ . Hill is the surprise of the film and is brilliant as his goofy sidekick​.​ <br/><br/>So this film could of been a 9 out of 10 but why isn't it? Well firstly the film is three hours long and to be honest it really doesn't need to be. Some scenes are over-indulgent ​with Scorsese​ deciding to let them run for fifteen minutes even when they don't develop the story. T​he 2nd hour is not much different than the first. Yes it is still entertaining but when the story is not necessarily moving forwards you question why Scorsese kept the film as long as it is. <br/><br/>​The ending (without giving it away) is just okay and the whole story is a little underwhelming. In the end you don't really like any of the characters but the superb acting and funny script keeps you enjoying it until the end. Very good but could of been great?"
"JPfanatic93","8","0","2","27 January 2014"," Scorsese and DiCaprio's finest collaboration thus far
","You might be inclined to ask yourself, 'a three-hour movie about money, how can that be the least bit interesting?' Don't worry, for Martin Scorsese's grand 'dramedy' The Wolf of Wall Street is not a movie about money. The lead character himself directly acknowledges this fear early on by stating that 'we wouldn't be interested in all that stuff', afterwards largely avoiding the subject altogether. So don't go in expecting any dreary financial number crunching, since it's really all about what money does with people. People, inherently flawed, get progressively flawed – read: effed up – as their income increases astronomically. Meanwhile, every sense of ethics, responsibility or even plain decency goes right out the window. Scorsese's case in point: Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>Belfort, a superb piece of acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, starts out as many a regular Joe from the middle class: screwed over by a financial crash and reduced to unemployment, unable to provide for his<br/><br/>wife. All the more disappointing for him as he had just found a job at a large Wall Street firm, where his boss (an impeccably loathsome Matthew McConaughey) saw his potential and advised him not to abstain of sex and drugs while on this job. Thanks to Belfort's talent for aggressive sales pitching, he quickly recuperates selling worthless stock at a fifty percent commission rate, and before long he returns to Wall Street triumphantly with a loyal band of peculiar misfits in his wake (including Jonah Hill on steroids), all of whom have their specific place in his grand scheme of taking money from the ignorant masses that hope to make a quick buck. The only one making easy money are Jordan and his friends though, and before long they become increasingly desensitized to the plight of their clients in favor of their own ruthless acquisition of wealth. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is born, and despite Jordan's all too human persona, such a term fits him perfectly, as this alpha male and his pack of wild dogs scour the land preying on the weak and gullible to feast upon their cash in a financial frenzy. One that seemingly knows no bounds, as Belfort continues his practices for years without sanctions, despite ongoing FBI scrutiny. Nevertheless, Belfort needs no help in bringing him down, as he does a fine job at that on his own.<br/><br/>In many ways The Wolf of Wall Street is a fairly typical story of a man gaining the world but losing his soul in the process, as he is unable to keep his base instincts in check. Arguably, it's not the plot that makes the movie stand out, it's the way Scorsese tells it to his audience. Walking a fine line between comedy and drama that finds both in perfect balance throughout the whole, The Wolf of Wall Street proves infectiously hilarious at one moment and effectively poignant the next. As Jordan's novel lifestyle as a millionaire progressively takes its toll, his personal life spirals ever more out of control emotionally and physically as his constant drive for more and more dominates his every move. Fondly remembering his former boss' advice, Belfort sets out on a course of rampant sex and drugs without worrying about any consequences, as money will no doubt solve any obstacles in his path. Small wonder his wife soon leaves him as she finds him snogging a super model. Marrying said model doesn't increase the happiness in his family life, children notwithstanding. Abusing every conceivable illicit substance imaginable also doesn't work in his favor. Despite the many yachts, limousines, prostitutes and drugs, Scorsese makes it amply clear that this is not a life to be envied as Belfort's once decent personality is replaced by a greedy, amoral and self-annihilating character that can only get the better of him, sooner if not later. Having become a veritable slave of money, Belfort remains miserable, and we wouldn't have it any other way, as his road to a personal hell is paved with one outrageously funny messed up situation after another.<br/><br/>Aside from DiCaprio's top performance, Scorsese gets the very best out of his cast and crew in conveying this tale of human deterioration at the hands of boundless greed, which often borders on the unbelievable. Exploding planes, savage storms at sea, goldfish eating, dwarf tossing and the generally lavish parties of debauchery at the office heralding the weekend are among the many elements of The Wolf of Wall Street that are so absurd, they can only be true. In terms of comedy, nothing beats the delayed kicking-in of exceptionally rare drugs that causes a most unwelcome physical reaction at an hour of crisis at which the need to get home fast results in one of the most humorous car scenes ever on the big screen. Despite all the controversy, the many scenes of nudity and excessive swearing feel rightfully placed, and credit must be given to both the director and his brave cast to stick with such daring material instead of catering to a general sense of good public taste, something Belfort severely lacked. The fast paced, witty dialogue written by Terence Winter proves to be in excellent hands of the assembled cast of seasoned actors, including the likes of Jean Dujardin, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Kyle Chandler and Joanna Lumley. Stylistically there's little to comment against the picture as the ingenious editing, wonderful cinematography and delightful score, featuring many a successful callback to the period in question, are found to be in perfect sync to make for a superior cinematic experience. But The Wolf of Wall Street at its heart remains another intimate collaboration between the grandmaster Scorsese and his personal muse DiCaprio, their fifth and finest thus far. The duo makes damn sure you care enough about Belfort to run along with him for three hours, but never are you really allowed to sympathize with him, given his deplorable nature."

","My first thought afterwards was ' wow a lot of people, particularly men, are going to walk away from this and say ""yeah I wanna be a stock broker too""! regardless of the message told through this movie '. Admittedly I felt the same way, especially seeing Jordan Belfort and his colleagues enjoying themselves so much. I mean c'mon booze, hookers, lavish parties, drugs, good times, who doesn't want that; at least a little bit? But that's the hook all sales jobs promise: if you work hard, don't be discouraged by failures and have the ambition to succeed then you will. Because everyone can be a millionaire right? Wrong. Not everyone can be otherwise millionaires would be everywhere. Truth is you can bust your guts and you may not make anywhere as much as you desired. Big bosses need bums in seats to make them money not you.<br/><br/>And that's exactly what Jordan Belfort does. He even admits this during the film. Of course the commission paid to his workers made them a decently living but the real income goes to Belfort. And he makes a lot! To much to know what to do with.<br/><br/>Through all the funny situations (and there is plenty of those) we see Belfort and co. revelling in greed and success. This obvious draws the attention of the law and it's their stupidity that becomes their undoing, despite some very lucky turns of fortunate beforehand.<br/><br/>The first lesson I learnt from this movie is to name your price and get out when you reach it. That's what a strategically minded investor would do instead of being greedy.<br/><br/>The second lesson is if you're doing something illegal and you draw attention to yourself you will get caught eventually. Not if but when.<br/><br/>It does have some shortcomings. For the sake of entertainment what they actually sell and how they do it is glossed over because the focus is upon what happens, not why. I also didn't like the pace of the film as it has so much to tell a lot of it is rushed, which explains why they gloss over details for the sake of timing.<br/><br/>This is a thoroughly entertaining movie about making money that has more relevance in this decade than prior films before it."

Set those thoughts aside, the pleasure-seeking, self gratification is essential to portray the characters.<br/><br/>I do feel the film should have been shorter, 3 hours is unnecessary with much of the content featuring Jonah Hill overly long and serving no purpose in any way, not funny and not developing anything but this does not spoil the overall enjoyment. Ultimately The Wolf is simply a roller coaster ride portraying the amazing rise and fall of a very creative, driven, lucky and yes... criminal, genius and, if you're not offended by bad language and nudity, well worth the ride it is!"
"evancyl","9","0","3","26 January 2014"," One man's rise and fall on Wall Street, brilliantly played
","The Wolf of Wall Street charts the spectacular rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, who goes from humble penny stock broker to multimillionaire and founder of his own brokerage, Stratton Oakmont. It's an adventure fueled by plenty of drugs, alcohol and sex, and we see Belfort's values change drastically along the way. As a broker, he wanted to create win-win situations for himself and the client, but it quickly became all about squeezing clients dry, even if it meant engaging in fraud. As a husband, he wanted to stay faithful but soon turned to hookers and later divorced his wife to be with the gorgeous Naomi, whom he regularly cheated on. The corporate culture he created at Stratton Oakmont strongly bore his personal imprint. Eventually, the long arm of the law caught up with Belfort and he found himself ratting on friends and colleagues to lessen his penalty.<br/><br/>I think this film gives fantastic insight into Wall Street culture: the testosterone-charged environment, the extravagant lifestyle, the lack of ethics and the close ties between men. The screenplay and acting were brilliant. Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort was so persuasive selling those worthless penny stocks, and I loved watching his eager-to-learn friends hang on his every word. He exuded charisma when speaking to his staff at each important point in the firm's history. His bumbling friends provided plenty of comic relief as well. I also like how the story was told from Belfort's perspective, allowing us to get inside his head at certain points. The part where he entered ""cerebral palsy phase"" due to a drug overdose and drove the car home, thinking that no mishap occurred when he had actually caused a heck load of damage - that was hilarious. Although we roughly knew what the end would be, seeing it all unravel was no less exciting."

","Martin Scorsese comes back strong this brilliant movie that is The Wolf of Wall Street, which is very funny from end to end but whose dramatic aspect, Jordan Belfort's lightning ascent, is also totally captivating.<br/><br/>Terrence Winter's writing is once again exceptional, Scorsese is at the top of his form behind the camera, the movie is fluid, dynamic, the editing is top-notch and a few exhilarating scenes will remain for sure in the annals such as the briefing at the restaurant or Jordan's to his new associates in their freshly rented garage.<br/><br/>Every character has its place and brings something, the cast is flawless, Leonardo DiCaprio embodies with brio this « guru » and can certainly aspire to win an already amply deserved Oscar, and Jonah Hill proves once again his tremendous comical potential, too bad Matthew McConaughey didn't have a more important role.<br/><br/>The movie lasts three hours but time flies, except maybe during the last half hour a bit laborious at times, which probably could have been cut to 15-20 minutes.<br/><br/>Tbe Wolf of Wall Street nevertheless remains at worse excellent, at best a true masterpiece."

","""The Wolf of Wall Street"" was as good as I expected it. The great acting and the special humor stands out. I felt very entertained when I saw the movie, but in my opinion it was a little bit to long. It lasts circa three hours. It would be easy to reduce the length about a half hour. Rather they should have invested more time in the complexity of the story. But as I said before - ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a great movie with extraordinary acting and very funny moments. I think the best way to see it is at home on Blue Ray or DVD, so you could press the pause button. Three hours in a cinema seat in a movie without a spellbinder plot can be hard.

"Troy_Campbell","8","0","4","25 January 2014"," Just shy of vintage Scorsese.
","It's rare to see an R18+ motion picture get a cinematic release these days, what with it not being financially ripe and such stuff, so it's fantastic that Martin Scorsese's tale of debauchery and greed didn't get shunned by the mainstream cinemas. After the family-friendly (and superb) Hugo, Scorsese has returned to his fascination of crime with this recount of stockbroker Jordan Belfort's financial rise through illegal trading and how he threw his millions away on drugs, parties and, well, whatever the hell he liked. It's a crazy ride, and the master director digs deep into his bag of tricks – trippy zooms, unbroken takes, toying with aspect ratios and camera lenses – to keep the pace rollicking and pulse thumping. Arguably the highlight among all of the course language, nudity, sexual activity, drug use and all round obscene behaviour is the central performance from Leonardo DiCaprio. This is Leo at his most daring and intense; his Belfort is a slimy, selfish, egocentric douchebag who is eminently watchable and somehow, against all odds, even manages to retain a slither of our sympathy. Wolf is not quite vintage Scorsese, however, even at 71 years old, the man with classics like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas and The Departed on his C.V. proves he is still at the forefront of filmmaking in Hollywood."
"louis1610","9","0","3","25 January 2014"," Genius
","The wolf of Wall Street is pure genius. The main character, Jordan Belfort, portrayed brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a criminal in all sense of the word but Scorsese's portrayal of the story has you wanting Belfort to get away with everything he has done. This kind of genius directing only comes from the best.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the whole film from selling penny slips to making the big time, the hardcore drugs, elaborate parties, hookers and the comical value brought through. I find it hard to believe after everything that Jordan Belfort is still alive. <br/><br/>Despite the long 3 hour length of the film I feel it was necessary to get every detail in. The cast was brilliant and I couldn't fault any of the performances. I must also mention that Jonah Hill's more serious role of character to his usual comic roles shows his true talent as a rising star in Hollywood."

In that case, by all means take the three hours and bury yourself in this creative debauchery.<br/><br/>I don't think there are many virile men out there who wouldn't love this long escapade into money, drugs and loose women.

"samfran94","8","0","2","25 January 2014"," The Academy will be 'crying Wolf'!
","If I could sum up 'The Wolf of Wall Street' I would say it's a film that you definitely wouldn't want to watch with your parents. Why you may ask? I'll tell you, Scorsese and DiCaprio's fifth outing together is an unparallelled roller-coaster ride of twists and turns, highs and lows fuelled by drugs, alcohol, gambling, hedonism and million dollar business deals. To cut a long story short it might it's incredible! ... but might be a little awkward to watch with your folks around.<br/><br/>Without sounding like I'm jumping on the bandwagon I honestly feel this could be the year that Leonardo DiCaprio breaks his infamous 'Oscar curse'. He is in sensational form as Jordan Belfort, the eponymous 'Wolf'. We first meet Jordan as an innocent 22 year old, a fish out of water in the overwhelming world of the New York stock market, trying to make a name for himself. Over the course of the early 1990s we retrace the Wolf's steps as he transforms from a humble family man to a ruthless, domineering drug addict raking in $49m a year and gallivanting with legions of gorgeous women. However, the fabric of Belfort's success soon begins to unravel as he is pursued by the authorities, becomes consumed by addiction and greed, and is alienated by those closest to him. The way the character self-destructs is captured brilliantly by DiCaprio, he appeals to our empathetic side playing a broken man who couldn't quit while he was ahead. DiCaprio brings raw energy to a role that demands it. He exudes charisma and seamlessly slips into Belfort's 'Wolf' persona conveying his dizzying highs and tormenting lows through his god-given acting talent. If he is overlooked by the Academy this year, cries of 'fix' and 'conspiracy' could very well ring throughout the auditorium.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's job is certainly made a hell of lot easier by the truly delicious cast Scorsese has assembled around him. Also tipped for Oscar success (Best Supporting Actor) is Jonah Hill, playing Belfort's neurotic business partner Donnie Azoff. It was recently revealed that Hill took the SAG's minimum pay of $60,000 for this role, simply because he was desperate to work with Scorsese, one of his heroes. This enthusiasm is immediately apparent as he takes to the role like a duck to water. Hill is now quickly establishing himself as hot property on the Hollywood scene, and distancing himself from his 'gross-out' comedy roots. His chemistry with DiCaprio is effortless and unforced, creating a warm, humorous and believable relationship upon which the movie fundamentally survives. <br/><br/>Also doing well, although a little underused I felt, is the silver screen's 'Renaissance Man' Matthew McConaughey as broker Mark Hanna who first shows Jordan the ropes. The 'chest-beating' scene is definitely one for the ages! Similarly impressive are Rob Reiner as Jordan's hot- tempered father, Joanna Lumley as Emma his demure and seductive aunt, and P.J. Byrne as 'Rugrat' one of his 'merry men' in the office ensuring the money, among incalculable line of cocaine, keeps piling up.<br/><br/>The performance I really enjoyed however was Margot Robbie as Naomi, Belfort's second wife. Robbie's contribution to the movie is brilliant, and that's not just me speaking as a warm-blooded male. The young Australian beauty conveys incredible emotion and vulnerability as she is tossed back and forth between both ends of Belfort's precarious spectrum. The sheer euphoria of their wedding in the Caribbean and the million dollar yachts, and the plight and terror of being dominated by an increasingly overbearing, drug-dependent, almost bipolar husband. At the tender age of 23 the future certainly looks bright for Robbie. She is already being touted to star as Jane in David Yates' upcoming 'Tarzan', and with performances like this no one will dare question any such casting decisions.<br/><br/>The editing and cinematography, although unorthodox, are also fantastic juxtaposing a sober and intoxicated Belfort beautifully. Scorsese essentially knocks another one out of the ball park, which is no less than anyone expected, and if he can continue to churn out movies of such high calibre in the future he will only further cement his position as one of cinema's greatest ever directors.<br/><br/>The only criticism I would perhaps make, and I really am being picky here, is the running time. At 3 hours Scorsese's movie incurs, a probably unavoidable mid-movie slump. We see 'The Wolf' make his rise but before the fall begins, I'll admit there was a slight lapse in my concentration. The movie seemed to drop off a little bit before it picked up its exhilarating, high octane drama again. But I'll admit I am just looking for a needle in a hay stack here, a small blip on an otherwise fabulous movie, that MUST bring home some gold at this year's Oscars!"

"hsolaf","10","0","5","23 January 2014"," Wolf Of Wall St. Scorcese-Di Caprio Masterpiece Shocks And Delights!
","In their film Wolf Of Wall Street director Martin Scorcese and actor Leonardo Di Caprio shock and delight us with a sweet and passionate director-actor collaboration. Scorcese has directed his most coherent artistic parable, providing us with exhilarating fun as well as thoughtful meaning. Leonardo may have become with this performance into the best actor of his generation, both dramatic and-who knew?Comic!The movie rocks and rattles us, providing us with orgiastic highs and depressive lows. We are drawn into Jordan Belfort's (Di Caprio's character) roller coaster, money-sex-drugs immoral existence like a butterfly to the flames.I left the the movie house in a cathartic trance, a sour taste and an alarmed distaste for the ways and values of Wall Street.<br/><br/>On a gut level, I hadn't had so much film fun ever since Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.(I laughed harder in this one.) On an intellectual and moral level, this film jolts us. Not one weak link in the ensemble of actors. They are all so crude and real and funny as hell. Also, they are as ugly and not-glamorized bunch of motherf--s in expensive suits as I never saw. The cinematography is like a Hyeronimus Bosch hellish landscape. The marvelous script by Terence Winter rings true and delivers the intended message. But no doubt, this is Leo Di Caprio's movie. He brilliantly carries all three hours of it with exuberant dynamic energy, mesmerizing charisma and total credibility. Also funny;stunningly so!<br/><br/>The comic relief is what makes the constant barrage of money , sex and drugs tolerable. The barrage is deliberate, the director wants us to be repulsed, but he makes the medicine go down by adding huge spoonfuls of humor. No one should refrain from seeing this movie because of the bacchanalia. I guarantee you will laugh your head off. The orgy scenes are not erotic, they make the characters seem absurd and ridiculous. Almost every scene has some kind of humor in it,subtle, slapstick, satirical, physical, visceral, tongue-in-cheek. Di Caprio is funny and intense in scene after scene. One long, scene of great physical humor in which Leo's Belfort,chock-full of drugs, drags himself home to alert his buddy Donny(Jonah Hill) of FBI danger, may become a movie slapstick classic. <br/><br/>Leonardo's great acting fête, besides profiting from Scorcese at his godly directorial best, is dependent on a terrific ensemble of actors. Jonah Hill, playing Jordan's best buddy-business partner, is the perfect complement to Di Caprio's acting. I can't over-emphasize how essential Hill's colorful chemistry is in tickling our funny bone, warming our hearts, and keeping the movie rolling.<br/><br/>As Jordan's trophy 2nd wife,Margot Robbie , a ravishing Aussie with the funniest Brooklyn accent,should be commended for her rich and nuanced special performance. Kyle Chandler,in subtle and resonant acting as the pursuing cop, has a read-between-the-lines philosophical banter with his nemesis.In cinema-noir fashion, they have a well written,battle of wits confrontation on Jordan's yacht. Who has the right world view? They go at each other verbally,but no one really wins.Rob Reiner as Jordan's accountant dad, delights us with warmth and humor in some very good scenes. Matthew McConnaughey has a rambunctious,hilarious cameo as Jordan's cynical, first Wall Street mentor. Every role is alluring and well played. Even the stylish Aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley) an unlikely money launderer.<br/><br/>Central to the whole film is Belfort's mentor, quasi-religious relationship as sales guru to his stockbroker followers. The movie's best scenes are the frenzied rallies Di Caprio delivers with Elmer Gantry passion to his rowdy bunch of cohorts. Their loving and symbiotic link is presented by Scorcese with Fellinesque gusto and skill, and played with fascinating brilliance and credibility by Di Caprio.It's hard not to be drawn into the Jordan & Co. emotion-filled rituals. It's hard not to feel for them, albeit with great ambivalence.<br/><br/>We laugh and grieve at the same time. Scorcese takes us once again into his journey into American darkness. Not the mafia this time, but the sins and excesses of Wall Street, and also into the immoral corruption of the American dream. This might be disturbing to free-market entrepreneurs;so the movie may have a built-in resistance for some. Another likely group that may find the movie off-putting, even repulsive, is those respectable citizens who don't approve of sex, nudity and orgies portrayed in films even if it has redeeming purpose.(Movie has been banned by Kenya and some Arab countries.)Too bad. I find the film as good as Orson Welles Citizen Kane, a must-see for anyone who sees film as catharsis through art and a potential instrument in cultural growth. It definitely puts the orgies of stocks, money, sex and drugs into the right perspective. It provides us with food for thought and a re-evaluation of our professional, economic and personal goals, lest we fall as Jordan and friends into the abyss of a meaningless, hellish existence."
"shawneofthedead","9","0","3","23 January 2014"," A brilliant character study that doubles as razor-sharp social commentary.
","It comes as no surprise, of course, that Martin Scorsese has found a new muse. After his career-defining work with Robert De Niro over three decades, Scorsese has turned his camera on Leonardo DiCaprio, with whom he's now made five movies in the space of about ten years. That's a pretty impressive number, and a statistically unlikely good set of films to boot. The Wolf Of Wall Street is easily the finest of the lot: a high-wire, high-octane corporate comedy that's as entertaining as it is excoriating - a delicious blast of hellfire distilled into the year's most outrageous biopic.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) is a clean-cut kid who starts working in one of Wall Street's top stockbroking firms in 1987. His boss Mark (Matthew McConaughey) is a vision of Jordan's future: a man corrupted inside and out, marching to his own odd tribal chant, hopelessly hooked on drugs, alcohol, women and money. When Black Monday forces Jordan to take a job selling penny stocks to the gullible lower class, he picks up a few more tricks of the trade. He resolves to set up his own company that will earn him and his buddies untold sums of money. Soon, he is the talk of the financial sector, and his profligate ways earn him the scrutiny of the federal authorities.<br/><br/>Many have cried foul over the moral bankruptcy that purportedly riddles Scorsese's film. Detractors have argued that The Wolf Of Wall Street seems to be celebrating Jordan's way of life and the varied excesses in which he indulges and soon comes to take for granted. Certainly, having it all strung together - constant drug-taking, casual sex, unchecked profanity, dwarf-flinging competitions - can indeed be too much for viewers of a more sensitive or conservative disposition.<br/><br/>But there is no glorification of Jordan's lifestyle in The Wolf Of Wall Street. It's placed front and centre, and then mined for a constant stream of bitter, brilliant black comedy. We are not meant to sympathise with Jordan, though we can certainly be charmed by him as many of the people he encounters invariably are. Even while we are kept endlessly amused by his increasingly desperate attempts to stay rich and privileged, there is never a point when we're asked to emulate or respect this man. In fact, it becomes clearer as the film goes on that we're not laughing with him - we're laughing at him, as he sinks into a murky swamp almost entirely of his own making.<br/><br/>It's exhilarating to watch Scorsese weave a rich and ever thicker tapestry of depravity around Jordan. Despite clocking in at a hefty three hours, the film feels like it's sprinting throughout: running at full-tilt in the same way that Jordan is living - and no doubt shortening - his life. Pouring copious amounts of drugs and drink into his body, he brings his friend Donnie (Jonah Hill; hilarious) with him, moving from the sticks to the big time. He trades in his first wife, practical brunette Teresa (Cristin Milioti; biting) for blonde bombshell Naomi (Margot Robbie; more than meets the eye). When things start to go south, he charms Naomi's Aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley; saucy) into fronting a bank account for him in Switzerland.<br/><br/>Along the way, Scorsese has crafted his funniest picture in years. Comedy isn't a genre that one typically associates with him: he brings to mind brooding gangster epics, boiling with crime, passion and cold hard cash. Well, those three elements are present and accounted for in The Wolf Of Wall Street too, but it's truly a riotous experience. There are many memorable scenes: from Jordan urgently demanding to sail his fancy yacht through the worst sea squall ever, through to a night when Donnie and Jordan dope themselves up more than even they would consciously dare to.<br/><br/>At the heart of this crazy, crime-ridden maelstrom sits DiCaprio, who delivers what is unquestionably the finest performance of his career. He's always been reliably good but, as Jordan Belfort, he's transcendent. Fierce, reckless, dark, bright, charming, foolish, clever, sly, mad, sane, desperate, confident - he slips effortlessly across this entire range of emotions and moods. It's because DiCaprio somehow manages to make this selfish monster recognisably human that detractors have fretted so at the film's alleged glorification of its lead character. However, just because we can spot glimpses of humanity beneath Jordan's loopy antics doesn't mean we are meant to condone them.<br/><br/>At the same time, DiCaprio manages to play it all just big enough for the film's physical comedy to be some of the most committed and self-assured you'll see this year. The moment when he tries to get into his car while super-duper-mega-high is the comic highlight of the entire film: an extended joke that will bring down the house even as it subtly, skilfully blends slapstick and social commentary.<br/><br/>Could The Wolf Of Wall Street have made the same points with an hour shaved off its running time? Sure. Would it have been as fun? Nope. So, if you can steel yourself for more abject depravity than you have ever seen on screen (it packs 569 'fuck's into 179 minutes), you'll be rewarded with a brilliant, blistering character study: one that applies a scalpel-sharp wit and huge helpings of irony to its main character and the world in which he lives.<br/><br/>Beyond that, Scorsese's tale is a cautionary one. Comedies often make us laugh by allowing us to forget who we are. The Wolf Of Wall Street reminds us of the depths to which humanity can sink: it stares the American Dream right in the face, and suggests that pursuing it can lead straight down a rabbit hole lined with heroin, hookers and hubris. For a Hollywood film, that's bold. For a comedy - that's unprecedented."
"jjsantangelo","9","0","4","23 January 2014"," Scorcese does not disappoint.
","This movie is a modern rags to riches story about a decent guy turned into scumbag, stockbroker, drug addict who becomes filthy rich, and I loved it. It portrays the main character's lifestyle as a debaucherous, decadent indulgence that rivals that of Ancient Rome. Overall the acting is great but I think Leo's performance starts out a little hokey when he first puts on the New York accent, which is why I gave it a 9, but it improves after the first twenty minutes. I thought the most amazing performance was Jonah Hill's, and in my opinion he definitely deserves the Academy Award. Martin Scorcese never disappoints me and if your a fan of his you will love this movie, but it's not for everyone. If you are offended by movies that contain copious amounts of sex, drugs, and greed, do not see this movie. Otherwise, this is a must see"

No other movie has satisfied me as a viewer in all the aforementioned fields like this one. The movie is based on the life of Jordan Belfort. It depicts his rise to wealthy stockbroker, his fall into corruption, addiction to drugs and involvement with criminals in a very comical and satirical manner. the movie is not to be missed, unless you are under age.

","There isn't much that I can add to the positive reviews that I've read here, except to say that in my opinion it is both Scorcese's and DiCapprio's best work. I saw the Spanish dubbed version of the film, and it was excellent, but I hope to see it in English at some point in the future. It would appear that some reviewers were turned off by the sex and drug scenes, obviously the movie is not to be enjoyed by all. As for my own personal bias, I believe the movie gives an entertaining depiction of how some portion of the 1% elect to spend their money, and, reading that the real life Mr. Bedfort only spent 22 months in prison, something of an indirect commentary of the failings of judicial systems to adequately punish fraud. Of course, the lesson applies to Spain and many other countries experiencing corruption as well as the US.<br/><br/>Overall, the performance was excellent and the three hours that I spent watching the movie was a great investment of my time."
"TheSquiss","10","0","5","22 January 2014"," Thrills, excites, inspires & entertains without boundaries.
","The Wolf of Wall Street is one heck of a jaunt. It out Wall Street's Wall Street, it thrills, excites, inspires and entertains without boundaries, and for three hours I was completely immersed in a world that, for the most part, I wanted to be my own.<br/><br/>Inspired by the true events of Jordan Belfort's escapades on Wall Street and beyond, The Wolf of Wall Street is a rip-roaring helter-skelter ride of dubious morality and no-holds barred excess of sex and drugs, with money trouncing rock 'n' roll. Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young stockbroker who is a casualty of Black Monday. Undaunted by the unemployment mountain and buoyed by his own brand of confidence, Jordan secures a job brokering penny shares, makes a bundle, inadvertently lands an employee, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), launches his own company, Stratford-Oakmont, reinterprets the law and embarks on an audacious journey of wealth and debauchery while the FBI gnashes its teeth.<br/><br/>Know this from the outset: The Wolf of Wall Street is not a film for those with tender minds and fragile ears. Though obvious comparisons will be made with Wall Street, its tone is more in line with Filth, and Jordan Belfort makes Gordon Gekko look like a timid convent girl.<br/><br/>While its 180-minute running time may put off some viewers short of attention and weak of bladder, Scorsese has not included a second that does not need to be upon the screen. We barely have time to think, let alone blink. An undisputed (by anyone with even a single brain cell) master of his craft, The Wolf of Wall Street is his ballsiest offering since Gangs of New York and emphasises the sheer breadth of his versatility. Yes, there's a moral in there somewhere, but that's not the point. This is an absolute joy to behold and the most outright fun I've had at the cinema since James McAvoy got down and really dirty.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is written, shot and edited so sharply that it manages to simultaneous flow smoothly and jar us sufficiently to keep our eyes wide and our backs rigidly to attention. One's pulse increases and laughter bubbles under the surface, sometimes erupting, though this is not a comedy, and the soundtrack is welded so solidly to each scene that it is not merely complimentary but integral.<br/><br/>DiCaprio has been a major Hollywood star for a long time. Titanic made him a heartthrob (to some) and he has convinced and engrossed frequently. Occasionally his performances have made us stop and reevaluate his rank amongst the Hollywood elite, most notably What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Catch Me if You Can. His performance as Jordan is cause to reassess once again. He doesn't just present Jordan as a man arrogantly living on the edge, he makes sure we know he thrives on it, loves every second of it. But even for a man as brash and self-assured as Jordan, we see the scruples, understand the hint of doubt.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie looks certain to permanently shake off the shadow of 311 episodes of Neighbours as Naomi, the second prominent woman in Belfort's life, with an assured performance that is sexy, gutsy and cruel. Likewise Rob Reiner has a ball and entertains thoroughly as the explosive Max, father of the hero, conscience of the company. But it is Jonah Hill who surprises most. Until Moneyball he was just another funny bloke in films. With The Wolf of Wall Street he is the actor who is very funny occasionally but, more importantly, is a fine actor who doesn't look remotely out of place in the limelight of a significant, box office smash. The reinvention of Jonah Hill is well underway.<br/><br/>Forget the moody, brooding Scorsese of Taxi Driver & Raging Bull, this is Scorsese letting it all hang out and ramping up the energy and impact for maximum effect. The Wolf of Wall Street is the fourth five-star film of 2014 (alas, I fear we're in for a slump once the award contenders pass) but easily the most fun of them.

The storyline is similar to that of other movies regarding stocks, shares, wall street, money laundering, and FBI invasion on companies who break the law. The introduction is easy to understand in many ways, including the optimized character personification, enhancing them to the point where one does not mix them up. Additionally, the plot isn't seen till the end, and there isn't an exciting climax.

When push comes to shove, this film is three hours of high level entertainment that feels like an ice cold milkshake on a hot summer afternoon. Pure, 'i shouldn't' but i'm gonna' enjoyment.

And that's usually fine, except, they're hating for all the wrong reasons when it comes to The wolf of Wall street .

The movie has a lot of messages about the life and how human changes under the influence of the money and gives you an idea what happens on wall street and on stoke market.

","This is the supposedly veracious story of Jordan Belfort a Long Island stockbroker who almost from nothing built a firm that kept growing through illegal schemes, defrauding clients and the State and became very wealthy leading a luxurious life in luxurious surroundings till he attracted the attention of the FBI which began to harass him till it managed to have him convicted to prison on a relatively light penalty after he made an agreement with the prosecution by which he agreed to cooperate with authorities in denouncing some of his collaborators and employees. Leonardo Di Caprio does an excellent job personifying this character. The movie scenes are very expressive and vivid in images and dialogues showing us a lot of dishonest people whose only worries are about getting the most possible money which is one of the aspects of capitalism. The screen-play is very authentic and convincing in this aspect. Money, sex, drugs and corruption galore in the behaviour of the chief characters. Summing it up, a good story, well narrated, depicted and acted."

","I have to say this film is a brilliant watch with a great mix of witty comments, comedy and over the top characters. The reason why I think this film is so good is because it kept me entertained and drawn to the story for the full duration of the movie. The film it self epitomised the energy, flair and momentum of Wall Street. There is never a maintained ""low point"" so to speak in the film and I think that Scorsese kept this movie at High very well. Leonardo Dicaprio, well there's nothing else to say, every role he plays at the minute seems to be flawless, for me there is no alternative to Dicaprio's role as Jordan Belford and I thought that Jonah Hill was a class act as Donny and would say there isn't someone I would choose as an alternative to him either. I would recommend The Wolf of Wall Street to anyone, 3 hours of my life well worth spending."

The writing in this film is great and with Leo's performance, it was a sight to see. Loved the moments of his speeches especially. The way he had with words was awesome. The acting was great by other actors too, most notable Jonah Hill. <br/><br/>The movie is about a guy who goes in stock business, has a silver tongue and builds an empire from it. The way he works, was not normal granted but it worked. It is three hours long but has great pacing and keeps you interested throughout that you won't even feel that three hours have past when the movie is done. There are no slowdowns. <br/><br/>The one thing that I really didn't like about the movie was lack of likable characters, apart from the protagonist, I don't think there were any characters I really cared for even though many got a lot of screen time. Also, ending to these type of Scorsese films were never to my liking. :p<br/><br/>Side note: The movie is NOT for young audiences. Lots of profanity, gratuitous nudity and other stuff.

","The Wolf of Wall Street is the true story about stockbroker Jordan Belfort(Leonardo DiCaprio). The movie chronicles his meteoric rise as an extremely wealthy stockbroker in New York, to his spectacular fall from grace & how he lost everything. Belfort along with his partner in crime, Donnie Azoff(Jonah Hill), dupes people into investing in loans & pocketing all the money for himself. Belfort's business expands, more and more people join & things start getting out of control. Now, it is up to FBI agent, Patrick Denham(Kyle Chandler) to stop Belfort & his get-rich-quick operation at any cost. <br/><br/>Let me just say that, I liked the film. I would like to caution you guys before going for this film. Some of you will love it. Some of you will detest it. This movie is not for people who get easily offended by heavy drug use and sex. The film is extremely funny, at times. The majority of the movie consists of a couple of guys hanging out, doing drugs & getting messed up. Though some scenes are really hilarious it gets repetitive, at times. The three hours run time doesn't help either. There are so many characters that, the viewer loses track of some of them. Though this film is really good, I liked Martin Scorsese's previous works like Shutter Island & The Departed better. The highlight of the film is the performances. Leonardo DiCaprio has given the best performance of his career. It was nice to see DiCaprio play a womanizing, cocaine snorting, sex obsessed & greedy jerk, which is completely different from all the roles he's done before. He absolutely nailed it! No matter how despicable Jordan Belfort is, you just can't hate him! That's the charm of Leonardo DiCaprio. Jonah Hill is hysterical as Donnie Azoff. Margot Robbie is impressive as Naomi Lapaglia. Kyle Chandler is great as Agent Patrick Denham. Rob Reiner is spectacular as Jordan's father, Max Belfort. Jon Bernthal is effective as Brad. Jon Favreau is good as Manny Riskin. Jean Dujardin is mind blowing as Swiss banker, Jean Jacques Saurel. Joanna Lumley is outstanding as Aunt Emma. Cristin Millioti is impressive in her small yet substantial role, as Teresa Petrillo. P.J Byrne, Kenneth Choi, Brian Sacca, Henry Zebrowski & Ethan Suplee are great as Nicky Koskoff, Chester Ming, Robbie Feinberg, Alden Kupferberg & Toby Welch respectively. Last but not the least, Matthew McConaughey is hilarious in his cameo as Mark Hanna. All in all, The Wolf of Wall Street is a must watch if you're a DiCaprio & Scorsese fan. Otherwise, it depends on what you like."

","I won't lie and say I'm a movie critic. I won't act so pretentious and use huge words to convey a small opinion on a big movie. However, I will say this. The only people who didn't like this film, are either morally self righteous, or they really don't understand the REAL sins of Wall Street. I completely understand that this film is UTTER satire. However, this small firm, which by the way, was a TRUE story, and is proved in several interviews and a memoir, doesn't even cover half the debauchery and corruption that happens in a corporate and money flooded world. This movie may have been morally disgusting, and it is on the dot about a lot of people in top million and billion dollar sales. <br/><br/>Also, to all the reviewers GASPING about him hitting Naomi, may we be reminded that she hit him first, and also threatened to take his kids the second the man lost his money? Just pointing that out. No, it wasn't OK for him to hit her, but it is equally not OK for her to hit him. <br/><br/>This movie did not say that all of this was OK. This movie showed that it does happen, and there is glory in all of it, and that is why this kind of lifestyle exists."
"cornflakeboy20","8","0","4","15 January 2014"," a gift wrapped in barbed wire
","There are a lot of reasons not to like this movie: Its run time, its celebration of bad-boy, animalistic greed, its revel in sexism and related isms. But this is a movie of moments. It reminds me a lot of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, there are scenes of ridiculous excess (I'd say the author of the true story behind 'Wolf' exaggerated quite a bit), scenes of intense drama, and then unforgettable scenes that are so well crafted you'll want to own it just to replay the scenes again. The board meeting brainstorm session over dwarf tossing, the Quaalude-fueled car chasethere are scenes that are amazing comedic gems, and genius in crafting. It is difficult to fully recommend this movie, because unlike ""Wall Street,"" the ""Greed is good"" motto here does not seem to be villainous or ironic at all. Dramatic scenes aside, many people will come out of this wanting to bilk investors on Wall Street during the 'Lude era and reap crazy rewards. The celebration of the bro workplace is like a modern ""Mad Men"" with nudity. At times, this looks to have been written as a dystopian sci fi novel by a feminist set in a future where the basest men run the economy. Even at three hours, I was alternately entertained, horrified, thrilled, at the edge of my seat. Sure, it could have lost some material. Maybe the consequences could have been amped up. But this is a work of unclassifiable genius."
"meye0875","7","0","3","14 January 2014"," Worth Seeing
","What I dislike about ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is that it has some scenes which compare drug-induced behavior to cerebral palsy or use the r-word, but it is intended to show how reprehensible people like Jordan Belfort are. I would rate the film 7.5 out of 10. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Matthew McConaughey, Margot Robie, the Amy Priestly (sp?) and the rest of the oddball cast are superb. The actresses who play Belfort's two wives are convincing in their conflict between living the life they want and their reluctance to put up with Belfort's swindling, womanizing, and misogyny. Jordan Belfort begins as a broker in 1987 at the age of 26, when he makes $49 million. When the stock market tanks later in the year, he takes a job as a stockbroker at a ""pink sheet"" company, meaning second-tier stocks that are not on par with NASDAQ or Dow Jones. Belfort nonetheless has the ""gift of the Gab"" and is able to sell almost anything and talk customers out of their money. He struggles not only with drugs and gambling but also with the FBI breathing down his neck even as he hides his ill-begotten gains in Swiss banks. Eventually someone is arrested about two hours into the movie. Without giving too much away, I will say the yacht ride through the storm in the Mediterranean Sea is one of the most exciting scenes. The movie still drags in some places, and Belfort eventually tries to give up alcohol, hired women, and Quaaludes and go legit. The nearly three hour film kept me entertained, and it hardly seemed that long; the time sure flew by. Scorsese's films sometimes run a bit longer than expected or bite off more than they can chew; this movie certainly does not lack for ambition."
"alishahmohd","9","0","6","14 January 2014"," Great Story and a Legendary performance from DiCaprio
","Films on real life stories or films based on books are not really 100% accurate as the way the events are portrayed in the movie is not exactly how things turned out in real life or how things are narrated in the book. Would it be fantastic if the real life incident or book portrayed in the film is completely accurately, of course. But that does not mean that changing the way the events unfold makes the film bad. This is where the majority of criticism for this film comes for. I personally do not agree with all that criticism, I watch films as a mode of entertainment and if a film successfully entertains me, grasps my attention, makes me get engaged in the story and characters and overall premise of their film, I will enjoy the film. So whether the films follows the book r the real life story 100% accurately is not a major concern to me. Regardless according to many outlets the films mostly stays very true to the books written by Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>The people who were affected by the real life incident have a right to be upset, no question. But the thing is that the developers of this film wanted to fit the real life scenario in the film in such a way that a variety of audience would enjoy it and find it entertaining, hence some changes.<br/><br/>The storyline follows Jordan Belfort journey, as he became a successful stock broker who made tons of money and became rich adopting a different lifestyle. Than this film shows his downfall because of the involvement of the Federal Government leading to another change in his life. That's all about I can say without giving away the whole plot. Honestly the film did not need to go 3 full hours, there were just way to many party and nude scenes, and they did slightly hurt the overall narrative. Also is it even naturally possible for someone to have so much sex and drugs without any major health issues. This film forces you to suspend your disbelief to a level to enjoy it to it's fullest.<br/><br/>Honestly skipping several of these sections in favor of progressing the actual story would have done wonders. I mean we get it, Rich people like to party, do drugs, go to strip clubs, drink alcohol what not, so many sections showing that was not needed. From what I know Jordan Belfort, in real life worked inside a Boiler Room office i am not sure abut him having such a large high-end office as shown in the film. However these party scenes are not a bore for several reasons, one of them being comedy, these scenes are the charm of the movie and are very amusing and will bring a smile to your face. <br/><br/>Regardless of this the storyline is told well, with Belfort/DiCaprio dictating his past stories and his comments are not only good at progressing the plot but they are also humorous at times. One of my worries before watching this film was that the dialogue would be too cliché but I was wrong, it was kept simple and only tell the viewers what they would easily understand they didn't go too deep in the nature of deals which is a good thing. At times DiCaprio breaks the fourth wall simply stating simple sentences rather than confusing audience with Jargons that would confuse them further. The film also maintains a balance between humor and serious storytelling.<br/><br/>The film has a large cast and all of them play their parts well. Leonardo perhaps gives his best performance ever Jordan Belfort, and that is saying something because he always gives a good performance. Everything from Leo's narration to his acting, everything is almost perfect, he was just natural in his role, from his dialogue delivery, voice intonation facial expressions everything was done to perfection. Leo honestly, without question deserves an Oscar for this amazing performance, anybody who says he can't act should just watch him here. Jonah Hill is cast as Leo's supporting character and he does what he does best give a comic relief bring humor t the film and he also does his part to progress the story. The rest of the cast do a serviceable jobs, there are several faces I did not recognize in the film and even they acted well.<br/><br/>The film like I said goes for a bit too long, it's story could have been told in a half the time honestly but even then, the 3 hours do not drag because even the filler scenes are kept entertaining with humor and will still draw a reaction out of you, while the storytelling sections are engaging and perfectly progress the plot. In the end we saw a fantastic character development and a good moral message. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this film to everyone, it is full f content which could be considered offensive or inappropriate, so it could not be watched with family or kids. The people looking for a 100% accurate portrayal of the Jordan Belfort story and his books perhaps should look elsewhere, as there are some different plot points in this movie, but if you can make do with that, most of the story stays true to Jordan's novels, according to Belfort himself, so those people who read the novel may also like this film. . If you want an entertaining film with a great storyline and good comedy, and great cast and performances, give it a go, you will love this film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I want to say that in my opinion, The Wolf of Wall street is a fantastic film, with a great story and is extremely entertaining from start to finish, without a doubt one of the best films of 2013. Overall: 9/10"

As in almost everyone of his movies , everything is so realistic and amazing at the same time. The film is funny but also touching and although it lasts 3 hours you're not able to leave your seats for even a second , as it shows no more and no less of what should be shown. Di Caprio is once again excellent portraying a true person who had and lost everything within just a few years , and he proves that no one can portray rich famous and successful characters than him. Also amazing that the film is based in a true story , although Scorcese's realistic direction would convince you it is even if it wouldn't. I have never seen a better description of the rich , luxurious but yet so corrupted and inevitably destructing lifestyle of Wall Street majors in many years.

","To start off, this movie is crazy. Drugs, orgy's, more drugs, more orgy's, partying, strippers, language, incest & basically everything. That being said, it doesn't make it a bad movie at all. It's an incredible movie. The best part about it is that during the 180 minutes of it, you are never bored, not even for a second. Even when something crazy isn't going on, you can't stop watching. Your mind doesn't drift away wondering what time it is or when the movie will be over. I am pleasantly surprised that I never got bored, considering it's lengthy film. Great filmmaking is when you have your audience's attention the entire time. And boy, did this movie do that. The movie has a great ensemble, from Leonardo DiCaprio to Jon Bernthal, from Jonah Hill to Kyle Chandler. All amazing actors. They did an outstanding job, especially Leo. I can't tell you how much I'm rooting for him to get an Oscar for this. His performance is memorable, hilarious & crazy. I loved every second of it. This movie in a whole is just very well made. I've seen quite a few of the movie that have been up for awards this year, and this one has been my favorite so far. The film just shows you a lot of how Wall Street works, which is interesting. They explain a few things throughout the film about it, not much, but enough for you to understand what exactly is happening. It's not a confusing movie, which is nice. Also something interesting is that it's based off a true story. Yes, ""based"" doesn't mean this is completely accurate to what happened, Hollywood always adds a little extra to it, but if you want to learn more about the true story, I suggest you read elsewhere because I know nothing of it. This is getting tedious, so I will wrap it up here. The highlight of the movie is definitely the acting and the pure insanity of it all. The cinematography, editing, and all that jazz is good. I'm not blown away by it, but it was very good. PLEASE GO WATCH THIS MOVIE! You will NOT be disappointed!<br/><br/>Thank you for reading!"

","I'm not sure of the validity of the happenings on Wall Street that are portrayed in this film, but there's nothing too crazy that happens with the stock exchanging that hasn't been touched upon in other movies. The background of what happens in these places, and how crazy these brokers actually were are another story. It reminded me of Mad Men in the sense that you can't believe what happens behind the scenes. This makes Mad Men look a bit like the Muppets however with the amount of violence, drug usage and.midget tossing??<br/><br/>That being said, it is ferociously entertaining. And while I don't fancy a job on Wall Street, it certainly would've been entertaining to work in a place like this for a couple days. How it managed to exist for song long without consequence is beyond me, or if it possibly still takes place. Belfort (Dicaprio) doesn't seem to regret the harm he causes on those that can't afford the stock or the drug addiction to hundreds he is feeding, and has multiple chances to escape his decisions punishment free. The performances by Dicaprio and Hill here aren't to be missed.<br/><br/>The Good: Great performances, entertaining for a weaving 3 hr. drama of a stock broker.<br/><br/>The Bad: The adult content, wow, I don't even know how this was R- rated, I think it actually broke a record for F-word usage. I would've liked to see some more time devoted to how Belfort trained his staff and worked on selling actual stocks. There are some great scenes of this in the beginning and then we don't see anymore."

","This one had all the hype in the world, and the pedigree to match. Martin Scorsese directing Leonardo DiCaprio? In a story of the rise and fall of a crook who gets on a fast track to money and success? (A proved formula for Scorsese...Goodfellas, Casino, etc...) So, slam dunk, right? Instant classic?<br/><br/>/dramatic pause<br/><br/>...Actually, yeah. It's pretty damn good.<br/><br/>Wolf of Wall Street shines in its casting. Leo's perfect for the role of Jordan Belfort. Jonah Hill gives the performance of his life (the exchange between him and Leo when Jordan asks him about his wife is hysterical). Margot Elise Robbie is in line to have her career blow up after her performance. And hey, remember that guy I mentioned before in the Grudge Match review, Jon Bernthal? That guy that was on route to becoming a star? Yep. He's right on pace. Even Matthew McConaughey steals the few scenes he's in. There are no weak links in this line-up.<br/><br/>Unlike many of Scorsese's bigger films, Wolf is just as much a dark comedy as it is a drama. Jonah Hill carries a good amount of the comic relief, but everyone gets in on the fun. Leo especially cuts loose in a few scenes, and you get the sense that this was probably one of the most fun roles he's ever done. <br/><br/>One thing to keep in mind...Wolf showcases a healthy amount of debauchery. A major chunk of the movie is all about Belfort and company living the life of the ridiculously rich and famous, and they don't hold back on the sex, drugs, and alcohol. AT ALL. It's to the point where you wonder if this movie is over-glorifying the actions of a criminal who built his wealth on the misfortunes of his clients. (But then again, we could say the same for Goodfellas...or Casino...) The fact that this is based on a true story makes me wonder if the real Jordan Belfort's life was anywhere close to this.<br/><br/>Another thing to keep in mind - Wolf clocks in at THREE HOURS. (By my rough estimate, about 2 and 1/2 hours of that is some combination of sex, drugs, and alcohol.) Get comfy. <br/><br/>Is Wolf a hit? Yes. Will it take home a few awards? Probably. Is it Scorsese's best work? No, but I'd put it in the top 5. (Goodfellas is still far and away his best - maybe THE BEST EVER - but Wolf is up there with Casino, The Departed, and Raging Bull, in my opinion.) Is it Leo's best work? Oooh...that's a tough one...all Leo does is lay out powerhouse performances, one after the other. But the argument can be made, for sure.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street scores a 4.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS. If you haven't already, GO SEE IT.<br/><br/>(Hey guys, thanks for reading.

I'm not much of a Leonardo DiCaprio fan but he's performance in film is spot on, special with this film as he plays Jordan Belfort , Jordan Belfort is the son of Max and Leah Belfort of New York. In 1989, he and Daniel Porush founded the now defunct brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont which became the largest OTC firm in the United States at that time. Jordan and his business partner were charged with 10 counts of securities fraud and money laundering for the stock manipulation of at least 25 companies that Stratton had underwritten. After serving approximately 22 months in prison he was also ordered to return $100 million to former clients. He reportedly had been earning upwards to $50 million a year during his later years before the Department of Justice in the United States shut his operation down. Some of this film you kind of find yourself straying a little as it dose get a bit boring at time, but the funny moment's really dose make you laugh special some scene there so ridiculous you can help but laugh i bet the stars film on set couldn't stop laughing after film that scene because I've never laugh so hard it was to funny. There is a lot adult content as i said most of it is a gay concept & naked woman, with a lot of drug's & alcohol use which is pretty strong in this film but that to be expected in this type of film being rich & powerful. All in all this wasn't a bad film to watch as i said its has its laughable moment's to dam right stupid moments but as a true story i think they told a pretty true story of the life of Jordan Belfort down to every detail of what he did.This is pretty well scripted with some brilliant performance from all the stars in this film f you a Leonardo DiCaprio fan your like this film."

","This film tells the story of a young man who is hungry for success in Wall Street. He becomes a top trader with his remarkable sales and leadership skills. He soon indulges in the world of sex, drugs and luxury that few can dream of.<br/><br/>I was hesitant to watch ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" at first because of its length. It's quite amazing that three hours went by and it did not even feel like three hours. The story is engaging and fuelled with adrenaline. I am very impressed by how well Leonardo DiCaprio's character manage to motivate his staff to become successful Wall Street elites. His high energy speeches are quite amazing, and I really feel that energy and passion. The shenanigans that the elites are up to are eye opening and entertaining, as one might have expected better behaviour! An added bonus is that there is much eye candy for everybody (yes, literally everybody). I enjoyed watching ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", as it has got a great plot relevant to the times, and entertaining scenes."
"brickmoviereviews","9","0","6","9 January 2014"," The Wolf of Wall Street: The Leader of the Pack
","Set in the 1980s, The Wolf of Wall Street tells the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), and his desire to be rich instantly. Growing up in poverty, Belfort's only dream was to be rich, and what better way to do that than in stocks? At the young age of 23, Belfort and his wife, Theresa (Cristin Milioti), head to New York so Belfort could learn the ways of Wall Street. Being taught by stock tycoon Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), Belfort quickly transforms from a mild mannered hometown boy to a drug addicted, adultering wolf, that is, of course, the stocks crash, Hanna's brokerage firm closes, and Belfort is out of a job.<br/><br/>Belfort's broking career looks bleak until his wife points out a small brokerage firm that is still hiring brokers. Excited about the opportunity, Belfort's hopes are quickly dashed when he enters the office of the firm, in a strip mall, and sees no put-together businessmen in thousand dollar suits, but he instead sees large, sweaty guys in collared shirts and sweatpants. Belfort's hopes rise once again as soon as the firm's owner tells him that the commission on the stocks sold, penny stocks worth six cents a share, is 50%, which means that if Belfort sold $10,000 worth of shares, he gets $5,000 straight into is pocket. Soon after Belfort makes a small fortune, he meets Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), and together, they co-found Stratton Oakmont OTC firm, and dive deeper into the illegal world of drugs, hookers, and money.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is simply one of the best movies of 2013. Definitely for mature audiences only, the rated R movie is, in my opinion, a boarder line NC-17 rated movie. The film can really only be described in one word: raunchy. Without going into detail, drug abuse and sex run rampant throughout the movie, of course along with the various other illegal activities.<br/><br/>In the days leading up to, and the days after the release of The Wolf of Wall Street, controversy about the movie began to rise. Many were saying that there is a case to be made that the movie glorifies criminals and criminal activity. Yes, The Wolf of Wall Street shows what happened to Belfort as his dove deeper into the criminal underworld, and yes, things looked pretty awesome. However, the movie DOES NOT glorify criminal activity, it simply acknowledges it. The highlife that Jordan Belfort lived through the majority of the movie is not the message of the story, the message of the story is what happened to Belfort in the final twenty minutes. The movie is not showing the rewards, it ultimately shows the affects of the actions taken.<br/><br/>In The Wolf of Wall Street, DiCaprio, in a way, once again channels his inner Jay Gatsby as he lives the life of wealth and parties. In a way, Jordan Belfort is very similar to Jay Gatsby from F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, just 60 years later. Anyway, DiCaprio's acting is memorable, and is a performance that should definitely be acknowledged. While I personally think Tom Hanks' performance as Captain Phillips in Captain Phillips earlier in 2013 will ultimately win the Oscar, DiCaprio is, at least, worthy of a nomination. Jonah Hill is great in the movie, and the rest of the cast does a fine job. DiCaprio, however, is definitely the star of the film, and has a chance to end his Oscar drought (knock on wood).<br/><br/>Of the Christmas day releases (the others being: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Grudge Match, 47 Ronin), The Wolf of Wall Street is definitely the best, and is also one of the best of 2013. With the Academy Awards around the corner, I find it hard to believe that Wolf will leave the awards show empty handed, but I've been wrong before. While not living up to my expectations fully, The Wolf of Wall Street is nonetheless a fantastic film that is 100% worth seeing. Scorsese, once again, delivers a phenomenal movie, maybe his best since The Departed, which, ironically, starred Leo DiCaprio. I do, once again, have to stress that The Wolf of Wall Street is for mature audiences only.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 of 10<br/><br/>BrickMovieReviews.wordpress.com<br/><br/>@BrickFilmReview"

","I don't normally write reviews but for this polarizing film I though I would. This is going to be a classic and was one of the best movies I have seen to date. It has the classic setup from the small man who starts at the bottom, works his way up, then comes crashing down. Thats the basic plot and while not overly complex it doesn't matter. People also complain about the characters haven't ""progressed"" into ""goodnes"" Do you really think these kind of people are suddenly going to start doing everything the right way after there success.. no. The characters are amazing and real. The acting brings them alive and they all connect so well together. The first half of the film is quite funny and really gets you laughing while still being clever. The second half focuses more or on the drama and the plot does start to get somewhat complex and the moves very well.<br/><br/>Now all the people who are moaning about how terrible it is that all the ""victims"" and all the drugs and sex promote ""irresponsibility"" can get off there high horse and just enjoy the movie. This is not a documentary, its a movie these things make the movie what it is. This is a fantastic movie and don't let all this ""bad stuff"" get in the way. If you want to know the real story go read up about the real story and leave this piece of art alone."

","~NO SPOILERS~ Funny perfect Sunday movie! Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, his portrayal as this lustful, greedy and confident stock broker was superb, specially the white Lamborghini Countach scene, when he as Jordan Belfort is full high on drugs! Matthew McConaughey's act at the start of the movie was excellent. Margot Robbie looks gorgeous. Martin Scorsese's direction made sure this long story was always interesting with its black humour. Finally thanks to the real Jordan Belfort for telling his story to the world. A great movie for entertainment if you can ignore the use of 'F' word for at least 506 times in 3 hours! Also if you are smart enough, the movie can also teach you why its necessary at times, to not cross the line! For the love of Hollywood, don't miss this one!"
"worshipthylouie","8","0","5","6 January 2014"," The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013) Review
","Are you sick of the good guy always being televised? Are you tired of the hero always getting all the glory? Does it sicken you when the hero always defeats the villain? Do you feel that the bad guy deserves the spotlight for once? Would you like to avoid positive messages being jammed down your throat? Do you like the unlikable, the scumbags, the assholes, the men who put fun first, and the law never? If you answered ""yes"" to all these questions, than ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" may be the movie for you.<br/><br/>Based on the real life of Jordan Belfort, who did most of the exact same things minus extra exaggeration and an added dose of craziness, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a character of the same name. I personally feel Leonardo has one of the best track records in Hollywood when it comes to starring in high regarded films, and this one did not disappoint getting a mostly positive reception overall.<br/><br/>Leonardo reunites with director Martin Scorsese, in what is the raunchiest, scummiest film of the year. Naked bodies everywhere, drugs left, right and center, swear words coming at a fast rate, and downright chaos on screen at every given second of the films run-time. I read that this movie uses the word, ""fuck"", a number of five hundred and six times. It features a bad guy, and many bad people who are willing to put down others for the greater good ofthemselves. Still Interested? Well, as I've already said, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>Instead of taking the usual approach plot wise, it features Jordan narrating certain parts of of the story, and jumps to the important events in his life.<br/><br/>Jordan befriends a man named Donnie Azoff, played by Jonah Hill. The two create a firm together called Stratton Oakmont, and give jobs to friends and family. Soon enough, it turns into a billionaire company. What did he convince the hard working class to buy into? Penny stocks. The answer is penny stocks. Yes, you heard that right, penny stocks.<br/><br/>He was not concerned with breaking the law, having morals or staying faithful to his first or second wife. What fun is in that? Him, along with his firm, broke the law on the daily, screwing countless people out of countless money. Morals? That was forgotten after endless snorts of coke, or four or five Quaaludes. Staying faithful? Jordan can have hookers or any girl he wants basically any day of the week, so that was out of the question in his eyes.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is part biographical film and part satirical black comedy. A lot of the characters in this film such as Donny or his wives for example, are based off people that the real life Jordan Belfort knew. Some of the parts used for comedy are even based off real life truths. For example, Donnie gets made fun of for marrying his cousin. Truth is, the man he is based on actually did.<br/><br/>The comedy elements of this film hit home runs. I laughed out loud multiple times, along with the majority of the theater. Jonah Hill was hilarious, and it is one of the best roles he had in quite some time. Matthew McConaughey makes an extended cameo as Jordan's first boss and mentor. Explaining that cocaine, hookers and masturbation are essential to the life of a stockbroker was the bulk of his appearance, and he embraced it passionately. Knocked it right out of the park when it comes to laughs.<br/><br/>This film is the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort. So as I've pointed out in the intro, it is more of a straight feature on the man himself and does not feature many messages one can take away as a positive. It does show how money can turn a person originally decent and controlled to greedy, unstable, and corrupt. It does highlight the consequences and sloppiness drugs or alcohol can cause. It is exposed that the American dream gained through illegal activities can just as easily be taken away when caught.<br/><br/>The acting across the board is top notch. Every one of the countless actors and actresses featured in this film contributed a good performance and had presence on-screen. Leonardo DiCaprio was a shining star as expected, and his charisma was out of this planet. I still remember the motivational speeches he gave at the firm, and they were extremely fun to listen too. Oh yes, that is another thing, this film was full of fun quotes that I'm sure people will be repeating over dinners, parties or casually in conversation.<br/><br/>I only have one major complaint, and that is the run time. This did not have to be three hours. It would have been a crisper film if it stopped at two. A lot could have been trimmed to make that possible.<br/><br/>My advice, if everything I said sounds like something you would enjoy, run out and see this. Be cautious of the long run-time, make sure to use the washroom before and go light on liquids. And go with people who enjoy raunchy, crude humour and would enjoy something where the day is not saved in the end, and where bad holds its ground against good. Those easily offended, or overboard righteous minded may not enjoy this, but anyone who understands entertainment is entertainment will likely get a kick out of it.<br/><br/>Watch it ASAP"

","The Wolf of Wall Street opens with a montage of such debauchery, it's appalling and fascinating at the same time. Leonardo DiCaprio, playing real-life stockbroker-scamster Jordan Belfort, tosses midgets across his office floor, crash-lands a helicopter while stoned out of his mind, and snorts cocaine off a hooker's ass. All this in the first five minutes. The film carries on, much in the same vein, for three hours.Based on Belfort's own memoir about getting insanely rich from conning investors, The Wolf of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a delirious, manic black comedy about an amoral but magnetic protagonist so consumed by greed that he makes Gordon Gekko look like the Pope in comparison.Belfort starts out as a young man who gets a job as a stockbroker, then loses his job during the 1987 market crash. He starts his own firm, having figured out a way to make big bucks by selling worthless penny stocks. He turns out to be such a smooth seller that in no time he and his merry band of no-gooders (led by a terrific Jonah Hill as his bucktoothed sideckick Donie Azoff) have more money than they know what to do with. So they blow it on hookers, booze, and ridiculous quantities of drugs. Before long Belfort and his hedonistic lifestyle catch the eye of a hungry FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) who becomes determined to take him down.Scorsese, who is no stranger to stories about men behaving badly, keeps the pace brisk and the proceedings outrageous. There is a frantic energy to the movie until the very end, although scene after scene of wild orgies and drug-fueled hazes begin to get repetitive after a point. It's DiCaprio's top-notch portrayal of this abhorrent but compelling market wiz that never lets your interest in the movie wane. He offers a solid, brave performance that reaches a fever pitch each time Belfort takes the mike to motivate his team. The actor also gets a terrific opportunity to show off his comic chops in one of the film's most memorable scenes in which he slithers and crawls in a party -drug-induced stupor from a country club to his Ferrari and proceeds to drive home.In smaller roles, Matthew McConaughey as Belfort's unscrupulous mentor, chews up the scenery in a crackling restaurant scene, while Margot Robbie gets some well-deserved laughs as Belfort's trophy wife.The Wolf of Wall Street is consistently engaging, but is it meant to celebrate this reckless pursuit of wealth, or serve as a cautionary tale against it? That's for each one of us to decide. To give credit to Scorsese, he's made a film that works on more than one level, and a film that inspires debate. I'm going with four out of five for The Wolf of Wall Street. In their fifth collaboration, Scorsese and DiCaprio once again do their best work together."

","Martin Scorsese might one day disappointment me. But that day is not today. The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the greatest movies I've seen on the big screen in a while. I heard about Jordan Belford before, so I was happy to know a movie was being made. It made it even better that Martin was directing it. <br/><br/>Let me start by saying that Jonah Hill dominated. Don't get me wrong, Leonardo did great too, but Jonah Hill...he was something. He killed it. I think every single character was portrayed by great acting. The storyline is very interesting, and despite the fact that the sex, drugs, and alcohol abuse could've gotten a tad bit disturbing, it was just a fantastic movie. Soundtrack, camera angles, everything. Besides budget, nothing wrong with the movie. <br/><br/>I really like how Scorsese didn't change Belforts story. He did make it a bit more Hollywood than the book, but not much. And at least he admit it. Keep up the good work Martin!"
"harsh-kabeer1","9","0","7","3 January 2014"," A capitalist orgy played on a grand scale.
","What happens when Goodfellas meet American Pie? You get The Wolf of the Wall Street. Really? American Pie? Ummm...yes. Sort of. You take the raunchy and the obscene from American Pie and bit of their juvenility and mix in with the Goodfellas, you will get an idea of what the latest Martin Scorsese's movie is about, just an idea. Because The Wolf Of Wall Street is much more than that.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of American Pie. The most I got out of it was being mildly entertained. So if you hear me raving about The Wolf of Wall Street, you can discount that adolescence pleasure in sexual innuendoes and vulgarity. And that is not to say that I didn't enjoy The wolf of the Wall Street's raunchiness, obscenity and vulgarity. I was thoroughly entertained. It was not just a passing sexual fantasy, a superficial make over. It was a powerful imagery that was associated with every bit of it obscenity-the metaphor for the corrupting influence of excess of money, the moral hollowness that it often accompanies and the emptiness that its grandeur brings. But then why the pleasure? Why the fun when all they are doing is justifying looting to carry out their drug and sex rampage? I should have been repulsed. But I didn't. Partly because it was that adolescence pleasure. But mostly because the movie weaved a world that engulfed me from the start and made me a comrade in the devilry of the stockbrokers of Wall Street. Just like Goodfellas did with its gangster story. I became a part of their world. I was justifying their acts. I even got angry at an honest FBI agent for doing his work. Such is the irresistible charm of money! And then it suddenly removes the rug from under my feet and I see all the hollowness lurking beneath all the materialism.<br/><br/>The movie is three hours long. And it never seems like it. And that is enough praise in itself. The wonderful cast led by Leonardo diCaprio and Jonah hill infuses the movie with their energy and thespian abilities. And Martin Scorsese shines as usual with his directorial mastery in keeping total control over the film and it is his prowess that dilutes the technical jargon of wall street to make the lingo comprehensible to all without sacrificing any of its narrative fluidity. There is also less of a divide between the audience and the actors as diCaprio keep talking to the audience. It is an interesting, engaging add on, and it also emphasises the key point of the story-Jordan Belfort's selling prowess.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is a parable on how addictive money making can be at the cost of conscience and love. Even love and loyalty that exists is all thanks to money. And once you threaten that, all hell breaks loose. It is fast paced, it is lunatic and it is one hell of an obscene fun-a capitalist orgy played on a grand scale."

","The Wolf of Wall Street is an immensely entertaining, darkly funny movie about (and filled with) excess.<br/><br/>Every performance is nearly perfect (especially DiCaprio and Jonah Hill). With a cast as large as this (I'd say there's at least a dozen important characters) you'd expect to have at least one performance fall flat, but that didn't happen here.<br/><br/>The writing is very good. Nearly every line of dialogue is filled with expletives, but that doesn't bother me at all. The story was completely new to me, so all the little twists and turns were interesting. The plot itself might not be anything revolutionary, but it's very effective. The whole audience in my theater was laughing consistently, so we all ""got"" the humor in this dark morality play.<br/><br/>The very best aspect of the film might be Scorsese's direction and overall filmmaking decisions. The way he told this story was amazing and I absolutely loved all the little flourishes, especially breaking the 4th wall.<br/><br/>I can't think of a negative aspect of this film. The three hour running time completely flew by for me. I've watched 90 minute movies that seem much longer than this one did.<br/><br/>Since I don't give out ""A"" ratings after only one viewing, The Wolf of Wall Street gets an ""A-"" from me.

Seriously. This film is crazy good.<br/><br/>Terence Winter proves that he is just as good at film as he is TV (Sopranos) as he delivers a great script based on the disturbing tale of Jordan Belfort.<br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio's transformation from a young, innocent stockbroker to a drug loving, sex crazed millionaire is truly something to behold. His performance in ""Wolf"" could finally earn him his long awaited (and much deserved) Oscar. I earlier said that Christian Bale's performance in American Hustle should be the front runner (and I have seen Chiwitel Ejiofor in 12 Years a Slave by the way) but Dicaprio will definitely be some tough competition for Bale.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill proves that Moneyball was no fluke. He appears to be here to stay as a serious actor, and why not? He delivers (probably) the greatest performance in his young career that could earn him another Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>And don't be fooled by the run time. Despite being 3 hours, ""Wolf"" was a rare exception for most 3 hours films I've seen - I didn't find myself bored once, and I was entertained the whole time.<br/><br/>I get this movie's not for everyone - there is a lot of inappropriate content in it that those who are easily offended may not enjoy.

"advaitkamat","8","0","5","3 January 2014"," A firecracker of a film that explodes slowly.
","Wake up and rejoice. The ""Goodfellas"" of our time has arrived, in all its vainglory.<br/><br/>As always, it's a pleasure to witness a brilliant filmmaker spin out of control and crank out a transgressive piece of cinema so exhausting that you know that you now have a new milestone movie to scale. And before I even completed my viewing of ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"", I knew I'm going to have to come back to it soon enough. Because there is so much going on, so much you have to watch, assess and enjoy that a single viewing can't do justice to it.Â  It's ridiculously dynamite, like Scorsese, aged seventy-one, mind you, wanted to live out his wildest dreams on screen. They animate like arresting fireworks in the sky, try tearing your eyes away, pal. <br/><br/>Crass, it's not. I'm here to affirm that ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" is indeed shockingly vulgar and darkly funny, so much so that it makes Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat Sagdiyev seem like a saint. But, hey, we aren't forgetting what we are watching, are we? The material that served as the film's inspiration is Jordan Belfort's own memoir about his doings as a stockbroker in the good ol' 1990s. This is just a wily adaptation of the book. What's the big deal? It's not like he's preaching the kind of lifestyle that Belfort led, he's just studying it. Like we are.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's Belfort is an obnoxious man, a sickening voyeur to hoot, to hang out with, to talk with, a conceited bighead who did something shamelessly nefarious like making millions of dollars through large-scale securities fraud and blowing it all up to satiate his drug-addiction. And yet, and yet, he's complete fun. He's reckless, he's stupid and he's funny. I haven't met anyone quite like him, certainly not in the recent spew of films and DiCaprio has never been more ebullient. He's Calvin Candie, only amped-up to several more degrees. And he comes with an swagger to match Scorsese's. <br/><br/>Probably the best thing about ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" is that it doesn't preach. You don't get to hear sermons about what's right and what's wrong, but you're watching something that tells you it's bad. Belfort's drug-fueled antics first amuse you, then disgust you. You're left to figure it out yourself, nobody tells you that. That's Scorsese's genius. He takes a look at the crimes of Wall Street in the '90s through the villain's POV but while you're having a blast like him, you're also shocked by his actions. Like him.<br/><br/>One scene stayed with me for a long time after I had finished it. That's a lunch scene between Belfort and Mark Hanna, his boss played by a spectacularly scrupulous Matthew McConaughey, who's goading his avaricious appetite. He slips a cheeky $100 note to the waiter and instructs him to get him drinks every five minutes till he passes out. He teaches Belfort how to make it big by plummeting stocks while high on alcohol and drugs, a character so different from the one he played in ""Mud"". McConaughey deserves an Oscar nomination for this two-bit role, the ten best minutes of the movie by miles, I think. Belfort walks and talks like no one I've met, and when Hanna's company gets wrecked, he talks a geeky Donnie Azoff into joining him. Azoff is impressed by Belfort driving a Jaguar, scoffs when Belfort tells him about the money stockbrokers make and is incredulous when Belfort pops up a check to prove it. And from then on, the ride's one hell of an explosion.<br/><br/>I've never really understood the stock game, those are spiteful, wishy-washy things that don't get to me at all. I don't understand what the hell were these guys talking about, all those damn schemes they sold on the phone while doing drugs at the same time, but I understood what Scorsese and Winter wanted me to understand - they were making a lot of money and none of it was licit. Like Belfort's character sneers bumptiously at one point, none of the audience was expected to understand any of it. It wasn't about how they did it, it was about why they did it.<br/><br/>For three hours, the kind of gross-out depravation that unfolded on the screen sickened me. I didn't find it funny at all, not when I'm watching an abhorrent man scourge and swindle a man into financing his junkets. Or a woman getting manhandled in a drug-induced haze. It wasn't meant to be funny, it was meant to be scary. Point duly noted?<br/><br/>If ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" is an example of something, it's why Leonardo DiCaprio warrants an Oscar the Academy has owed him for over a decade. He's terrifically wild, perilously peppy and delivers his line, one after one, to comic perfection.<br/><br/>The casting, as always in a Scorsese film, is flawless. Jonah Hill is fantastic, as are Rob Reiner and Kyle Chandler, who plays what he has been playing for the past two years. Reiner's aptly cast, much to my surprise, and he does well. Really well. Margot Robbie, as Belfort's wife, is impressive. She's got the looks and she's got the confidence. Good job handling the quivering pressure that came with the role. Jean Dujardin, who was sensational in ""The Artist"", doesn't have much to do here but whatever little he has, he does alright. <br/><br/>Scorsese's cinema has never been more alive and it's heartening to see the master filmmaker indulging into this kind of exuberance. You won't believe a seventy-one year old has made this kind of a film, it's more like a twenty year-old made it. Dazzling."

"MMAsonA","9","0","6","2 January 2014"," Who knew DiCaprio and Hill would mix so well?
","This movie is rated R, but should have been rated far worse than that. There is a sex scene in this movie that was too long for my tastes, and it also clocks in at about 2 f-bombs a minute. This, however, does not take away from how entertaining this film is. Jordan Belfort always told his wife the same thing whenever they had money troubles: ""I'm gonna be a millionaire"", and it is this desire that lead to his rise and ultimate demise due to greed.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was phenomenal, but what do you expect? It's a DiCaprio film! This could very well be DiCaprio's very best performance as an actor. When I first saw the Jonah Hill would be in this movie I thought ""Well that's an interesting decision"", and I figured that it could either go extremely well or go terribly. To my pleasure it went AMAZINGLY well, I never realized Jonah Hill had so much talent behind his humorous chubby face. He plays a very convincing business partner to Jordan Belfort, while still delivering on the laughs. There are plenty of times during this movie where you will ask yourself ""Is this a comedy?!?"" and NOT in a bad way!<br/><br/>I rated the Cinematography the lowest because as with all films there were certain scenes that I felt could have been angled better and so on. The soundtrack for the film however was very delightful. I loved the choice of music for the trailer, it just instantly captivates you!<br/><br/>All in all this film was definitely worth the ticket price, but do not being your kids to this one, as I stated before it is extremely inappropriate."
"darann92","9","0","6","1 January 2014"," Martin Scorsese makes a film, again!
","When Martin Scorsese makes a film, he makes a film! Nothing could ever go wrong with the products he chooses to come up with. After a long wait, here comes a legendary filmmaker's latest offering with his favorite star cast DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Based on a memoir written by Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street speaks about the rise and fall of an American stockbroker. Although the movie shared similar story craft with The Departed and Goodfellas, what made the movie very interesting was the black comedy genre. As usual, Scorsese's trademark of profanity enhanced dialogues worked big time. Under his direction, the screenplay was faithful to the memoir; cinematography was classic and scenes execution was incredible.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is the one man who breaks his own record each movie he performs. The man surely seemed aged a little, but his performance proved otherwise. He is a director's actor and with that being said, it was very evident that he gave his heart and soul for the success of this venture. And it proved worth it. This deadly combo of director and actor provided massive entertainment to put it short.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is strictly an adult product. The only flaws could be the slow-mo effect that certain scenes had and slightly overdosed nudity enhanced scenes, unlike in previous Scorsese's masterpieces. Nevertheless, if one could successfully render a 3 hour long movie and at the same time engross audiences for the entire duration, that person could only possibly be Martin Scorsese."
"Bravesfan17","9","0","5","31 December 2013"," For Martin Scorsese Fans
","Needless to say, but Martin Scorsese is one of the best living directors, and has kept the consistency. He has brought us classics such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull to Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, and my favorite, The Departed. But now Mr. Scorsese has brought us another great film that is a must see for all Scorsese fans, The Wolf of Wall Street.<br/><br/>With this film, Scorsese is collaborating with star Leonardo DiCaprio for the fifth time. Here, DiCaprio stars as Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street stock broker who never knew when to say quit. The film begins with him starting out at a Wall Street firm manning phones. Shortly after beginning work, his boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) takes him out for lunch and coaches him on how to survive on Wall Street by recommending to Jordan to take up his lifestyle of drugs and prostitutes. After a the firm goes out of business, Jordan's wife Teresa (Christin Milioti) finds a job in the want ads that will fit him. His new boss Dwayne (Spike Jonze) gives him new information about the stocks his place sells and offers an unusual reward if he sells ten thousand dollars worth of stock. Jordan's selling strategy hugely impresses all of his coworkers and earns him a fortune.<br/><br/>At a diner, Jordan meets Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), a salesman who coincidentally is a neighbor of Jordan's who wants in on his business. Shortly after, they have their own firm and recruit some of Jordan's old coworkers to join in. Standing out among them is Jordan's friend Brad (Jon Bernthal), who also deals drugs. However, the firm has become wild and crazy, which causes Jordan to hire his dad Max (Rob Reiner) to handle the finances. Jordan also throws many wild and crazy parties involving drugs and sex. At one of his parties, Jordan meets Naomi (Margot Robbie), and they hit it off leading to a divorce from Teresa and a new marriage to Naomi. Jordan's actions lead to an investigation of him and his firm Stratton Oakmont by FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler).<br/><br/>In the three hour run time Martin Scorsese has put on this film, he gives his audience a wild and crazy ride through the life of Jordan Belfort. As a storyteller, Scorsese doesn't hold anything back. He is not afraid to show us the sex these characters have or have us witness these people doing drugs. I do think that some parts of the film could have been trimmed down, but Scorsese keeps everything in that is important to Jordan's story. The times does fly by quickly. Terence Winter wrote the script and does a great job of making the story run smoothly. Winter does a great job at writing out the dialogue for each of the characters, but the cast also does excellent at bringing Winter's script to life.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio continues to show why he keeps starring in Scorsese's films, and shows a lot of greatness here as Jordan Belfort. With this role, DiCaprio brings confidence, craziness, determination, and a lot more. DiCaprio fleshes out this character and makes him into somebody who is living his dream, but doesn't know when to say quit. The rest of the cast is great too. I truly enjoyed Margot Robbie as Jordan's second wife Naomi. She takes this role of the wife and makes her into a strong and attractive who knows how to stand up to her husband. Rob Reiner is great as Jordan's dad Max who is there for his son and goes nuts at times but can turn the craziness off at the right time. Jon Bernthal is also great as Jordan's drug dealing friend Brad. Jonah Hill is good as Jordan's right hand man Donnie Azoff, but excessively over the top. The standout of the supporting cast is Kyle Chandler as FBI agent Patrick Denham. Chandler is excellent as the agent who was assigned to the case. With his scenes, Chandler makes some great acting choices with his eyes that indicate Denham's intelligence.<br/><br/>Like all of Scorsese's films, there are some great things that stand out technically too. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is nice with the lighting in each scene. Thelma Schoonmaker, who has been editing Scorsese's films since Raging Bull, does a lot of great work with making each scene dramatic or exciting and putting the whole thing together.<br/><br/>While I highly enjoyed The Wolf of Wall Street, I must say that this is not for everyone. I recommend this for Martin Scorsese fans and those who enjoy great acting."
"hawkeye-mail","Null","0","7","28 December 2013"," A Must See For ""Sales Movie"" junkies
","OK, I'll jump straight to the bad because I want to get it out of the way, and there's plenty more good. First off, the run time. Too long. 3 hours, I'm sorry but in today's ADD society, where people are habitually checking their iphones every 3 seconds - 3 hours is way too long to expect people seated in front of a movie. Secondly, there are some scenes that toe the line of soft core porn. The debauchery is not all gratuitous but it is a bit over the top (although Margot Robbie naked is one of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen in my entire life - damn you Leo!). So, while the nudity and drug use in this movie will probably get a lot of moralist undies in a bunch, if you can stomach a few sex scenes that might make you a little uncomfortable and lines of blow off of naked bosoms, the film does have plenty of substance behind it.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is a little too long, it does have a good flow to it. There are no real dull moments. You stay pretty engaged in the film the whole time. Dicaprio knocked his role out of the park. Jonna Hill does a surprisingly good job as well. The FBI dude is ah so-so but I guess you can't always have Tom Hanks chasing Leo around. Overall, the casting for the movie is solid.<br/><br/>So in summary, this is a must see for sales movie junkies. I'm taking if you're of Wall Street, Glengarry glen Ross, Suckers...ilk, you're definitely going to enjoy this. People will get offended and even upset that this was based on a true story and that someone like Jordan Belfort actually will profit of this movie, but those aren't salesmen! Salesmen (real salesmen) know that in every transaction there is a winner and a loser. Nothing is 50/50. If you have a problem making money off of other people's expense, you usually going to be on the losing end of most transactions."

","Last Friday I went to the cinema to watch The Hobbit:Desolation of Smaug,and I fell asleep for almost ten minutes,which was my first nap in cinema ever. Yesterday, I went to see The Wolf. Did not even look at my watch for the whole duration. Why?Because simply, this film rocks. Saying anything except awesome would be underrating it.It's all beautifully set: the story,the character development, the quick succession of funny moments.Above all, first movie in eons where I could not tell what the outcome of some scene would be.To me, it sounds like a perfect movie. Yes,there are naked breasts(and more nudity), booze, drugs, vomiting,hobbit throwing (they were in fact midgets,although I wish they were Hobbits,such is the desolation of last Hobbit movie), wife punching,goldfish eating,drunk&drug&drive scenes,and bad reviews for this movie as well. Seems like half of people love this movie, half despise it. I am sure if there was ever a movie about a guy who had his gold fish eaten by a vice-president of his wall street company, they would give good reviews. But I wouldn't. Because my life experience has shown that those goldfish owners,if given a chance, can be real douche bags, much more than self- made millionaires. And as our proverb says, while the wolf is chased,the fox eats the chicken. Don't believe Wall Street is a better place without one Wolf...."
"andy-933-696608","Null","0","6","27 December 2013"," My name is Jordan Belford.
","Now when Oliver Stone's Wall Street premiered in 1987, the character Gordon Gekko ushered in the physical manifestation of greed in American consumerism. Gekko would dismantle and profit from a company, simply because it could be destroyed. Now Jordon's Belford's novel ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", follows a similar direction, less having to do with the business aspect of his illegal dealings, and more to do with who he was. In Martin Scorsese's latest project, Leonardo Dicaprio delivers the Gordon Gekko of the 21st century, technically the 20th, but really who cares in that respect. The rage and ecstatic enthusiasm Dicaprio has always brought forth in his characters has once more proved remarkable in this recent collaboration with Scorsese. As Belford Dicaprio captures a charisma that is both fascinating and addictive in this character study of a film, as it is made clear from the constant voice-over narrations made by him that all he wants is money, and as the story progresses, mostly through the characters, Belford's quest for power is shown with so very little restraint that you think maybe Scorsese bribed a few Studio execs to get this movie made.<br/><br/>Starting out with a simple marriage, and eventually moving up into the big leagues, Jordon Belford began his climb to the top when he founded Stratton Oakmont, a boiler room which marketed penny stocks. It didn't take very long for Belford to see the weaknesses in such a small and minuscule business, giving him one chance after another to profit off the gullibility of simple minded people with fraudulent sales stocks. In time, Jordan formed a cheeky but wise team of swindlers with enough gull and enthusiasm, though not much brains at first, to reach higher and higher levels of monetary gain. His right hand man was Donnie Azoff (Hill), a businessman just as mad, and just as self-destructive as Jordan Bell, and most of this praise goes to the stellar and energetic performance Jonah Hill delivers as he once more breaks from the conventional comedian role into more zany and out of the box characters, following his Oscar nom in 2011 for Moneyball.<br/><br/>Aside from this film being a satire and black comedy, it really is not meant to be funny, according to Martin Scorsese, and that comes from his initial desire to show the darkest aspects of humanity within his characters. In a way, The Wolf of Wall Street shares so much similarity with Scorsese's 1990 film Good Fellas that as Belford from time again takes us through the story, breaking the fourth wall to add a little humor, it becomes very clear by the confidence, the profanity, and the smug arrogance is the spirit a confident Ray Liaotta had shown in one his role as Henry Hill, who in a way shares so much with Dicaprio's Jordan Belford that eventually it becomes clear what the story is about. And that is the characters and the examination Scorsese takes in portraying this darkly comedic Greek Tragedy. One of the most fascinating aspects that is prevalent within this film is the total lack of restraint it has when giving a gritty and in your face style kind of humor, sadness, and drama to that matter. There rarely goes a scene without Belford popping Quaaludes, or stepping into an orgy where the scene is cynically narrated by his remarkable honesty, and even when any modesty does come from this connoisseur, it is solely for the means of his self-centered agenda of greed and buffoonery.<br/><br/>The wolf of Wall Street says a lot about not just American culture, and its many flaws, but it really speaks about much deep-seeded questions regarding the dark nature within human beings. It questions the notion of greed, and it presents it in the manner in which it remains unsolved. In a Hollywood Reporter interview, promoting the film, Leo Dicaprio elaborated on the nature of greed, and although it is essential to our own survival, it still begs the question as to whether it can be conquered. It has been a part of the survival of not just our species, but really any living organism that thrives. Martin Scorsese in the same interview weighed in on the matter, believing that we as human beings are still far from ever solving that predicament within our biological construct, while also acknowledging that each of us individually have qualities within us that are detestable to even the most lenient of moral standards. Now although this notion of greed seems almost impossible for any species to conquer, especially one like ours which is self-conscious, it certainly is a unique question regarding both the positive and negative aspects of it. In Wall Street Gordon Gekko says, ""Greed, for a lack of a better word is good"", explaining the capabilities it holds when implemented. If one could really sum up the notion of greed is really that it is a double edged sword. It remains essential to our survival on any kind of level, be it social or physical. On the other hand, it can corrupt us to the point where the very satisfaction we get from it has lost all meaning that it becomes numb within its indulgence, thus making as empty and without purpose."
