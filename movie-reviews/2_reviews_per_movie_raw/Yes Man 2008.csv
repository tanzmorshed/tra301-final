","Being lucky, I already saw ""Yes Man"" and was pleasantly surprised. Jim Carrey is not really my all time favorite (despite his comic talent and acting skills), but in this movie he seems to have hit the spot.<br/><br/>The story itself is really simple: Carl (Jim Carrey), a very negative man, goes to a meeting among the very positive Yes people, whose charismatic leader (Terence Stamp) preaches that one should say Yes to all questions and agree with all propositions. Carl is reluctantly convinced to try it out, and after meeting a girl on a scooter (the ever so lovely Zooey Deschanel) all sorts of things start happening around him. But being 100% positive might be tricky sometimes...<br/><br/>It is all very silly, of course - but this feel-good comedy has a small undertone of seriousness as well. And it has a great cast, many delightful scenes, a reasonably relaxed Jim Carrey and a lighthearted style. Y/N? I say Y."
"dead47548","8","234","275","20 December 2008"," Say yes!
","Yes Man follows the same basic genre comedy structure that we've seen an endless amount of times in the past few years. The main character has a big problem, they work to solve that problem, the problem is solved and happy times are had. Then another problem arises as a result to the solution to the original problem. So everyone is sad. But then that problem is solved and everyone lives happily ever after. And there's a message about how to live your life sprinkled in there. For every single comedy in the past few years with that structure, I've gotten so bored by the time it's over because I just lose interest when the drama comes in during the third act. I either don't care about the characters or I don't care about the message.<br/><br/>Every comedy except for this one. Not only did I care about the characters so much (thanks mostly to the performances from Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel who put a beautiful, free-spirited romance at the core of this seemingly typical comedy) that I was emotionally impacted during that predictable turn for the worse near the end, but the message of the film was actually something that I found relatable to my own life which is something I've never experience during these kind of comedies. I'm definitely a man who doesn't really live his life (as cheesy as that sounds) because I isolate myself by making excuses to just be alone and not be with anyone. As a result, I was definitely more invested in this film than I have been with other comedies of the same vein.<br/><br/>Add to all this the fact that it's completely hilarious throughout to the point where I have no hesitation in calling it the funniest movie of the year and easily the best straight comedy (not that there have been many good ones; three by my count). Plus, of course, Zooey Deschanel is absolutely infectious in every moment she's on screen (especially her lovely singing). I love her more than air, and this is just another example of why that love is justified. Call it fanboyism if you must, but she's my #2 of the year in supporting actress right now falling second only to the Cruz. In summation, do yourself a favor and say yes to this great comedy.<br/><br/>I'm so sorry, I had to say it."
"Davide74","7","57","66","31 December 2008"," Yes Man
","I always get excited about a new Jim Carrey movie. In my opinion, he has rarely done anything unwatchable in whatever genre from The Mask to Liar Liar via Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. Yes Man is an excellent feel-good comedy with an outstanding turn from Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel & Terence Stamp. The movie is unfortunately predictable (like most Jim Carey flicks) but very enjoyable with a hard-to-ignore message about how people should live their lives. Don't be surprised after seeing the film to start saying yes a bit more often and how much of a difference it may have on your daily life. Yes Man is a worthy addition to Jim Carrey's filmography."
"zoe_washburn","10","221","276","27 December 2008"," Don't be a no man!
","I went to this film as one of those process-of-elimination things: Valkry had Tom Cruise, my friend had already seen Benjamin Button, Spirit's show-times suck, my local theater is idiotic and not showing Doubt or Slumdog Millionaire, all leaving Yes Man which neither of us were enthused about, but hey! it got us out of the house. We were shocked to leave the theater with our lungs hurting. The movie was well thought, well executed, and the humor was smart, snappy, and so far from the usual toilet humor of Jim Carrey. I was throughly and delightfully surprised with this film. On the note of message: I think this film actually has a very valuable message. Never in the history of humankind has the average person had so many opportunities to live life in ways never before imagined, yet never before have we been so isolated. Our computers; our phones; our mp3s and ipods; dare I say it, our movies all keep us isolated from actual social interaction. We are skeptical and judgmental about those who actually seek social interaction and friendship (site: Norman) that we fail to realize we are the ones who are actually lame--we are the ones not gathering with the people we love and those we have yet to meet. We are the ones spending our nights lulled into lame predictability, sitting in front of our TVs, telling characters in films to ""just snap it off already."" Yes Man is not just a fun filled film. It is a well deserved social critique."
"bopdog","6","232","302","20 December 2008"," Pure joy. A great film, true to its rom-com genre roots. I was uplifted, and grandly entertained!
","Yes Man was a delight to watch. Critics had panned it a bit, but unfairly, in my view. Granted, it is formulaic, but it IS a rom-com, and rom-coms have formulas. What made this film so great was the natural charm of Zooey Deschanel. She is beautiful, of course, but not in a ""model-y"" kind of way. She has always had a freshness and honesty about her that makes her appealing. When I first saw her in ""Almost Famous,"" playing the older sister, I wished I had an older sister like that. When she played the girl lead in Big Trouble, she was quirky, but without any of the self-aware conceit that can often accompany quirky young female actors. I will be kind and avoid names, but perhaps you can picture in your mind some of the ""Tragically Hip"" and oh-so-cool young actresses who do quirk with a smirk. Zooey Deschanel has an innocence and a friendly quality that really make her shine, in the way a flower shines.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey was also very good in this. He is who he is--- goofy and loopy and elastic. This wasn't a ""Serious Role,"" such as Truman Show serious--- but wasn't over the top like Ace Ventura. Maybe he's mellowed with age. I liked him as a wild kid, but like him even more now that he is a bit ""evened out."" He is still hilarious--- but also a bit more human, and a bit more approachable.<br/><br/>This movie runs through its rom-com paces, but each new scene, while a bit predictable, was nonetheless a pleasure. I felt uplifted by the end, and am very glad I went, even in the blizzard occurring where I am now staying. It was worth it!"
"saarvardi","9","160","220","15 December 2008"," Carrey is back with a bang. Yes! Yes! Yes!
","Being a teenager in the 1990's, I have to say I was never a big fan of Jim Carrey's mainstream performances in the movies that made him the star that he is today. Hits like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Liar Liar left me mostly indifferent to Carrey's rather obscene personality. It was only when he shined in more complex roles like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon and eventually Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that I grew to respect the wide range of characters Carrey is able to bring to life.<br/><br/>Over recent years, Carrey continued doing his thing, moving from comedy to dramatic roles and vice versa. The problem is that all of the sudden he wasn't alone in the ring anymore, and countless other comedians have tried to slip into his shoes to various degrees of success. There was no place to deny it; Carrey was in need of a hit to re-establish his place in the Hollywood sky.<br/><br/>Cue the brand new comedy Yes Man, that finds Carrey once again in his favorite ""What if...?"" sub-genre. This time around, he plays Carl, a lonely divorc√©e that has somehow alienated even his best friend (portrayed successfully by Wedding Crasher's Bradley Cooper). Carl is stuck in a dead-end job at a bank, yearns for his ex-wife and spends his evenings watching rented DVDs... all by himself. When an old friend introduces him to a corny self-help program (lead by a hilarious Terrence Stamp) that persuades him to answer ""yes"" to every question thrown his way, Carl's life takes a dramatic turn.<br/><br/>As expected, the new approach gets our hero into all kinds of wacky situations - such as spending a steamy morning with his horny elderly neighbor (!); meeting a potential Iranian wife through an online service; partying all night whilst drinking countless cans of Red-Bull and over excessively helping a homeless person. Luckily enough, it also introduces him to the extremely free-spirited Allison (portrayed by the ever-so-cute Zooey Dashnel).<br/><br/>If you've seen the average Carrey comedy, you can probably guess how the plot unfolds from here on out, necessary complications included. The format is more or less the same of what we've been used to seeing Carrey perform in his comic outings, with the main idea being a modern moral story urging people to stop going through the motions of life and start seizing the day. But I digress. It seems as though years of perfecting his comic roles as well as starring in more ""grown up"" roles have tamed Carrey a bit. A lot of the arrogance and awkwardness revolving his earlier films seem to be missing this time out, and instead I could actually feel true emotion and heart in Yes Man. It seems as if this fact alone contributed greatly to the fact that most of the punch lines actually worked here and I found myself smiling for the larger part of the film.<br/><br/>Some points that still managed to ruin some of the fun are: A. As mentioned above, the film was very predictable, and formulated at that. B. Carrey has definitely aged recently, and it's starting to show. The age gap between him and Dashnel left me feeling somewhat uncomfortable.<br/><br/>However, all in all I had a great time with some excellent laughs - and at the end of the day that's what really counts (:"
"Joejoesan","8","72","95","29 November 2008"," Carrey's return to box office greatness?
","After commercial failures like Lemony Snicket, Fun with Dick and Jane and The Number 23 Jim Carrey could use another hit. Yes Man might just do the trick. It will undoubtedly not only mark Carrey's return to box office greatness (a 45 million dollar opening (when there are no snowstorms around)?), it will also go into history as the first movie in which the Canadian born actor gets oral sex on screen. No kidding. But more on that later.<br/><br/>Yes Man is a typical Jim Carrey feel good movie. Like Bruce Almighty (a human becomes God), The Mask (a mask transforms a zero into a hero) and Liar Liar (a man is forced to tell the truth all the time) the film has a strong but ridiculous premise. What would happen if you said yes to every offer that you got? The story features Carl Allen (Carrey), a dull man who got stuck in a dull life. He's living the same life for at least three years now ¬ñ ever since his girlfriend left him for another. His best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper) tries to draw him back into life, but Carl remains a hermit, saying no to every invitation he gets. When he accidentally forgets Peter's engagement party Carl decides to change his life drastically. He signs up for a Yes Man seminar by philosophy guru Terrence Bundley (Terrence Stamp) and embraces life by saying yes to any offer that's made to him. Guitar lessons, flying lessons, even a penis enlargement: Carl is your man. And wow, his life does get better. Carl not only gets a promotion, he also meets the charming Alison (Zooey Deschanel), a free spirit who sings in a band and has a job as a photographer. The two fall in love. But what happens when Alison finds out about his Yes Man way of life and begins to doubt if he really wants to choose for her?<br/><br/>Ever since I saw the trailer I wanted to see Yes Man. In dark times we all need a laugh and let's face it: there's a lot of truth in the fact that only a Yes opens up new opportunities in life. Luckily, Jim Carrey fans should not be worried: Yes Man delivers the goods. The story is safely predictable and although Carrey carries the movie, he gets help from a strong supporting cast. Terrence Stamp is great as Yes man guru. Bradley Cooper ¬ñ Carrey best friend in the movie - is a handsome man with some great screen presence. This movie could be his real breakthrough. But the real treat in Yes Man is Zooey Deschanel (The Happening, Bridge to Terabithia) as Carrey's love interest Alison. You can't help but falling in love with her in this movie. She's happily strange and immensely charming. I give her a 9/10 on the Drew Barrymore scale (with Drew having a 10/10 of course). <br/><br/>Storywise Yes man starts rather nice. When Carl learns that 'Yes' means progress and 'No' could mean punishment he reluctantly agrees to almost anything ¬ñ including his 70 year old toothless female neighbor giving him oral sex. I don't know what to think of the scene actually. It is funny, but it's a long way from the Claw in Liar Liar ¬ñ if you know what I mean. Needless to say, Yes man is not exactly family entertainment. On the other hand, in Transformers there was also a dialogue about masturbating. So maybe Hollywood is growing up. One of the funniest scenes is the one that follows the kissing of a beautiful girl in the bar (as seen in the trailer). Her boyfriend wants to beat up Carl and what follows is a very funny fight between a muscled dumbo and a very drunk Carrey. In this scene Carrey really shows his comedic talent. Pretty hilarious.<br/><br/>Overall Yes Man is nice entertainment. Carrey fans won't be disappointed and there are a lot of strong moments. Too bad the ending of the movie seems rushed. All the actions Carl undertakes under his Yes Man spell suddenly all turn out for the better (and that's just a little bit too convenient). The movie is only 82 minutes long and I suspect that there are a lot of scenes cut that could've given the story more drama and suspense. Despite the oral sex scene Yes Man is Jim Carrey's most romantic movie in a long while. Just watch the scene on the Hollywood Bowl stage... Well done!"
"J_Trex","7","64","87","21 December 2008"," Funnyman Jim Carrey Returns
","After seeing ""The Number 23"" I was beginning to wonder if Jim Carrey had renounced his trademark physical comedy roles he played to such great effect in ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Liar, Liar"", ""Dumb & Dumber"", etc.<br/><br/>Carrey is back in form with ""Yes Man"". While the plot was lacking and somewhat formulaic, it was fun to watch the best physical comedy talent of our generation doing what he does best for two hours. Zooey Deschanel was good as the love interest (and she did a nice job singing to).<br/><br/>If you liked Carrey's earlier works, you'll find plenty to like in this movie. I hope Carrey keeps on doing these comedies. It's what he was born to do."
"jon.h.ochiai","9","21","27","3 January 2009"," Say ""Yes"" to ""Yes Man""
","""Yes Man"" is surprisingly good, and here the punch line is everything. Jim Carrey is great in Director Peyton Reed's hysterical romantic comedy. Zooey Deschanel is amazingly charming and quirky. In ""Yes Man"" Carrey plays Carl, who has been divorced for 3 years from Stephanie (flighty and hot Molly Sims) and has an uninspired job as a loan officer at Brea Savings in Los Angeles. Carl has pretty much checked out in life. To that end he says ""No"" to all invites. Carl even forgets to attend his best friend Peter's (funny Bradley Cooper) engagement party. An old buddy invites Carl to a seminar given by Tony Robbins-like self help guru Terrence Bundley (charismatic Terrence Stamp). Terrence invites Carl to accept the ""covenant"" to say ""Yes"" to everything in life. Reluctantly, Carl accepts.<br/><br/>However, there is a point to the screenplay by Nicholas Stoller, Jarrad Paul, and Andrew Mogel based on the book by Danny Wallace. In a great conversation with Carl and Terrence later in the story Carl asks, ""So this is bullsh*t?"" Carl has been so not present in his own life. Obviously, saying ""Yes"" mindlessly to everything is ridiculous. What if taking on saying ""Yes"" as an operating practice is a way of practicing being enrolled in life. When you are enrolled in life, and become enrolling, you are now open to a new realm of possibility. Reed and his writers present this transformed perspective in both a hysterical and touching manner.<br/><br/>Saying ""Yes"" immediately does not seem to make a difference for Carl. Carl ends up giving a ride and all of his money to Homeless Guy (funny Brent Briscoe). With his cell phone dead and his car empty on gas, Carl ventures miles to a gas station where he meets free-spirited scooter girl Allison (Deschanel). Allison gives Carl a ride, and leaves an indelible mark on his heart. In not the most linear or obvious ways, Carl soon embraces saying ""Yes"". Peter asks, ""So you say 'yes' to everything?"" Carl confesses, ""I wasn't open to stuff. Now I am¬Ö"" <br/><br/>Carl eventually is fated to meet up with Allison. Carl tells Peter that ""¬ÖShe is so not me."" There in lies the genius. There is a quiet moment at the Hollywood Bowl where Allison tells Carl, ""The whole world is a playground. Somewhere along the way everyone forgets that¬Ö"" Here Reed is unexpectedly poignant. Carrey and Zooey's sweet and funny chemistry give ""Yes Man"" its big heart.<br/><br/>""Yes Man"" is hysterical. Carrey is at his best playing outrageous comedic with an underlying humanity, instead of straight up serious drama. He is amazingly hysterical as he serenades a Jumper (funny Luis Guzman), takes a drunken beating from an angry boyfriend, and jacked up on Red Bull in a jogging photography class. Zooey Deschanel is Carrey's amazing romantic foil. There is a nice scene as she and Carrey walk side by side along a barren Nebraska road. She is cute and has such a radiant spirit and vulnerability. So her Allison must touchingly reconcile for herself whether Carl is just saying ""Yes"". ""Yes Man"" is about what's in your heart and being open to all the possibilities of life. That's not a bad message for a hilarious and outrageous comedy from Jim Carrey and Peyton Reed. Say ""Yes"" to ""Yes Man""."
"mitchlax14","7","95","142","17 December 2008"," A very good flick!
","I saw this movie as a early showing and having gotten the tickets for free I said ""what the heck, I'll see anything for free"". So right off the bat I went in with low expectations. The previews made it look like the same old Jim Carrey Schtick. However, I was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>There was no ridiculous plot line (Liar Liar) or over the top characters (Ace Ventura) but a simple yet humorous story-line that is played to perfection by Carrey. There were plenty of good chuckles to be had and some down right laughs (and yes for those into it, a gross out scene that will make even this amazingly desensitized movie going generation cringe).<br/><br/>Overall, Yes Man is definitely worth the 10 bucks or so that movies are now ridiculously priced out now a days. But most definitely worth the trip if its free :-p. <br/><br/>*7/10*"
"goulding_m","10","144","224","5 December 2008"," This movie is really good!
","Despite the fact that I am a huge fan of Carrey, I admit a lot of his comedic performances are somewhat ridiculous. But this is legitimately a sensible comedy where he doesn't use a lot of his ""Rubberface"" antics and actually just acts funny. The premise of this film is intriguing and I loved watching it. Both Jim and Zooey are excellent the story is amazing. All the Carrey-haters should give this one a chance, it really deserves it. I think Jim's most recent movies have been great. It's his older movies that people hate him for. But he's becoming a legit dramatic actor who can also be funny. He sometimes goes over the top, but all-in-all he is a multi-faceted professional. This movie deserves a lot of praise because it is excellent. This brings back flashes of his performance in the extremely popular ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". In closing, give ""Yes Man"" a chance. It's good for some laughs but also offers a very optimistic view on life in general."
"laymonite-2","5","12","18","10 April 2009"," Probably exactly what you imagine it will be.
","Carrey pulls his faces and is occasionally annoying while 'doing his thing' (pulling faces and being 'crazy') as you would expect. Unfortunately this doesn't fit in with his character at all, which is kind of the basis of the film.<br/><br/>There is no apparent reason why Carrey is some kind of 'stay at home' life waster as he always instantly charms crowds and attractive ladies wherever he goes and has a bunch of friends.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is utterly formulaic and predictable. But you can tell that from the trailer.<br/><br/>There ARE laugh out loud moments though, and although Zooey Deschanel has little point ultimately, she really charms you despite the horrible script and unlikely direction her character takes.<br/><br/>The whole thing is basically a formulaic Carrey vehicle. WHY is he so popular to the characters in the film? And talented and funny to everyone he meets...while supposedly being some kind of secretive social inadequate outcast? It's an OK and fun film, a formulaic Carrey vehicle and fine for a laugh and to rent and enjoy and then forget."
"ltlacey","3","12","18","7 April 2009"," A man who usually says no to everything is convinced to say yes to everything instead.
","The first twenty minutes of this movie looked promising, and actually was fairly good, but then it went downhill, and kept gaining speed as it went further and further downhill. What could have been a decent movie turned out not to be. Part of the problem is Carrey, who is getting too old to be playing such silly parts. There is a difference between silly, which can be fun, and stupid silly, which is just, well, stupid. As an actor ages there are some elements that made them famous in the first place that need to be matured and developed. There is nothing entertaining watching a man in his 40s behaving like someone in his 20s. And it's worse for women. Zooey D. was a total waste in this movie, and her monotone voice is getting old. The same advice goes for her. Liven it up, or just pigeonhole your career into the bored character that comes up with short and snappy lines (Big Trouble). And we won't even go there about the scene with the elderly neighbor. Shades of Grandma's Boy, without the good lines and younger characters. If you're a Carrey fan, wait until you can get it for free at the library."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","58","110","22 March 2009"," Not Jim's best, but still a nice comedy
","Jim Carrey, a man who has delivered some of the most memorable comedies of the 90's: Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, Dumb and Dumber, and the Mask. He used to be one of the funniest men alive, now it's just kind of odd, he's gone into the drama genre in films, which is good, he's actually proved to be a good actor. But with the comedy, it's like he was once the person who you would be first to invite to the party because he was so funny, now he's the guy who invites himself to the party and laughs at his own jokes. I think because he's older it's just awkward watching him trying so hard to make people laugh. Not that Yes Man is a bad film, it's just a different version of Liar Liar, yet he's not even hypnotized into saying yes to everything, he just does so because he thinks it'll make his life better. So instead of feeling bad for him you just go ""ummm, are you an idiot?"". I don't wanna know if a man hit on him if he had to say yes to that too.<br/><br/>Los Angeles bank employee Carl Allen has become withdrawn and depressed since his divorce from ex-wife Stephanie. Routinely ignoring his friends, he has grown used to spending his spare time watching DVDs alone in his apartment. His outlook on life has become inherently negative. But when a friend persuades him to attend the ""Yes!"" self-improvement seminar, motivational guru Terrence Bundley publicly browbeats him into making a covenant with himself. Carl reluctantly promises to stop being a ""No Man"" and vows to answer ""Yes!"" to every opportunity, request or invitation that presents itself thereafter. After the seminar he meets Allison, an eccentric young woman who is refueling her scooter. After this experience, Carl adopts a positive mentality and seizes every opportunity that comes his way. He takes flying lessons, attends Korean language classes, learns to play the guitar, and even joins a Persian dating website. Saying ""yes"" constantly works to Carl's advantage. As their relationship blossoms, Carl and Allison meet at the airport for a spontaneous weekend excursion. But while checking in for the flight, Carl is detained by FBI agents, who have profiled him as potential terrorist because he has taken flying lessons, studied Korean, approved a loan to a fertilizer company, met an Iranian mail-order bride, and bought plane tickets at the last minute. Then Allison begins to doubt whether his commitment to her was ever sincere.<br/><br/>Yes Man is over all a good comedy, it has a few good laughs here and there. I think the plot just needed a bit of work, because like I said before it's just odd that he isn't hypnotized into saying yes constantly, he just does so because someone told him to do it. Yeah, it brought him to some great moments in his life, but he ordered a bride? He's just a little bit crazy. But over all I'd have to say that this movie is more of a rental vs. a theater experience. Jim Carrey can still make you laugh, but not the same as he used to, it's just time to grow up, how long can you make those stupid faces for without looking ridicules being a grown man? Well, the money helps I guess.<br/><br/>6/10"

And the other person: Fionnula Flanaghan who plays the nasty, sexually & very funny neighbor of Carl Allen and delivers us one of the most disgusting & very funny scenes in years (not giving you spoilers)!!

","Yes Man<br/><br/>Directed by Peyton Reed. Starring Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper.<br/><br/>In the late '90s, Jim Carrey decided he'd had enough of playing the silly goofball and started on a path to more serious films like ""The Truman Show."" Ten years later, he's had his share of hits, but for the most part, his comedic efforts have fallen flat. Excusing 2003's fairly enjoyable ""Bruce Almighty"", Carrey hasn't had much recent success with the genre that he once dominated (""Fun with Dick and Jane"", anyone?).<br/><br/>In ""Yes Man"", the skilled physical comedian has dusted off the cobwebs and is back in good form. Carrey really seems to be enjoying himself, putting on his best game face and immersing himself in the sight gags and slapstick madness that were so commonplace in his earlier films. He hasn't lost his touch or his talent at making people laugh, and he makes sure that the audience knows it.<br/><br/>Truthfully, the plot to ""Yes Man"" is irrelevant. Carl Allen (Carrey), a man afraid of living life, challenges himself to say 'yes' to everything for an entire year. Hilarity ensues and in the end, everyone learns a lesson. It's nothing more than a vehicle to showcase Carrey's ability. But really, which one of his comedies isn't? There are no unexpected twists or surprise endings, just Jim Carrey doing what Jim Carrey does best. Everything else is secondary.<br/><br/>The film is rounded out rather nicely by a few of its supporting players. Zooey Deschanel is a cute and bubbly romantic interest who even adds a bit of mayhem to the proceedings, instead of being relegated to straight-man status. ""Flight of the Conchords'"" Rhys Darby shines as Carl's Harry Potter-obsessed co-worker. However, some of the cast feels extraneous. Bradley Cooper and ""That '70s Show's"" Danny Masterson are given little to do, and contribute little as a result. The missed opportunities are irksome, but will do little to affect one's enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>""Yes Man"" is a fun time waiting to be had for those who know what to expect. The movie is generally funny throughout, but not clever or inventive enough to justify a second look. It's the kind of entertainment that leaves you chuckling, but won't be remembered long after viewing. The biggest thing going for the film is that it has re-energized Jim Carrey. He's an absolute joy to watch; one only wishes that ""Yes Man"" could keep up with him.<br/><br/>Final Grade: C+"

","The comedy, Yes Man stars Jim Carrey as Carl Allen, a man, who upon realizing he's losing his friends since he never wants to see them, agrees to go to a seminar as asked by an old friend named Nick (John Michael Higgins). The seminar is a yes seminar, in which a man named Terrence Bundley (Terrence Stamp) talks about the importance of saying yes to everything. Carl makes a deal with Terrence that he will say yes to everything, or else have bad luck for not saying yes. This leads to meeting a gorgeous biker chick/aspiring musician named Allison (Zooey Deschanel). The relationship, although involving an age difference is sweet, tender, and funny. Carl soon figures out the most important lesson of them all: you will not succeed in life being the boring, always refusing guy he is. As you dig deeper in the story, Carl soon figures out how to live life (going to nightclubs, traveling the world, getting hyper on red bull, etc.) Rhys Darby also steals some scenes as Carl's wacky boss, Norm.

","Overall, this movie is wonderful. But it could be bad, too. It depends on how you look at it. If you look at it as a comedy, you see it isn't exactly Carrey's best, but it's decent enough to rent. If you look at it as a romance, then you see it isn't very fulfilling, what with too much comedy and stupidity. Now I don't see it as one of these things.. I see it as a love story that happens to make you laugh. Two people practically MADE for each other that fall in love, a ridiculous premise involving a cult and a wise old man that sees the whole picture as the leader of that cult, and a lonesome and horny ex-wife. These three are the ultimate romantic comedy- no, no. Scratch that. This isn't a romantic comedy, this is a genuine love story with a pinch of humor. These three items make the ultimate love story, making you j*** in your pants because of the sheer awesomeness. When you go out to buy the DVD (and make sure you buy it, because you'll want to watch it over and over again) and watch it, wear protection.. No one likes sticky j*** of awesomeness in their pants.."
"Mihnea_aka_Pitbull","6","49","104","8 January 2009"," Such a good start, such a lousy outcome...
","The premise is good: that kind of sectarian gregariousness that turns people into a brainwashed flock, only to scream ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" at a ridiculous guru's finger-snapping - and its impact over one's life.<br/><br/>AND, for almost one third of the movie, the humor works well; Carrey is his old self (old - also in the negative sense: again, again, AGAIN the same grimaces!), but at least we guffaw in laughter often enough.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, around half-ways, the script turns messy, dissociated, incoherent... it departs the efficient logic that had led it till then. And the fun gets repetitive and ever more tired...<br/><br/>In the end, it leaves us with the fateful question: ""And so, what...?"" But, at least, it is some comedy... Mediocre, but still amusing... Not as the tons of trash that the Hollywood showbiz delivers all year long, under the Apatow and Seltzer signature. Thank God for the small favors - and small time comedies!"
"bbSouthstreet","8","17","32","20 December 2008"," Say ""Yes"" to ""Yes Man!""
","I am the biggest Jim Carrey fan I know, whenever a Jim Carrey movie comes out in theaters, I have to see it no matter how bad the premise sounds. I was there for his worse (Fun with Dick and Jane) and I was there for his best (Horton Hears a Who, The Number 23 and Bruce Almighty). As far as this new Jim Carrey venture goes, this is one of his best.<br/><br/>Besides Jim Carrey, the movie has a good deal to offer. We have Zooey Deschannel, beautiful and talented, singing new age music in the fictitious band ""Munchausen by Proxy."" Zooey was perfect for this movie because the crew could've had someone lame like Maggie Gyllenhaal or Cameron Diaz play in this. Zooey is really one of those new actresses who is daring and free spirited in her roles, thank God she starred in ELF and got noticed.<br/><br/>Okay, now on to the story. A lot of people say that this is too like ""Liar Liar."" Now I have to disagree and agree, it's a little similar with ""Liar Liar"" but not too much similar. The story, I find, is more realistic than Liar, as it gives a story we can relate to. I'm sure a lot of us are still brooding over that boyfriend/girlfriend we broke up with, and we just become zombie's after that, avoiding anything fun or exciting. The movie offers a good point, if you don't feel like going back to your old life, try a new and exciting life. The plot is kinda simple, but that's what comedy is about, being simple and taking a break from the serious plots like ""The Departed"" or ""The Dark Knight."" So when going to the movies and asked if you'd want to go see ""Yes Man,"" there is only only answer for that. Guess what it is."
"perttu_hartikainen","7","5","7","8 May 2009"," Your typical Carrey film
","""Yes Man"" seems to follow almost the exact same pattern as most of the Jim Carrey movies. We have an every-day-guy, who's life isn't what he would want it to be, then something bizarre happens that changes his life for a moment. During this moment he ends up in unusual events and he meets a girl, breaks up with her and gets together with her again in the end. Hmm...sounds familiar.<br/><br/>Although ""Yes Man"" doesn't give us anything new or special by storyline, it is still entertaining and for me at least fun/funny as hell. Carrey doesn't fail in performance, not a chance. Not nearly as good as his best performances (Me, Myself & Irene, for example) but still amusing and, as said before, funny as hell. Carrey has already proved his other side of his acting abilities (Number 23) so I forgive him this slightly overused style of self-expressionism.<br/><br/>I would recommend ""Yes Man"" for almost anyone who is not looking for anything ""groundbreaking"" from a Carrey flick, but who is in the need of a cheap laugh and a fun little detach from the boring reality. I give ""Yes Man"" a 7 out of 10 rating for keeping me interested in the life of Carl Allen, the man who has to say ""yes"" to everything. Nice one, Jim!"

","Meet Carl. Carl leads a life on his own. Somewhat miserable because he's always stuck with himself. Carl denies himself all the pleasures of life because he's unable to accept them. With each and every new opportunity arising he turns it down with a firm NO. Luckily for Carl he has a friend, a friend that pulls him along to a seminar where Carl is introduced to the power of Yes. Converted by the power of Yes Carl is now ready to accept life's challenges and chances, saying Yes to every single one of them.<br/><br/>And so the film starts running and shooting gags concerning each of the accepted chances and the very most of them work out pretty well. Carrey is on a roll playing the plagued Carl that has to swallow down quite a few odd things during his days of the all-accepter. The pace of the film comes to its final speed when Carl runs into Allison though, who I guess can be considered his final and most challenging opportunity. It works out flawlessly - Deschanel plays her brilliantly and the two characters together work out more than well enough.<br/><br/>The story line plays by rather predictable, but that's fine. It's no big mystery of life that is being challenged here after all. And when the film finally comes to its end all it can do is leave a smile on the face of the audience - time to say Yes and accept that life can be a swell place after all.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 opportunities taken"
"fredman5555","7","5","7","20 December 2008"," What a fun movie!
","I have to admit, I was skeptical at first. I hadn't seen a Carrey movie in awhile -- the last one was Lemony Snicket's which was not too great in my opinion, but the previews and the reviews for this looked good so I figured I'd give it a chance. I was happily surprised! Jim Carrey has improved over the years -- no doubt about it, and for a start, one thing I really liked about this movie was how he took it to a semi-serious level while managing to interject humor that, for the most part, wasn't aimed at the intelligence of the average seven year old. This movie has a plot. It has drama, and to a point, it draws you in.<br/><br/>Carrey got rid of (well nearly) his almost constant facial contortions which had defined so many of his past movies. For this one, he relied on the personality of his character, which was placed in the potentially compromising situation of always having to say yes, to be what led the movie, and he did a good job of it.<br/><br/>The movie was truly enjoyable overall, and you do feel sorry for his character toward the end when he has a falling-out with the leading lady (though not so sorry that you actually want to cry yourself). The emotional level of this movie is simply, ""fun."" It won't ""wow"" you! You won't leave the theater feeling like you've run the gamut of emotions yourself or anything like that, but you won't be disappointed either. You'll leave the movie smiling. Oh, and be sure you stay through the credits!<br/><br/>All-in-all I give it a 7 of 10. The acting was believable, good but not great, and entertaining 'til the end. The premise was plausible, and the characters are pleasant to look at, but perhaps most interesting is how there really is a good lesson built in there for all of us to learn.<br/><br/>Go ahead. Take a break from holiday shopping and enjoy this flick! You'll be happy you did."

","It's another piece of Jim Carrey's Classic hits! The movie is good humored with happy ending and kind of film which you can watch either with family or friends and even with your love partner. Throughout the film, its basic theme runs about a person committing his each answer with a yes; but not only this its also about how friends stand for you through your tough time and how being optimistic in life can be beneficial for you! It's Jim's acting which takes the movie double the way up to what it actually is,any other actor and the movie would have been flop! Bradley Cooper fans would love him in his supporting role. The only thing which movie lacks is showing less negative effects of saying yes which made it a bit less humored. The ending could have been made more tricky. Overall, after watching this film, you might change your mind and decide to say yes for a year yourself.!<br/><br/>My movie ratings are on following basis each having 2 stars: 1. Plot: 1.5/2 half star reduced for the ending, as said could have made more tricky and humorous. Otherwise, great plot. 2. Cast & Crew: 2/2 with Jim Carrey in it, says it all but with Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper, it was icing on the top! 3. Imagination: 2/2 a very unique idea effectively shown in motion. 4. Cinematography: 1/2 was nothing much to be talked about it as it ran simple with good humor. 5. How much it satisfied its genre: 2/2 1 for comedy and 1 for romance. Romance was not over the top, it was just like it is in Jim Carrey's movies. So overall rating- 8.5 <br/><br/>THANKS."

","Every comedy except for this one. Not only did I care about the characters so much (thanks mostly to the performances from Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel who put a beautiful, free-spirited romance at the core of this seemingly typical comedy) that I was emotionally impacted during that predictable turn for the worse near the end, but the message of the film was actually something that I found relatable to my own life which is something I've never experience during these kind of comedies. I'm definitely a man who doesn't really live his life (as cheesy as that sounds) because I isolate myself by making excuses to just be alone and not be with anyone. As a result, I was definitely more invested in this film than I have been with other comedies of the same vein.<br/><br/>Add to all this the fact that it's completely hilarious throughout to the point where I have no hesitation in calling it the funniest movie of the year and easily the best straight comedy (not that there have been many good ones; three by my count). Plus, of course, Zooey Deschanel is absolutely infectious in every moment she's on screen (especially her lovely singing). I love her more than air, and this is just another example of why that love is justified. Call it fanboyism if you must, but she's my #2 of the year in supporting actress right now falling second only to the Cruz. In summation, do yourself a favor and say yes to this great comedy."
"AngelDel","7","2","2","14 May 2010"," Of course it's a yes.
","Some still can't believe that Jim Carrey can indeed perform without resorting to his popular over-acting, and to those faces that have driven so many people insane with killer instinct (me included) in the past. For those as secure in this knowledge as to missing out on true wonders such as The Truman show or Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind (script that could never be praised loud enough), using Yes man as therapy for coming back to Carrey's worthy films is a must. Being fair, Yes man is somewhere in the middle (low middle, maybe) between the actor's histrionics and the two modern classics above, but hey, it's a first.<br/><br/>Yes man is a scream to life. For life. Quite a few hilarious moments and memorable comic scenes and characters in this very entertaining feel- good film (yeah, ""feel good"", never understood what is wrong with that) may only make you feel better about this complicated but enjoyable adventure of life.<br/><br/>ALSO, Zooey Deschanel (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) is in it. If there is a cuter, more lovable creature in God's Earth, producers have not taken notice yet, or she would be in the film instead. Producers are not idiots."

","Yes Man is a promising if not altogether fulfilling film. Although the film could inspire it is more of a middle of the way production, which entertains but fails to do anymore.<br/><br/>Zoey Deschanel is lovable and beautiful as the eccentric Alison who bumps into Carl after he begins to say Yes. There chemistry is spot on and just right for the film, providing an engaging relationship. To the credit of Carrey you forget that he is playing Carl he molds into the character very well.<br/><br/>Yes Man does unfortunately become coarse and lewd when it does not need to straying into inappropriate territory as though trying to provide meagre offerings of popular juvenile comedy which have been prominent in recent years.<br/><br/>Rhys Darby as Norman provides the biggest laughs with the Harry Potter themed party and a nod to 300, but on the comedy side of things Yes man is more a gentle showering of laughter.<br/><br/>Yes Man is a good film but it just doesn't either sway to a more serious or more comedic mood, it is pretty linear throughout and it just doesn't have that enchanting factor. Yes, go and see this film as it entertains but it has no element to make it more than just that."
"KineticSeoul","7","2","2","11 November 2009"," Yes, it's worth checking out.
","This was a surprising comedy, because I thought I won't like it that much and would end up a below average comedy. Even the trailer didn't seem that good and not very interesting. And even when the film started I just wanted to hate it but as the film progressed I started to enjoy it bit by bit. Most comedies usually have a strong start but start to lose it's flair after a while, this isn't the case for ""Yes Man"". This is a movie to get back to the younger audience for Jim Carrey where the premise is sort of similar to ""Liar Liar""(1997) except he isn't forced by some supernatural powers to say yes to everything. While in ""Liar Liar"" he could not lie because a curse was on him. In this movie he says yes to everything because it opens up doors for new opportunities in his life and it works for the better for him and by saying no he thinks bad stuff will happen to him because he makes a covenant, coincidence or not. But it just isn't something a lot of people hasn't seen before. Jim Carrey's character is one of those guys that stays in his apartment most of the time and hardly has interest in women and says no to just about everything. But that changes when a friend of his suggest he go to a seminar that could change his life for the better. And than his journey begins with random stuff happening in his life when he starts saying yes to everything while being obnoxious and retarded to the point you could tell Zooey Deschanel who Jim Carrey's character falls for is annoyed by him even while trying to act. This is a okay date movie as well since it's actually quite amusing at times and like I said has it's moments while going the romantic comedy direction. Although younger audiences will probably enjoy this movie, it just isn't really appropriate for them. It would have been cool though if they pushed the yes factor and made Jim Carrey do even crazier stuff.<br/><br/>7/10"
"sddavis63","7","2","2","23 October 2009"," The Power Of ""Yes""
","In all honesty Jim Carrey sometimes grates on me. He's funny, but far too often his humour becomes too over the top and his characters become cartoons rather than real people. When he keeps that to a minimum, though, he can work very well, and he managed to pull that balance off with ""Yes Man."" Of the Carrey movies I've seen I'd probably compare this most to ""Bruce Almighty"" - not in terms of plot but in terms of the type of character he was playing and the challenges the character was facing. In this, Carrey played Carl Allen, a loan officer at a bank who leads a pretty empty, lonely and unproductive life. One day, a buddy convinces him to attend a self-help seminar, where he learns to start living life by saying ""yes"" to every opportunity that comes up. Terrence Stamp, by the way, was absolutely bang-on as the self-help guru.<br/><br/>Thanks to the power of ""yes"" Carl's life moves into overdrive. Suddenly he's involved with everything and everyone: from guitar lessons, flying lessons and Korean lessons to a new job as an executive to a new love - and he's loving his life. Finally, though, his new love interest, played by Zooey Deschanel, reminds him of reality. She tells him that she loves him and asks him to move in with her. Of course he says ""yes,"" but when she finds out about the program she backs out - does he really want to or is he just following the program? Can she believe a word he says to her? The key to the movie in the end is whether Carl can learn to really live his own life rather than just being enslaved to the program that originally seemed to have given him freedom.<br/><br/>It's an interesting premise for a movie, very well written and well acted, and, in the end, both thought-provoking and a lot of fun. 7/10"

","The banker Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a lonely man with low self-esteem after his divorce with Stephanie (Molly Sims), for whom he still yearns; he avoids his best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper); he has a boring job, stalled in a bureaucratic position in the loan department of a bank; and he spends his spare time watching DVDs. When he meets by chance his former high school mate Nick (John Michael Higgins), he is convinced to participate of a self-help program called ""Yes Man"" leaded by the guru Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). The basic principle of the program is to say ""yes"" to new situations, leaving the negativism aside. Carl misunderstands the concept and says ""yes"" to every question. While leaving the encounter, he helps a homeless man and in the end of the night he meets the gorgeous Allison (Zooey Deschanel) that helps him with her scooter. His life completely changes with his new attitude: he becomes closer to his manager Norman (Rhys Darby) and is finally promoted in the bank; he experiences the most surrealistic and the weirdest situations, and becomes successful and with many friends, until the day that he discovers that sometime a ""no"" is necessary for an answer.<br/><br/>""Yes Man"" is a good romance that highlights the importance of changing attitude in life. Carl Allen is a very negative man that has no progress in his lonely life, but when he changes his behavior and becomes a positive man, he achieves love and success. The story has many absurd situations, but is very funny. I like Jim Carrey and this role is tailored for him. The cute Zooey Deschanel shows a great chemistry with him and the result is an entertaining movie with a good message in the end.

","This was not only one of the worst Jim Carrey movies I've seen- and I've seen them all... it is one of the worst FILMS I have seen in the last few years.<br/><br/>Some reviews I read here are quick to forgive how ""formulaic"" this movie is... and I am a sucker for a good formula. I enjoy a good romantic comedy too. However, a rom-com should be EITHER romantic or funny, hopefully both. This was neither.<br/><br/>The romance was completely unbelievable, no chemistry whatsoever. Carrey acts disconnected, and while he is not over the top, the comedy seems desperate... not insane- funny like he used to be, I mean his Dumb and Dumber character was even endearing, and I loved that movie. Here, he is just... dull. Then he transforms and he is... still dull. <br/><br/>The primary thing about this movie here is, I don't believe it. <br/><br/>I am a pro at suspending disbelief to enjoy a movie... but here, I didn't believe one phony minute of the entire movie. For example, in one scene, he is following the girl of his dreams, and she says ""stop, get away from me. Farther!"" and he literally runs, brushing his friend aside, sprinting away in the middle of a busy airport. Because, you see, she asked him to go away, and he must obey. OK. There was some nervous laughter in the theatre as if people felt some obligation. Another time he gets in a fight in an alley and ... nothing either funny or dramatic happens. Actually that pretty much explains the whole movie. I'm not saying that you really need anything special to happen... I mean I like guys just sitting there talking sometimes, if the dialog is witty and the characters are likable and believable (e.g. 40 year old virgin, knocked up, Seinfeld the classic TV example, etc).<br/><br/>NO spoiler here but I felt the ending was a final, fitting, nose-thumbing to the audience from the imagination-less buffoons that obviously think that just trotting poor Carrey out there doing the same old thing would be good enough for us. What they forgot however, is you need a plot, decent writing, a believable situation, dramatic tension, jokes or at least some form of humor, and chemistry between the actors. I felt sorry for Carrey in this movie. Nothing wrong with him... he did his best but there was nothing here to work with.<br/><br/>That's 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back- even worse, it felt like twice that."

","If Stoller, Paul and Mogel (the 'writers') needed toilet paper, they should've gone to their local supermarket for a roll of extra soft Charmins. This 'movie' (to use the term so loosely it's blasphemous), exploits Carrey's comedic talents to make money and possibly tarnish the art of film-making. It's perfectly fine if you go to a movie for laughs, or just to see something light instead of an 'Oscar contender'. What's not fine is how so many mediocre films similar to this seem to come out of a factory instead of someone's imagination.<br/><br/>What's bad about it? The story--what is the story? A depressed guy who says ""no"" to everything is encouraged to say yes--only he does it without thinking, making things worse. Cue physical comedy. Things go wrong. Time for moral. Cue montage. More physical comedy. Cue wrap-up scene. If I wanted to see something predictable I would have just stayed home and watched TV. I feel so bad about what I've just seen that I don't even feel like continuing this review. Please, stop supporting bad films. If you wonder at how Aaron Seltzer movies (Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, etc.) get made, it's because people continue to see them. I was coerced into buying a ticket to Yes Man, but I'm no less guilty than the ones who went willingly. Still, I feel I've been punished enough for having to sit through it.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is too talented for trash like this. If you think your brain cells should not disappear and the size of your anus is just fine the way it is, do not see Yes Man because it will feel like a lobotomy and rape at the same time. If you absolutely need to dispose of 10 dollars, rent The Mask or Dumb and Dumber."
"WnhJohnson","1","12","24","6 January 2009"," Bad Review
","My husband and I went and saw this at our local drive in and thought it was a terrible movie. We were expecting something funnier since Jim Carrey was in it, possibly something that went to outrageous lengths as Liar, Liar did. It just didn't seem to have any real point to it and dragged on. I understood that they were trying to sell the importance of saying YES to things and letting your life take you in different directions, but it just got weird. Jim Carrey's character getting in trouble with homeland security for getting on a plane spontaneously makes our government systems look good and bad. GOOD because it would be great if they actually were aware of such things and some odd behavior. BAD because they were so far off, and they just came off like idiots. The explanation that was given by the lawyer to the Home Land Security, would NEVER be accepted, so it just became really unrealistic in a movie that they were trying to make saying YES to things parallel true events."
"nikki-folwell","3","5","8","3 January 2009"," Love Jim Carrey, but definitely wouldn't sit through this again,
","I went into this movie trying not to expect too much from it. Lord knows, Hollywood has been pumping out so much crap recently that it's difficult to think of any movie worth getting excited about, and a movie nearly always seems to be more satisfying when you arrive knowing that it's unlikely to be more than it's advertised as. But I've always loved Jim Carrey and, with the exception of Number 23 (because I heard so much negativity about that film that I just couldn't be bothered) always make an effort to try and catch everything that he's in. And with this film getting positive reception from so many places, I crossed my fingers and went in for the grating two hours.<br/><br/>In three words, I was disappointed. As usual, Jim makes for an endearing and likable leading man (even if he is starting to look a little long in the tooth) and I really can't imagine anybody else pulling off this kind of role but him. And really, that goes without saying; it's hard to name any film where Jim hasn't been likable. But the script was so annoyingly stupid that it really made it hard to get into the story. Maybe I'm just bitter and cynical (all of my friends kept gushing afterward about how they found the movie ""inspiring"" and kept telling me to lighten up) but having to suspend this much belief in a comedy is always going to make for a prickly ride.<br/><br/>I ended up having so many issues with the screenplay that it's hard to know where to begin. Yes, I guess if you go through life constantly saying no to everything then you ARE going to miss out on opportunities, but to go to the opposite extreme and start saying yes to everything is not necessarily a better idea. It is, after all, what gets numerous people taking advantage of him - including his so-called friends, one of whom cons him into arranging his fianc√©'s bridal shower and another who even moves into his house while he's away - and ultimately taints his relationship with his love interest, when she finds out the truth behind his constant agreeing to things (and there's another problem; if you ask me her reasons for getting mad at him were really not that reasonable).<br/><br/>So why couldn't they just admit at the end that saying yes to everything is actually just as stupid as saying no to everything? Oh, that's right - because if you dare say no to anything then suddenly bad things will miraculously happen to you, even though that never happened to Jim when he said no to things BEFORE attending the self-help seminar. Which brings silly inconsistency into the script which it doesn't need, and makes the film that much less believable. If you're going to feature a supernatural subplot in a film, then it better have a fitting place for it. This kind of movie doesn't have that place.<br/><br/>And oh, how it runs out of steam towards the end. It doesn't even seem to know what it's trying to say, which was probably inevitable when you've got a concept as muddled as this, and ultimately solid proof for why they shouldn't have bothered. As a direct result, it gets so bored and desperate to wrap everything up that it finishes by resolving the ending only halfheartedly. To drag us through that kind of frustration is unforgivable in itself, but to conclude it with an ending both contrived, implausible and lacking in any decent sense is a right kick in the teeth. The part in which Jim reconciles with Zooey was so badly written that it left me wishing they HADN'T gotten back together, and the final quote from Terrance Stamp - ""say yes because you have to believe that it's what you really want"" - is so removed from what he was preaching before that it just makes the whole film look confused. What he really should've said was, ""Find a balanced happy medium in your life - say no where necessary and yes where necessary, so that you don't pick up a manipulative homeless man and get into trouble with the FBI"".<br/><br/>The movie is not without it's chuckles. The scene in which the withered old lady gives Jim oral pleasure was a surprising highlight. But the rest of the film was befuddled, silly, unconvincing and uneven, with an unsatisfying ending that won't admit to any of its mistakes. By all means, nice to see Jim back on top again at the box office, but definitely a case where a box office blockbuster doesn't automatically equate to a good film."

","I'm bored out of my skull with these same old half-assed movies being made where you know the story ending within 5 minutes of the opening credits. it almost feels as though someone with a lot of money at warner brothers or whatever says ""we got to make a movie where Jim Carey says YES to EVERYTHING, cause' thats bound to get people in curious to see what happens, cause Jim Carey has a reputation or whatever!"" and sure enough people will go and see it, the movie company makes their money and I'm left feeling ripped off. i think people now know when a movie has been made with heart and passion rather than being made because it has to be made. i guess at the back of my mind i knew it would be like it was but Jim Carey has always been credible in my mind because of his infamous back loge of legendary movies(from the ace Ventura-eternal sunshine) but the latest few movies he has done left me feeling tricked into watching them because of Jim Carey. there was no real character building, i didn't connect or relate to any of the characters (in fact i cant even remember them) forgettable performances, overall borderline boring!!!"

","Would you be willing to say yes to everything just to prove that you're not just an ordinary and shallow man? Now who in the world would actually do this? Apparently and fortunately, Jim Carrey.The comic genius who gave us 'The Mask' and the Ace Ventura movies returns with something new and refreshing.He takes the literal use of the word ""Yes"" and mixes it with lots of comedy and some romance and the outcome is a movie that's both simple and entertaining.So why are people saying ""No"" to 'Yes Man'? Is it because you're tired of the same old crude humor that he's always involved with when it comes to his movies.C'mon, this is a good movie that really doesn't need rude behavior or slapstick violence to make it's own purpose on comedy.I say ""No"" to the people who dislike Carrey's work and I most certainly say ""Yes"" to 'Yes Man'."

","This movie is a fun one has good humor and is interesting until somewhere before the end. I mean don't expect the best work of Jim Carrey here but it's better than Bruce Almighty in my opinion. The humor is understandable by anyone but not one in a dozen, it is keeps it freshness throughout.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there are some problems with this movie as well, the movie keeps strict to the formula of a Rom-Com so you aren't surprised anywhere and can guess the plot from the beginning to the end. This is not to bad if you can switch off your mind and just enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Worse is the need to have a moralistic end. Without telling how or what I will just say that this forced moralistic ending upsets the whole flow of the movie and it would have made a better movie if it had been left out. The moral is to obvious and just bad.<br/><br/>The last flaw I really noticed was the enormous amount of products which were being endorsed by the film. It was almost funnier to watch every product which came by then the jokes of the film itself. Anyway it would make a great drinking game if you would drink every time anyone saw a product endorsement. One scene particularly would get you loaded when Jim Carrey shout a brand name at least ten times.<br/><br/>Again in short it was a good film but it could have been better. And if you need a drinking game this movie is bound to get you loaded."
"honorhorror","8","3","4","20 June 2009"," A lot of likable characters plus a thoughtful story.
","A lot of likable characters plus a thoughtful story. Apparently the movie is everything I didn't expect. It appeared to be a little too stereotypical when I saw the trailer. The protagonist got a dead-end life, and a chance of change just came in the form of a mental seminar. It sounds a lit too alike those ""don't believe the cheap American dream"" style of story. So I was expecting the ""spiritual teacher"" to turn out a cult hierarch who drives people into his whatever-magnitude conspiracy. And Jim Carrey's gonna do something to stop him. How stereotypical I was.<br/><br/>The story, implied by the plot outline on this site, was a self-exploration story which is relevant to us, everyone who's in a dead-end status quo on this planet. But it offered more, it's written with heart and the performances deserved many praises. The story managed to pull the brake at perfect timings before it's gone totally crazy for several times. Finally it turned out to be both hilarious and inspiring. It got the message delivered that those straight-minded people really deserved more care, understanding and guidance. Yet it's not really selling any tin-can theory on the big screen. The final moments are very well done. It could be one of the best comedic ending I've ever seen.Carrey's comfortable in the title role, though I am not sure if he was totally comfortable with everything he was asked to do during filming. Zooey did a her part and stole the show every single time she's on screen, not only for her hot appearance, but also for her comedian talents. Anyway audiences could be mislead by the trailer and skip it, but the movie's better than its trailer, and that's a rare thing in the industry today.<br/><br/>Well, there are some awkward moments, and all of them are related to an elder woman who tried to seduce Jim everyday. When I watched it, I shook my head and thought that's the only thing overdone. the makers managed to set the tones right and got the movie a PG-13 rating, but IMO that single scene could get the movie an R. Anyway the whole movie's too mature for a 13-years-old.<br/><br/>8 stars, if they delete or alter the scene I mentioned I'd give it 9."
"ryanaustinf","8","3","4","12 June 2009"," Hilarious in every way
","Well people, what can you say about Jim Carrey? He's hilarious! From The Mask to Bruce Almighty, he's been making us laugh. He's one of my favorite comedians and I'm probably gonna give his other movies reviews. Let me just state that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only facts will be events in the movie. Jim Carrey's the man but in here, he's the Yes Man. ---------------------------------------Spoiler Line------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>So our main characters are Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) and Allison ( Zooey Deschanel). They are likable and Carl is hilarious. Our villain is¬Ö is there a villain? Oh yes, our villain is a word¬Ö NO. Wow, I never thought a movie's main villain would be a word. Let alone a two-letter word. Well, since there is no villain, this will be a pass. Our supporting characters are Norman (Rhys Darby), Pete (Bradley Cooper), Stephanie (Molly Sims), and Lucy (Sasha Alexander). These characters are subtly placed in the story. Norman is Carl's boss, subtle. Pete is Carl's best friend, subtle. Stephanie is Carl's ex-wife, subtle. And, Lucy is Pete's fianc√©e that Carl has to throw a bridal shower for, subtle. Is the word subtle starting to sound weird to you? Anyway, these characters are played well and Norman is hilarious (It could be biased since I'm a Harry Potter fan and a scene in the movie is well, WATCH THE MOVIE). The comedy in here could be clean or crude. But either way, it's hilarious (Once again I could be biased since the HP bit was hilarious for a Potterhead). Finally, the story is simple and good. Carl keeps on giving up opportunities and saying no. He attends a seminar and makes a covenant to say ""yes"" to every opportunity. And it's a chain of events from here on. This film can make you laugh and, to a minimal extent, feel sad. So overall, I give Yes Man, an 83% awesome."

","Although I read many negative reviews of Yes Man, I still decided to go to the theater. That is totally a wise decision."" Yes Man"" is quite hilarious with a deep message about how to live and enjoy life. Some of you may see the trailer and think it is similar to one of Jim Carey's films ""Liar Liar"". Let me say this: it is totally different. Yes Man's plot is not so predictable. In fact, it is quite good. It really amazed me. It is full of funny moments and incredible scenes of Jim and Zooey. <br/><br/>This film got some romantic scene between Jim and Zooey. Jim Carrey in this film really impressed me because of his style. His acting is more natural and thoughtful than he was in ""Liar Liar"", reminding me of him in Eternal Sunshine.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel has got a specially sexy voice and big eyes, which makes me like her so far. She really has a unique style. <br/><br/>I really enjoy funny songs performed by two main characters (Jim's and Zooey's) with amusing lyricss.<br/><br/>Yes Man delivers a good message about positive living style. Therefore, it is really worth watching. Just give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."
"PipAndSqueak","8","3","4","10 January 2009"," Delightfully spontaneous
","This is a very well scripted film with some great lines, amusing situations and appealing characters. Even Australian Norm, played by Darby is beautifully crafted. It's not to be taken seriously of course. This film is a fine antidote to all the bad news that is swelling the news media at present. There are moments when you don't even recognise Carrey, he has matured very well and suits the role given him in this piece. He has good support from the other actors with only one weak point - Stamp is not convincing in his role. He is too much of an ageing and wobbly old man...maybe it is a realistic portrayal of a couple of the 'motiviator' types that are still promoting their +ve thinking messages long after they should have retired. Worthy amusement."
"inyourimage","9","3","4","9 January 2009"," I couldn't stop smiling! Not once through the whole movie!
","That is, except when I was laughing out loud. The movie is more than that though. It gives us some philosophical and even metaphysical potentialities to think about. ""Yes always leads to something good,"" is the presupposition offered to the protagonist. A true statement, but a trick assertion if one believes EVERYTHING leads to something good. ""Let your yea be yea and your nay be nay"" means either way leads to something good. Just be clear about what you want. Its being shifty and/or indecisive that leads to confusion and disharmony. Yet, I think this is just the kind of movie that will get people thinking differently, get people to act apart from habit, to see what happens, and get people experimenting with life. This is when we truly live. And I dare say, this is when we begin to have faith."
"savvo01","9","3","4","7 January 2009"," Impressive and charming
","Did I like this movie? YES Do I recommend you to see this movie? YES Will I buy this movie on DVD when it comes out? MAYBE (Maybe's good enough) The last film I saw at the cinemas was 'Step Brothers'. I left the cinema that day disappointed. I was fearing for the state of today's comedy films. Despite this, I watched Yes Man with a great deal of optimism, after being impressed with the trailer. And it was if the laws of attraction pulled through, because Yes Man is a very funny movie. I laughed more times (and harder) in the first 20 minutes of Yes Man than I did for the entire duration of Step Brothers.<br/><br/>Here's the plot: Jim Carrey stars as Carl Allen, a middle-aged man who is extremely stubborn towards all around him. He has a lot of trouble saying 'yes' to things and often escapes events and functions with a pack of lies. One night, Carl gets a phone call from his best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper), because Carl didn't attend Peter's engagement party (Carl would rather be at his local video store). Carl says he didn't want to go because he might see his ex-wife. Carl is eventually dragged along to a 'Say Yes!' convention by a friend, where he is singled out by the 'Guru of Yes!' and makes a covenant with himself to say 'yes' to everything.<br/><br/>He first exercises this covenant when he gives a homeless man a lift to a secluded area. This man also uses Carl's phone (and runs out the battery), runs out Carl's gas and asks for all his money (he has to say 'yes', remember?). So Carl runs to the nearest gas station (which isn't near at all), where he meets a young woman called Allison. Allison owns a motor scooter, and gives Carl a lift back to his car. They share a quick kiss then part ways.<br/><br/>Carl thinks that he has a chance with Allison, and realises that saying 'yes' can lead to great fortune (he never would have met her if he didn't give the homeless man a lift). So 'Yes Man' is a tale of serendipity, but it's not all lain out on a bed of roses. Saying 'yes' isn't always the way to go, and Carl learns that as the film progresses.<br/><br/>I can draw comparisons between this movie and Harold Ramis' 'Groundhog Day'. Phil Connors and Carl Allen are both similar, though Carl isn't as cynical as Phil. Both films are about a man trying to sort out his life, while making others feel happy.<br/><br/>The message I interpreted from this film is that life's too short to say 'no' to everything, and that sometimes you should take a risk, because it may turn out for the better. Sometimes the best things pass us by, and we end up regretting not pouncing on the opportunity.<br/><br/>In case you're wondering why I didn't give it 10/10, in my opinion, the ending was a little anti-climatic. Now I think of it, it reminds me of a scene you would see in The Simpsons, which of course, isn't a bad thing exactly, but it doesn't suit the context of this movie. If you love pop-culture references, you will have plenty of fun with this film (from Harry Potter to Red Bull).<br/><br/>I thought that only Judd Apatow and Co. were the only group of people who could pull off the modern-day comedy, but after seeing Yes Man, I believe there is a great chance of the comedy genre making a comeback. Jim Carrey never fails to entertain, he is gifted with this natural aura of effervescence. This role looks as if it was made especially for him, and he passed with flying colours.<br/><br/>The bottom line: It's better to be an optimist than to be a pessimist. Seize opportunities you may feel ambivalent towards, you have more to gain than you have to lose, even if what you gain isn't tangible."
"coldplay_1992","8","3","4","4 January 2009"," Incredible movie, a must see for any Carrey fan!
","This film, in my opinion, is brilliant. It's one of those movies where you leave the cinema smiling, it's just a brilliant feel good film. Jim Carrey is an amazing actor, and he really shines through in this one, so if you are already a fan of him then this is a definite must see. As a typical Rom-com, it's very formulaic and quite predictable, but it fulfills the audience's expectations and is funny all the way through. The supporting cast are brilliant and really help support Carrey's brilliant performance. If you have seen the film Liar Liar, then this is basically the same thing. Many people might think 'Why did he do it again then?' but personally, I loved Liar Liar, and this is pretty much the same, so I loved this! Definitely worth the money!"

","The idea behind YesMan is very simple - say yes to opportunity and your life will change for the better.<br/><br/>Cue Jim Carrey as Carl Allen, a bank employee who bumps in to an old friend who is living the Yes philosophy. Intrigued by his friend's antics, Carl attends a Yes seminar where he agrees to say yes to everything for a year.<br/><br/>What follows are some seriously comic, madcap and unpredictable moments as our hero forms new friendships and falls in love with the wonderfully kooky Alison (Zooey Deschanel).<br/><br/>It's not all plain sailing though Carl is obligated to say yes to every opportunity and finds himself in some rather uncomfortable situations too. You may never agree to help out your elderly neighbour again after watching this! The performances by both Carrey and especially by Deschanel are excellent (beautiful vocals too) and the movie really sends home the message of 'don't let life pass you by'. The only criticism would have to be the hammy performance by Terence Stamp as the YesMan guru and the odd way Carl agreed to become a YesMan in the seminar.<br/><br/>On a personal note, this is the first comedy I've seen in years that really made me laugh out loud in a cinema, especially the suicide jumper scene! The feel-good factor is abundant and infectious and will leave you wanting to say yes more often too. Say Yes and go see this movie - you won't be disappointed. 8/10."

","Bank loan officer, Carl (Jim Carrey) is in a self-imposed state of hibernation. Stinging from an acrimonious divorce, Carl goes to work each day but returns home immediately afterward and stays put, watching the boob tube. Even his friend, Peter (Bradley Cooper) can't get him to go out on the town and he is mightily ticked when Carl misses a pre-nuptial party for Peter's coming wedding. Yet, a chance encounter with an old friend leads Carl to an inspirational seminar run by Terrence (Terrence Stamp). With the word ""yes"" as his mantra, Terrence urges his adult attendees to affirm life by dumping negativity, taking some chances, and refusing to say ""no"" in social and work situations. Almost immediately, Carl's life changes. He takes a homeless man back to a city park, where he runs out of gas. But, amazingly, pretty Allison (Zooey Deschanel) is there to rescue him, offering him a seat on her motorbike and a ride to the nearest gas station. Carl likes what he sees and makes plan to get together with Allison again. At work, things change, also, to the delight of his British boss, Norman (Rhys Darby). Carl begins to give out more small loans and the company makes money, as folks gratefully make their payments, with interest, on time. But, in truth, is this a genuinely new Carl or just a temporary impostor, that is, is Carl's optimism real and enduring? This is an enjoyable film, thanks to the splendid cast. Naturally, Carrey deserves a great deal of the credit, for his facial expressions and physical antics are humorous and unique. Just watch him play a corpse, in a dream sequence, or tape up his face at work and you will be howling with laughter. He definitely carries this flick much farther than anyone else would have done. But, the supporting cast is quite fine, too, with Deschanel a treat as the spunky Allison, Cooper a nice second fiddle and Stamp a hoot as the inspirational guru. Then, too, the scenery in so-Cal is lovely, the costumes are inspired, and the production values topnotch. Therefore, the real weaknesses of the flick are its spotty script and direction, for the film has moments of high humor followed by blase bits of nothing. Yet, it still manages to come together at the finale, with gusto. If you are a fan of Carrey's, you will absolutely not want to miss him in action, he is one of American cinema's priceless treasures. However, if you just want to get out of the house and see something light and funny at the local theater, this is a good choice, yes."

Not to mention that it's downright hilarious! Sure... it didn't win any Golden Globes, but that doesn't make this any less of a great film. Jim Carrey knows who his audience is and he aims his performance right at us. Lately... most movies that come out I can't watch more than once without getting bored. However...

","It has been awhile since Jim Carrey has come out with a comedy. His sad attempt at drama came in the form of The Number 23 last year in 2007, which completely sucked in all forms of sucking. Now he returns to the genre he shines in and that is comedy. This movie doesn't deliver laughs nonstop like in his other films, but the laughs are more realistic unlike other Carrey movies in which he does some crazy antics. We also see some decent supporting performances from Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson, who play Carrey's friends. The movie actually does play Carrey as a totally different character, he normally is a fun loving character, but in the beginning he is portrayed as an uptight person that never has any fun. It all changes and the plot unfolds when he begins to say yes to everything, which brings a pretty funny cameo from Terrence Stamp. The movie actually ends on a decent moral, with him deciding to only say yes to things he wants to and learning the true meaning of saying yes. So basically it is worth a watch."
"TxMike","Null","4","6","14 May 2009"," Pretty entertaining movie that also has a good message.
","Jim Carrey to me is always better when he has a serious part and minimizes his goofy physical comedy. That is the kind of role he has here as Carl Allen, single banker who might be best described as a ""no"" man. He turns down marginal loan applications and generally avoids doing things he thinks will be a bother. His best friend calls but he makes up excuses why he can't do things, and instead just wants to hide out at his place and watch a movie on DVD.<br/><br/>But this story is about him becoming a ""yes"" man. He meets old friend John Michael Higgins as Nick who claims to be enjoying life more than ever since he has become a ""yes"" man, saying ""yes"" to life and taking chances. So by Nick's invitation Carl attends the seminar conducted by Terence Stamp as Terrence Bundley, and in an atmosphere similar to a charismatic revival, Carl commits to becoming a ""yes"" man.<br/><br/>His first challenge is a homeless man who asks for a ride to a park (where we soon find he lives in the bushes). When Carl runs out of gas and has to walk down to a service station, he happens to meet pretty and quirky Zooey Deschanel as Allison, who offers him a ride back up the hill on the back of her scooter. In the grand scheme of things Carl would never have met Allison if he had not said ""yes"" to that homeless man looking for a ride.<br/><br/>As the story continues to unfold Carl gets himself in some awkward situations by saying ""yes"" all the time, and some friends take advantage of him because of it, knowing he will never say ""no"" to anything. But the story also makes the point that ""yes"" always comes with conditions, that you use your common sense to filter things, and sometimes the best options really is to say ""no."" There is an overriding truth to the whole message, that in life we need to be open to new experiences because we never know what good will come of them.<br/><br/>In spite of their 18 year age difference, Carl and Allison connect and by the end of the movie it seems that they may have a budding love relationship.<br/><br/>Good, entertaining movie. I saw it with Natalie and Miranda (both 20) and they both enjoyed it as much as I did."

","I thought that Jim Carrey quit playing in comedies and now will only do dramas because after Fun with Dick and Jane no new Jim Carrey's comedies were released (exept for Horton Hears a Who! which I haven't watched yet because I am not a big fan of cartoons) until this film came out. I heard that it's based on true story, so I thought that it's ain't going to be funny. I was so wrong. This movie was great. It's very similar with movies Liar Liar or Bruce Almighty, in other words - a typical Jim Carreys comedy. Not only it's funny, but it also has a great plot and a very optimistic mood. I think I'm going to try to say yes to everything at least for one day. It's such an inspiring movie."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","4","6","17 January 2009"," The most powerful three-letter word in the English language!
","OK, I have to tell you a true story, you're not gonna believe this. I tried this ""yes"" thing a couple years ago, in late 2006. The first thing I did was accept an offer to teach English in China (I'm still here), then I was invited into dozens of Chinese homes, I agreed to an idea to ride a bicycle from my city to Beijing (about 600 miles), I was thereafter featured in the local newspaper, and through no real talent of my own I made an appearance on national Chinese television giving an interview and singing a song in Chinese.<br/><br/>It hasn't all been fun and games though. I also accepted a casual invitation from someone I had known for about two hours to visit a nearby city which turned out to be forbidden to foreigners, so I was arrested as a spy and questioned in a Communist prison for 7 hours. Try it!<br/><br/>Anyway, I was moved to tell you that story, because you would be surprised at how real the possibility is that the word 'yes' can actually change your life. It's so easy to get stuck in a comfortable rut and just stay there. Not that there is anything wrong with that, a comfortable rut is certainly better than a lifetime of hardship, but I'm going to go ahead and suggest that saying yes for a while is probably going to make the ride a little more interesting.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey stars as Carl Allen, a regular guy with a regular job who really just wants to be left alone. He turns down invitations from his friends to go out on the town, he refuses offers and opportunities and invitations left and right, preferring the comfort of his own sofa and a rented video or two. And I can't say I blame him. There are few things as appealing to me as an evening in my apartment by myself watching whatever movie I might want to watch. Even two years after the word 'yes' has landed me in central eastern China, you would be amazed at how often I enjoy that particular situation.<br/><br/>Complicating matters is the fact that Carl's wife left him, badly injuring not only his pride but his self0image and possibly even his mental stability. Not only does he reject chances to interact with friends and family, but he's also a loan agent at a major bank, so he says no for a living!<br/><br/>He attends a YES seminar, where he learns that saying yes to everything can have brilliant affects on his life, whereas saying no could cause the sky to fall on his head. There is a crucial (and tasteless) scene where he is put into a position where he is forced to say no, and all hell breaks predictably loose.<br/><br/>Yes Man is definitely a light-hearted and goofy comedy, but there is a thread of reality that permeates it and really makes you think that it's saying something real, which is something that is generally only true of the best Jim Carrey movies, like The Truman Show or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's not at the same level as those movies, but there is something here that really might make your life a little more interesting, and when was the last time you ever saw a movie with the potential to do that?<br/><br/>""The world is a playground.

","Yes Man may not be Jim Carrey's best movie nor is it his most amusing. But I've got to say, this movie is funny and it got a lot of heart.<br/><br/>It's one of those light-hearted, feel-good movies.<br/><br/>It doesn't have an out-of-mind plot (like Liar Liar or Bruce Almighty) or any over-the-top humour (like Dumb and Dumber or Ace Ventura). It's just a simple story of a guy who hits a dead-end and joined a seminar that changed his life; by saying YES when opportunity presents itself. Simple to understand. But after The Number 23, I'm glad to see Jim back in his natural form; doing comedy. And yes, it is funny.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel was also amazing and an interesting love interest. And she sings well, too.<br/><br/>Yes Man brings nothing new from the long list of Jim Carrey's film, but it does bring humour, love and a lesson to learn at the end."

Then again, if you just get into stupid mindless gag-type comedy and rather tasteless crude sexual humor, then maybe it might rate a 7.0 or greater for you.<br/><br/>There were a few clever as well as a few sweet moments in the movie (i.e., respectively, when Carrey's various ""Yes!""-inspired self-improvement forays come in handy in unexpected ways, and scenes with Zooey's big hound dog eyes doing their best emotive magic), but very few.<br/><br/>What a shame, and what a waste of Carrey's comedic talents.

It looked like a good chance for Jim to return to the level that he started, but the movie just falls flat. I guess you have to figure that there is no way you can say yes to everything and have things work out. It just seemed like an excellent opportunity for Jim to create something. I did like his love interest played by Zooey Deschanel, I could not place where I had seen her before, she has one of those familiar faces.

","Java Man Reviews ""Yes Man"" (PG-13) Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com December, 2008.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a divorced 40-something who lives in LA and works as a loan officer for a neighborhood bank. Depressed at being dumped, he says ""no"" to everything: ""no"" to unlucky loan applicants; ""no"" to his best pal (Bradley Cooper) who wants to hit the bars; and ""no"" to his sex-starved neighbor (Fionnula Flanagan) who wants him to get intimate. While sitting home alone watching a video one night, he nods off and dreams of his demise. When he awakens, he realizes that he has a problem and reluctantly agrees to attend a ""Power of Yes"" seminar conducted by self-help guru Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). After initial resistance, Carl is finally won over and accepts the Covenant of Yes. This means that when he says ""no"" (say, to his naughty neighbor), bad things happen--like being trapped in an elevator. When he says ""yes"" (giving all his money to a homeless guy), good things happen--like meeting gorgeous, free-spirited Allison (Zooey Deschanel). The comic possibilities are endless. <br/><br/>REVIEW: 2.5 out of 4 Java Mugs<br/><br/>With Carrey in the lead role, a story like this should write itself. Or at least one would think so. The movie is funny enough, but somehow it seems like it should have been funnier. Perhaps the premise has too many comic possibilities for its own good. It ends up being a mishmash of random episodes, some of which are inspired while others should have been consigned to the cutting room floor. <br/><br/>It can't be blamed on the cast. Appealing newcomers Cooper and Deschanel light up the screen, while veterans Stamp and Flanagan make the most of their unimaginatively written roles. The talented Carrey is more than adequate, but he is unable to convincingly sell the outlandish premise as well as he did in a similar, better movie, Liar Liar.<br/><br/>The film has great production values and is quite watchable. The action scenes and stunt work are top notch, while the location work is inspired. Underutilized LA backdrops such as the Hollywood Bowl and Griffith Park Observatory are used so well that this film's portrayal of the city rivals Woody Allen's love affair with the Big Apple. <br/><br/>This movie offers a point to go with your popcorn: that saying yes once in a while can open you up to life's infinite possibilities. Frank Capra would have loved it."
"nowtheworldisgone","1","12","27","22 January 2009"," where is the comedy? terrible!
","The movie tries to narrate the miserable side of a man who is obsessed to answer everything yes. Jim Carrey is not a good actor anymore to reflect such a character. We have seen this before also in 'the number 23, Fun with Dick & Jane as well. Jim Carrey was a great actor years ago but this proposal is not valid anymore. I only remember him from the old movies like 'the Mask, Liar Liar, Dumb and Dumber. What is sad but true is that; Jim Carrey does not meet the expectations anymore. People want to see something more from the Hollywood. People do not want to see such a clich√© anymore. This is the movie which is absolutely a fiasco. This is an indisputable fact that, Hollywood movie industry has already started to get behind the rest of the world. Spending millions of Dollars for making a movie does not make that movie better. There are more important things such as Quality of Acting, The originality of the story. Now the Asian and European directors and filmmakers are aware of that fact. All in all the movie is just below the average it is a time wasting. It does not worth to see it. by the way is it a comedy movie??"

","This is a truly wonderful 'Carrey On' film. The comic genius of Jim Carrey is at full throttle. And smiling at him enigmatically is the fascinating 'cutest thing on two feet' Zooey Deschanel, who is like Meg Ryan when young, but brunette and with more of an edge to her. It all goes like a Porsche, rushing along smoothly and with more fun than a turtle in a sun bonnet. You can't help laughing and then laughing some more. It just all clicks. It is so satisfying when things work, especially comedy, which can so easily misfire. But here everything is in the hands of pros. Peyton Reed has done a terrific job of directing. Terence Stamp, as a motivational guru, is electrifying and so funny. Special comic genius is also shown by Rhys Darby, with his matey New Zealand twang, who is simply hilarious as a nondescript man who is beyond description. For somebody who is 'normal', how weird can you get? This is one of those totally successful comedies that you dream about. And as for Zooey Deschanel, anybody who doesn't dream about her is, well, only interested in boys. She is not a mere zooeylogical specimen, she is a zooeylogical innovation, a creature with only two arms who manages to wrap herself around you with all hundred of them and just won't let you forget her for a minute. At least I won't, anytime soon. But as for Jim Carrey, he is definitely a specimen never before seen, and still unclassified by science, who should be named Hilarius perpetuus and put in a jar to be kept forever, so that in ages to come, they can de-pickle him and say: My God, this is a funny one!"
"C-Younkin","4","8","18","20 December 2008"," A career low
","""Yes Man"" confirms what you already thought about Jim Carrey's career. It's struggling and it's struggling bad. His movies hinge on him, I get that. He's supposed to be his wild and zany self and the rest is supposed to work itself out but jeeze, in the past he's at least gotten workable premises. Now he's worrying about the number 23 and yelling yes to everything and everyone. ""Yes Man"" marks his career-low, a movie so awe-inspiringly bad at times that I just wanted to walk out and try to remember the good times with Carrey that now seem so far removed.<br/><br/>He plays Carl Allen, a lonely, sad-sack whose been avoiding his two best friends (Bradley Cooper, Danny Masterson) and refusing to go out at all since his wife dumped his boring, say-no-to-everything-ass. He works in a bank approving loans, a perfect job for him since he declines all of those people too. But on advice from a friend, Carl is invited to some crazy seminar run by some crazy guru (Terence Stamp) with some crazy ideas about saying yes to everything. Carl buys into it and soon all of his yes's are opening doors to different opportunities, including a date with a free-spirited musician/photographer/exercise teacher/missionary worker (you get it, she's a free spirit) named Allison (Zooey Deschanel).<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that the yeses also open the doors to the jokes. One involves him having to give a homeless man a ride (the homeless man also kills his cell-phone battery, which is the big laugh pay-off I suppose). Another yes gets him into a bar-fight. One more leads to him repeatedly and hyperactively shouting out ""Red Bull."" And the near walk-out moment for me was the old lady who offers him oral sex. And I don't even want to get into his sing-a-long of Third Eye Blinds ""Jumper"", as he's trying to get a man off the ledge. If anyone finds this ludicrous and near desperate material funny, consider getting an MRI on Monday right away.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Carrey, who really has to go above and beyond here to even get the few chuckles he does get. He wraps tape around his face, dresses up like Harry Potter, drives a motorcycle bare-assed through the street but not once does this premise allow him the same thing he was allowed in ""Liar Liar"", a movie a lot of others have compared this to. It just looks like he's doing random things for the sake of doing them here, whereas in ""Liar Liar"" his schtick fit in better. I used to be a big fan of this guy but it looks like his great dramatic work in ""Truman Show"" and ""Man on the Moon"" has dissipated into things like ""The Number 23"" and his comedic career all hinges on doing another movie with Charlie Kaufman.<br/><br/>And Zooey Deschanel is no help. She looks much younger than Carrey, can't match him in energy at all, and sounds as if she's drowsy. If she's watching this movie, I can understand why. ""Yes Man"" is one of the worst comedies and movies I've seen all year long."

","Buoyed by some good reviews, stirred by extensive press coverage, bored by the Xmas holidays, I looked forward to the return to form of the truly funny Carey. Carey seems to have lost his way since his reasonably successful wander into 'straight' acting with Eternal Sunshine, and we all want the real Jim back (same for you Mr E Murphy). Both men have outrageous comic talent, but seem unable to find right now (it's behind you!), so I hoped 'Yes Man' would deliver me the Carey of 'Dumb and Dumber' and/ or 'The Truman Show'. <br/><br/>Alas.....picture the scene: A 30 second pitch details nothing more than a man who has to say 'Yes' to everything, Carey is on board and the comic japes he can get up to are endless. It's Liar, Liar circa 2008. Brilliant, let's go. Carey even has points, his heart is in it, can't fail. Dates are set, the screenplay begun. Shooting looms, the screenplay is awful. Constantly rewritten during the shoot. Cast and crew do their best but the premise is lame, cannot be saved. The movie is disjointed, characters lifeless, and the plot written merely to accommodate a feeble joke or two. Post production, let's grab some great Eels tracks and try and paper some cracks, 'they' might not notice. OK, 'si-so', they're gonna notice, only one thing for it.... 1. Release it at Xmas, where the movie going public is at it's hungriest (and when word of mouth is relatively restricted) 2. Grease the tabloids and get some good reviews. 3. Plaster it everywhere, throw even more cash at it, wall to wall on every advertising medium under the sun.<br/><br/>It's the oldest trick in the book ¬ñ well, since the 70's; ""we'll have our money back and more before they even notice"". And they did, I fell for it, they have my money, wasted 90 minutes of my life and I am mortified. Don't fall for it, don't get sucked in, heed my words, and don't be a 'Yes' man like me! This is tripe."
"lkdg32","2","5","10","3 January 2009"," I didn't like this movie
","The beginning and middle of this movie were good. It was about Jim Carrey living life, but the end, the rug is pulled beneath him and he is told not to live life so much. I didn't get it. Other than that, Jim Carrey was good as far as being comedic and this movie didn't seem as much as a Liar Liar ripoff as when you see the trailer. Overall a really disappointing movie, but I give it an extra star just for the Jim Carrey comedy. Another point I want to make (that had no affect on my rating) is that I thought Jim Carrey had too many friends in the movie (Bradley Cooper's character, his boss, and that fat friend of his with the beard who joined him in the Yes Man seminar). I thought they should have just nixed the Bradley Cooper character because he is so stodgy and stuck with the other two."
"gaming_arbiter","2","6","13","29 December 2008"," Easily the worst movie of 2008
","This was possibly the worst movie I've seen all year, there couldn't have possibly been a worst line of actors, Jim Carey has got to be at least in his forties and he picked a less-than-great actress who just happened to be in her twenties for a make out scene. The movie was so predictable that i was able to call every plot twist dozens of minutes before they happened. And i was extremely tempted to leave the theater when Carey was hanging after bungee jumping and he answered his cell phone, ""Oh nothing just hanging here"", if it wasn't for the people who had their legs up on the seats i would have left the movie right then and there. I wouldn't be surprised to see this movie on 2008's ""Worst movies of the year""."
"policy134","4","3","5","10 January 2009"," A mood-lightener but not much else
","Can't really say I was laughing out loud all the way through this. The movie is too cute and Jim Carrey doesn't get to cut loose because of his character, Carl, (has there ever been anyone funny in the movies with a name like that?) spends half of the movie being depressed. Other than Zoey Deschanel (I can't spell it), Carrey is basically the whole show here.<br/><br/>The premise was bad from the start. A man who can't say no but it is too much like the lawyer who can't lie. Sorry, but there is no other way of putting it but you are basically being suckered into seeing Liar, Liar once again but unlike that hilarious film most of the jokes just aren't funny.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are left with nothing to do except being mildly obnoxious (check out the old lady). Danny Masterson looks particularly out of place and Brad Cooper, who was remarkable in The Wedding Crashers, is given nothing to do. Terence Stamp must have received some kind of medal for taking every job that is available, although he was kind of funny in Get Smart. He hasn't done anything very memorable since The Hit.<br/><br/>So what it boils down to is how well does Carrey do his thing. Well, he doesn't slam his head with a toilet seat but there is a funny little sequence where he and his boss are one-upping each other with weird gestures and a particularly nasty sequence involving Carrey's face and some tape. But these moments are few and far between.<br/><br/>One thing though: The band sequence with Deschanel is hilarious and she can actually sing quite well, that is if she wasn't dubbed, I didn't check. She looks pretty and her character is nice but overall she suffers the same fate as the other leading ladies of Carrey's career, that is you can't remember her afterwards.<br/><br/>Carrey is fast becoming the one-time great comedian who seems to be repeating himself. This time it just doesn't work."

","I had a chance to see an advance screening of Yes Man last night and I have to say it's one of his best comedies since Me, Myself & Irene. I've always been a fan of Jim Carey, whether he's doing juvenile comedy like Ace Venture or adult orientated drama like the highly underrated Man On The Moon; & Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Making his first live action film since Fun With Dick & Jane, Carey once again shows his talent as a comic. Early trailers have the film coming off as a Liar Liar rehash, but looking deeper the film is more about than belly laughs and one-liners. It's refreshing to see Carey bring freshness to a role he could easily play in his sleep; one particular scene with Scotch tape had the preview audience in tears. Zooey Deshuncaal more than makes up for the debacle that was The Happening and displays the same likable charm she displayed in Elf, and hopefully she continues to play romantic leads in the future. All in all this is a fine film and if you're looking for a break from the profanity filed gross out comedies of recent memory, then say yes to Yes Man."

","The one was better than Jim Carrey's recent efforts in my opinion, but still it doesn't match up even close to his previously work like ""The Mask"", ""The Cable Guy"", ""The Truman Show"", ""Man on the Moon"" and all those others. It's okay, but what really bothered me about the movie was the slow poor pacing at times, mostly near the end of the movie. it just got really weird and I started to lose concentration about what was happening. The girl played by Deschanel is not bad, but she needs some caffeine to wake up. The best scene in my opinion is when Jim is convinced to join the Yes convention and Terrence Stamp sits right up close in front of him and puts him on the spot in front of hundreds of people. That was hilarious.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where in the beginning the guy (Jim Carrey) is unhappy and doesn't want to do anything different with his life, and then a life-changing experience happens (the Yes convention) which leads him to experience new stuff and meet a new girl and then everything goes too far and he becomes miserable. The problem with ""Yes man"" is that I liked Jim's character much more before he changed and joined the Yes people. It had a few good laughs, I admit, but it was kind of a let down overall."

","Jim Carrey has made a name in over the top comedy. Not everybody likes his humour, and his films are not to my taste, but I saw Ace Ventura, and I thought it was fun. I cannot say the same for Yes Man. It feels like Liar Liar, but hopped up on nonsense and less funny. I'm not sure if it's a romcom or straight up comedy, but either way it was disappointing.<br/><br/>The lesson of the movie is shallow (which is only fitting because Bradley Cooper is in this movie) and because it's such a simple idea, it makes Carrey's character annoying for his inability to grasp it.<br/><br/>There were funny parts, and I did like the scene where he stops the man from jumping off the ledge, but there were too many bad moments. The scene with the old woman is disgusting, Danny Masterson's character has no purpose, and the entire end of the movie felt like a hallucination (which it kind of was).<br/><br/>If you want to watch a Jim Carrey movie, I suggest The Truman Show, an excellent story with a wonderful performance by Carrey.

I thought the scriptwriter 's did an excellent good job on the choice of words for the actors. The humor was monotone but I enjoyed that style of comedy. Of course Jim Carrey helped out a lot with his impromptu such as the ""budgie jump phone conversation"", and it made the movie that much more enjoyable.

Again, it was a comedy that had a mild energetic style of humor. Overall the actors did a great job. The location of the movie was very ""relatable.""

To explain my earlier comment about being in shock I meant that it kinda reminded me ""Bruce Alimighty"", a miserable man sees a change in his life takes advantage of it but in the end he loses the plot until he finds out its true meaning, but ""Yes man"" is head and shoulders above that film.

For most of my life I was purposely pessimistic and cynical and had a mildly negative view of the world. A few years ago I decided to try the other side, and with determination and some books on positive thinking I managed to turn myself mildly positive, and my life genuinely improved, even though the cynic in me would have said it couldn't be that easy. So not only is this a very funny movie, but I think if it makes people think about the benefits of being more positive and adventurous in life then it is a movie with real world benefits."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","2","3","15 March 2010"," Better than I thought it would be
","When I first saw that my two sisters wanted to see this film, I was not that motivated initially, thinking it would be a substandard and predictable comedy with contrived romance. I don't know why I thought that, despite starring Jim Carrey who is quite likable anyway and an intriguing concept, part of my brain was telling me it wasn't going to be good. But I watched it anyway, as I always give films a chance even if the film turns out utter rubbish. After watching, I was pleasantly surprised; it has its flaws but it was an above average film. The romance isn't as good as Carrey's enjoyably wacky antics though, the pacing is sometimes uneven and there was one scene when Carl's neighbour makes sexual advances towards him that I felt wasn't needed. That said though, the concept about what would happen if you answered every question with the answer yes is very intriguing, and the script is good. Also well done is the pleasant cinematography and very good performances from Carrey and the beautiful Zooey Deschanel, who gives her Allison free spirit and charm. Howver it is Rhys Darby as the geeky, Harry Potter-obsessed bank manager who comes very close to stealing the film. Not to mention Terrence Stamp as Terrence, the quasi-religious seminar leader. Overall, flawed, but intriguing and surprisingly likable. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

"mario_c","6","2","3","21 May 2009"," Entertaining? Yes! Great? No!
","This movie has a nice message: Be positive in life, and it will be as you wish it would. This idea of positivity resumed in the ""Yes to life"" quote is quite interesting and even being over exaggerated in the film is really good to use as an ideal for living... It's not really a novelty that positive feelings attract good things and negative ones deliver you into emptiness and loneliness, but it's always good to remember that. Even knowing that in real life things are not so easy to solve like in the movies, especially those made in Hollywood, is good to remember that positive thought! <br/><br/>Well, in fact I think the real good feature of this film is its message. As a film itself it's so so... There're a few nice jokes, some good laughs but nothing exceptional. The acting is average. Jim Carrey has a role to his measure, as expected, and Zooey Deschanel does a regular performance either. Rhys Darby who plays NORMAN does a funny character. He and Jim Carry look stupid but hilarious with those HARRY POTTER suites! <br/><br/>Globally I think it's an interesting film especially because of the main message, but it could never be great because it follows too much some Hollywood's canons, what make it a ""pop corn flick""... therefore entertaining but not great!"

","Yes Man is free-spirited fun! Yes, it's a bit of a romantic comedy between two polar opposites 18 years apart but it wasn't all that gross. Yes, it's formulaic but it's also seriously funny.<br/><br/>Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a recently divorced junior loan officer. Wallowing in his misery, his vocabulary is comprised of all variations of 'no'. He meets an old acquaintance, who convinces him to attend a life-changing seminar that is centered on saying ""yes"". Carl gives it a try, and ends up meeting Allison (Zooey Deschanel) as a result of his newfound way of life. Whenever he says no, though, things seem to take a turn for the worse. Or do they really? Deschanel is great for this sort of quirky role, and while the rubber-faced Carrey has aged a lot, he can still deliver the punchlines and play the role of leading man. When Carl breaks into song (""Jumper"" by Third Eye Blind), and the onlookers yell the power line back, ""Put the past away!"" it's priceless.<br/><br/>It's uncanny how much I can relate to Yes Man. Even before I heard of the movie (which was only this year) or of the book (a biography by Danny Wallace), I had already tagged the year 2008 as the Year of the Yes for me, which meant accepting all sorts of dates and invites to trips and doing things I would not normally do. Just like Carl, this little change of perspective worked wonders for me. More than a little excursion out of my comfort zone, it opened up possibilities. It wasn't all good all the time, but it's definitely worth extending to 2009 as the Year of the Why Not!"

In the past couple of years his acting became kind of serious. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty good but his movies are just not as funny as they used to be.

","Yes Man is the movie that I feel was the last Jim Carrey's last film that was worth anything. This was the last one that was truly funny and had a great plot to make it an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Carrey plays a man name Carl, who works at a bank and is having trouble saying yes to a lot of things and people. He then joins a seminar that makes him say yes a lot, and he feels this has changes his life. He also meets a beautiful woman, Allison (played by Zooey Deschanel) and they form a relationship. However, later on, things take a turn for the worst as Carl realizes saying yes to particular things get him into trouble.<br/><br/>The film's plot (like a lot of people say) is kind of similar to Liar Liar. Liar Liar deals with a guy having trouble being honest and that changes through a son's birthday wish, while this deals with a guy having trouble saying yes and that changes through a seminar. Although the plot is similar and not too original, I still enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>Carrey managed to be pretty funny and had a great performance and chemistry with Zooey Deschanel, and the pacing for the film was pretty fast. It didn't bore me to be honest.<br/><br/>If the plot would of been a little bit more original, than this film would be even better. But, I will say, Yes Man is a great Jim Carrey film to watch for very good laughs and to see Carrey one last time be truly funny and truly rememberable."

The story is very simple: Carl is divorced from marriage and he became negative and quiet man. Also, he lost lots of his friends, because he is too lazy to have a fun with them. However, one day he met his old friend, who was as same as Carl, but he changed after visiting a workshop with the charismatic leader Terence. The workshop is visiting by Yes People, which saying yes at all situation or chances. Carl is convince to try it out, when he meet the lovely girl Alison. He began to live a different life than before.<br/><br/>Yes Man has a good cast, very crazy and funny character is Norman (Rhys Darby). The best scenes are with Carl and Norman, for example Norman's wizard party.<br/><br/>In my opinion Yes Man have the undertone of motivation.

There's also quite a large (and somewhat cringe-inducing) age gap between its two stars and a generally 'old-fashioned' feel to much of the proceedings, even if the end result is ultimately an enjoyable one. 6/10"

","Yes Man follows the same basic genre comedy structure that we've seen an endless amount of times in the past few years. The main character has a big problem, they work to solve that problem, the problem is solved and happy times are had. Then another problem arises as a result to the solution to the original problem. So everyone is sad. But then that problem is solved and everyone lives happily ever after. And there's a message about how to live your life sprinkled in there. For every single comedy in the past few years with that structure, I've gotten so bored by the time it's over because I just lose interest when the drama comes in during the third act. I either don't care about the characters or I don't care about the message.<br/><br/>Every comedy except for this one. Not only did I care about the characters so much (thanks mostly to the performances from Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel who put a beautiful, free-spirited romance at the core of this seemingly typical comedy) that I was emotionally impacted during that predictable turn for the worse near the end, but the message of the film was actually something that I found relocatable to my own life which is something I've never experience during these kind of comedies. I'm definitely a man who doesn't really live his life (as cheesy as that sounds) because I isolate myself by making excuses to just be alone and not be with anyone. As a result, I was definitely more invested in this film than I have been with other comedies of the same vein.<br/><br/>Add to all this the fact that it's completely hilarious throughout to the point where I have no hesitation in calling it the funniest movie of the year and easily the best straight comedy (not that there have been many good ones; three by my count). Plus, of course, Zooey Deschanel is absolutely infectious in every moment she's on screen (especially her lovely singing). I love her more than air, and this is just another example of why that love is justified. Call it fanboy ism if you must, but she's my #2 of the year in supporting actress right now falling second only to the Cruz. In summation, do yourself a favor and say yes to this great comedy.<br/><br/>I'm so sorry, I had to say it."

","This is a job well done. It has a coherent story (for a comedy), a good theme/message, is acted well (Jim Carey overacts, but you expect that from him), the casting is spot on, and it is directed without any significant issues. It is both fun and funny.<br/><br/>It is not perfect, though. The jokes are not extremely funny or original. Directing, while fine, isn't original or by any other means remarkable. The realism could also be higher, as the tension/fun that the move away from realism brings isn't payed back well. As you can expect, the same goes for acting. Zoey Dechanel is very cute, but, quite unremarkable. Both her and Bradley Cooper are superbly cast, as he makes a great stereotypical best friend, but he too just doesn't do much more then ""play by the book"".<br/><br/>As for the ""message"", I must protest to any message that inspires you to say ""No"" to Molly Sims. :)<br/><br/>OK, I was kidding, but, to make a point - even the message, and that particular scene with Molly Sims, is fine, but not inspiring."
"troyputland","6","1","1","10 July 2015"," The toned down Carrey.
","Yes Man's story is fitting for Jim Carrey. It gives him plenty of material to show off his sporadic, eccentric ego. It's astonishing then, to see only flashes of Ace Ventura or Charlie/Hanks from Me, Myself & Irene. Yes Man sits comfortably between them and the likes of Eternal Sunshine and The Truman Show. Carl (Carrey) is a likable man whose lack of ambition is having a detrimental effect on himself and those closest to him. He reluctantly agrees to say yes to everything for a whole year, no matter what it is. From online dating and learning Korean to bungee-jumping and organising his best friend's fianc√©e's bridal shower, there's nothing he cannot, sorry, will not do. The story is one of redemption, of finding ones-self. Taking part in something that you'd later regret not doing. It's all well and good until Carrey and new love interest Zooey Deschanel get serious. A less formulaic route hits a clich√© roadblock. And that's the route it takes thereon. The ending doesn't have the strength that the rest of the film carries. Carl's work partner, Rhys Darby (Flight of the Concords) is a scene stealer."

But when a friend of his invites him to go to a conference held by Terrence Stamp who persuades Carl to say Yes to everything, things starts happening like one where he meets and falls for a quirky singer songwriter named Alison(played by singer songwriter/actress Zooey Deschanel)who Carl met in a petrol station,and they spend some time together during their time together like going to a no- entry concert hall,gong to Nebraska for a weekend and of course fall for each other. But will he and Alison get together in the end well you have to see the film to know what is happening.<br/><br/>Like I said Jim Carrey is a funnyman. His serious roles just don't suit him at all as without his over the top charm,his just a boring dull guy. And well.........it shows in this film. I enjoyed it as it was on last night and parts of it was funny but it was a bit boring as it wasn't Jim Carrey's best.

It's such a brilliant concept; say yes to everything! Then watch as the comedy unfolds, Carrey style. Try to imagine the things that could happen if you took that vow completely seriously and couldn't say no to anything for a year. At least twice I laughed until I cried and my stomach started to cramp. I personally think that this movie contains some of the funniest scenes ever brought to film.

"Donatien3","8","1","1","8 April 2012"," Carrey, Darby and Deschanel make 'Yes Man' a winner!
","It's fair to say Jim Carrey's star has waned over the past few years, hitting a low point with 'Mr. Popper's Penguin's'.<br/><br/>While 'Yes Man' may look like a quasi-sequel to his big hit 'Liar Liar' (in LL, Carrey can only tell the truth, in YM, he can only say yes), its one of his best films in a while and we see glimpses of the classic rubber-faced Carrey. He is supported by an eclectic cast, including the stunning Zooey Deschanel, the delightful Kiwi stand-up Rhys Darby, Bradley Cooper, Danny Masterson (Hyde from 'That 70s Show') and Terence Stamp.<br/><br/>The concept of 'Yes Man' is simple: Carrey plays Carl, a man rooted in a vicious cycle of negativity. Trapped in the same dead-end job, with only his enthusiastic co-worker Norm (Darby) for company, he says no to everything, even his best friends (Cooper and Masterson), instead choosing to stay home and watch DVDs while pining over his ex-wife Stephanie (Molly Sims). A chance encounter encourages Carl to attend a 'Yes' conference (with Stamp as the instructor), where he has to say ""yes"" to everything. While reluctant at first, this extreme mantra sets off a positive chain of events, including meeting the beautiful free spirit musician/photographer Allison (Deschanel), getting a promotion at work, reuniting with his friends and bonding with Norm. Probably the best part is how all of Carl's seemingly inconsequential positive moves come back at the end of the movie, which helps tie everything together.<br/><br/>While this is a vehicle for Carrey, with all his rubber-faced mugging on display, the brilliant Darby almost steals the show. Anyone who's seen 'Flight of the Concords' will know how fantastic Darby was as the band manager Murray, and he carries that form over into 'Yes Man' with the same routine of well-meaning and enthusiastic awkwardness. The other star is Deschanel, who continues to light up the screen as the ""manic pixie girl"" love interest. As the popularity of 'New Girl' has proved, its impossible not to immediately fall in love with Deschanel when she appears on screen.<br/><br/>While 'Yes Man' may not have the long-lasting appeal of 'Liar Liar' (when Carrey was at his peak), it's still a funny and enjoyable comedy, with glimpses of Carrey at his best, and well worth a look."

And in one moment of ""Bruce Almighty"" when he was given to right to be God for some time, his character answers ""Yes"" to the prayers of everybody who asked him something. ""Yes Man"" mixed the premise and the moment from both films but this time Carrey has an life changing experience where he'll stop of being an negative person to become an man who answers ""Yes"" to everything that comes in his life. Confusion and some hilarious moments are set in a film that must not be taken so seriously.<br/><br/>What would happen with a man whose job at a bank consists in saying ""No"" to people and who also says this same word to his friends whenever they want his company, if he had to say Yes"" for a whole year? What kind of obstacles and/or advantages he would get? After being dragged by an old friend (John Michael Higgins) to an workshop about saying yes to thing and lead a positive life, the dull Carl will see that life might open lots of doors to him but at the same time will put him into an gigantic load of confusion, heartaches, and add things he don't need in his life (or it appears he won't need them but eventually he'll use somehow like learning Corean or learn how to play guitar. Things that only happen in film scripts.)<br/><br/>Carrey takes advantage of his enormous variety of facial expressions to compose the troubled Carl while facing lots of misfortunes and disasters in his life, most of them very comical, others a little bit dramatic like when he rescues a man who want to jump to his death. Basically, it's the Jim Carrey we've get used to see, being very funny in ridiculous situations. And the movie comes with an obvious message of knowing how and when to give up from saying ""yes"". <br/><br/>Of course a film like this fall into some absurds and some annoyance (like when Carl is arrested by the FBI considered to be an suspect of terrorism) but there is brilliance in this as well (when he's promoted to a higher position in the bank after approving an great number of small money loans or his moments with a girl he meets, played by Zooey Deschanel).<br/><br/>It's a nice way to spend the day, there's plenty of good and funny moments. ""Yes Man"" has an great cast that includes Danny Masterson, Bradley Cooper, Terrence Stamp (playing the Yes guru), Brent Briscoe and Fionnula Flanagan.<br/><br/>And in last case it might change your life, making you being more open and positive about things.

"Sandcooler","8","1","1","2 October 2011"," Jim Carrey's roots
","There are always two things going through my head when I watch movies like ""The Truman Show"" or ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"". The first thing is that Jim Carrey is truly a tremendous actor that could do well in a wide variety of genres. The second thing is: ""I'm sad, I'm going to watch an Ace Ventura movie"". What I'm trying to say is that he's really versatile, and ""Yes Man"" definitely caters to the classic Carrey fans. He's everything you expect him to be in this one: he's unbelievably energetic, he's loud, he's wild, and he cracks you up every five seconds or so. In one scene they just make him drink Red Bull and the rest sorta writes itself, it's all as vintage Carrey as can be. Rich man's Katy Perry Zooey Deschanel is also really good in this movie, because at least she manages to rise above being the lame, bland love interest you usually have to put up with in this sort of movie. She actually has a personality, what more could you want? Caring for the obligatory love subplot in a blockbuster comedy has never been closer to possible than in this movie. ""Yes Man"" is just an hilarious comedy, totally worth seeing."

","At first I didn't want to watch this movie because I wrongly thought it would be a desperate intent to bring back to life Jim Carrey's career. I expected plenty of his stand in performances, gestures, and more.<br/><br/>I was wrong. This is a very equilibrated film. It has a very interesting plot, the kind of plot that interacts with the audience and almost tells the viewer: ""you should try Carl's decision to say yes to everything, it will be fun"". I seriously thought about doing it! Then, there's the modern humor that deals with racial interaction (chinesse female worker), scatological humor (loved the granny performing oral sex), spoofs (Harry Potter was hilarious, 300), and the well known Jim Carrey routine. He makes all the funny faces, spits catchy phrases quickly, his physical humorist performances, and everything that deals with his talent.<br/><br/>Then we have a very likable co-star. Zooey Deschanel is extremely pretty, funny, sassy, and even has a decent voice. I loved her in every single scene she appeared.<br/><br/>The secondary characters such as Peter, Nick, Norman, and Rooney were very funny. I would like to see more from Carl and his buddies! Norman was extremely funny and he's the kind of geek we all know in real life.<br/><br/>""Yes Man"" is a very fine comedy that should make you think about some things about your ordinary life. Of course, if you have a routine :)"
"tom_owens_182","8","1","1","8 May 2010"," Hilarious and thought provoking.
","Yes Man is a return to what Jim Carrey does best. This film was hilarious. It runs the fine line of down right stupid and genius almost perfectly. Providing comedy for everyone, no matter what your taste.<br/><br/>The basic premise is that there is a man who must follow a set of rules. In this case, to say yes to every proposition he is faced with. It follows much of the same premise as Carrey's Liar Liar from 1997. This involves Carrey engaging in a set of hilarious set ups ranging from bungee jumping to learning the guitar. This gives the film a nice pace which never slows down at any point because something new is always going to happen when you say yes to everything.<br/><br/>From this comes such a sense of fun. You can tell all members of the film had a lot of fun making this film and I believe that that transcends on to the audience.<br/><br/>Aside from being funny, this film has also an unexpected twist. It makes the audience think. About all the things they say no to. And so people think about how their life is (or would be) when/if they say 'Yes'! I'm not suggesting you try this for the rest of your days. But the next time you are presented with a choice, try saying yes. See where it leads you. It worked for Mr.Carrey.<br/><br/>Where as I don't believe this is Jim Carrey's best movie (In my opinion that is The Mask) it does a damn fine job of making it's audience laugh. Especially considering it was a winter film. (When people need cheering up the most.) It also puts you in the mind set of everything you could say yes to in the summer.<br/><br/>If you do watch this, see it with a large group of people and make a pact to say yes from now on."

"Stampsfightclub","8","1","1","3 January 2010"," The power of positive thinking
","Carl Allen (Carrey) a negative no man is challenged to say yes to everything that comes his way, which he accepts in the hope of becoming a better person The concept of saying yes to everything that comes your way is an interesting prospect given that there are so many situations which would normally require a no. Myself, a fairly negative person, was quite thrilled when I first watched this a year ago, being completely transfixed by the apparent ease like Carrey's character. Sadly for me it never materialized because I ruined the film through criticizing the standard formatting of the final stages. Now however I can see past that.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey starring in another big idea comedy sets us in motion as we follow him in his life by saying no to everything and anything. When a friend shows him what he is missing out of life he turns up at a positive say yes lecture and the film is set in motion.<br/><br/>His first act of positive thinking is to give a homeless man a trip far out of his way, lending him his phone and money. This spells comedy light heartedness and some charming Carrey wisdom which because of his helpfulness leads to something good.<br/><br/>Carrey the arguable king of physical comedy is slightly held back here. There isn't as much wide mouthed madness as in The Mask or brilliant cleverness from Ace Ventura. This comedy portrayal feels like his Liar Liar character which allows him some more normal man approach, which is what the character needed given the context of the film. Carrey, performing most of his own stunts including the bungee jump sequence still flies high with some physical comedy, particularly the motorbike sequences.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel fills the necessary love interest role with some clever contentedness. The best supporting star is Rhys Darby who brings the stereotype of nerd to a new level with some very amusing and elaborate comedy. The Harry Potter party is pure genius.<br/><br/>This film boasts one healthy soundtrack with Zooey and her band on particular fine tune with positive springy songs.<br/><br/>Characters and performances aside, this is all about the apparent simplicity of saying yes. Carl initially rejects everything then after the lecture starts his yes streak before learning how to control it.<br/><br/>There are only a few problems with this film's projection and pitching of using this ideology in your real life.<br/><br/>For one Carl is at a very good job and is earning plentiful. Therefore when opportunities arise he is able to take them without worrying about the consequences, which wouldn't necessarily be the case for all viewers. The second is that whilst the film is undeniably feel good and energetic, the descent into conventional story has been tackled too frequently in comedies.<br/><br/>However this film has an advantage over other comedies as it is beneficial for the human personality. Saying yes is certainly more encouraging, so say yes and see."
"Sirus_the_Virus","8","1","1","29 July 2009"," Say Yes!
","Jim Carrey is one of my favorite actors. His recent film Yes Man didn't disappoint. Perhaps it's not as good as liar Liar but it's still a pretty fun and funny film. Jim Carrey plays Carl, a divorced man who doesn't do much with life. His friends(Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson)don't really like him that much anymore. Until one day, somebody convinces him to come to a Yes convention.Carl goes and says No to the Yes Guru(Terrence Stomp)and is cursed.If he doesn't say yes to everything bad things will happen to him. For instance, and old lady that he knows asks for sex and he says no. So he falls down the stairs and is practically raped. It's a little gross but it's still funny. Carl says yes to many things. A Harry Potter costume party, the first flight to anywhere,and an instant marriage to a woman from Iran.Carl meets Alison(played by Zooey Deschanel, who I always like)and things start to change for Carl. Perhaps Yes Man does seem a bit like Liar, Liar. But I still said yes to Yes Man because it's funny and it's pretty entertaining. People should leave Jim Carrey alone too. Don't be a No-man, be a Yes Man and see Yes Man."
"chapsmack","7","1","1","27 July 2009"," Delightful little comedy
","After much deliberation on whether to watch another Carrey flick or not, I finally decided that I should say yes! And you know what? It doesn't disappoint! Carrey is quite funny without performing any insane tricks and Deschanel complements this by keeping her character just right without overdoing it. There were a couple of things which I thought were taken to the extreme those being the scenes with the old lady and probably Hyde's role in the entire film. They could have probably edited these and made it less crude to keep it an overall movie for the family. Nonetheless the movie stands up on it's own and is more realistic and funny with a pleasant cast. 7/10."

","I didn't have high hopes for this film. I thought it would be entertaining Sunday movie. As a matter of fact it was much better than I originally thought.<br/><br/>Carl's (Jim Carrey) life is going badly. The man has been stuck on working in a bank for five years without a promotion. He is lazy, he would prefer to be alone and watch a movie than to go out with his friends. And all because his wife Stephanie (Molly Sims) divorced him three years earlier. Carl's life changes suddenly when he gets a opportunity to become a Yes-Man. First Carl is very skeptic about this but magically saying ""yes"" starts to work. Carl meets different kind of girl Allison (wonderful Zooey Deschanel) who is not afraid to enjoy her life...<br/><br/>""Yes Man"" offers a couple of new jokes that makes you laugh out loud. The new comedies of Jim Carrey have lately been just shadows from his pasts funny flicks like Dumb and dumber, The Mask etc. It was great that the film makers had a gut to cast a different kind of comedienne as opposite of Carrey in this film. Deschanel is great and little eccentric. For that reason she was a brilliant choice to play Allison. Also Carl's boss played by Rhys Darby is hilarious. The plot is somewhat predictable which is a little minus. In summary ""Yes Man"" is enjoyable and funny comedy."
"valleyjohn","7","1","1","28 April 2009"," Not a patch on the book but not bad
","I'm not the most prolific reader of books. in fact I'm lucky if i get through half a dozen books a year . One of the novels i have read recently is the fantastic Autobiographical "" Yes Man "" written by the extremely talented Londoner Danny Wallace . It's a funny , moving and ingenious book that i found hard to put down . So when i heard it was being made into a film i was thrilled. That was until i found out that it was going to be a Rom Com starring Jim Carey. <br/><br/>Carl Allen is a guy whose life is going nowhere‚Äîthe operative word being ""no""‚Äîuntil he signs up for a self-help program based on one simple covenant: say yes to everything...and anything. Unleashing the power of ""YES"" begins to transform Carl's life in amazing and unexpected ways, getting him promoted at work and opening the door to a new romance. But his willingness to embrace every opportunity might just become too much of a good thing. <br/><br/>Ten minutes into Yes Man i soon realised that this is very loosely based on the book. In fact it's nothing like it. Sure there are a few moments that happen in the book that are repeated in the film but not many. I'm not a fan of Jim Carey as regular readers of my blog will know. I don't think he's very funny and when he tries straight acting he's even worse. So what I'm about to say may surprise you. I actually quite liked Yes Man! <br/><br/>Sure it's not true to the book but once i got my head around that i started to quite enjoy it. Carey is not as annoying as normal and his supporting cast are very good. Zooey Deschanel is delightful as the love interest and ""Flight of Concords "" star Rhys Darby is hilarious. In fact he nearly steals the show from old rubber face himself. It's true that it's a romantic comedy and that's not every one's cup of tea (especially mine) but there are enough distractions to make you forget that. It does lose it's way in the last twenty minutes when it starts to get a bit preachy ( which couldn't be further from the book) but you can forgive it for that.<br/><br/>Yes Man isn't the sort of film you need to think about too much. It's a movie that you can just sit back and enjoy....but not too much. There are a couple of really funny scenes. One involves Carl and a role of sticky tape and the other a pensioner who has a special talent when she takes her teeth out. You use your imagination with that one! Having said that there is also an awful scene that made no sense at all involving a man trying to commit suicide and a spontaneous burst of song. Jim Carey has made a whole load of awful films in recent years and fans of his will be asking , Is Jim back? The Answer is........Yes Man! <br/><br/>(But i recommend the book more than the film) <br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"kyle-cruse","7","1","1","17 April 2009"," Surprisingly, it works
","Like most of Jim Carrey's films, ""Yes Man"" is random, over-the-top, and silly. However, like many of his other films, this one works. It's a simple story about how a guy who always says no to everyone and chooses to spend all of his time alone is convinced to go to a club that will encourage him to say ""yes"" to everything and truly live his life. As a result, he is challenged to say ""yes"" to every opportunity that comes his way, which ends up advancing his job, friendships, love life, etc. No matter how much or little you know about the film, you'll probably be able to predict just about everything that will happen. Nevertheless, it proved to be a tender and uplifting story anyway. Despite the random and corny jokes throughout, I found myself laughing. This film easily stands up to Carrey's similar films (""Bruce Almighty,"" ""Fun With Dick and Jane""), and is in some ways even better than those. I enjoyed the romantic parts of the film as well, with Zooey Deschanel providing a great female companion for the story. Of course this is not perfect, but a Jim Carrey film like this is one we do not (and cannot) expect to be perfect. Not great, but enjoyable, and you won't feel like you wasted your time. By the way, I could relate to Carrey in the film, understanding how he often preferred to spend his time alone. Maybe you'll relate to it as well, and enjoy it just that much more.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"Otoboke","Null","1","1","27 December 2008"," Heart-warming and more than good for a light hearted chuckle every now and then.
","There are those out there ¬ñspecifically speaking, there are critics out there- who often take it upon themselves to point out that Jim Carrey is an actor who plays the same hand, badly, movie after movie. I, believe it or not, am not one of these people. Growing up as a child, nobody made me laugh half as much as Ace Ventura, and I don't even want to estimate how many times I seen most of Mr. Carrey's movies of the nineties. As far as I was concerned, there was nobody funnier on the big screen.<br/><br/>Many years on, I still find at least some joy in watching the man play out familiar routines, but find much greater fun in seeing him stretch out and trying new things. Yes Man is an example of Carrey in mature comedy mode- to some degree. For sure, this isn't The Mask or Dumb and Dumber, and it sure as hell doesn't pull out the laughs as much as those movies, but there's a lot more to be said for the film's value as a substantial, character-driven piece of romantic comedy. I make no pretences, this isn't a masterpiece of any sort; there are numerous flaws to Yes Man's tale, but that doesn't mean that it is without any value. Heart-warming and more than good for a light hearted chuckle every now and then, this is Carrey doing adult, and it's an uplifting, albeit slightly underplayed couple of hours.<br/><br/>Taking a rather unconventional approach to storytelling, Yes Man is a feature that, like most feel-good-life-revelation movies, the main focus here is about the main character and how he changes his life for the better. In this happy-go-lucky sphere, there isn't much room for the key ingredient that playwrights will swear by- I'll give you a clue, it begins with c and ends in onflict. As a result, Yes Man can be slow moving¬Ö I mean, extremely slow moving. Surviving mainly on gags and character-development for the better half of the feature, the writers don't seem too worried that there really isn't much for the viewer to be paying attention for, and yet this is slightly liberating despite its sometimes irksome pacing consequences.<br/><br/>In case you didn't know already, Yes Man is a story like this year's The Bucket List, in that our central character realises he must change his life rapidly in order to enjoy it to the fullest. For Carl Allen (Carrey), a meek, always-say-no insurance shark, this comes in form of an organisation ¬ñor, a more appropriate, but keenly avoided term, cult- that embraces the word ""yes"" as their simple but effective mantra. Extremely sceptical at first, it doesn't take long for Carl to realise the benefits of such a philosophy after his first night living by it ends in him sharing a kiss with the lovely freebird Allison (Zooey Deschanel); from here it's just a matter of agreeing to everything that comes his way- which, admittedly can result in some awkward, but hysterically amusing segments.<br/><br/>From here on in, the movie moves from gimmicky comedy to focus more on character and romance. This shift in gear helps break Yes Man away from its early amusing, but largely soulless scenes and develop those who inhabit the screen into characters we care for. Carrey, who adopts a tone here that is similar to his work in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (arguably, his finest film to date), manages to establish a mostly plausible mix of genuine warmth and his usual shtick and slapstick; those who appreciate both sides of the actor will get a lot out of it, though one suspects many will only be distracted by the more zany sides of Carl. On the opposite side of the story, Zooey Deschanel plays a role not that dissimilar from her earlier effort from this year in The Happening, but is certainly given a lot more to breathe here. As a love interest, Deschanel is as alluring as she need be, and counterbalances her softer core with a welcome independent edge.<br/><br/>Of course, Yes Man isn't all yes, yes, yes; there are problems here, and one cannot help but be somewhat critical towards the unsustainable premise of the feature. Yet despite the pacing issues, and a lack of drama or conflict that feels natural or warranted, there nevertheless remains an enjoyable, heart-warming core to Yes Man's story that is very hard to refute. There will be moments when you may look at your watch, perhaps roll your eyes at the movie's more over-the-top scenes which clash with the adult-orientated segments, but by the time the credits roll, there's little doubt that you'll be feeling uplifted. As far as comedy or romance goes, Yes Man is by no means perfect either; in fact both elements are lukewarm for a large part of the feature, but as a character-drama, the feature remains compelling to watch unfold. For that reason I simply recommend this to those who seek something a little familiar but at the same time, more contemplated and reserved. There are brash moments in Yes Man, yet these are moments of mere background noise contrasted against sweet melody that is played in the foreground.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

"commandercool88","5","3","6","1 January 2009"," Average Carrey Comedy
","There's not much to get with a film like 'Yes Man'. It's the kind of vehicle you would have expected from Jim Carrey some ten years ago in the thick of his one-trick pony concept films. It's not a bad movie, and it's actually very entertaining, but it's the sort of movie you forget about ten minutes after walking out of the theater.<br/><br/>It's the concept of 'Yes Man' that just screams utter lunacy. A man who says 'yes'. To everything. If he says 'no', awful things will happen. How on earth can a film sustain such a flimsy and empty plot for 100 minutes? Thankfully, 'Yes Man' is so harmless and lofty that Jim Carrey barely has to sell us anything for us to willingly go along with it. He seems right at home here, even if it feels like an attempt to rekindle prior hit machines. Though quite honestly, I'll take this Carrey over 'The Number 23' any day. But after seeing his potential in films like 'Eternal Sunshine', he's better than this.<br/><br/>Carrey's routine works well enough to garner a few laughs. Not many, and I really can't recall any gut-busting jokes, but 'Yes Man' will get you chuckling to the point where you won't feel like the money spent was a complete waste. And once again, the gorgeous Zooey Deschanel finds herself in a film that really has nowhere to go. But she makes the best of what the script gives her, and like many of the films she participates in, she's the life of the party. Proving once again that she can also hold a note, 'Yes Man' should have been a better vehicle for her singing career than Carrey's goofball antics.<br/><br/>I have perhaps saved the best for last. In case you ever forgot that Warner Bros. does have a stake in this silly thing we like to call Hollywood, 'Yes Man' is practically a 100 minute infomercial advertising their many products. There are no less than a dozen references to all things related to this film's parent studio. And in case you're the subtle type, Warner Bros. doesn't hesitate to hit you over the head with their involvement with 'Harry Potter', '300', 'The Goonies', and yes, even Third Eye Blind. Who were, in case you didn't know, signed onto Warner's music label. So even if 'Yes Man' rings mostly hollow despite its good-natured attempt to teach us a life-affirming message, Warner Bros. has another issue on their agenda. They make movies, and even music, and they hope you don't take the shortcomings of a film like 'Yes Man' too personally.<br/><br/>The joke's on us.<br/><br/>More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
"zardoz-13","4","3","6","24 December 2008"," Just Say No To Carrey's ""Yes"" Jest!
","Just say NO to the new Jim Carrey comedy ""Yes Man"" (** out of ****), a frivolous exercise in high-concept celluloid that co-stars dishy Zooey Deschanel and grim-faced Terence Stamp. This one-note nonsense about a negative-minded man who realizes the affirmative power of the word 'yes' recalls an earlier Carrey epic ""Liar, Liar"" (1997) about an unprincipled lawyer who prevaricated at the least provocation. The gimmick in ""Liar Liar"" was his son's birthday wish that his father couldn't fib. Consequently, the reformed attorney had to tell the truth no matter what the situation.<br/><br/>In ""Yes Man,"" the rubber-faced funny man must say 'yes' to everybody with a request. Inevitably, our hero's life takes some hallowing turns, but nothing really surprising happens. Well, perhaps something surprising occurs in one scene where dentures in a glass of water on a night stand figures prominently. Mind you, moviegoers who appreciate risqu√© humor will split their sides laughing. Fastidious folks, on the contrary, may grimace with horror and feel offended by this salacious twist.<br/><br/>Along with its single usage of the F-word as prescribed by the Motion Picture Association of America in all PG-13 flicks, ""Break Up"" director Peyton Reed's ""Yes Man"" recycles the typical boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl back tale. Audiences that adore Carrey's elastic-cheeked clowning no matter what he does may find this far-fetched foolishness farcical. Discriminating audiences will feel like they've been cheated, even at matin√©e prices. At 104 minutes, ""Yes Man"" qualifies as more mess than merriment.<br/><br/>Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) loves to say 'no.' As a bank loan officer, nay saying is second nature to him. As it turns out, our pitiful protagonist lost his wife, Stephanie (Molly Sims of ""Starsky & Hutch""), after six months of marriage because she felt Carl was too dull for her own good. Since their divorce three years ago, Carl has shunned his friends, particularly Peter (Bradley Cooper of ""The Comebacks"") and Rooney (Danny Masterson of ""Face/Off""), and confined himself to his apartment watching Blockbuster DVDs. At work, Carl tolerates his goofy boss, Norm (a hilarious Rhys Darby of """"The Flight of the Conchords""), who keeps inviting him to his masquerade parties. Speaking of product placement, this Warner Brothers release shamelessly touts its own movies, such as the ""Harry Potter"" franchise and ""300"" for Norm's parties.<br/><br/>One day while he is relaxing outside the bank, Carl meets a former bank colleague, Nick (John Michael Higgins of ""Evan Almighty""), who lives life to the hilt and shows no ill effects for all his reckless indulgence. So impressed by Nick's carefree attitude is Carl that he attends a self-help seminar hosted by charismatic Dale Carnegie-type counselor Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp of ""Superman"") who preaches about the positive power of saying 'yes.' Appropriately enough, Carl resists the urge to say yes, but the crowd around him changes his mind.<br/><br/>No sooner has our hero left the seminar than a shrewd homeless man, who has been taking advantage of Bundley's converts, hits up Carl for a free ride to a far-off park, the use of his cell phone, and every dollar in his wallet. Not only does Carl run out of gas by the time he reaches the park, but also the homeless guy (Brent Briscoe of ""Mr. Woodcock"") has depleted Carl's cell phone battery. Carl traipses several miles back into town to fill up his gas container. At the gas station, he meets free-spirited, non-conformist Allison (Zooey Deschanel of ""The Happening"") who is gassing up her motor scooter. She sports a helmet with Tweety Bird eyes painted on it so you know she is a little wacky, too. Anyway, Allison offers Carl a ride, and he says 'yes' to a new relationship. At the same time, Carl decides to take flying lessons, guitar lessons, learns to speak Korean, and searches for a spouse at the website persianwifefinder.com. Eventually, things sour for our love birds because Allison learns that Carl has programmed himself to say yes to everybody.<br/><br/>Watching Jim Carrey is always a treat because he is so spontaneous. His physical humor and his facial antics are as infectiously funny as ever. The contrived screenplay by ""Fun with Dick & Jane"" scribe Nicholas Stoller as well as newcomers Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogol, however, runs out of comic momentum about 45 minutes and becomes hopelessly predictable. One amusing moment occurs when our hero saves a suicidal man (Luis Guzm√°n of ""School for Scoundrels"") by using his newly acquired guitar playing skills and getting the man as well as a crowd of spectators to join him in a sing-along.<br/><br/>Carl's love interest is flaky as all get-out; she teaches a photography class where students jog around Griffith Park and snap photos. You'd think Allison would have noticed how Carl always blurts out 'yes' to anybody. She decides to dump our hero because she feels that he isn't so much attracted to her ridiculous life-style as he is committed to the 'yes' covenant he made with Bundley. Meanwhile, Rhys Darby matches Carrey's maniac comic energy with his use of childish nicknames and nerdy parties. Terence Stamp, who played General Zod in the Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movie, makes a great comic foil as the harried guru who bullied Carl into taking his covenant and regrets having done so during our hero's fourth-quarter meltdown.<br/><br/>Indeed, the ""Yes Man"" trailer makes this movie look far better than it is. Aside from the possibly objectionable scene with an elderly, sex-starved neighbor who promises to relieve our hero's anxieties, ""Yes Man"" amounts to a made-to-order, upbeat date movie. Nevertheless, compared with Carrey's funnier films, especially his ""Ace Ventura"" movies, ""Yes Man"" is one big No-No."
"dvc5159","6","3","6","21 December 2008"," Carrey's back.
","In this feel-good film, Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) challenges himself to say Yes to almost anything and everything. Concept aside, this is a remarkable comedic comeback for Carrey, after the magnificent Michel Gondry art piece ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", the mediocre but dark thriller ""The Number 23"", and the animated ""Horton Hears a Who!"" There are a lot of jokes in the film, and some of them are put to well use. But Carrey blazes above all else with his humor. He's still the zany goofy guy we all like, but not as hypercaffienated as ""Ace Ventura"" or that ''truthful'' lawyer in ""Liar Liar"". Carrey has matured. But he's still very funny. This film may very well be Carrey's funniest film since the first ""Ace Ventura"", and that's saying something.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat formulaic and predictable. But it's all good as the jokes and mostly Carrey save the film. Sure, it has a preachy message hidden somewhere in there, but all in all it's a pretty good message: Say yes to (almost) everything and you'll have a better life. I couldn't agree more after seeing this film.<br/><br/>Supporting actors are good here, but the standout is Zooey Deschanel. It's her innocence and natural charm that makes her appeal to the audience, and it is refreshing.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a very good comedy that will definitely make you smile, feel better, and inspired when you walk out of the cinema.

"DICK STEEL","7","6","17","16 December 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Yes Man
","It's been a while since Jim Carrey hit the screens, going back to his comedic roots after the rather lacklustre dramatic turn in the thriller The Number 23. But it's a somewhat muted Carrey we get, as gone out the window are the over the top antics and rubbery face, and in comes a fine balance between getting the laughs, as well as having some dramatic flair in crafting a believable working class character who is jaded with work and life in general, opting instead to coast through life almost like a recluse.<br/><br/>And when a friend told me that this character was somewhat familiar, I understand his point. I suppose most of us could probably identify with the very routine lives that we're leading, juggling work and whatever effort we can muster to have a semblance of balance, either with family, friends, or spending some quality time investing in oneself. But this means regressing into the tried, tested and safe, losing that spark that comes with the randomness of living, and the gaining of experience that would have been gained. In fact, it brought back some memories that I was once a Yes Man myself, and I won't deny that somewhere along the way I've taken a detour, though it was a conscious decision at that.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey plays Carl Allen, a junior loans officer at a bank who spends his time at work, and his personal life, in saying no to everyone and to opportunities, ignoring calls and well meaning efforts from friends to bring him out of his shell. But a life changing seminar (I've been to something similar, even though it was just a preview) with pop music, enthusiastic energizer-bunny type attendees, and an enigmatic speaker, would convince him to take the plunge into make a covenant to say yes to every opportunity that comes by. Not that he has any choice since the self-help guru is played by Terence Stamp, and nobody has the audacity to say no to General Zod. (Curiously, Terence Stamp has been in plenty of supporting roles of late).<br/><br/>So begins a series of situational comedies, most of which would already have been captured in the trailer. Carl begins to live life as he wanted to, taking lessons, meeting people, and what I found to be most appealing, would be to convert from a person of negative thoughts, to a positive thinking fellow. His new attitude opens doors, and almost instantly he reaps the benefits of this new found approach, the best of course is the encounter with hot chick Allison (Zooey Deschanel).<br/><br/>Besides the philosophy behind the movie, Yes Man is also a romance, with two random people who are totally opposites, coming together because of their spontaneity, and how strongly and positively different a relationship which isn't routine would provide for a couple. I suppose to a certain degree I tasted some form of success at this going where the wind brings approach, though that of course was a long time back. Naturally they fall heads over heels with each other, but like all romances, there's no such thing as smooth sailing, even though this takes place in the last act and rides to the finale fairly quickly.<br/><br/>I more than welcome Zooey Deschanel as the leading lady in Yes Man (I would say yes too *ahem*), because in my opinion she hasn't made a lot of films, and still has that refreshing appeal. If truth be told her Allison would be someone whom I'd sit up and take notice, because of her zest for life, and hey, here's someone multi-talented (ok, that might be debatable), coupled with some of her really unorthodox activities that look like fun, and miles from what I am doing anyway. I thought Jim Carrey had a field day acting opposite her, and that chemistry probably rubbed off and made them look like a cute couple who are up to totally crazy antics when they're out on their dates.<br/><br/>Based on the book by Danny Wallace, the turning point in the film, which tied up all the random elements pretty neatly for that push toward the final act, was well done and I couldn't help but to guffaw, that if I was in those shoes, I might be connecting the dots in the same manner and asking pointed questions as well. Along with a whole host of supporting cast ranging from Bradley Cooper as Carl's best friend Peter, Molly Sims as his ex-wife Stephanie and Rhys Darby in a hilarious role as his manager (and major geek) Norman, the soundtrack too serves as another highlight in the film, with songs mostly by Eels, and Zooey Deschanel herself lending her vocal chords to a number of songs here, where the lyrics are totally insane (she has part writing credit for those) which left me laughing out loud for the most parts.<br/><br/>So while I see the cinematic ways as to how saying Yes could change one's life but only with the intervention of fated coincidences, I guess there's no harm trying and giving the same philosophy a shot, right? So go ahead and say Yes together with me, but of course with some intelligence and common sense, and I'd expect all of us could hope to be in for some surprising change to our personal lives. And please say Yes too to sitting through the end credits - that little skate man idea looks totally awesome!"

","Yes Man, Starring: Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel, Bradley Cooper, & Terrence Stamp Directed By: Peyton Reed This is a movie about a guy who is a shut in, afraid to commit to things to just about anything actually. His ability to say ""yes"" and to commit to anything since his wife divorced him, so in result he's been stuck at the same dead end job and become a nuisance to his friends, then one day takes a seminar and the word"" YES"" takes over his life and doors of opportunity open for him.<br/><br/>I am a big Jim Carrey fan and a sucker for anything he's ever in. So when I saw a trailer I thought to myself this out to be good, it looked a like a ""Liar Liar"" type throw back but could be really funny. Saying this I went tonight and I was entertained but didn't laugh all that much. It had a so so attempt at some laughs and some obvious set ups for bigger laughs but not very clever in deliveries. NO chemistry between anyone in this film, from his friends, to great new love interest he falls into. This movie had the set ups for everything but nothing really all that great happened, when it came time for the obvious plot thickness and in a romantic comedy usually that means the love interest gets really aggravated at the main character and he has to win her back basically. We've seen this all 1 to many times and it was nothing new and it was already obvious what was going to happen.<br/><br/>Like I said this was no "" Liar Liar"" not,"" Bruce Almighty"" and definitely not ""Cable Guy"" (which is a good movie if you give it a chance). This like I said was entertaining but nothing more, I like to think I am some what a film psychic and I predict that Jim Carrey's last two films have not been hits and will soon be joining the"" Apatow Posse"" to help revive his comedic films. Although I think the best part in this film is when Jim Carrey made a few funny faces, those are always priceless."

So, I guess I was more upset about how poor this movie was, how it wasn't remotely funny, and how it was almost entirely nothing to do with the source material.
In the book, a random man on a bus, overhearing Danny Wallace on the phone says ""You should say yes more"". So he decides to.
In the movie, he already wants to, then joins a cult, then Jim Carry capers like a drunk monkey for the rest of the movie, followed by the moral of the story.

Enter stage right Carls old buddy, Nick (John Michael Higgins) persuades him to attend a self empowerment seminar hosted by the large than life and seemingly mystical Terrance Bradley (Terrance stamp) where he is indoctrinated into the pseudo-cult like following. Terrance bradly makes a 'covenant' with carry whereby he must say yes to everything¬ÖEVERYTHING that comes he's way.<br/><br/>On leaving the seminar a homeless man asks him for a lift, Carry's friend answers for him (yes, obviously) and thus starts the snowball effect of the film. Carry plays he's part well and via a sires of events meets Allison (Zooeny Deschanel) who like him says yes to life. She plays in a niche rock band, leads a jogging photography group, and generally leads life to the full like a manic pixie girl. Her attitude Is "" The world's a playground.

Due to a heavy handed misunderstanding he's waylaid by the FBI while trying to get a plane to the first random destination available, when its explained that he HAS to say yes to everything Allison takes umbrage at this and flounces of like a schoolgirl,sorry i mean, leaves him. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is him coming to terms with the truth behind saying yes to everything and learning the lesion that its not always saying yes to everything, but WANTING to that makes a true change in he's life. Having reached this epiphany he finds general zod, sorry Terrance bundley, causes a car crash, asks him to be realised from 'the covenant' as every time he says no to something bad things follow. Terrance assures him that there was no covenant in the first place and that the point was to open him up to the idea and he should say yes because you have to believe that it's what you really want"". With this fresh in he's mind he rides up like a bat out of hell to find Allison and cue the happy ending as they work out there relationship issues in record time.<br/><br/>Its not a bad film, not by any means.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) works in a bank, spending his time rejecting most of the loans customers apply for. Outside of work, he has a negative attitude that sees him missing out on a lot in life, including the engagement party of his good friend Peter (Bradley Cooper.) He bumps into an old friend who takes him to a self help seminar where a guru embraces him to say 'yes' to everything-and actually puts a curse on him where saying 'no' will result in something bad. Before long, Carl's saying 'yes' to literally everything, causing complications in his work life and personal life.<br/><br/>I've become quite an avid reader of Danny Wallace's '...is a man' column in ShortList Magazine, which I pick up for free every Thursday on my way into work. The man has an undeniable way with words and for bringing fairly ordinary situations he's found himself in during the past week to life in the most vivid and outrageous way possible, I call to mind his experiences in a chip shop with a drunk guy who thought he was mute, sitting behind a guy on a train who talked loudly into his mobile while placing a large order and confrontations with builders outside his home. This is an adaptation of a novel he wrote based on a philosophy he adapted in his own life where he had too much of a negative attitude. I haven't read it (hadn't even heard about it!) but I'm sorry to say Yes Man hasn't translated into a great film.<br/><br/>There are some very funny moments (that are uniquely Wallace in their hilariousness), but as a whole the film is very hard to get into and fails to really hold your attention. In the lead role, Carrey seems to have matured and refrains from too much gurning and mugging (except from a scene where he's consumed too much Red Bull!) but he can't work to his best with the weak material. With the current economic climate, a scene where he's reprimanded for granting too many loans may even be seen as tasteless by some. I'm just nit picking now, but the fact is this is a disappointing film that only manages to be sporadically funny. **"

","I left this movie puzzled. It started out so well! It had a great premise: this guy who always says no to everything somehow changes and says yes to everything--let the events unfold! However, with that great start, led the movie to a decline which soon plummeted to an awkward ending of the movie.<br/><br/>I was excited to see this movie because of Jim Carrey; I thought it would be like ""Liar, Liar"", where it would be funny, it would have a good plot, and leave myself with a sense that I enjoyed a good movie. Unfortunately, I am not so much of a Carrey fan anymore.<br/><br/>There were quite a lot of boring scenes that I did not really understand, leaving me thinking, ""Why was that put in there?"" The entire plot was quite random; things just happened from one thing to another. It's like they could have scrambled a bunch of scenes and it wouldn't make any difference.<br/><br/>The thing that confuses me the most is that there is a book which was written before the movie, but it's a good 400 pages. My thinking is that they just took snippets from the book and made this slapped-together movie, leaving a lot out, which was probably key to the plot line. <br/><br/>I wanted to walk out of the theaters and tell everyone that this was a great movie, that I highly recommend it, but I won't be doing that. It was just so-so. It has been the worst Carrey movie I've seen yet. What also bugs me is that Zooey Deschanel, who plays Alison, is 28 in real life, when Jim Carrey is 46. Although age is just a number, she's basically a young girl and he's a grown man. There were scenes that just looked awkward between the two of them because you could tell she is so much younger than him.<br/><br/>I would almost venture to say bad casting and a poor execution of the plot. The only thing that saved this movie is that it was quite hilarious throughout. I definitely got my share of laughs, but they soon ceased when the halfway point in the movie occurred, and the balance was tipped off the scale.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 stars."

"RisingStar12","6","2","4","26 December 2008"," Can one word provoke an entire movie?
","When I first heard about ""Yes Man"", I was intrigued. In case you don't know, the plot line is pretty simple. It's about a man who has to say ""yes"" to every circumstance. I instantly started imagining Jim Carrey being thrown into ridiculous and crazy situations because he can't say ""no."" Yesterday, after finding out that ""The Spirit"" was not playing, I decided to see this movie. And I have to say that my original outline in my head isn't that far off from the actual film. There's no need to bore you with the details of what the film is about, so instead I'll cut right to my opinion: This movie had a lot of potential. It's one of the most unique ideas that I've heard about in years (and yes, I have seen Liar, Liar.) And there are some great scenes in this film. For example, there's a bar fight scene where Jim Carrey completely looses himself in his character. However, for a large amount of the scenes, one of two things happens. Either the scenes don't go far enough or the scenes don't connect at all to the movie. Yes, this is confusing, so let me explain. In some scenes, I felt as if the actors did not go far enough. They simply rushed through an idea, but did not extend enough to give the scene it's full potential. There were also moments when things didn't really connect, and it felt like the filmmakers randomly selected scenarios and copy and pasted them into the movie. My only problem with this is that it's not realistic. Yes, this is a comedy, but I personally believe that movies should still be realistic. My final concern with this film is the lack of a problem. This is the kind of movie where you walk in to the theater knowing that some sort of conflict will occur 3/4 of the way into the film. And, of course, it does. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will simply say that when the conflict does occur, it feels so small that you barely recognize it for what it is. But I've focused too much on the negative part of the film. I must say that all of the actors gave very good performances and got into their character. And, as stated previously, there were moments of comic genius. The plot line is so simple that it's almost daunting to know where to begin, and I applaud the filmmakers. And, out of everything, the message is clear: Live your life to the fullest.<br/><br/>---RisingStar12"

Then there's the love story between two opposite people that is just delightful and the awkward situation these two are placed in once Jim Carrey's big secret comes out.

","The talk that ""Yes Man,"" is Jim Carrey's return to leading role comedy through the reincarnate of ""Liar Liar"" is not off-base by any means, but other than Carrey himself, this movie is completely different. This is Carrey in a much more contemporary comedy, not a product of formula that made him a star in the 90s. ""Yes Man"" is still extremely formulaic when viewed alongside recent comedies, but if you can just say ""yes,"" and not dismiss it too early on, you'll be surprised by how fresh and entertaining this film can be.<br/><br/>Carrey stars as Carl Allen, a man whose boring job and divorce have him in a rut so bad that he would rather make excuses and be left alone than do anything. But when he begins to lose the faith of his best friend (Bradley Cooper of ""Wedding Crashers""), Carl reluctantly attends a seminar about the power of the word ""yes."" At the seminar, Carl enters a 'covenant' in which he agrees to say ""yes"" to any opportunity, no matter how strange, that comes his way. By doing this, Carl meets a lot of frustration, but he also meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel)and his life begins changing for the more humorous.<br/><br/>It's the right role for Carrey, but it's also a touch odd to see the master of last decade plugged into a film where the writing, the cast and nearly everything around him is hip and current. Director Peyton Reed (""The Break-Up"") and writer Nicholas Stoller (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""), for example, both are well-versed in the recent frat-pack/ Apatow clan comedy mania that has defined the last five or so years. There is some great situational writing from Stoller where every joke or thing that Carl agrees to do is able to come back to make the film funnier later on, but Carrey does fit strangely into it all. After all, he is 46 year old and his love interest, Deschanel, is 28. Carl Allen is clearly written for someone younger, yet without Carrey there is no star power to sell this film. Carrey has that power and beyond, and though it's a bit weird to see a middle-aged man going out with the guys and getting completely drunk, it was still the right choice by the producers because his comedic strengths fit the role in terms of characterization.<br/><br/>Sure, ""Yes Man"" is one of those comedies where a guy starts out pretty despicable but wins the audiences favor and gets a girlfriend who finds out he was a jerk and doesn't forgive him though we know he has changed so he has to do something valiant to get her back. However, that's nothing new in Hollywood and ""Yes Man"" deserves to be judged on the meat of the comedy and not its bones. In that respect, it's mostly a very funny situational film though some of the dialog intended to be witty/clever falls flat.<br/><br/>The only other things that keep ""Yes Man"" from becoming one of the year's best comedies is the excessive use of product placement and Warner Bros. decision to brag about all the popular movies it owns the rights to (""Harry Potter"" and ""300"") by showing them in various ways throughout the film from actual footage to costumes to DVD cases. But that's all nit-picky because as much as ""Yes Man"" might sell out, it's really got some great stuff buried inside."

","After watching this for the fourth time, one revelation sprung to mind. I miss Jim Carrey's career. Whilst this is not his best comedic outgoing, it's probably one of his most watchable titles. The light comedy paving the way for a predictably mundane romance produces an optimistic outlook on how one should live, but doesn't necessarily exploit its concept fully. A bank loan officer, with an increasingly negative perspective on life, attends a motivational seminar which changes his routinely daily workings to a life of spontaneity, allowing him to meet a new girl in process.<br/><br/>How does one obtain the dream girl, you ask? Say ""yes!"" to literally every opportunity. Attend Korean lessons? ""Yes!"". Accept oral sex from an elderly neighbour? ""Sure, why the hell not!"". Drive halfway across the city at the request of a homeless man whilst he drains the battery on your phone and leads you to run out of gas? ""Sign me up!"".<br/><br/>The concept of said seminar is to open one's mind at every opportunity presented, not to be a negative Nancy and become an introverted recluse. Let life guide you. Sure, this ethos is somewhat taken to the absurd degree with Carrey instantly shouting ""Yup!"" to all things stupid, but at its core there is a poignant message to be taken from Wallace's memoir of the same name. And that's where this film succeeds in being the eternally watchable comedy that it is. The onslaught of shenanigans that Carrey finds himself jumping into, suits his body comedy. He has always been an exaggerated comedian, and a traditional one at that, who can obtain chuckles from myself by rapidly talking about Red Bull whilst having consumed said beverage. Simple, yet hilariously effective. The hyperactive narrative is perfect for his skittish nature.<br/><br/>Where the film falters however, is with the terribly written romance. I have nothing against Zooey ""Look at me, I can't act"" Deschanel, but let's face it, she just cannot express any range of emotion. She is unable to masquerade the one-dimensionality of this forced romance that plagued the story, offering a complete tonal shift from the well-executed comedy. The plot should've focused purely on Carrey's rehabilitation on his perspective on life, not wide-eyed Deschanel. Far too formulaic for my taste. Cooper, despite not being a star back then, was underused. Fortunately Stamp blows everyone out of the negative water with his insatiable positivity. Just him running off the stage and towards the crowd like Sonic the Hedgehog, was enough to make me shout ""Yes!"". Unfortunately, the romance is an overbearing ""No!""."

","The problem with Jim Carrey is not Jim Carrey...it is the mediocre directors that do not do their homework! This is a movie studio problem. Number one factor is identify what your star does better than anyone else, what makes them unique. Habit one: Begin with the end in mind. This is a thinking skill few seem to possess.<br/><br/>What does Carrey do brilliantly? We saw a few Carreyisms which are littered throughout his film and Living Color performances. In Yes Man, it was the scene where he grabs the guitar and sings the guy off the ledge, but it was immediately after he pulls him into the office, he does a British accent of a rock musician. Totally unexpected addition to a scene. That is LOL stuff. That is where his magic takes place.<br/><br/>Give him a story to grab hold of, that is a writer's job. Jim could play the role here similar to Norm MacDonald--a goofy guy that has a deeper soul underneath. Jim can stay on surface as Mr Silly, but as the story moves on, show a deeper side, a side that makes connections to soul most people miss and ignore in real life. Compare this to the shallow businessman focused on his portfolio using whomever along the way (the norm) and Jim is in this world, but not part of it--he is actually more courageous but it takes time to see this. That is a story people can connect with, the part that says, ""I really want to have more courage, but truth is, I am a conformist...like everyone else and afraid to take risks.""<br/><br/>Look at Jim's life today...where has he gone?

","Meet Carl. He's the most negative person you've ever met. Only you'll never meet him because he hides from society being terminally annoyed by everyone. Unexpectedly, something happens which makes him say yes to everything.<br/><br/>Right in league with other fun & silly what-if plots like ""The Invention of Lying"" (a world where nobody ever lies) or ""Stranger Than Fiction"" (a guy who hears a narrator telling him his own life story), ""Yes Man"" is good clean entertainment that, who knows, might even change your life. Or at least get you out of the house once in a while.<br/><br/>""Yes Man"" differs from the other 2 films I mentioned (great flicks by the way) in one important respect: it's not a bizarre alternate reality, nor is there anything really supernatural going on. So it's more down-to-earth and less wacky than you might expect. But that gives the actors more room to give it a personal touch. In other words, what makes this movie work isn't just a crazy story but good solid character development.<br/><br/>Jim Carey, who plays ""Carl"", is somewhat toned down compared to his manic ""Mask"" theatrics, but subtlety works to his advantage. (Note: if you want to see Carey in all his insane glory, check out the bonus features where he really lets loose). As he meets quirky characters, it's Carey who plays the straight man, and his deadpan expressions are hilarious. The way he tolerates his overexuberant boss ""Norman"" (Rhys Darby) is classic. Norman himself is something similar to Austin Powers in a business suit. Zooey Deschanel is, well, she's Zooey Deschanel - awesome and cute as hell, playing the role of a photography/jogging instructor by day and by night she sings in an alt band that has a total of 7 fans.<br/><br/>What's really fun about this movie is seeing how all the quirky characters converge in a well written story that all comes together with every character contributing. There aren't necessarily any bank capers or high speed chases (wait, actually there are sorta)--what I mean is, there aren't a lot of contrived plot twists and seat-gripping thrills; the film relies on its entertaining script and the aforementioned acting expertise. But it delivers a great story with never a dull moment. Should you watch ""Yes Man""? My answer is.......... sure dude."

","One of Jim Carrey's many silly movies features him as a man who decides to answer yes to everything, no matter how banal. ""Yes Man"" is essentially a gimmick comedy like ""Liar Liar"" or ""Bruce Almighty"", but it's a funny one. It's one of those movies whose purpose is just to be funny, and it succeeds. I suspect that they probably had a lot of fun filming it, understanding that a few scenes - namely one involving Fionnula Flanagan - were very likely awkward to film.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a fun movie.

","This film tells of a banking official who, because he is dissatisfied with his life, adheres to a positivist theory that promises to change his life if he stops saying no to everything. The theory, of course, was something to take with discernment, but Carl adopts it in a radical way, which brings him several and hilarious confusions, especially from the moment he meets Allison. The two roles are played by Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel, respectively, and both are excellent in the role, particularly Zooey. Terence Stamp plays the guru of self-esteem.<br/><br/>The movie is interesting. It deals with a current theme that is low-self-esteem that affects us quite often at times. The need to face life in a cheerful and positive way. The jokes are good, although it's not a jaw-dropping movie. They are mainly based on situations created by the psychological inability of the central character to say no. The novel intertwines well in history and gives it a rational outcome. It's an interesting movie, especially for those who are accustomed to a crazier Jim Carrey. He is undoubtedly a quieter and quieter character than most of the actor's comic characters."

","Yes Man is a loaf of fluffy, inconsequential Wonderbread amidst a career of denser comedic pumpernickel for Jim Carrey. Most of what he does has weight to go along with the laughs, and if it doesn't it still has a raunchy bite that always hits below the belt. This is one of the few times he treaded lighter, a tone which can also be found in Fun With Dick & Jane, but that's just not a good movie. Yes Man has merit in fits and starts, and it's harmless fun for most of the ride. Carrey plays the consummate negative Nancy here, a guy who spends the better part of his time turning down offers, cancelling plans, avoiding people and saying no to everything. This all changes when he goes to a dodgy seminar preached by batty self help guru Terence Stamp. Inspired by his slightly odd teachings, he challenges himself to say yes to everything, and I mean everything, for one whole year. This gets him into all sorts of trouble, and steers him to the obligatory 180 shift in his character arc, and his own enlightenment. Guzzling red bulls after an all night club bender, guitar lessons, sexual favors from his experienced elderly neighbor (Fionnula Flanagan), driving a homeless dude (Brent Briscoe) to the middle of nowhere and giving him like two hundred bucks, life is just more fun when you say yes to everything, as Carrey quickly finds out. He also meets cutie pie Zooey Deschanel, whose initial amusement towards his lifestyle quickly turns to exasperation when his affirmative nature gets just a biiit too crazy for her. It's all in good fun, and while most of it isn't memorable or super noteworthy, there is one particular scene that makes the entire film worthwhile: Carrey has an awkward kiwi of a boss (Rhys Darby) who is constantly inviting him to cosplay parties. The moment he accepts is a symphony of quirky mannerisms, scotch taped facial grimaces and absurdity that is pure Carrey and could be used to sum up his career in half a minute. Watch for work from Danny Masterson, Spencer Garrett and Bradley Cooper. Like I said, it ain't gonna rock your world like many of the iconic, beloved Carrey films, but it's an amusing diversion with some scenes that do bring it home."

Work suddenly seems promising, and above all, he meets this new girl.<br/><br/>Comments: A very warm, actually inspiring but above all, a really funny movie. I enjoyed it very much, and even though a star like Jim Carrey brings a lot of expectations with him, both he and the movie exceeded them. This was just a lot more funnier, a lot more entertaining than I expected.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is cast perfectly in this role. It lets him utilize his unique brand of comedy and wacky acting that once made him famous, but also combine it with some of the more serious aspects he has been looking for in recent years. According to trivia this was something both Carrey and director Peyton Reed aimed for, and I think they succeeded very well. Zooey Deschanel was a real positive surprise for me. Having seen her in a few films before I haven't been impressed. This time she really stood out. She managed to give her character, the girl that the lead is interested in, so many more sides than is usually done. Many times the girl of interest is just beautiful, and Zooey was, but she also had her own quirky way, combined with a caring sweetness. She contributed very much to the success of this movie with her character, and she worked very well with Carrey. They both had good support from the other cast too, to many to mention them all. But I would wish that Danny Masterson found a role that would put him more in the limelight, he got the talent.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie successful is that it doesn't depend on Carrey as the sole resource of fun. As mentioned the other cast contribute well, but so does the story itself. It is very well written, and puts mostly Carl in a lot of odd, but funny situations. It develops well and doesn't reuse the same joke too much, it keeps inventive and because of it, very funny and entertaining.<br/><br/>It was a positive surprise for me, in more than one way. It was just one of those rare movies that are both very funny and thoughtful at the same time. Recommended.<br/><br/>8/10"

","In 1997, Jim Carrey starred in a wonderful film called Liar Liar, about a lawyer who is forced to tell the truth for 24 hours. Now, in 2008, he was in Yes Man, about a banker who must say ""yes"" to every opportunity presented to him. Sound familiar? Although Yes Man was a decent film, it is nothing compared to Liar Liar. When a lawyer desperately wants to tell the truth, but cannot, it is funny. It provides many opportunities for Jim Carrey to go insane with his facial expressions and such. But when a man says ""yes"" to everything because he wants to¬Ö Where's the tension? Jim Carrey's comedic talents are practically not employed in this film, which is a terrible shame.<br/><br/>Although Yes Man is enjoyable, there is one thing that I wish the film didn't do. Jim Carrey's character, Carl, has an elderly woman as his neighbour. One day, she asks him to come set up some shelves for her. As a method of compensation, she proposes to give him a ""sexual release"". What happens next‚Äî I just wish the film hadn't gone this far. There was no need. When Carl refused and fled, the scene was funny. When he returned, the scene momentarily switched from funny to disgusting.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey makes gargantuan efforts to carry the film, and he more or less succeeds. He is supported by a solid cast, but none (with the possible exception of Terence Stamp) do nearly as good of a job as Carrey.<br/><br/>One more thing about Yes Man that I have mixed feelings about: Carl's boss, Norm, is portrayed as a stereotypical, Hollywood ""loser"", hosting a Harry Potter dress-up party, and later, a similar one in honour of 300. He remains a gawky, two-dimensional caricature. Only in one of his final scenes, at his 300 party, does Norm actually feel like a real character, which is a fantastic, unexpected, and pleasing surprise. However, it's just barely worth the long wait for about 10 seconds of a good scene.<br/><br/>The Verdict: The film is enjoyable and entertaining, but far from memorable. A couple of flaws seriously detract from it. For a far better film with a similar premise, I recommend Liar Liar.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 6/10"

","I have been wondering what was up with Jim Carrey. Other than 'Horton Hears A Who' I haven't seen much of his recent stuff. With Peyton Reed's 'Yes Man', Carrey returns to comedy. This may not be among Carrey's best or even funniest movies but it draws enough laughter to keep one entertained. The humour isn't too vulgar (for those who easily get offended). Not surprisingly Carrey does a great acting job. It's quite a mature performance when compared to his other comedic characters. He is brilliantly supported by the luminous Zooey Deschanel, Bradley Cooper, a sensual Molly Sims, a charismatic Terence Stamp and a hilariously horny Fionnula Flanagan. The story idea, about a man saying yes to anything, is amusing and well told but at the same time it's very predictable. Another flaw the obvious age difference between Carrey and Deschanel which is pretty huge. Overall, 'Yes Man' is a lighthearted movie. It remains a feel good comedy that one shouldn't mind saying 'Yes' to."

The performances, art direction, cinematography, and perhaps most importantly, the score and soundtrack all threaten at some point or another to overwhelm the viewer but are held nicely in check by restraint on the part of Peyton Reed. Which is somewhat surprising to me, since admittedly, I've watched 'Bring It On'. <br/><br/>In all fairness, 'Yes Man' may at first be categorized as yet another Jim Carrey ego piece, but on closer examination, the message behind the madness proves stronger.

Really, it's an affectionate homage to L.A. culture: the New Age self-help gurus; the exercise/photo group in Griffith Park; the great view of L.A. from the Griffith Observatory's recently completed balcony platform; the Hollywood Bowl dome and amphitheater; the easy mixture with Asian cultures; the small-time alternative rock band with its small local following; the woman with the celebrity cake business; even Carl's (Jim Carrey's) apartment layout with its bland interior courtyard concrete walkway.

","I was very excited to see that Jim Carrey was making a turn to what made him famous...slapstick comedy. Obviously Yes Man looked far more intelligent than, say, Dumb and Dumber or the Ace Ventura films but it still looked like finally he was going to give the comedies that made him bucket loads of cash in the nineties. The obvious comparisons to Liar Liar flowed freely but first of all Liar Liar was one of his last really great, drop dead hilarious comedies so comparisons wouldn't be a bad thing. Secondly after seeing the film it has very, very little actually in common with the film. Yes Man is a little less slap stick and more serious but even still the movie is fun and a throw back to the old Carrey films and just a lot of fun. It's not the perfect comedy but there is certainly nothing wrong with it. The concept has a lot of potential, the idea of a man saying yes to everything automatically makes for a lot of funny moments. Obvious critics will call it stereotypical and predictable and compare it to Liar Liar but the movie really does hold it's own merits.<br/><br/>I have always enjoyed Jim Carrey's films, he's always been crazy and fun and is the master of physical comedy and of course his crazy facial antics. On top of all this we know that Carrey has actual range as an actor. The Number 23, The Truman Show and the under appreciated The Majestic prove that he can act which definitely helps with making a good film. He also has terrific on screen presence. He makes Yes Man a fun and really good watch. Zooey Deschanel plays Carrey's love interest. Deschanel is a little strange as an actress. I'm still trying to forget her deplorable performance in The Happening ((shudder)) but even still her and Carrey don't really jive. I mean they are okay but just not the picture perfect movie couple by any means and she doesn't have a lot of personality for comedy. She worked in Elf because the movie was odd and Will Ferrell is a nut. Terence Stamp is also good in a small cameo role as the leader of the ""Yes"" cult that changes Carrey's character's life.<br/><br/>Yes Man won't throw you back to Carrey's wild antics of yesteryear but it is definitely a worthwhile comedy. Director Peyton Reed is a strong director and has done some good films but nothing really slapstick other than the cult classic Cheerleader comedy (which I secretly enjoy) Bring It On. However I do think this film will help Reed's career for comedies. So all in all Yes Man might not be a billion dollar comedy but for anyone who wants to see a funny little film on a Saturday Night will enjoy Carrey's latest flick. 7.5/10"

","Some people may find out Jim Carrey is not the same as he was a decade ago but I would say the magic is still there! It's something like you've watched it for at least one and half an hour and you're still expecting something more until the credits start rolling. This Jim Carrey show was no different. Total comedy with a little romantic touch at the end.<br/><br/>Now, I would rather prefer not to say anything about the storyline in here, because I believe everybody must laugh at anything Jim Carrey does in this movie without knowing it before. But in a nutshell this movie is about saying ""Yes"" to everything and how everything can fall in place with it (though it's mostly being super lucky!). But again when you ask for laughter/smile/enjoyment for one hour and forty minutes, this movie says the magic ""Yes"" to you.<br/><br/>Finally, it is a preparation of Carrey, with Carrey, by Carrey and so it's a perfect Carrey Curry. All the other characters are nothing compared to his."

","When people make comments like: ""Americans can't even locate themselves on a world map,"" you might think of it as a racist remark. But after 2500 years, Hollywood can't tell the difference between, Persians or Iranians with Arabs. I know you don't care because they're all darn terrorists, right? And it's so amusing to dress an East Indian woman, Anna Khaja, in Arabic Hijab and ask Jim Carrey to locate her on ""persianwifefinder.com"" and name her ""Fernoosh"" who asks for hot sauce with an artificial accent. Just to remind you that Iranians are terrorists, later, Jim is caught by the airport security, because he's been seen with ""Fernoosh"". The movie 300 is on the same boat that animates Persians as blood-thirsty savages who killed for pleasure and it was up to 300 Spartans to protect the world from these beasts so they wouldn't come back again 2500 years later and target Twin Towers with a commercial flight. When did we see Iranian and American commercial flight conflict? Ah, yeah I remember; it was July 4, 1998 that American Navy ""mistook"" a civilian jetliner with a F-14 and shot it down killing all 290 passengers and crew aboard, including 66 children. You didn't hear much about that on CNN, did you? Or perhaps there's not much in history books about Cyrus the Great (a Persian guy) cylinder that was written in 539BC and it has been hailed as the world's first declaration of human rights. Well, for now, the Iranians, Persians are the bad guys so it's OK to dress East Indians, Afghans, Arabs, Kurds, Turks, and pretty much any brown skinned with a funny accent in a movie and make them pay for what Osama did few years back. As an Iranian, I don't have any problem with that¬Öthat's ""how the cookie crumbles"" these days, but for the ones who don't know, please buy a map and find Iran before labeling ""them Iranians"" terrorists."
"moviefreak92","7","0","0","1 January 2009"," It isn't 'Bruce Almighty' but...
","'Yes Man' accomplishes its purpose - to make people laugh without thinking too hard.<br/><br/>Okay, let's face it - this movie isn't going to win any awards. But not all movies have to be Oscar-material. Some films are there just to provide a nice break from all the depressing reality of today's world, and the heavy material of serious films. 'Yes Man' is certainly one of these.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is in his element - his best performance since 'Bruce Almighty,' which has always been my favorite comedy of his. It doesn't top 'Almighty,' but it comes close enough that fans of the older movie can appreciate this one. The major difference between the two (besides, of course, the plot) is that 'BA' had serious undertones and taught a lesson - 'YM' doesn't really attempt anything deep, besides reminding people to live their lives. If you've ever been interested in seeing Carrey play drunk or high off Red Bull, you have found the right film.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast provides great support for Carrey. Zooey Deschanel is charming as Allison, Carrey's love interest. She is a little young for him, but it's possible to get over this as you admire her easy complement to Carrey and her quirky personality. Rhys Darby is hysterical as Carrey's boss/friend. Bradley Cooper as Carrey's best friend and Terence Stamp as the founder of the ""Yes"" program Carrey becomes a part of are also wonderful suppport. The entire cast really did a great job.<br/><br/>I would warn parents not to bring their children. When I went to see it, there were several young children in the theater, and I bet they had no idea what was going on throughout 3/4 of the film. There is a fair amount of swearing, including two ""f---ing."" There is also partial nudity at more than one place, and ample crude humor. Hey - it's a Jim Carrey film. What do you expect? If you don't want to think but want to laugh (a lot), this is a great film to see.<br/><br/>7/10"
"neil-476","7","0","0","1 January 2009"," Fun, but doesn't stretch Carrey
","Jim Carrey's latest vehicle resembles a re-tread of Liar Liar - Carl Allen is an overwhelmingly negative man in a small scale job in a small scale bank: prevailed upon to attend a self-help seminar which induces him into entering a covenant to only say ""Yes"" when asked, he finds his life transformed when the ""Yes"" answers produce good, if unexpected, results, while ""No"" responses produce negatives.<br/><br/>The whole thing falls to pieces, of course, when one considers that running one's life in this way means that one can't say no to things which really demand a No answer (and the lesson Carrey's character ultimately learns is that ""Yes"" actually means ""Yes when ""yes"" makes sense""), but this is of course where much of the humour comes from. While much of this is predictable, there are time when the story runs off in unexpected directions, and there are a number of moments when earlier apparently inconsequential plot points pleasingly pay off later on.<br/><br/>There are no surprises in terms of Carrey's performance - he has been here before, and often. There is relatively little gurning, which is something to be grateful for. Zooey Deschanel reminds us of how cute she is in a performance which goes some way towards making amends for the dreadful turn she delivered in The Happening. Terence Stamp is funny as a surprisingly curmudgeonly self-help guru. And most of the supporting parts are well delivered, especially Rhys Darby as Carrey's aggressively and incompetently social boss.<br/><br/>There is some unnecessary bad language and an oral sex scene which, while quite funny, adds nothing of importance - the film could easily have been trimmed for this and given wider appeal. If you're a Carrey fan you will probably enjoy it - I was amused throughout."
"Grant_Price","4","6","21","16 December 2008"," We all prefer your serious roles, Mr Carrey
","With a Jim Carrey comedy you know what to expect, namely facial expressions and funny noises being emitted from a man who, at forty-six years old, should possibly know better. Yes Man employs these qualities to their fullest extent throughout in a vain attempt to hide the fact that the plot is essentially non-existent and merely consists of a bunch of non sequiturs whose only connection is Captain Malleable doing his magical face changing trick in each of them. But whatever. As long as Carrey is allowed to shout things like ""I've got blisters on my fingers!"" in Ringo Starr's voice, some source of enjoyment can always be gleaned from Yes Man's lifeless, decaying corpse.<br/><br/>The story involves Carrey's protagonist Carl Allen, a banker who lives alone, spends his free time watching endless DVDs, shuns his friends and says no to every offer that comes his way. After attending a self-help seminar, Allen then decides to say yes to every offer that comes his way. Who saw that coming? Even more unbelievably, his saying yes to everything leads to him meeting a girl and they both fall in love. And he gets a promotion. And everybody thinks he's great, even though he's essentially lying to everybody. It's all so fresh. I can only assume the screenwriters took Danny Wallace's original novel, read the synopsis, possibly urinated on it before throwing it in the bin, laughed, and then set about writing their own screenplay based on the last film they'd both recently seen and thought the world needed more of, which was Bruce Almighty. Thanks guys.<br/><br/>The only actor who actually seems like they're having a good time is Rhys Darby, who plays Carl's boss, Norm. Sure, he might be an imitation of David Brent, but considering the screenwriters enjoy reusing ideas so much they managed to weave a whole film out of doing this, at least with Norm they stole an idea which is funny. However, they don't stop there. Later in the film, Norm holds a party which, in its execution is such a blatant rip-off of Rick Moranis' gathering of his neighbours in Ghostbusters that I'm sure Moranis is probably spinning in his grave. If he were dead. Which he isn't. Other than Norm, the only character worth remembering is the love interest, Allison, who isn't memorable because of anything she does (Oh look! She's quirky! Look at her running and photographing! Only Juno is quirkier!), but rather because she's played by Zooey Deschanel, who may or may not be an angel. Any scene she is in goes some way to alleviating the hebetude the film tries so hard to induce, and in particular the ones where she wears the cutest faux-military jacket in the world.<br/><br/>Of course, if you don't happen to like Zooey Deschanel then you're a little stuck. You may take comfort in seeing a 78 year old woman remove her dentures moments before engaging in oral sex with Carrey, which is possibly the highlight of his career after anything else he's ever done, including the Cable Guy. Solace may also be found in an excruciatingly lengthy fight scene between a 'drunk' Carrey (hello silly voice/funny face combination) and a muscle-bound clich√©. Happily, it never seems to end, allowing one pun after another to fall flat on its face while the audience watches on reticently, kind of like slowing down to see a car crash.<br/><br/>In all, Yes Man is only offensive in the sense that it doesn't try at all to create something even slightly original, choosing instead to rely on tried and tested mediocre formulas in order to deliver a mildly amusing diversion for an audience that will forget the film the moment they leave the theatre. So, while Carl Allen would unequivocally say yes to the question, ""Do you want to go and see Yes Man?"", I know that he's really thinking ""No, obviously not."""

","To Dear Mr. Reed, I tried to find a direct connection with you, but it seems it's impossible. So I'm writing my comment on this site, hope you would get it and would understand me. I saw the film in it's first night of screen in Pune. It was great, we laughter from the beginning to the end. Actually, I'm a Persian woman, I didn't understand 3 locations in this film. The problem between US and Iran is between the governments not people. Why did you try to make fun of Iranian people. Have you ever seen a common Iranian girl? Or do you have any idea about Persian culture. You know we are against film 300 because it shows such cultural people as barbarian people. and it's not true, even the history of 300 is not true. This is why Iranian blackballed this film, and you used it twice and its hurt us so much. The film was shown on 11pm and the screen had about, let say 40 people in it, watching movie. half of them where Indian, and the rest were from different regions. We were 4 groups of Iranian sitting and watching the film. Without having such idea that it might make fun of us. I think as a director, perhaps you are familiar with the cultures of the different regions, especially, Iran, which is now, in the central point of attention of all the world. I wish I could have your direct email address to send you some picture of the real and actual view of Iran, Iranian, and Persian culture. Anyway, the film was great, I love Jim Carrey, and again he shows his ability on playing on such character again. You also made the film on the way it should be except those objection of mine which is mine, of course others might not have the same comment. Thank you for your understanding."

Many funny laughing moments they almost have you falling out of your seat. A great little love story behind it makes this comedy not just great for the guys who like laughing but also the woman who like the chick flicks. <br/><br/>I personally would recommend this to many. Just don't take your kids along. Even though it may say PG-13 I don't think I would really want my kids to see a little segment in this film. No nudity of course, but just a little to much for the kids. But the scene will have you laughing and talking about it all night."

","Having just seen this, I can say that this is Jim Carrey at his worst. How he sank to such a low level is beyond me. ""Copper Mountain"" looks like a masterpiece compared to this travesty of a film.<br/><br/>I was lucky I got to see this film for free. I was actually dragged along to it by a friend of mine after he scored some free tickets. I really had no intention of seeing it. I kept thinking, what can possibly be fun about a guy who says ""YES"" to everything for a whole year? My suspicions came true at the conclusion of the film. It is obvious that Carrey is struggling in his career (he hasn't had a solid hit for quite some time) and to me, it seems that he sincerely felt that this film would lift him out of ""Washed Up Beach"". I will admit, there was a few funny lines and moments in this film, but they are few and far between.<br/><br/>As per usual, Carrey uses his rubber-face and physical comedy for laughs, but it has just the opposite effect. It's sad to see a man pushing 50 prancing around with a big grin slapped on his face.<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD - or better yet, wait until it's screened on TV."

","Yes Man is an entertaining movie with a great concept with quality one liners, but lackluster execution. It also has two excellent lead characters thanks to Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel. The problem with Yes Man is that it's a very sloppy movie. There seems to be little basis for a plot, or any direction the movie is supposed to go in general. Some language and scenes were also uncomfortably awkward and unnecessary, only bringing the movie down, leaving a bad aftertaste; Yes Man was clearly borderline rated R.<br/><br/>Anyway, the whole movie itself has sparks of brilliance, but may just be too random and ridiculous for its own good, to the point that when its over, you're not quite sure what you just witnessed. It's kind of like the product of an intelligent, creative student starting on a school project the night before its due; there are sparks of brilliance, but they're negated by its own flaws. Yes Man is a weird movie, and I'm not sure whether that's a good or bad thing.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes were definitely the ones where Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel are just running around together being spontaneously carefree, because these two actors are great; they clearly carry the movie and are the best and only reasons you should say yes to watching Yes Man. For Jim and Zooey, it's worth a rental, and for them alone."

","I was really hoping Jim Carey would knock this one out of the park and have a really good movie. I understand he actually settled for ""points"" and did not get paid any money upfront for this movie - that's risky, and he should fire his manager. The movie has an interesting concept and good message, but it falls flat for so many reasons. The movie was very contrived, lacked originality, and did not know how far to go with the comedy. Things were conveniently happening just to move the story along even though they were lazily thought up and could have been better. The comedy was not screw-ball enough and failed to capitalize on Carey's strong points. I like Jim Carey, but that's just about all this movie has going for it. This movie is definitely not for the analytical type, because your suspension of disbelief required to enjoy a movie like this would not be met."

I went to see this film thinking it would be full of the humour Jim Carey's Liar Liar was full of but it's undoubtedly lacked any funniness or when it did they didn't last for very long.

","Every Jim Carrey movie I watch, I always notice how expressive he is. His expressiveness engages me in a way that no other actor does. Every Zooey Deschanel movie I watch, I fall in love with her. The characters she plays are always very wise and heavenly. Their combo kept me engaged the entire time. All of the other supporting actors were also great. Of course this movie is funny, it has Jim Carrey and a love interest in it. But, it also has a great story and morals.<br/><br/>The message of Yes Man is a great. It's basically to say yes to more opportunities in order to get yourself doing more and living more, but I love the way the message is portrayed. The movie frames it by having Carl, played by Jim Carrey, attend a seminar with a very culty vibe. A speaker leads the seminar and convinces Carl to say yes to literally every opportunity that comes his way. Of course he is hesitant but ends up doing it and it changes his life. Everything that he sees as bad and would normally say no to ends up leading to something great when he says yes. After a while of everything going great from his mindlessly saying yes, there is a turning point where everything falls apart to shambles no matter if he says yes or no. Here he learns that he should not just be saying yes mindlessly and that saying yes to everything was just to open his mind up to the possibilities. Now he must change and only say yes if he truly feels it inside. After realizing that and making the change, he is able to nurse his life back together and return to the path of greatness and happiness that he was once experiencing. The reason that I love this framing is because it gives you a simple rule that will change the way you live your life, but then it makes fun of that rule by attributing it to a cultish seminar. The point is not to just follow a simple rule mindlessly, the point is open yourself up to more possible experiences and the framing in this movie makes that clear.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie whether you are looking for inspiration to live a better life or you just want a fun and satisfying comedy. Definitely one of my favorites in both of those categories."

","I'll be honest; I can massively relate to Jim's character in this movie. I know too well the paralytic inability to let go of the past and come out of an antisocial shell. Or the guilt felt when turning down invitations due to a lack of motivation, watching friends slowly drift away as a result.<br/><br/>In this sense, Yes Man is a really important film. Carl might be a jerk for the first 20 minutes, but it's impossible to not relate or sympathise with him. He is massively understandable even if we don't approve of his behaviour, and many of us might need to watch this movie as a partial reflection on ourselves. His transformation from no-man to a yes-man is actually quite realistic for a rom-com, and the film sends a very important message about missing out on life and not being stuck in a dark hole. I actually felt a motivation to say yes more often, and surely that's a great achievement when a film stays with me in a profound alway after watching.<br/><br/>My main issue with the film are the tropes. Zooey Deschanel didn't really need to be there, and even then, I would've preferred if they stayed broken up. The comedic ""run and get your girl"" scenario is so overplayed and cheesy that it sucked out a lot of my enjoyment for the rest of the film. There are ways to portray the consequences of being a 100% yes man that doesn't involve a boring romance. I'd prefer if Carl, despite having had a setback in his love life, could still move forward with a lesson learned instead of ""winning the girl"". It would be more realistic and also send the message that trying to be positive and open is worth it even when times are tough.<br/><br/>Many American films are scared of having the main character be anything but 100% successful and redeemed. If the number was 80% or so, I would have rated this higher. But still, great message and important for everyone to watch, especially those of us who have a tendency to be 'busy' when out friends call."

Jim Carrey returns to what he does best with Yes Man. Though Yes Man had some moments, I thought most of the movie reminded me a lot of Liar Liar (1997) in terms of the plot outline thus giving it a very derivative feel.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey plays a miserable bank loan officer named Carl Allen who frequently turns down loan applications from clients as well as avoiding his friends Pete (Bradley Cooper) and Rooney (Danny Masterson) whenever they try to invite him out.

He took it very badly and sat in another table. The next afternoon, I gave him the paper, what made me change my mind, he asked me. I thought 'what the hell', what made the goddamn paper so serious anyway. He was pleasantly surprised, 14 years later; the guy is still my best friend, and it was a 'yes' that paved the way to our relationship.<br/><br/>In a similar case, Jim Carrey is Carl, the main protagonist of ""Yes Man"", a man alienated by his perpetually negative outlook on life. He refuses to attend at his friends' parties, he refuses every proposition in his bank loan office job, his 'No' are the convenient escapism to any form of unpredictability that could spice up his life a little bit. Since his divorce, Carl sticks to his habits of loneliness and bitterness, to a point we wonder if we're really watching a comedy. Granted it's only the set-up before the life-changing experience but some parts were surprisingly depressing, and a more restrained Jim Carrey didn't make things better.<br/><br/>His life comes to a miserable dead-end, until he discovers, from an old colleague, a 'Yes!' seminar whose inspirational guru Terrence played by the namesake Stamp, challenges him to say 'yes' to everything during an entire year. Carl accepts and the 'yes' attitude promises a series of funny situations. You guessed it; ""Yes Man"" follows exactly the same pattern as another (and funnier) Jim Carrey movie, named ""Liar, Liar"". Since all the best comedies rely on a promising plot, try to compare the two situations, which is funnier: a lawyer who can't say one lie during one day or an average schmuck saying 'yes' to everything although he can say 'no'.<br/><br/>What made ""Liar, Liar"" so irresistible was that Carrey's character was incapable to say a lie, he was victim of a curse, and one we accept it because 'lying is indeed wrong'. In ""Yes Man"", the eventuality of a curse in underdeveloped but there's no doubt that Carl can say 'no' and in fact, he SHOULD. Ever since he starts his 'yes' attitude, and accepts to take a bum to some place and give him the money he asks, we know there are limits to the positive attitude. And we know it's a matter of time before Carl realizes the limits of saying 'Yes' to everything. Nothing is more unfortunate than a comedy where you're one step ahead of the characters, no matter how sympathetic they are.<br/><br/>The main problem of ""Yes Man"" is to take the (so so) originality of its plot for granted and fill it with comedic archetypes that reduce the talent of Jim Carrey rather than liberate it. When Carl accepts to say 'yes' during the first nights, he ends up stranded in a park, and this is where he meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel), a young (maybe too young) nonconformist artist riding him back on her scooter to the next gas station. Allison is a girl who seizes the day, sings, takes running photographs, enjoys the unpredictability of life, basically, she's a natural 'yes, girl"". Carl follows her by saying 'yes, to everything she does.<br/><br/>Again, we know it's a matter of time before they would start loving each other, and before the 'yes' too many would come. Yet, despite some predictable plot points, Peyton Reed's movie depicts in an enjoyable way the exhilaration of saying 'yes'. Carl bonds his with his friends, his nerdy boss, he takes the courage to jump off a bridge, in the most memorable part of the film (and it's only fitting that Carrey did it himself, embodying the main message of the film). Carl learns guitar, takes flying course, attends Korean lessons, and meets an Iranian girl, the way all of his new lessons converge to an unpredictable and hilarious gag, is one of the film's highlight.<br/><br/>The film also focuses on Carl's profession and it's interesting that his new attitude, allows him to bond with his boss, in another twist reminding of ""Liar, Liar"". By never rejecting the customers, Carrey basically reinvented the micro-loans and earned the company more benefits and a great reputation. Carl's job reveals the film's softer side, and kind of reminds of the James Bailey-figure from ""It's a Wonderful Life"". The part where everyone helps him at the end, provides the obligatory moral that every service is rewarded, and no man a failure who has friends, and a 'yes' can open many friendships.<br/><br/>This is why I started with the story of my best friend and this is why I feel indulgent toward ""Yes Man"" who despite its predictability is redeemed by its positive feeling √† la Frank Capra. I only wished the movie would give more flexibility to Jim Carrey to let him express his usual goofiness. Carrey is such a comedic genius you never get tired of his mimic or clown mannerisms, and ""Yes Man"" is no exception, no matter how funny are some parts plot-wise, they're never as hilarious as when Jim Carrey plays with his face. No one can reach his level of comic, so why preventing us from that, especially since it doesn't even ruin the overall mood of the film? <br/><br/>My comparison with ""Liar, Liar"" wasn't meant to diminish the merit of ""Yes Man"", if not the best, but one of the sweetest Jim Carrey's comedies, but to highlight the level it had to equal: it had the message, it needed the laughs. Yes the message was positive, but predictable. I didn't need it personally, I remember one of my uncle's sayings, which best summarizes the experience of Carl, ""Why say 'no' when you can say 'yes'"". And that's the point, sometimes, you can't say ""yes"", which gives more value to the word."

","An OK comedy/drama<br/><br/>In my opinion, this one was a little disappointing. It had potential to be a hilarious Jim Carrey comedy. Don't get me wrong, because it has a lot of funny moments which makes it worth watching. <br/><br/>The concept is really appealing; a typical ""No-person"" suddenly has to say ""yes"" whenever he gets the opportunity. That leads to a lot of hilarious situations. But on the other hand, I think the drama-part of the plot got a little too much attention. Of course it's okay for a comedy to have some serious elements, and there are a lot of very good drama-comedies out there, but in this one I think it got a little uninteresting at times. <br/><br/>But nevertheless, it's a good comedy, so don't let my negativity keep you from watching it."

","I actually kind of liked Yes Man. For much of the time, I thought I was watching a movie where the plot and the writing for various characters took precedence over the goal of feeding another body to the Carrey-loving piranhas.<br/><br/>It was interesting: It appears that when the plot stopped moving forward, Carrey started becoming his usual buffoon; a kind of cinematic version of nature abhors a vacuum. When the plot again got (sort of) roused from its slumber, the direction of Carrey fell back into the territory where his antics get subsumed under the larger (and surely nobler) goal of delivering an actual story to the viewer.<br/><br/>Carrey is capable of doing fine acting. I want to see a flick where, from start to finish, that's what he does. And, of course, with his clout and cache, he can afford to pick and choose a script and role (and director) that will allow him to do this.<br/><br/>When you discount Carrey's buffoonery, what's left? Unfortunately, a mixed bag. The overall theme is great: Positivity nets you good fortune. I loved that message! The bit of business at the end of the movie--with the love interest, and revisiting the seminar to reconfront the guru--was sort of cool, but seemed to me not to have been written and directed well.<br/><br/>In general I would characterize this as a movie that still relies too much on Carrey's draw, and so thinks it can afford to skimp on the aesthetics.

","In YES MAN, anti-social Carl (Jim Carrey) has been sinking lower into negativity since leaving his girl, Stephanie (Molly Sims), making dumb excuses not to attend any social events with his friends, turning down loan applications at his job, saying 'no' to life in general, spending every night blankly watching DVDs in his apartment. Kinda like you're doing right now...<br/><br/>One day he meets a crazy coot friend (John Michael Higgins), whose life has changed drastically due to his allegiance with a group who say Yes to everything. Carl attends a ""Say Yes"" meeting - overlorded by guru Terrence (Terence Stamp) - and accepts the challenge to Say Yes, to be a Yes Man.<br/><br/>And he finds that saying Yes leads to myriad life-changing possibilities, money, success and, of course, panty, in the form of insipid Zooey Deschanel. (The tryst with his 70-year-old neighbor who insists on ""pleasuring him sexually"" doesn't count! Oh, great gums a-mighty! How that doesn't count!) YES MAN marks Carrey's return to his forte - that plastic, elastic, bombastic spastic who refuses to grow up.<br/><br/>It is obvious which Carrey movie YES MAN resembles - LIAR LIAR (1997), where a birthday wish from his son forced Carrey to Tell the Truth for 24 hours. No such mysticism here, which is this movie's saving grace. Carl's decisions to Say Yes are made under no duress or magic - just a leering curiosity to see where it all leads.<br/><br/>And the explicit message is very succinct - that being positive is better than being negative (just don't tell that to a person with AIDS); that it should not be a compulsion or a rule to Say Yes, but a decision; that it opens up possibilities that might not have been created had you said No. Simple.<br/><br/>A light-hearted film which doesn't even annoy me when Carrey and Deschanel trip through the usual romantic arc of ""boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-makes-assface-of-himself-to-get-girl-back"" which only proves YES MAN advocates the same tired, insidious message of procreation guised as something wondrous and mysterious.<br/><br/>How difficult can it be, Humans?

"Buddy-51","6","1","2","6 May 2009"," generic but enjoyable Carrey vehicle
","Essentially a cock-eyed variation on ""Liar Liar,"" ""Yes Man"" presents Jim Carrey as a bank loan officer who spends most of his off-duty hours actively avoiding social engagements with his friends and co-workers. A ""lonely guy"" by choice, Carl undergoes a life-transforming experience when he attends a self-help seminar dedicated to the proposition that one can get a whole lot more out of life by saying ""yes"" when opportunity comes a-knockin' than by saying ""no."" Soon, Carl is agreeing to virtually every offer that comes his way, often to surprising and hilarious results.<br/><br/>As a generally generic Carrey vehicle, ""Yes Man"" doesn't provide much in the way of a thespian stretch for the actor, who could toss one of these roles off in his sleep if he wanted to. On the positive side, the movie feels less contrived than some of his previous efforts, thanks to the fact that it doesn't rely on some cheap gimmick like a magic spell or a knock on the head to get the plot rolling. The decision to become compulsively agreeable remains an act of volition on the part of the character, thus making the tale more relatable and grounded in the long run. Nobody is better than Carrey when it comes to over-the-top mugging and he is frequently in prime form here. Moreover, there are quite a few genuine belly laughs that are alone worth the price of admission (with a randy encounter between Carl and his aged landlady achieving the movie's high point of hilarity).<br/><br/>On the downside, ""Yes Man"" does have a whiff of d√©j√† vu about it that it is never entirely able to shake. Moreover, there is a certain threadbare quality that is almost inevitable when a movie's premise is built, as this one is, on the repetition of a single note. And there are some definite dull patches when the comic ideas seem to be withering on the vine. The compensation, beyond Carrey of course, comes in the form of two noteworthy supporting players: the likable Bradley Cooper as Carl's best buddy, and the winsome and charming Zooey Deschanel as the slightly offbeat motorcycle-riding band singer Carl meets and falls in love with during the course of the story."

","Based on the non-fiction book by British TV presenter and journalist Danny Wallace (who I have seen on 8 Out of 10 Cats), this film has an intriguing concept. Basically Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a divorced man who spends most of his time working as a bank loan approval officer, supervised by immature manager Norman (New Zealander comedian Rhys Darby, who I've seen in The 100 Greatest Cartoons), staying at home lonely watching movies, and declining many proposals. After forgetting the engagement party for his friend Peter (Bradley Cooper), Carl is convinced by friend Nick (John Michael Higgins) to go to a motivational ""Yes!"" seminar, where inspirational guru Terrence Bundley (Priscilla, Queen of the Desert's Terence Stamp) teaches people to say ""yes"" to everything and start living. So from then on, Carl promises himself to say ""yes"" to every question, request, proposal and opportunity given to him. It starts off very promisingly, Carl doing things he wouldn't normally do, he finds positive things happening to him, having his own adventures, saving the life of a jumper (Snake Eyes' Luis Guzm√°n), getting a promotion, meeting the opposite to him, Allison (Elf's Zooey Deschanel), and ultimately getting a better perspective on life. Antics Carl gets up to include finding a Persian wife, learning Korean, learning to play the guitar, flying lessons, bungee jumping, and of course, attending the club, where he finds Allison again, and they get much closer. There is the point when Carl's recent activities are questioned by the authorities, and with Peter he forced to explain the reason behind his actions, and Allison assumes he did many things, saying ""yes, despite no true desire, including hesitating before agreeing to move in with her, angry she leaves him. In the end, Terrence confirms to him that he doesn't have to say ""yes"" to absolutely everything, Carl says ""no"" to Allison's earlier question to moving in, admitting it is a big commitment, he asks her to give him another chance, she says ""maybe"", he says that this is good enough and they kiss to make a happy ending. Also starring Sasha Alexander as Lucy Barnes, Patrick Labyorteaux as Marv Winchell, Fionnula Flanagan as Tillie and Spencer Garrett as Multack, and look out for Danny Wallace himself as a man at the bar at the wedding shower. Carrey does not overshadow his performance with his usual slapstick humour, he makes a likable character, as does Deschanel being a little bit kooky but lovely, Darby does steal a few of his scenes, the script does have its slight predictability with the romantic plot, but you cannot deny it is an interesting concept with some original ideas thrown in, and it does make you laugh and warmhearted at the right moments, a worthwhile comedy.

Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel played their parts well making an enjoyable watch. However the biggest laughs for me came from Rhys Darby who really makes this film and delivered the best quote of the film, ""I was just going to fist you too"", was textbook! <br/><br/>Overall I would describe Yes Man as 'Liar Liar meets Bruce Almighty', and as a tip I wouldn't say it isn't critical to see this at the cinema. Unless of course you want to see Jim Carreys 46 year old face up close and personal."
"stuka24","8","1","2","13 January 2009"," Darn good motivational comedy, yes!
","I went to this film dreading the worst, and came out yes, saying ""yes"" quite a bit more often. Bearing in mind the ""meaning"" of it, not saying a monosyllable, and taking it all with a pinch of salt (like the self-help guru Terrence Bundley teaches our man in the hospital), this movie is fun, well made, and doesn't pretend deep meaningful questions. Popcorn movie? Yes, but good one! Only once did I feel I was into another formulaic trap. In my case, it was when Carl was riding the super motorcycle. It felt like The Mirror Has Two Faces (Streisand's), which was copied in (among others), ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"", etc.<br/><br/>Moving to the stuff of life: I love Zooey Deschanel's Allison! Of course, I don't know if I'd stand anything like her in real life, but isn't she lovely as a woman living by her own rules, not wanting to be stereotyped ""I've got fears, too!"" near the end, and yes, charmingly out of tune with reality :)? I feel the part suits her perfectly. Unlike another try of Carrey to play something sort of serious: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's Kate Winslet, who's just crass, and totally... uninviting :).<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper and his other sex addicted friend are fine, the scenes with the old lady are a bit too much to, well, swallow, and <br/><br/>Rhys Darby is great. I didn't know the actor, but playing a perfect goof takes guts! I felt pity for old Norman, which is good in such an ""optimistic"" film. Molly Sims is cool as a stupid gorgeous materialistic woman. John Cothran Jr.'s voice is good for a boss. I am having nightmares with it :). The joke on cops being paranoid about yes, ""suspiciously chosen activities"" ""Who goes on holidays to Lincoln, Nebraska"" :)? is fun, if a bit stereotyped Hollywood ""liberalism"" as Americans like to misname it.<br/><br/>I agree with IDMB's reviewer bopdog from Cardiff, Wales about a) the film being uplifting b) Carrey becoming ""a bit more human, and a bit more approachable"".

","When was the last time Jim Carrey was really funny? Yep, that would be back in 2004, when he delivered a double mixture of creepy (Lemony Snicket) and touching (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, his best role to date), both paired with his natural comedic talent, which was significantly watered down in the disappointing Fun With Dick & Jane and consistently missing in the excessively weird The Number 23. Yes Man is the perfect antidote, then: a typical Carrey comedy, where the gags abound and the soul department is a little empty. Not that we're gonna complain that much - it's just that the source material indicated the film could have been a little more... you know.<br/><br/>The material in question is Danny Wallace's eponymous autobiographical book, in which he recounts what happened to him after he attended a ""Yes Men"" seminar and vowed to say ""yes"" for six months. In the movie, the action is moved from England to Los Angeles, and Wallace is replaced by Carl Allen (Carrey), a bank employee who hasn't had a real life since his marriage ended. Instead of hanging out with his friends (Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson, both criminally underused) or helping his neighbors, he spends his days working or renting movies he subsequently disses during the viewing. Everything changes when an old friend invites him to a ""Yes"" convention where the British host (Terence Stamp, who else?) advises him to greet every offer that crosses his path with the same answer. Any need to guess which that is?<br/><br/>From then on, it's just like Liar, Liar or Bruce Almighty: a torrent of gags which stem from the absurd (yet undeniably plausible) premise. The jokes range from predictable (Carl replying to spam messages) to somewhat original (Carl learning Korean) to quite outlandish (Carl preventing a man from committing suicide in a most unusual way; Wallace has pointed out this never happened to him, by the way). Throw in a sweet, enthralling romance with free spirit Allison (the always charming Zooey Deschanel), and you've got a comedy that ticks practically every box. The most important, of course, is the one concerning Carrey, who mixes full-on comedy and heartfelt seriousness with the ease one could expect after his marvelous turns in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine. Too bad he's also stuck with a director who can't give the serious bits the dignity they crave (but hey, what can you demand from the guy who did Bring It On?). And that's without mentioning the obvious contrivance that is used to get to the third act.<br/><br/>Still, Yes Man has enough ingredients to make for a nice, though not entirely satisfying viewing: there's a relatively good central idea, Deschanel and Stamp in supporting roles and Carrey going ballistic. Would die-hard fans of the comedian really ask for more?"

","I reluctantly went to see Yes Man, imagining - like many others - a bad remake of Carreys' earlier movie Liar Liar. I was surprised that it wasn't, and frankly relieved that it actually was a nice story with some good laughs in it. I would recommend Yes Man to anyone seeking a good laugh and a smile when walking away. It is a Hollywood movie though, so don't expect too deep a storyline (it's a comedy, laugh ;=). The ad placements were at times also over the top. I know it makes the movie cheaper to produce, but why not fake the brands ?<br/><br/>But apart from those two, that still makes this movie a ***1/2 out of 5 stars."

","To me, Jim Carrey has never been as funny as Drew Carey used to be on television. In this movie he is OK. The film starts a little slowly as Jim is Mr. No. Then he meets a friend of his who talks him into going to a yes lecture. There he gets worked over almost literally by Terrence Stamp. <br/><br/>After the life change, he tries yes and at first it does not go well. Then his luck changes when he meets a short brunette with a scooter. This is where the film starts to improve. It is a simplistic plot but when you compare putting away your brain on this to enjoy a good laugh versus the Cruise Fiction & Non-Fiction Valkerie, this film looks like a work of art.<br/><br/>The film has a good supporting cast and from what I have looked at of other reviews, a lot of folks didn't see the end of the movie. The film has a strong classic ending which makes you laugh or smile when the credits role. I will not spoil the ending, but if you do not see it, you might feel ripped off. <br/><br/>There is a hidden deeper sense of fate in the film. Once he changes from no to yes, every time he says no, fate seems to punish him. While the humor is a little off the wall, the encounter with the shelves and the elderly lady neighbor has a great comedic touch that has nothing to do with Carey. It has everything to do with the meaning of her false teeth in the glass. <br/><br/>While not an absolutely great film, it is better than mediocre and there were lots of films in 2008 which were."

","Yes Man is Jim Carrey's latest comedy, and I have got to admit I was not too terribly excited before viewing this film, but upon seeing it I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Yes Man's premise is simple and direct. Jim Carrey's character basically attends a self help seminar that teaches its participants to say Yes to everything in life. As Carrey begins to do just that it leads to many funny and endearing sequences, resulting in him not only learning to live life, but also finding love as well.<br/><br/>Yes Man was a truly terrific time at the movies and was quite possibly my favorite comedy I have seen in sometime. Jim Carrey was as usual terrific in this film, but the other supporting players, such as Zooey Deschanel, were excellent as well. Thanks to the film's terrific cast the laughs continued to come. My only minor problem was that the film is very slow to the start, it takes nearly 15-20 minutes for it to really have its first good laugh, but once you reach that point the laughs do not stop till the credits roll. Putting it simply, if you are a fan of Jim Carrey's other comedies such as Bruce Almighty and Liar, Liar, you will feel at home here and love this film.<br/><br/>I give Yes Man a hilarious 9 out of 10!"

","If you are a fan of Jim Carrey, Yes Man for sure does not disappoint you, specially with his antics, but though, he does look a little older than usual!! His wrinkles on his face are quiet evident in the movie, not only at the time of him smiling, otherwise too!! The philosophy of the movie, where you should always say Yes, and if you say NO, you are losing on to life!! I so love the philosophy, just yes to what ever comes your way, with out pausing for a second to understand how the whole will repercussions on you. Yeah, it is only possible in movies, though!! There all the instances in the movie where Carl (Jim Carrey) just keeps on refusing to everything that comes his way. His ex-girlfriend, growth in his career, invitation to costume parties, and all other fun activities. Until, he he goes and attends this symposium of ""yes"" and always saying to Yes, and if there is a no, then there will be ""bad things"" happening to him.<br/><br/>From the philosophy to getting a girlfriend, to having being promoted - even jumping the position of his own boss, bungee jumping, helping the neighbour (watch out for this one), attending costume parties, basically enjoying life.<br/><br/>One of my favourite scenes in the movie, is when he is riding the Ducati to meet with his girlfriend and explain her things as to how it went. Why he had to say, yes, when he actually wanted to say yes? Confusing, watch the movie, if you like Jim Carrey, for sure not a disappointment! Rhys Darby reminded of Nigel from So you think you can dance? A very strong resemblance, probably was the character!!"

Great premise, pretty well acted out, produces an uplifting film. Differs quite a lot from the book, so you can see the film and read the book and enjoy both. The plot isn't too original but the individual episodes are fun to guess about. Watch this if you liked Bruce Almighty ... and stay around for an extra clip during the credits.

Loved him in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Never even bothered with 23. The concept of YES MAN is similar to Liar, Liar but without the constraints that his character had in that movie (which consequently made the humor easier to come by BECAUSE of that) Without a long rant, rave, or negative review....it simply was not that funny. It had funny moments... but with Jim, is that what any of us would really expect? Oddly I do not blame him for this. Hollywood, Jim's agent, whomever....needs to really get a great comedic script that allows Jim to be over-the- top again...something with a great concept or culturally relevant for this time...cause God knows we need at this very time some ""bust at the gut"" laughter. I SOOOOO, wanted this to be good. For Jim to make me laugh to the point where I wasn't worried or thinking about the economy, or jobs, or war. I can't believe there is no script clever enough to let this talented man demonstrate how bloody funny he can be.

","To put it brief and informative, I'd say ""Yes Man"" is a movie of delightful comedy where there are hardly moments in the film where you aren't laughing. The movie was original or a better word for it would be unpredictable, where humour appears in the most unexpected way. Unlike his earlier comical movies like Bruce Almighty, Ace Ventura and Liar Liar, there is a hint of truth and reality in the storyline where he isn't invincible or abnormal but an average and lethargic pessimist influenced to say yes to anything. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, you'll definitely enjoy it if you're a fan of Jim Carrey, and he excels in this role just as he did in the other ones."

Your entire family could enjoy a good comedy skit or movie together. Today these comedian-wannabes don't know how to make a person laugh without including trash in their routine. The true comedians of Jerry Lewis's era didn't use profanity, make useless sex jokes, jab at public officials in order to put them down and make them look stupid in public. Don Rickles always made sure if he picked on anyone they could walk away feeling good about themselves and not be offended. All those comedians - Lewis, Rickles, Hope, Kaye, Benny, Martin, Skelton, etc - they didn't use trash talk comedians use today. Any of today's comedians who say they learned from the masters are lying. Comedians today inject their personal religious beliefs or personal political left-wing beliefs in their routine forcing paying customers to listen to them when it's no one else's business what the comedian believes or thinks. Jim Carrey made about 5 or 6 movies I liked and have. This movie ""Yes Man"" turned me completely against Jim Carrey because of the scene where a grandmother gave him a blow job. You didn't see the act but you knew what was going on. That was disgusting. Sorry Jim Carrey but you are not funny anymore and not worth the price of a ticket to see any of your trash!

There were funny parts and there were over-the-top parts that didn't turn out too funny. I have a problem with casting Zooey Deschanel as his love interest, not because I don't like her (love ""New Girl"") but because I think she's half his age (at least in looks). I guess that makes me old as I'm now bothered by that timeless Hollywood caveat. Actually, most of the supporting cast (Bradley Cooper, Danny Masterson, Molly Sims) is at least a decade younger than Carrey. For me, it just stole all the realism out of a Jim Carrey comedy..."

","Yes Man is a fun experience. Yes it is clich√©d, and yes it doesn't stray from the tried and true comedy film formula, but it is a very enjoyable film. The film's story is almost identical to Liar Liar but sees Carrey agreeing instead of being honest, and in many ways it plays like what would happen if you swapped the running order of the first and second acts of Bruce Almighty.<br/><br/>But with Jim Carrey both at his craziest and also most sincere it is difficult to not have fun watching this movie. And when combined with the natural quirky charm of Zooey Deschanel the random adventures are infectious in their own way. The moral compass of the story is provided by Bradley Cooper who plays the best friend Peter, it is far from a show-stealing role but Cooper does his best with the part and gets a few good comedy moments too. Terence Stamp's cameo role as the leader of the Yes cult is enjoyable but slightly awkward at times. The real revelation is Rhys Darby, who plays Carl's boss Norman, and is hilarious in almost everything he does.<br/><br/>The premise of a man saying yes to everything is an interesting one, and it tells a good moral story about why people should always keep an open mind, but the most intriguing part of the premise is the fact that this is a real life story written by comedian Danny Wallace (who makes a cameo appearance in the bar towards the end) after he was did the 'Yes Man' for six months in real life.<br/><br/>Even in a film that requires a fair amount of suspension of disbelief there is one thing that really stands out as strange, and that is Peter telling the police about the Yes agreement in front of Allison. It is far from how a lawyer would do it, and feels like a forced way to present the films dilemma for Carl to overcome and win his love back."
"fedor8","Null","1","3","25 March 2010"," Saying ""yes"" to this script was the second dumbest thing Carrey ever did - after dating Courtney Love.
","Is this a script even Adam Sandler had previously rejected? ""Sorry, guys, but it's too dumb, even for me."" Why do those cheesy ""feelgood comedies"" from Hollywood always make me feel crap? If Jim Carrey continues like this, he will soon be eligible for the Steve Martin & Bill Murray No-Longer-Funny-Comedians Graveyard.<br/><br/>Just like modern horror films cannot exist without at least two pairs of dumb/horny teens (waiting to be butchered), recent comedies cannot possibly be made without being romantic comedies. This pandering to the female audiences is ruining even potentially good comedies. Fortunately, that's where the good news come in: YM isn't one of them, i.e. the film had so little potential anyway, nothing much had been ruined by injecting into it predictable formulaic she-loves-me-she-loves-me-not schmaltz.<br/><br/>YM has one of the most cretinous premises of all time. It's cretinously far-fetched even by 21st-century's low Hollywood standards. Saying ""yes"" to everything results in predictable plot-twists, yet nothing can compare in predictability than the basic clich√© ingredients of practically every single romantic comedy: <br/><br/>1) If the couple hooks up half-way through the film, this means that they have to split up at some point half-an-hour before the movie ends so that the film's ""mega-highlight"" can consist of the pair hooking up again, and living happily ever after. Women, get those handkerchiefs out, for the romantic comedy's obligatory dull she-loves-me-after-all ending requires of you to be moved emotionally.<br/><br/>2) Make the lead couple split up because one of them (usually the female) gets angry due to some totally silly trifle of a non-reason: Deschanel dumps Carrey for a reason so non-existent that even the script's writer probably doesn't quite understand her motives. ""You kept saying 'yes' to everything, Carl, so how do I know you really love me! You hesitated AN ENTIRE SECOND when I asked you to move in with me! Boo-hoo-hoo!"" Idiotic.<br/><br/>3) End the 100-minute romantic-comedy drudgery with a foreseeable action scene. Pointless action scenes are easy to write, and don't require any gags. They are a great way to round off the pointlessness of everything that preceded it. ""Here you go, viewers: after 100 minutes of 5 funny gags, 500 misfired ones, and several tedious ""romantic"" I-love-you scenes, we present to you a nice little action scene to wake you up - or put you into even deeper slumber."" <br/><br/>The movie did, however, elicit a big, loud laugh from me at the very end, when the end-credits said: ""YM was based on a book"". I just thought it was hilarious that someone actually wrote an entire novel with this Z-grade bubble-gum concept. Was it a children's book then?"
"ARTaylor","6","1","3","11 January 2009"," Carrey's Simply Too Old For These Kind Of Movies
","Jim Carrey is not the man he was. He can't do the Ace Ventura, Dumb and Dumber, or Liar Liar anymore. You can see it in his wrinkled face. He's a great actor, funny and charismatic (and the one and only good point of Batman Forever). But he can't do the same movies forever. Even Tom Hanks moved on from these kind of goofy comedies.<br/><br/>Carrey does not fit in with this cast. Everyone seems to be in their late 20s early 30s, and most of the actors are. Carrey looks, and is, past middle age. Yet he's trying to fit in with these people. They say he's been working at the bank for five years, but what has he been doing the rest of his forty years? The whole thing reminded me of that episode of Friends where Bruce Willis dated Rachel, but at least they they acknowledged the age discrepancy played on the idea that Willis was older. This movie keeps trying to pretend that Carrey is a thirty-something again. He's not. He's almost fifty. He should be moving on to more mature characters, something like Truman Show.<br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel and Carrey simply don't click. There's no on-screen connection between the two. Maybe it's because Carrey is exactly eighteen years older than her (both born on January 17 but Jim in '62 and Zooey in '80). But it's probably because director Peyton Reed doesn't have the experience for that kind of thing.<br/><br/>Maybe they should have gotten a younger actor for Carl. Maybe they should have gotten older actors for everyone else and made it a City Slicker-esquire mid-life crisis movie.<br/><br/>Carrey's age is not the only problem. It seems a bit random, like they just threw in a bunch of gags together and tied it with this ""just say yes"" gag. Some of the ""yes"" gags don't pay off. At some points it seems like they created a situation that didn't fit the story at all but would pay off some gag. It doesn't seem very thought out. The side characters are underdeveloped and rather one dimensional. There's no side stories so the movie relies entirely on the one seemingly unplanned plot line.<br/><br/>Not that it was a bad movie. It was funny, with plenty of laugh out loud moments. Zooey is cute in every role she plays. I've never seen Terence Stamp do anything less than a superb job. His part is short but sweet. Although Carrey should not be doing these roles, he does have fun with it. Giving it the full nine yards as he always does.<br/><br/>In the end it's just a poor man's Liar Liar. It has Carrey. It has a very similar plot. It has most of the gags. It just didn't have the wit. Carrey fans will probably find something to enjoy being reminded of his older, better films. But I can't really recommend it for many others."

For example, there is one barely disguised oral sex scene, comments about masturbation and liberally-peppered crude language. Now, I'd have less of a problem watching this film if it had a higher age rating. At least I'd know what to expect, but even my 13-year old boy was looking distinctly uncomfortable throughout.

","Carl is a loner who never wants to do anything with anyone. This includes his best friend who is about to get married. After missing a few important dates in his friends life and having a bizarre dream about being dead and nobody caring, he decides to attend a YES MAN seminar. He is challenged to say YES to EVERYTHING, or else bad things will happen to him.<br/><br/>This kind of sound like Liar Liar and that is the film most people will be comparing it to, even though both of them are almost completely different. The only similarity is that the main character HAS to do something. One is to tell the truth, the other is to say yes. Well, the similarities stop there. I want to say that this film is funny, and I will, but it wasn't funny enough. I got a few chuckles here and there but not one scene stands out in my mind as the funniest or the most memorable. Which is a bad thing for a comedy.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey does his usual and brings the funny faces and physical comedy. At some points it seems unnecessary and forced, like when he is having a weird face making competition with his boss. At other times, it just simply works cause it's Jim Carrey and he's being doing it for years. As Carl, who is played by Carrey, soon finds out that saying yes leads to good things in his life, he embraces the idea. Unfortunately that idea is never fully realized and we never really see where this could take us. It felt like they were playing it safe this time, which is really odd considering the amount of adult material in here.<br/><br/>There are a few swear words, I remember hearing the F-BOMB a few times, which surprised me. Also there is a scene in which my girlfriend found completely gross and it involves an elderly lady taking out her teeth to 'perform' on Carl. The scene is used to show that when he says NO, bad things happen to him, but at the same time it seems completely like it should belong in another film.<br/><br/>Everything you see in the trailer is pretty much what he says yes to. The Korean, the guitar lessons, the plane lessons. There are only a few that you don't know about but they aren't that funny. Driving a homeless man home is one of them and it never got a laugh from me.<br/><br/>The supporting cast helps the film immensely. Zooey Deschanel is wonderful as always. I find her always to be charming and cute with a funny side. Carl's boss and new friend due to him having to say yes to everything is Rhys Darby. People may recognize him from the TV show Flight of the Conchords as the band manager. He steals the show in every scene and is far more funny then Jim Carrey. It's a shame because I always liked Jim Carrey. It seems that the older comedians are losing it while the newer ones seem fresh and hot. Terence Stamp has three scenes in the film, two of which are at the seminars. He doesn't really add too much to the film and the role could have been played by anyone.<br/><br/>The film is indeed a romantic comedy, so I warn you. Be prepared for every romantic comedy clich√©. This one has them. Boy meets girl, loses girl and races against time to win her back. What makes it not really work is that I can't see Deschanel really hooking up with Carrey. It must be the age gap. Even though these two work well together, I just can't see them romantically involved. Maybe best friends would work better.<br/><br/>I wanted more from Yes Man, it could have really done some funny things with it's premise but it plays it safe. I do find the film to be one of Carrey's better ones of late. Fun with Dick & Jane was horrible and let's not even mention The Number 23. Yes Man is a film you want to be able to laugh constantly at, but will only find yourself laughing every now and again. I recommend Yes Man as a rental and nothing to rush to see."

","I hate to give the movie 1 out of 10, but it has severe issues that are simply unforgivable.<br/><br/>First of all, this film, made in 2008, attempts to laugh off sexual assault! When Jim Carey's character is in the bar he forcibly kisses a woman passing by him and we, the viewers, are supposed to forgive this because he makes some bad joke about how every girl deserves to go to a ball blah blah blah - no, it's nonconsensual SEXUAL ASSAULT. It doesn't matter what she says afterwards. It doesn't matter how many jokes Carey's character tells. He kissed a girl who didn't consent. Period.<br/><br/>As though this wasn't bad enough (and for me it was fatal to the movie), he afterwards gets into a fight with her boyfriend and ends up punching a random stranger in the face. That's ordinary criminal assault. The guy who got punched could have had him charged for that and for some bizarre reason doesn't press charges. Indeed, things continue on in their illogical way. After he hands out loans to every person who comes by his desk (thus defrauding the bank he works for) he gets promoted because it apparently was profitable. In real life he'd be sent to prison for a lengthy period of time, not least because he gives loans to personal friends - which is criminal behavior.<br/><br/>He goes out with an Iranian woman so that the movie can make fun of Persians. He takes Korean classes so that the movie can make fun of Koreans. His boss is an Australian weirdo so that the movie can make fun of Australians.

","Oh gosh this is hilarious. Jim Carrey is at his comedic best, while managing to not be too comedic. He finds the perfect balance between OTT funny and relatable funny, and this is easily one of his best films.<br/><br/>The characters are all hilarious, and I was surprised to see John Michael Higgins in this. He's a horribly underrated character actor, and he was pretty funny. Carrey is obviously the best and is just hysterical. Rhys Darby is also too funny as Norman. The movie has a lot of weird comedy moments as is typical of a Carrey film, with just as much unsubtle comedy as subtle.<br/><br/>The premise is pretty great. It promises a funny film, and delivers.

","At its barest bones this is a movie about saying 'Yes' to life and all the joys it has to bring. An unhappy man played by Jim Carey gets roped into one of those personal seminars where he is asked to start saying ""yes"" to everything instead of 'No"" which he has been doing as of late to the extent that even his best friend is about to cut him off. By saying Yes his life suddenly starts to genuinely improve and he even meets a girl but then just as suddenly his life spins out of control. Like everything else even saying Yes to life needs to be done in moderation. The movie is fun, funny, and heartwarming at times but it is also a little silly so I am giving it a 7.

","Yes Man is the last Jim Carrey movie that I feel was really funny. This was the last one that had a great plot to make it an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Carrey plays a man name Carl, who works at a bank and is having trouble saying yes to a lot of things and people. He then joins a seminar that makes him say yes a lot, and he feels this has changed his life. He also meets a beautiful woman, Allison (played by Zooey Deschanel) and they form a relationship. However, later on, things take a turn for the worst as Carl realizes saying yes to particular things get him into trouble.<br/><br/>The film's plot (like a lot of people say) is kind of similar to Liar Liar. Liar Liar deals with a guy having trouble being honest and that changes through a son's birthday wish, while this deals with a guy having trouble saying yes and that changes through a seminar. Although the plot is similar and not too original, I still really enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey manages to be funny and had a great performance with Zooey Deschanel, and the pacing for this movie was pretty fast. It wasn't too boring at all.<br/><br/>If the plot would of been a little bit more original, than this film would have been a lot better. But, I will say, Yes Man is a great Jim Carrey film to watch for very good laughs and to see Carrey one last time be truly funny and truly rememberable.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite comedy movies of 2008 and it's my 3rd favorite Jim Carrey of all time.

","Yes Man (2008): Dir: Payton Reed / Cast: Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel, Terence Stamp, Bradley Cooper, Danny Masterson: Yes, they screwed up this comedy about opportunities. It stars Jim Carrey as a divorc√©e who tries to avoid people until he is enrolled in a program that focuses in changing our attitudes towards better change. Starts out well until becoming routine and predictable. Directed by Payton Reed who made the wonderfully clever and underrated Down With Love as well as the low grade romantic dud The Break-Up. Here he surpasses The Break-Up but comes nowhere near the perfection of his Renee Zellweger effort. Carrey does his best as a guy who gave up on life only to find it again. He has his ups and downs in massive and sometimes comic overload but he holds the film together where everything else falls apart. Zooey Deschanel plays a singer he encounters but despite her efforts, the role is cardboard. Terence Stamp as the guy whom Carrey seeks with regards to this life change is an embarrassment and beneath Stamp's talent. Bradley Cooper appears as one of Carrey's few friends whom he ticks off. The film is well made from a technical stand point with an interesting point of view but its delivery is far from approving. Despite a message about living life and embracing opportunities the film only seems eager to present humour that most people should say, ""no"" too. Score: 5 ¬Ω / 10"

","Yes! You live your life! That is what this movie is about. If you are already doing it, then you really know your own way to be happy. But there are some people who struggle to find their own freedom, and lock themselves up in prison called Eyes of Society. I am going to give them an inkling that might set themselves free. This is story of Carl who has been living in boredom. He has a negative look on his life, but becoming a ""Yes Man"" changes his life completely. Famous comedy actor Jim Carry played Carl, and he was flawless in the film.<br/><br/>Someone like me will have sympathy for Carl because Carl is mirror image of me. Carl has a simple life(such as working every week, buying food, and watching TV then going to bed). Doing the same thing day in, day out gives him ennui. I feel for him. After watching how Carl's life changes I felt the urge to do things that I had in my mind for a long time. Such things like learning how to play piano, taking an acting class, and participating in a tango club on weekend make me feel alive, and satisfied. Money can not buy me these emotions because it never did and never will.<br/><br/>I want you to look Carl carefully, and hope that you would feel the same way that I did. If some of you are experiencing this, then I highly recommend you to see this film. If I do something that I want, I always consider what other people might think of me, because I care so much about how people see me. I have been hiding my interests from everyone around me. Apparently I wanted to be a good person. Unfortunately the more I tried, the less I felt happy or satisfied. Carl may have the answer for you, just like he gave it to me."

But what you can take away from this movie is the thought of saying ''yes'', when you really don't know what to do, maybe yes or maybe no, made me think about all the opportunities and fun memories i could have had if i said ''yes'' one of those times someone called me or offered me something.

The film features Jim Carrey's character, Karl, going to bars and clubs where everyone is far younger than him. He kisses a young woman, probably 30 years younger than him in a bar at one point and gets into a bar fight. The most disturbing part, which is most of the movie, is his relationship with Zooey Deschanel. Jim Carrey is an accomplished actor, a talented and funny guy.

"hall895","6","0","1","11 May 2012"," Good enough to say yes to
","Yes Man is a movie which can both entertain and surprise you. It's a Jim Carrey comedy so we know what that entails right? Carrey going way over the top, exaggerated physical antics, the rubber face stretching in every conceivable direction. Anything for a laugh, that's a Jim Carrey movie. Except it's not this Jim Carrey movie. Carrey reins himself in a bit. This is less a Jim Carrey movie and more a breezy romantic comedy which happens to star Jim Carrey. Even with a premise, a character who has to say yes to everything, which seems to set the movie up for all kinds of outrageous, and likely juvenile, shenanigans the movie doesn't go in that direction. OK, there's one unfortunate incident with an old lady. But other than that Carrey's character is saying yes to more mundane things. He says yes to guitar lessons and Korean language classes. Nothing uproariously funny there but things which will pay themselves off in smart ways later. That's what this movie is. Nothing to make you bust a gut laughing but enough to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>On the surface the plot seems to harken back to Carrey's Liar Liar but the movie and Carrey himself don't go to the extremes we saw in that one. This time there's nothing magical or mystical going on as with the man who absolutely could not tell a lie. Carrey plays bank loan officer Carl who has lost in the game of love and retreated into his own little shell. He says no to everything. He says no to life itself. Until a friend drags him to a seminar run by some weirdo guru-type who preaches the power of saying Yes! Carl vows to begin saying yes to everything. Here you expect the movie to start its inevitable flight off the deep end. But no. Carl's first chance to say yes sees him giving a homeless man a ride. This leads him to a meeting with the exceedingly quirky, scooter-riding Allison, played by Zooey Deschanel. Will Carl say yes to falling in love with Allison. Uh, didn't I just mention Allison is played by Zooey Deschanel? Duh, you don't have to have a yes-saying covenant to fall in love with her. From there it's a pretty formulaic romantic comedy. The movie's got enough humor and, helped immeasurably by the wondrous Deschanel, plenty of charm. The jokes and gags aren't huge, certainly not as outrageous as you'd expect in a Carrey comedy, but the more subtle humor works well for this movie. You're not just waiting for the next big Carrey explosion, this movie actually gives you reason to care about its story and its characters. Carrey and Deschanel have great chemistry and it is oh so easy to root for the Carl and Allison relationship to succeed. As in any rom-com there will be complications in the relationship. But there's never really any great drama, no real doubts as to how the story will turn out. But even if the ending has a tinge of inevitability to it the movie has a good time getting there. Not a great comedy but a good one. Pleasant and charming, likely to bring a smile to the face. A more relaxed, restrained Jim Carrey can still be funny. And Zooey Deschanel can be whatever she wants to be, she's that good. Pair them up and you have a movie worth saying yes to."

","Can you reinvent yourself by saying ""Yes"" instead of ""No""? The movie does not provide a good answer to that interesting question. Most of the time, saying Yes just leads to extreme and nihilistic situations. Would you drive a homeless man at night to his wooden refuge? Why not? Would you give him money? Why not? Would you drive a scooter with a lovely girl? Why not again? With so many opportunities and trusting friends, one can wonder what he (Jim Carrey) was waiting for. Some situations are really charming and insightful, like choosing the first airplane departing the airport. The problem is that leading a life like this is like trying to steer a whirlwind in the proper direction. What is the future of a relationship based on experiencing things, which normally would not happen? Is it possible day after day to do that without exactly leading a very boring life? It is interesting to note that a real engagement, and Jim Carrey is using the word ""Covenant"" in the movie, is a matter of trust and enlightenment. I am personally convinced that being open to life is paramount, but the movie is not about that ""√©tat de gr√¢ce"". It is just a collection of funny situations. Basically there is nothing new here, but the simple truth of being a Mensch, that is a responsible and open person in life. And this is a message the movie is delivering with a good purpose."

Such as giving a homeless man a ride, while also giving him change after the smelly man begged for it.<br/><br/>You'd think with Jim Carry there would be comedic energy, unfortunately it's not so. This movie is slow in it's tracks, with Jim Carry acting as if he forgets he's in a comedy. <br/><br/>The premise of the movie is tired enough, you'd think an idea like this would lead to funny pay off, but it absolutely doesn't.

So instead always making excuses and spending his nights alone on the couch watching a DVD from his local video store, Carrey plans an engagement party for his best friend's fianc√©, who hates him, learns Korean, takes flying lessons, helps the homeless, hangs shelves for his elderly neighbor, and a host of other things. It's a very similar movie concept to Along Came Polly, A Guy Thing, or Chaos Effect, each tells the story of an unhappy, yet orderly man whose life is turned upside down and eventually improved through comedic spontaneity. The movie is done well enough but there a too few laughs and I found the plot had a great deal of untapped potential.

","A long time ago I read a book by Luke Rhinehart called the Dice Man in which a man allows all the decisions in his life to be made on the roll of a pair of die and, had I not known that this film is actually based on someone's real-life experiment, I would have considered this film to have been a variation on that basic concept. As it is, whereas Rhinehart's book understandably focused on the gradual erosion of the hero's character because he was no longer responsible for making any decisions in his life, this idea, which practically demands to be the core of a story like this, is only arbitrarily explored in the very last reel of Yes Man. It's one of the drawbacks of having to cater for a mass audience that is identified by its lowest common denominators, I suppose, but it means this film fails to be anywhere as near as interesting as it could have been.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is about ten years too old for the part of Carl, a bachelor with low self-esteem who is slowly cutting himself off from the world (essentially saying 'no' to it) whose life is turned around when he is practically press-ganged into a personality enhancement scheme in which he must say yes to all and any suggestions, instructions or requests. Cue much hilarity with our hapless hero giving his money to tramps, learning to speak Korean and fly a plane, approving loans to all and sundry in his job as a loans officer, and receiving oral 'pleasure' from the toothless old lady who lives next door.<br/><br/>The film has some genuinely humorous moments and manages to generate an enjoyable feel-good atmosphere as Carl first discovers his life taking unexpected, life-affirming directions, but ironically the more his life seems to develop a focus ‚Äì mostly in the form of Zooey Deschanel ‚Äì the more the film starts to drift aimlessly. And when it does finally pull itself together for its final reel it manufactures such a ridiculous plot device (Zooey learns of his 'yes to anything philosophy' when he is arrested on suspicions of terrorist activities aroused by his free-spirited lifestyle) that you almost end up feeling the film wasn't as good as it actually was."

","As a mind numbing comedy this is fairly enjoyable. Jim Carrey is a bit too old already for the role, but he is funny, can't deny that. Deschanel is always Deschanel, which is good.<br/><br/>In the past years I've learnt that Americans are probably not that happy with their lives. Most comedies that are aimed to be spirit raising feel-good movies end up promoting some sort of recklessness, risk taking and general individualism. This movie is a prime example. Since when did risking life equal good living?<br/><br/>This theme has raised it's head a lot in the recent years, but do these movies really help anyone in the long run? They're like a pain killer, you feel good for a moment, but they don't dig any deeper and really cure the cause. Good as it is, but not really my cup of tea."

","Yes Man is yet another Jim Carrey vehicle, trying to cash in on his bankability while also giving him more scope to emote than in some of his earlier films. Plotwise, a forlorn shell of a divorc√©e finds new direction in life when a self-help seminar convinces him to say 'Yes!' to anything and everything. He meets a girl. Complications arise. Hilarity should then ensue.<br/><br/>This film never relies on quick gags and funny faces for comedy. Instead we see Carrey's understated loans manager thrust into a variety of predicaments that would have confronted his original character. When it does descend into Carrey-patented rubber-face, is seems exploitative and not at all funny. Flight of the Conchords alumni Rhys Darby is brought in for comic relief, but in much the same vein as the rest of the film ‚Äì characters forced into awkward and slightly ridiculous situations. It's amusing, but never hilarious, in the vein of Bruce Almighty rather than Ace Ventura.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are admirably adequate, Zooey Dechanel lively if somewhat bland, and Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterton as the obligatory best friends fit the stereotype they are called upon to play. Essentially, the success and failure of Yes Man are that it is standard Hollywood fare. Acting, writing, production values and so on are all adequate, but there is no adventure or risk involved. Terence Stamp enjoys stealing a couple of scenes, but even he seems a little tired by the whole process.<br/><br/>Yes Man harks back to Liar, Liar ‚Äì Carrey's character is forced to do things that he would otherwise avoid, but this is devoid of the family warmth and sense of the ridiculous that made Liar, Liar a surprisingly enduring film, and all seems a bit self-conscious. It's humorous and harmless, a pleasant film to watch of an evening, but nothing that demands repeat viewings."
"seeddream","6","0","1","16 April 2010"," Reflection
","I thought this movie is just a comedy movie without any content before I watched it. But I was wrong, it not just a comedy movie. It showed the something that can encourage people. The main actor was not lucky and able to do thing well. He always refused others' inviting, helping, or something they want him do. But his life got worse and worse, and he felt worse and worse, too. One day his friend introduced a speech, yes man, to make him become more confident. He went to the speech and do truly what the speaker said. And then, he always said ""yes"" when somebody ask him for doing something. Because of this action, he got a good attitude toward his life, and met the girl he loved. I think that the magic is not only say "" yes"" to do anything, but by doing this, you can be more confident to face everything. Be confident is very important. If you have confidence, you can show yourself at your best. Everything changes when you change your attitude toward the way you look the world. So change yourself to be active and confident, everything will be better as you do it!"

Story goes as Carl Allen (Jim Carrey), who was left by his wife years ago, suddenly lost his passion and keep saying 'no' to the world. he even forget his bestfriend's engagement party, take all the chances he got to the garbage can and spend his nights doin nothing¬Öbarely nothing¬Ö'til one day he meet a man who introduce him to a club where all the member just need to say 'yes man' to everything comes ahead. even throwing oneself out of the bridge! Well surrounded by doubt, he simply take it as a nice-treat but not to follow. All of course, before Terence Stamp, founder of 'Yes Man' club makes a 'covenant' with Carl to say YES at every opportunity and Carl hesitantly agreed. So just right after that, our 'no-man' Carl turns to 'yes-man' Carl who'd simply give his money away to a homeless man he met at the street just because the man ask for it.<br/><br/>overall i love the way Allison live her life and the way she presenting herself to the world¬ÖShe take life as simple as she loves to make a jogging photograph and sing whatever song she likes, going somewhere clueless, just do whatever she likes. my fav Allison quote : ""The world's a playground.

","Yes, it's predictable (extremely.) Yes, it's typical (Carrey.) Yes, it's a rip-off (Liar, Liar.) But, I find the most important ""yes"" is: Yes, it's actually funny and in some scenes genuine and heart-warming.<br/><br/>Well, some of it is. It's nice to see Carrey taking on more of an ""adult"" comedy role, not toning down his language humor. So, I found myself laughing a lot in Yes Man.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, every time I was laughing, or enjoying myself, it took a dive, whether a very slow-moving scene or an unoriginal idea or just into predictable territory. These were the movie's undoing. Oh, and that the leads (May-December at its best) had zero chemistry. That didn't help either.<br/><br/>The nice thing about the movie, unlike Carrey's better movies, Liar, Liar or The Mask, in this one, he's given the ""choice"" to be ""a better man."" So, I liked the so-called realism he finally portrayed.<br/><br/>Carl is a definite ""no-man"" in his life or job as a loan officer at a bank. When given the chance to attend a guru's workshop to say ""yes"" to opportunities, he actually attends and tries it out with success. When he does, in fact, say no, coincidentally, bad things happen.<br/><br/>There's a lesson to be learned, as in 90% of Carrey's films and predictability, you'll see it coming. Whether in his yes-choices or romance with the typically very good Deschanel (Carl's love interest) but in this case very misplaced. I loved her so much in (500) Days of Summer, but here, she looks so out of place, it's painful on how she tried to be ""perky."" For fans of Carrey's earlier work (Liar, Liar remains my favorite of his comedies) this is worth a viewing. In fact, it's his best comedy since Bruce Almighty (2003) but one of his weakest movies. And that's sad. For a lot of the movie, it's down-right hilarious and had scenes that can teach ""loving life,"" but for most of the movie, it's so boring, expected and clich√©d."

","The TRAILer of this film made me laugh. That face JC makes, when he's telling the lovely Korean girl (Vivian Bang) that his friend's fianc√©e hates him, is fantastic and you can tell Vivian is really laughing.<br/><br/>A lot of actors/directors believe in letting the comedy of the moment speak for itself via natural acting and that's fine. But it's Carrey's style and gift to make a funny moment funnier by being silly that makes you laugh instead of THINKing about laughing.<br/><br/>I like to laugh. I also like to think but I do enough of that on my own. I prefer Jim's comic efforts more than the ""Truman Show"" and ""Eternal Sunshine"" and other more serious efforts. I loved the ""Series Of Unfortunate Events"" which allowed his acting genius to shine, where he could be diverse, dark and comic.<br/><br/>Yes, some of Carrey's films are formulaic but whose aren't? It's his ability to break the formula from within the formula that makes him Jim Carrey.<br/><br/>Yes, Jim Carrey is getting older. Who isn't? He's still ten thousand times funnier than the geniuses who are saying ""Hey, he's getting older"" as if everyone else is getting younger.<br/><br/>The people who made comments about the age difference between JC and Deschanel weren't 20 years old, they were 40 year old female actresses and their beauticians.<br/><br/>On the other hand, people are complaining about the octogenarian sex. Was it vital to the plot? No. Did Carl/Jim instigate it? No. Was he a bit repulsed by it? Yes. Was it uncomfortable? Yes. Was it human? Yes. It's unfortunate that old people are still horny, that bankers and governments are corrupt, that humans aren't monogamous- but that's life and life isn't always about the comfortable and politically correct. It's boringly typical that people are upset that an old woman is horny; if it had been an old man, it would have been clich√© or ignored. Alan Arkin is horny in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and that's OK but old Tillie is a little bored and randy and it's inappropriate. Old women get horny, too. <br/><br/>Zooey Deschanel's anger at Carl's ""yes-ism"" seemed contrived. In a real situation, he should have let her walk and waited till she called him- which she would have in time. Guys- wake up!<br/><br/>This is a cute, funny, positive film with a message of life and moderation AND it takes the time to ridicule the terror situation in America. For that reason, if for no other, it should be praised."

Carrey's character meets a random girl early on, and surprise, surprise - he ends up meeting her again!

However, the idea of the flick I thought was great and promoted a positive way of thinking. The acting was very good and I love the leading female role, she was great!

While Carrey and many of the scenes are still funny, a lot of the fun is drained out as you realise the script simply exists to throw up as many random slapstick moments as possible without really exploring the idea of a man, who is not allowed to say 'no.' Or, for that matter, an entire wave of people who can't say 'no.' I found myself squirming in my seat before things got even more stale in the final third. On one hand the complications were welcome because the movie had just been going for so long without looking at the consequences of Carl's actions.

","Before watching this movie, I thought that it was going to be real funny and very entertaining. It wasn't that funny though, not like Jim Carry's usually gags and jokes. This was alright. Yes man tells the story of man Carl Allen (Jim Carrey)who challenges himself to say Yes to almost anything and everything. There are a lot of jokes in the film, and some of them are put to well use. But then again, some were just plain unfunny and awkward. But Carrey blazes above all else with his humor. He's still the zany goofy guy we all like and admire. Some parts of this film was great. others were weird. I mean, in the beginning his friend tells Carl to go to a Yes Man convention where a speaker tells the audience to say yes to everything and to be committed to saying yes. It starts out pretty weird. The guy tells Carl to say Yes to everything and that he has to. Carl agrees with this and follows his plans. The story basically starts from there. The thing I don't understand is, when Carl was forced to say yes and when he wanted to say ""no"", why couldn't he just say words that mean ""no"" like ""nope, naw, i cant"", and stuff like that...That as wack The story is somewhat predictable. Sure, it has a preachy message hidden somewhere in there, but all in all it's a pretty good message: Say yes to (almost) everything and you'll have a better life. I couldn't agree more after seeing this film.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a very good comedy that will definitely make you smile, feel better, and inspired when you walk out of the cinema. Definitely a worth watching, its was great...coulda been better though"

Because my film reviews are not the standard ones, but they definitely are unique. Jim! Jim! Jim! You are definitely one of my idols! I have been an avid supporter and jovial fan of all your films; including the drama ones. I have said ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" every time in dishing out the admission fee to check out your Carreyisms in your flicks. But Mr. Carrey, almighty Mr. Carrey, it causes me profound pain to say this but ""Yes, Man"" is a No for me compared to your other comedic masterpieces. Carrey plays Carl Allen, a compulsive ""nosayer"" who decides to turn and join the ""Yes Club For Men"" after attending a motivational seminar. Carl then goes berserk with the yeses. He will say yes to just about anything and anyone. He then meets cutie Allison, lifelessly played by Zooey Deschanel, who he desires the most important yes from. For a few initial scenes, the yes scenes were comical; but then Carrey gets carried away with them and it overextends their yes welcome. The plot line of ""Yes, Man"" is similar to Carrey's classic ""Liar, Liar"", but the similarities cease there. ""Liar, Liar"" was a laugh riot contrary to the underdeveloped or maybe one can argue overdeveloped ""Yes, Man""; and that is no lie! Director Peyton Reed did not develop enough creative comedic ingenuity in ""Yes, Man"" to be considered ""The Reeder"" of the comedy directorial parade this year. Screenwriters Nicholas Stoller and Jarred Paul were in ""No Man's Land"" while writing the mediocre script of ""Yes, Man"". However, I must say ""yes, man"" to Rhys Darby's hilarious turn as Carl's colleague Norman. And I also mildly enjoyed other supporting turns from John Michael Higgins playing a ""yes"" motivational recruiter and Terence Stamp playing a motivational speaker. Those aforementioned supporting performances and a few hilarious gags from Carrey, I guess motivated me enough to give ""Yes, Man"" a borderline ""Yes"" recommendation; but not by much. *** Average"

","As usual, movie with Jim Carrey promised you fun and laughter, and this one delivers too. The awesome concept of saying ""YES"" to ""ANYTHING"" in lives might seems a little bit extreme. But boy oh boy, the excitement and fun is also ""extreme."" For me, picking up a homeless person and give all your money to him is too dangerous and not recommended, but helping out at the shelter, joining a party costume that you think is cheesy, jogging and taking pics, taking up foreign language classes seems like tons of fun.<br/><br/>I laugh out loud and cries because I laugh too hard. And even laugh harder, when came the dialog ""You know who another Carl we don't like, Marx"" And the teenage girls sitting beside me ask innocently, who is Carl Marx, who? I just wanna scream out loud: ""He is the father of communism, the one who inspired Hitler, girl read up your history books"" But of course I didn't hahaha....because I'm too polite, and I'm afraid the girls will beat me up hahaha...<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie inspired me a lot, and I probably will say more ""YES"" in live for events with theme I'm not familiar with, with meeting and knowing people from different walk of lives, and trying out new exciting, not common things. YEAH, don't miss out on this one. It's much more fun than the ""Truman Show"" and ""The man from the moon"" And absolutely a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>And don't leave the movie theater too soon, because they have a nice little scene after the ending credit"
"Hellrazr360","6","0","2","5 January 2009"," A ""Has Its Moments"" Film In the Purest Sense
","Jim Carrey has had a rather rough run with his recent films. After raising the bar with the obscenely lovable Liar Liar and creating a perfect casual guy goes party mode in The Mask, it seems he's had a tough time living up to his 90's classics. While 2003's Bruce Almighty was a decent watch it just felt a little forced near the end. Then there was The Number 23, which was an all-time low for him as far as I'm concerned. Now he offers us Yes Man, with my thoughts from the trailer being that I though it would be mildly entertaining but not a return to glory. And this is pretty much exactly what the film was for me.<br/><br/>Carrey basically plays a man of reluctance and slight resentment in the film until he's finally persuaded to give a program a shot encouraging people to say ""yes"" to mostly everything. Carrey's first thoughts are that it's as bad as he thought, but then things finally start to go his way in-spite of a few suspicions. The rest of the film essentially plays out like a casual romantic comedy with him and his love interest doing what they want and hitting the usual speed bump near the end with words and a couple events smoothing things out at the end.<br/><br/>For me, this film had a bit of the ""Bruce Almight syndrome"" in that the first half to 3/4 of the film are where the highlights are at, but the rest of the film felt like it was becoming a little too forced and serious. There were a few good, humorous moments during the film but nothing that'll make you choke on your popcorn and soda. My main problem with this film and other comedies is that sometimes they take things too seriously or feel forced for certain sections. This was the case with Bruce Almighty during the second half and Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay felt like it was trying to push the ""food for thought"" aspect(s) a little too much. Yes Man is more or less in the same boat.<br/><br/>If you're a Jim Carrey fan like me, then this film might be worth a viewing, though I'd suggest waiting for it come out on DVD and renting it since I was only entertained so much. I did get a fair amount of chuckles and laughs and it did manage to keep a smile on my face for most of the runtime. However, during the last roughly thirty minutes it felt like it was trying to change its style, which just didn't work for me."
"spackard","7","0","1","2 January 2009"," Yes it is a lot like Liar Liar, but it's Better
","Yes Man is a very hard film for me to review because it one of those films where the part of me that fancies myself a intellectual film critic tells me I should hate it, and the part of me that is just some suburbia kid that went to see a movie on Friday night tells me I should love it. The reason I'm suppose to hate it is because Hollywood has been beating the proverbial dead horse with films whose premise is almost identical to this one. Yes Man is a Romantic Comedy about a man who recently went through a divorce and is realizing his life is miserable, in order to change all that he makes an unusual, radical, and unrealistic change in his lifestyle that causes him to acquire a new girlfriend. If you can't name at least 5 Romantic Comedies that are carbon copies of that idea then you must live under a rock, Hell I can think of 3 that Jim Carey acted in before this one.<br/><br/>But there is nothing inherently wrong with these kinds of films, in fact some are very good, and if Yes Man is the last of this form of Romantic Comedies then the sub-genre has ended on a high note. There are several things that make Yes Man better than Liar Liar (which every critic on planet earth seems to be comparing it to). The first thing they do right is casting Zooey Deschanel as the lead female, since every role Zooey Deschanel touches is pure gold. You see, it's very easy for a director to find an actress with tits big enough that all then men in the audience wants to Do Her, it's not easy for a director to find an actress who is so sweet and likable that every man in the theater wants to snuggle with her for 4 hours then watch her sleep in their arms. I even liked her in Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy despite the fact it sucked. In fact her role in that film was so good that if they just called it ""Zooey Deschanel goes to Space with a British Dude"" it probably would have gotten very positive reviews.<br/><br/>Now other than the fact the film has an actress that me and a good number of my male friends have a crush on (for good reasons), it deserves credit for doing something original with an unoriginal thing. It kind of like how Punk ceased to be original at the dawn of the 80's so everyone just started playing Post-Punk, (sorry no more Punk Rock references). Yes Jim Carey makes an unfeasible lifestyle change, but it can't be to unfeasible because apparently some Scottish Comedian actual did it for like six months and then wrote a book about it which this film is based off of. So unlike Liar Liar I could see 90% of the things happening in this movie actually happening.<br/><br/>What's really great about this film is the message it preaches. Almost all Romanic Comedies I see nowadays preach the message of ""Responsibility,"" and ""Trust,"" and ""Respect."" Back in the day this made sense since we were living in an age where getting a divorce was considered about as bad as getting a chocolate bar while on a diet, but it seems whoever wrote Yes Man thought this message got pounded into our heads a bit too well. Yes Man encourages couples to be spontaneous and free spirited, which is good because it seems people are so convinced that once you enter a serious relationship that you have to enter a dull routine. The movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall had a similar message, and I really enjoyed that film as well, thought it didn't have Zooey Deschanel. This movie is most likely the best Romantic Comedy about a guy making an unrealistic lifestyle change I've ever seen, there are some genuinely funny times, and some genuinely heartwarming times, plus the Romance between Carey and Deschanel in this film is a creative and oddly believable. And if anything you should probably go see it just cause I think it's Zooey's best role so far."

It just amazes me that one could get so far on so little talent as Jim Carrey. I enjoyed Ace Ventura, The Mask and Dumb And Dumber, but his act wears thin and gets old very quickly. People have made him out to be a comic genius but this just isn't the case. He breaks no new ground here and there really isn't a lot of laughs. The young actress who plays his love interest does a fine job but they don't have real chemistry. Its like she just cannot wait for the take to be over just to get away from him. I also wanted to mention Patrick Laborteaux's part in this film. He was on Little House On The Prarie as a kid and was Bud on JAG (one of my favorite shows, he and Karri Turner were so wonderful together). Karri Turner has had only two bit parts in films since JAG was canceled and Patrick Laborteaux only has a 40 second spot in this film. What a letdown. To go from being on one of television's most beloved shows to bit parts. How sad. Anyway the bottom line to my review is to avoid this movie like the plague. I think a great way to sum it up is simply ""Say no to Yes Man""."

Another one of Jim's characters I like is Fire Marshall Bill from In Living Color. I have gone way back here. I did not know who Jim Carrey was until he popped up on In Living Color. I remember I did see him in a serious movie before In Living Color. He is great in playing series roles. I am not surprise because he is a brilliant actor. A little over the top but still brilliant. I am usually feeling exhausted after watching Carrey in a comedy. He can take a lot out of you. I can not imagine being married to a guy like this. His energy is just too much for me. However, he is a great actor and I am looking forward to seeing Yes Man. I will be exhausted after the movie, but it will be worth it. I hope I will like this movie. We will see:)"
