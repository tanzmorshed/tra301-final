"NoArrow","Null","67","77","4 August 2004"," A great film headed by a classic director and strong star William Holden
","William Holden is always in the shadows in `Stalag 17', he's always behind the characters or off to the side of the camera.  You see, despite Holden's character Sgt. J.J. Sefton being the film's main character, he is only seen through the eyes of his fellow POWs, rarely ever alone.  When they start to think he's the spy so do we.  Oh, sure, we know he isn't the rat (movies don't do things like that), but since the story is told by all of the POWs who think Sefton is the rat, we start to think like them too.  That is the mastery of Billy Wilder's `Stalag 17', it takes the film's most interesting character and sets him apart from the rest for most of the film, letting us learn about him as the characters do.<br/><br/>The story focuses on a group of POWs living in the American section of Stalag 17, supposedly the     's best POW camp.  Among them are barracks chief Hoffy (Richard Erdman), Price (Peter Graves), Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck) and Animal Casava (Robert Strauss).  They all have their own special job when their fellow prisoners try to escape, Price, for instance, is security'.  The film starts when two prisoners try to escape the barracks. Everyone inside is enthused, thinking the two will make it very far, except Sefton, who bets precious cigarettes that they wont make it past the outer forest.  When he turns out to be right the POWs start thinking there's a rat and that rat is Sefton.  And as the first hour passes we think so too, it's only logical, Sefton has any luxuries because of his deals with the s.<br/><br/>The POWs start to bully Sefton, and once they beat him to a pulp he decides to discover who the real rat is (at this point, of course, we know he is     ).  His investigation isn't handled with dialogue though, we get this by seeing his facial expressions and his lurking in the shadows of the barracks.<br/><br/>So, what starts as a light, `gung-ho' type war movie (there's lots of comedy in the first hour) turns into a dark, sort of gritty thriller with a twist that left me with my mouth open.  I wont reveal it, but I'll just say that Sefton smartly solves the mystery and redeems himself to the rest of the barracks (I didn't spoil anything, come on, it's expected).<br/><br/>As I said, there's lots of comedy in the first hour and some in the second, mostly from Strauss and Lembeck's characters.  Some of the comedy is key in showing how these characters cope with their nearly hopeless situation, handled well by Wilder and the actors (Strauss' performance even gained him an Oscar nomination) but some of it just seems tacked on and out of place, like when a drunken Strauss thinks that Lembeck is a hell.<br/><br/>But that is a small qualm, and the rest of the film is excellent.  The direction and writing are great in showing us a war film, a mystery, a thriller and a dark comedy all at once.  I'd have to say I like the acting the most though, Holden (who won a leading Oscar for his work in this) is suave and charming, as well as mischievous and cynical, he creates a real `cool' character without trying too.  And the rest of the cast - Graves, Otto Preminger - are admirable as well.  The POWs aren't clichés or caricatures, they're all their own separate people.<br/><br/>`Stalag 17' is great as a war movie, a mystery, a thriller and a dark comedy.  It's a classic film, for all who appreciate good cinema, 8.5/10."
"jmcsween90","10","77","96","28 February 2000"," Underrated? - understatement!
","In his lengthy and eventful career, Billy Wilder created many films that have rightly attained classic status, but his WWII prisoner of war comedy-drama Stalag 17 is arguably one of his best. The scripting is a perfect example of how to marry a tight plot with sharp dialogue and great characters, and the acting is flawless on all counts. While William Holden's performance as the cynical American sergeant rightly won him an Oscar, it is the comic antics of Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck that steal the show. And if there was ever a more entertaining ensemble of previously unseen (and sadly subsequently unheard of) supporting players - with the possible exception of Casablanca - I would love to see it. This film predates the more famous WWII pow film The Great Escape by more than a decade, but had Wilder, Holden and company not caused havoc in Stalag 17, the world would never have seen Steve McQueen play the cooler king with such wry aplomb. Stalag 17 is easily one of the finest films of its time, if not of all time, and I would encourage anyone who has never experienced its unique blend of cynicism, comedy, suspense and drama to check it out at the earliest available opportunity."
"DeeNine-2","10","72","91","7 February 2004"," Quasi-realism and burlesque: a comedic drama
","There was surprisingly enough a lot of humor in the American attitude toward the Nazis and the Germans during World War II. Life goes on even under the conditions of being prisoners of war, and people need to laugh. In such circumstances, they especially need to laugh. We can see that in some of the songs from that time and in this play from Donald Bevant and Edmund Trzcinski that Billy Wilder made into an unusually good movie. It should be realized that the full extent of the horror that the Nazis had visited upon Europe was not known until after the war was over and we saw the films of the concentration camps.<br/><br/>William Holden stars as Sgt J.J. Sefton whose amoral cynicism and gift for the cheap hustle allow him to feather his nest even while a prisoner of war.<br/><br/>He's the guy who always had a storehouse of cigarettes, booze, silk stockings, candy, etc. under his bunk, the guy who always won at cards, whose proposition bets always gave him the edge. We had a guy like that when I was in the army. We called him ""Slick.""<br/><br/>But William Holden's Sefton is more than Slick. He is outrageously cynical and uncommonly brave. He takes chances because he doesn't have the same kind of fear that others have. Most people would feel self-conscious (and nervous) eating a fried egg while everybody else in the barracks had watery-thin potato soup. Others might feel uncomfortable with bribing German guards for bottles of Riesling or tins of sardines. Not Sefton. He flaunts his store of goodies.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is overdone. Perhaps the real hardships that prisoners went through are glossed over in this comedic drama--a comedy, incidentally, that plays very much like a Broadway musical without the music. Perhaps it is the case that from the distance of 1953 the deprivations of Stalag 17 have faded from memory and it is the ""good times"" that are recalled.<br/><br/>At any rate, I think it is this kind of psychology that accounts for the success of this unusual blend of quasi-realism and burlesque. Certainly Stalag 17 has been widely imitated, most familiarly in the TV sit-com ""Hogan's Heroes"" and to some extent on Rowan and Martin's ""Laugh-In."" Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful, on the other hand, which also finds humor in the horrific, is of a different genre. Like Ionesco's Rhinoceros, Benigni's movie is from the theater of the absurd, not the Broadway stage.<br/><br/>Holden won an Oscar for his performance and Robert Strauss who played Animal was nominated in a supporting role. Otto Preminger, the legendary director and producer, was excellent as the two-faced Col Von Scherbach, the ex-calvary commander and camp commandant who can only take a phone call from the high command with his boots on so he can click his heels. I also liked Sig Rumann as Sgt Johann Sebastian Schulz (""always making with the jokes, you Americans"") whose previous career as a wrestler in the US accounts for his English-language skills. Gil Stratton, who for years did the sports for CBS Channel 2 in Los Angeles, is interesting as Sefton's sidekick and funky.<br/><br/>Indeed, what is responsible for the success of this movie as much as anything is this fine cast playing well-defined character roles. By the way, Strauss and Harvey Lembeck (""Sugar Lips"" Shapiro) were reprising their roles from Broadway.<br/><br/>Important is the fine plot line in which Sefton is accused of being a spy for the Nazis while the real spy is exposed step by step. At first we don't know who it is, and then we do, and then the prisoners find out. <br/><br/>This should be compared with Sunset Boulevard (1950). While very different movies they have similar elements which reveal part of the psyche and methods of director Billy Wilder. First there is the anti-hero as the protagonist, in both cases played by William Holden. Then there is a lot of the old Hollywood crowd appearing in both films including directors appearing as actors, Erich von Stroheim (not to mention Cecil B. DeMille in his memorable cameo as himself) in Sunset Boulevard, and Otto Preminger here. Sig Rumann has over a 100 credits going back to at least the early thirties. Finally there is the discordant mix of comedic and dramatic elements, a mix that works on our psyches because life is to some very real extent filled with tragedy in close congruence with the laughable.<br/><br/>But see this for William Holden who was the kind of actor who was best playing a compromised character as here and as the failed writer/reluctant gigolo in Sunset Boulevard, an actor who drank too much and tended to undistinguished, but when carefully directed could rise above his intentions and give a sterling performance.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
"Boba_Fett1138","10","32","38","27 June 2008"," Another WW II POW classic.
","Despite the fact that this movie got made 10 years before the WW II POW classic ""The Great Escape"", the movie is still known as the 'other' WW II POW movie. While I do admit that ""The Great Escpae"" is still a better movie than this one (""The Great Escape"" is probably one of my favorite all time movies) this movie is a great and classic one as well.<br/><br/>Just like ""The Great Escape"", the movie knows to create a perfect balance between its drama and comedy. This movie could easily been turned into a heavy war drama but instead a more light approach gets picked, without loosing any of its serious and more dramatic power. It makes the movie entertaining as well as effectively powerful. It can be assumed that ""The Great Escape"" and its style got inspired by this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is a 'great' portrayal of the lives of American officer POW's, in a German stalag. They try to make the best of it, with very limited resources. Every small thing and things that are out of the ordinary are the things that make them go through their days and is what's keeping them alive. The first halve of the movie isn't even about the William Holden character and he is just one of the boys. It isn't after about halve way through the movie that the story takes to take shape and the main plot of the movie becomes obvious. In advance you would just expect from this movie to be one about POW's trying to escape. But the story is way better written and layered than that though.<br/><br/>But it above all things is also a very well made and especially directed one, by 6 time Academy Award winner Billy Wilder. He also received a directing nomination for this movie. It's a '50's movie but it doesn't feel like one. The movie seems to be ahead of its time with its story handling, directing and just overall style of film-making. The camera-work is especially great and worth mentioning.<br/><br/>William Holden does a great job at portraying a complicated character. At first you just don't know what to think of him and he isn't a very likable character but he slowly turns into a strong and more important character, that starts doing the right thing. Holden also actually won an Oscar for his role in this movie, despite the fact that he never really wanted to do this movie. It was the only Oscar he ever got, which makes it quite ironic.<br/><br/>A great powerful, entertaining classic, which was truly ahead of its time.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Snow Leopard","Null","33","41","16 September 2004"," Absorbing & Very Entertaining
","This absorbing and very entertaining movie creates a believable and interesting cast of characters, puts them into an intriguing story, and uses its settings, props, and other resources very creatively. It is a fine combination of drama and comic relief that stands up very well against anything else of its type. The setting and atmosphere are quite believable, and they make it easy to enter the characters' world.<br/><br/>The opening sequence sets up everything nicely, with most of POW's helping two of the prisoners in an escape attempt, while William Holden as the cynical Sefton separates himself from the rest. Sefton is interesting enough as it is, a man who simply by remaining true to his nature cannot help arousing suspicion and antagonism, and Holden was quite a good choice to play him. The story builds up nicely, with developments coming at a careful pace, and some good stretches of lighter material.<br/><br/>There are numerous interesting characters and good performances among the other prisoners, and in particular Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck steal more than one scene with their antics which, though goofy, are also an appropriate complement to the main plot and the setting. The German characters are more stylized, but both Sig Ruman and Otto Preminger make them come to life, and help them fit in seamlessly with the others.<br/><br/>Billy Wilder's direction and the photography also deserve praise. Besides the way that each sequence fits together so nicely with the others, there are several individual scenes and shots that are done in an impressive fashion - not flashy, but creative and thoughtful. The scene with Holden lying on his cot while most of the others sing and celebrate is one particularly good example. There is a wealth of good material throughout, making ""Stalag 17"" a classic that has lost nothing over the years, and one that can be seen and enjoyed several times."
"MartinHafer","9","30","37","15 November 2006"," A wonderful war film that dares to be different
","This is one of Billy Wilder's best films and still stands up very well today. Unlike the concentration camps of the Holocaust, prison camps for Allied prisoners were actually not all that bad in comparison (except for how the Russian prisoners were treated--they were often just shot). So, the prisoners enjoyed a little more freedom and were constantly trying to deal with the incredible boredom of being locked up with very little to do. As a result, films about these camps (such as this one and THE GREAT ESCAPE) are few and far between--they would just be too dull to merit a movie. However, in the case of this film, the monotony is disrupted because there apparently is a snitch within the prisoners' ranks--some rat is tipping off the Commandant (director Otto Preminger--in one of his few acting roles) about escape attempts, major rule infractions and who the actual perpetrator of a major act of sabotage was.<br/><br/>Naturally, prisoners begin to think that William Holden is the snitch. After all, he is living incredibly well compared to all the other Allied prisoners in the camp due to all his money-making schemes and black market activities. In addition, he is so cynical and apparently unpatriotic that he has no desire to escape--he's more than willing to sit tight until the war is over since he is safe and happy! In this role, Holden's character is VERY similar to the one he played in BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI--where he is also a schemer and mostly focused on saving his own sorry butt! However, the problem of the snitch isn't so simply solved and much of the film is about how Holden proves he was NOT the spy for the Germans.<br/><br/>The movie is odd in that it is a combination of both drama and comedy--with alternating moods throughout the film. Some of the ways the bored prisoners create their own fun are incredibly funny (especially the ""MEIN KAMPF"" scene) and some of the moments are poignant and exciting (such as the escape at the end of the film). All this comes together wonderfully in the marvelous ending of the film. The movie features exceptional acting, writing and direction and is one of the best WWII films ever made. See it--it's well worth your time."
"bleakeye","8","53","69","24 July 2001"," In Defense of ""Stalag 17""
","In defense of this great film ""Stalag 17"", I would like to say a few things. First of all, William Holden's performance in this film gives this film a very big lead against many other films like it.  Holden is a very good actor given a very good role here as Sefton, a soldier that uniquely accepts his situation.  The other supporting, and even prominent roles are good but seems ""intentionally"" underdeveloped for the benefit of not complicating viewers with unnecessary information.  The story, consisting of a ""whodunit"" plot, wartime ordeals, and amusing dialogue between the characters is superb for it's time.  All in all, watching ""Stalag 17"" is at least a fine way to spend your time.  <br/><br/>I've read many reviews that say that they were disappointed with this film. Some were annoyed because it wasn't as realistically gritty and tense like ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Well, that's the effect of the Hays Offices (censorship officials of American produced movies during the past).  I have to say that although it may have lacked the grittiness of Spielberg's film, it still surpasses ""Saving Private Ryan"" for it's honest approach to it's characters such as the POW that responds to his wife's letter (""I believe it."") with a certain kind of feeling that can truly be described as honest and the German ""Wake up caller"" Scherbach's constant joking around with POWs while remaining true to his kommandant's wishes.  The 'Animal' and Shapiro characters were obviously created for comic relief but it should only be taken as that, comic relief (Hell, everyone's a comedian and at least they tried).  Most anybody that was disappointed with this film were probably disappointed for it's strange association with the TV show ""Hogan's Heroes"". I must say that I don't care much for that certain show but I do like this film.  <br/><br/>I really don't think that any film should ever be compared with another film or a TV show (unless it's a spinoff, then they're just asking for it) no matter how related they are.  A movie is a movie on it's own and never with the help of another, no matter the similarities.  This is a classic film, worthy of it's praise yet unworthy of it's negative critique.  Nobody should let personal opinions be considered flaws.  Just watch it, when you have the chance, with an open mind."
"Quinoa1984","10","26","32","9 April 2008"," the perennial 'feel-good' American POW movie
","Billy Wilder's Stalag 17 relies on folds of comedy and a cynical attitude to elevate a story that seems out of a crime novel. Here we have a cast of characters, and the undercurrent is 'who's the rat?' in a bunker as the secrets shuffled around (i.e. that there's a tunnel for escape) and the Germans know right away. There's fun in that, and in being able to 2nd guess who the informant really is- at one point I thought the old adage ""it's the quiet ones you got to watch"" would come forward- but Wilder is brilliant at transforming this as some solid suspense and dramatic tension while ALSO making a really snappy (sometimes) dark comedy. It's a movie about personality, despite the plot being somewhat important, and with the actors themselves delivering a lot for the characters' sakes.<br/><br/>William Holden is the first given attribute as the star, playing the sort who, for a conventional movie-goer audience, seems easy to peg: too full of himself, sneaky, has the motive to be the informant. But as the layers come into focus, he's more than meets the eye, and Holden (against his better instincts, as he didn't want the role originally) fills it in with his subtle swagger and great sarcastic touch carried over from Sunset Blvd. Then there's Otto Premminger, a big surprise as he is mostly known as a director, as the Commandant, taking up and stealing every scene he's in (only Erich von Stroheim in Grand Illusion beats him out as tour-de-force Commandants). Then there's supporting work from the desperate 'clowns' (Robert Strauss's Betty Grable obsessed Animal and Harvey Lembeck's Shapiro), and the cool Don Talyer in a turn as Dunbar. They're all at their best.<br/><br/>While it almost appears to be more entertaining than it perhaps should- considering, as Cookie's opening narration says, movies about the army have been glamorized and this story is different- it's kind of like the Hollywood 50s answer to something like A Man Escaped. Bresson's film is cold and detached and immediate in dramatic impact, while Stalag 17 wants to be a big hit. There's a lot of humor, some unexpected, some that are meant to be big laughs (i.e. Animal and Shapiro's scheme to get into the Russian prison), and they all connect. It's simply a really entertaining movie that has transcended its period, thanks to Wilder's faith in (and more than likely proponent of) an ironic, witty sensibility to otherwise dark and gloomy cinematic terrain."
"ackstasis","9","23","28","17 February 2008"," ""Nobody has ever escaped from Stalag 17. Not alive, anyway.""
","Director Billy Wilder was certainly no stranger to the horrors of World War Two. He was born in Austria-Hungary {now Poland} in 1906, but moved to Berlin to begin a career in movies. However, following the rise of Adolf Hitler, Wilder  being Jewish  fled for Paris and then the United States. His mother, grandmother and stepfather died at the Auschwitz concentration camp. As such, I think it'd be safe to presume that Wilder housed a considerable hatred towards Nazis, which makes his POW-picture, 'Stalag 17 (1953),' all the more remarkable. Whereas the film might have developed into a bleak, depressing drama, the screenplay by Wilder and Edwin Blum {adapted from a play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski} effortlessly blends drama and comedy, clearing the path for other similarly-themed war-time films {David Lean's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' and John Sturges' 'The Great Escape (1963)'} and even TV series {'Hogan's Heroes (1965-1971)' clearly used Wilder's film as a template  including an identical Sgt. Schulz  despite a failed court case in which producers sued for infringement}.<br/><br/>The year is 1944, in the week before Christmas. Stalag 17, a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, is situated somewhere along the Danube River, and hundreds of captured Allied sergeants have been imprisoned there. The Americans of Barrack 4 endure a dull, deprived lifestyle, with each day consisting of unwholesome meals, tedious labour and uncomfortable living conditions. Displaying that typical American cleverness and resourcefulness, many of the prisoners have banded together to ensure themselves a few added luxuries  such a makeshift radio to listen to the latest war news  and to build an effective escape tunnel beneath the camp. However, it soon becomes apparent that there is a Nazi spy within their midst. After two escaping prisoners are immediately shot down, and their escape passage is inexplicably discovered, the men turn their suspicions towards J.J. Sefton (William Holden), a selfish and arrogant prisoner with a dog-eat-dog mentality that sees him openly bribing the German guards for luxuries. An unsympathetic character, one who nonetheless exhibits a certain streak of integrity, Sefton decides to uncover the true traitor of Barrack 4.<br/><br/>Though he was reluctant to play such an unlikable character, Holden won the Best Actor Oscar for his powerful performance {via the second-shortest acceptance speech in Academy Awards history  a simple ""thank you""}. The other actors in the film also create distinct and likable personalities, and I particularly enjoyed the big, oafish Animal (Robert Strauss) and Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck). Goodness knows what compelled the writers to make Sgt. Schulz (Sig Ruman), a loathsome tyrant in any other film, a jolly and hearty buffoon, but it works absolutely perfectly, his character's incompetence best highlighted in the sequence where he is distracted into playing volleyball, and enjoys the game so much that he hands his loaded weapon to the nearest POW. As Sefton attempts to uncover which fellow prisoner is leaving secret messages for their Nazis captors, Wilder intersperses the drama with an episodic flow of comedic situations, placing particularly emphasis on the means by which prisoners will alleviate their desire for the opposite sex. A hilarious sequence sees the drunken Animal mistaking his dressed-up bunk-mate for the cinema beauty Betty Grable, of whom he has an undying obsession."

","I'm a woman younger than 30.<br/><br/>Saw it for the first time in 2005- knew nothing about the director or the actors- and I couldn't turn away because I needed to know the answer to the mystery. The acting is superb, the dialogue quick, the plot unexpected. The film seems fresh and subtle compared to Hollywood films of now. Perhaps this is because the special effects are simple; the emphasis is on dialogue. We also watch for clues in the changing surroundings and the characters in the shadows.<br/><br/>I held my breath for the last few minutes. Even after the movie had ended, I wondered ""What will happen now? Will the guards burst into the barrack? What will happen the next morning?"" The last seconds of the film are peaceful, but the whistling at the end seems too hopeful...surely something will go still wrong!"
"bkoganbing","9","30","42","14 July 2005"," If Billy Wilder were making this today.
","Stalag 17 is my favorite Billy Wilder film. This is Wilder at the top of his cynical game. Not a frame of film is wasted in this movie and even the most minute performances shine.<br/><br/>Of course the big prize here is the Oscar won by William Holden for Best Actor of 1953. In a recent biography of Wilder, I learned that Kirk Douglas was Wilder's original choice to play Sefton. Douglas wanted to do it and I'm sure would have been very good in the part, but he had prior commitments. So Wilder turned to Holden with whom he had done Sunset Boulevard and the results were sensational.<br/><br/>While making the film, Holden grew to hate his character. He urged Wilder to do something to soften Sefton and Wilder refused. I think the results vindicate Wilder and Holden was the first to agree.<br/><br/>Stalag 17 was a play set in only the barracks for the stage. To adapt it for the screen, Wilder created one character that was not in the original play, that of Cookie. Gil Stratton's performance blends so nicely in with the cast that that fact came as something of a surprise to me. Cookie is the offscreen narrator and it is through his eyes in which we see the action unfold.<br/><br/>Wilder has such a marvelous sense of the absurd here. In Stalag 17 he created in my opinion one of the great absurd moments in film history. During the mail call scene Harvey Lembeck is getting a ton of letters and poor Bob Strauss is pining away that no one wrote to him. He questions Lembeck and he finds that all the letters were from a collection agency about his overdue payments on his Plymouth.<br/><br/>Instead of love letters to ""Sugar Lips"" Shapiro, the collection agency wants ""the third payment on the Plymouth, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, they want the Plymouth.""<br/><br/>I don't know about the rest of you, but the sublime absurdity of a collection agency tracking some soldier all the way to a POW camp in Germany for overdue car payments just cracks me up every time I see Stalag 17.<br/><br/>Lembeck and Strauss were a great team together. Strauss was nominated for best Supporting Actor, but lost to Frank Sinatra.<br/><br/>Lembeck has another favorite moment of mine in the film. The main plot is to discover who in the barracks is a stoolie. Almost at the end of the film when the stoolie is discovered, the stoolie tries to protest. Lembeck, who's been a comic character throughout the film, drops his voice down and just says ""he said to shut up."" There is such a chill in his voice it will frighten the audience. Again sublime film technique by a master.<br/><br/>If Billy Wilder were making the film today some of the homoerotic overtones would be a lot more explicit. These men have not had any female companionship for a while and I'm sure some of the other prisoners would have started looking good. There's the Christmas dance in which poor Bob Strauss with some homemade hooch in him, starts dancing with Harvey Lembeck and thinking she's Betty Grable because Lembeck is in some impromptu drag. <br/><br/>Also at the dance the blonde naive pretty kid Peterson played by Robert Shawley who you see being held rather tightly by one of the other prisoners. That was about as far as you could go back in 1953.<br/><br/>In fact one of the reasons that Holden is hated so much by the rest of the barracks is that he's worked it out so he could consort with the Russian female prisoners in another part of the camp. The best thing the rest of them have in that barracks is Robert Shawley. He'd be a lot more explicitly gay by necessity or maybe even inclination today.<br/><br/>Fellow director Otto Preminger is great as the camp commandant and Billy Wilder favorite Sig Ruman is Sergeant Schultz. But he's not your Hogan's Heroes Sergeant Schultz. In fact as the plot unfolds Ruman is not quite the buffoon as we are originally led to think. It's a very subtle piece of acting by Sig Ruman, probably the best performance in his career.<br/><br/>In fact Stalag 17 is a wonderful ensemble gathering of great players performing a timeless story."
"eaglejet98","10","18","24","7 November 2003"," Top notch WWII film. A must see.
","Some viewers criticize Stalag 17 for technical inaccuracies and conflicts between comedy and drama in the story. I strongly disagree. I think the film is perfect.<br/><br/>I saw Stalag 17 in 1954 at age seven, with my late uncle. He was shot down over Germany in 1944 and spent 14 months in Stalag Luft I (Barth, Germany). He said the film was an accurate depiction of ""kriegie"" life.<br/><br/>When I was a teenager he and I discussed the film and both agreed it was excellent. Yes, there was much suffering and death in POW camps. But he said there was humor as well. In fact, it was the only way he maintained his sanity. His POW Log (a hard cover diary type book with blank pages for writing and drawing, donated to POWs by the International Red Cross) contained many tales of POW hi-jinks and other funny stories, so I think that aspect of the movie was on target.<br/><br/>American and British POWs viewed escape as both a serious endeavor and a ""game"" to outwit the Germans. The Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio has a display devoted to Luftwaffe POW camps and displays one German poster from 1944-45 that declared ""Escape activity is no longer considered a game and POWs attempting to escape will be shot"", so it appears that, at least up to the last year of the war, both sides saw escape activity as a test of will and competition. It also reduced boredom, on both sides.<br/><br/>Viewing this film, one should remember the Luftwaffe considered allied airmen to be brothers of sorts and gave them better treatment than other POWs received. And they certainly treated military prisoners much better than civilians in concentration camps. On the other hand, the Japanese were extremely brutal to all prisoners. An excellent film about Japanese POW Camps is 1965's adaptation of James Clavelle's book ""King Rat"", with George Segal, who also plays a character like Sefton. Clavelle also co-wrote the screenplay for The Great Escape.<br/><br/>Stalag 17 is well paced and the characters fully developed. William Holden is perfect as Sefton. I think he was probably the first film anti-hero; a role he played throughout his acting career (Bridge on the River Kwai; The Bridges at Toko-Ri). Sefton wasn't a collaborator. He just ""traded sharper than other guys"". And of course he ran lucrative floating games of chance and a black market operation.<br/><br/>Neville Brand shines as a tough POW who hates Sefton and leads a group who give him a 'blanket party' one night. Shapiro and 'Animal' are classic clowns and foul ups who continuously provide hilarious comedy relief. Otto Preminger is nothing short of superb as the arrogant Prussian who was transferred from the cavalry to be a POW camp warden. His daily diatribes to the ""sergeants"" are priceless. Schultz is exactly what we expect, a mindless boob. Clearly, the TV series Hogan's Heroes' Sergeant Schultz was based on him. By the way, my uncle and I both thought Hogan's Heroes was absolute trash and an insult to all POWs.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER: The best surprise in the entire movie is the discovery of the ""stool pigeon"". We never expect Peter Grave's character, Sgt. Price, to be the English speaking German masquerading as an American in order to rat out the POWs' escape plans. It is poetic justice that after Sefton is beaten up because the guys in his hut think he's the stoolie, he is the one who catches Price. 'Pricehoffer' (Graves) is gunned down by his ""own soldaten"", when he is tied up and noisily thrown out into the yard as a decoy the night Sefton and Lt. Dunbar escape.<br/><br/>In the end, Sefton does the right thing and clearly redeems himself. He uses an inner courage we didn't think he had to help LT Dunbar escape before he's turned over to the Gestapo as a saboteur. But then Sefton does do it for a reward from Dunbar's rich family, so he's still playing the angles up to the end.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films about WW II. Holden clearly deserved his best actor Oscar."
"Whythorne","5","21","30","21 February 2008"," Excellent drama that tries too hard to be a comedy
","This is a difficult film to rate because there are equal parts that deserve a ten and those that deserve a one. That's why I rate this a five.<br/><br/>The plot elements that focus on the drama and intrigue of an informer in the midst of allied prisoners in a German WWII prison camp are excellent. If the film had focused only on that, along with the addition of the acting and screen presence of William Holden, this would have been a wonderful film. Unfortunately, it is hindered by an overabundance of stupid shenanigans by a few characters who are supposed to be the standard comic relief. I think the intention was to depict these figures as lovable goofballs who are doing what they can to cope with prison life. That intention fails completely, since they never give any indication that life in the POW camp is anything but a time for frivolity and pranks, as if they are just grade school brats away at summer camp.<br/><br/>Evidently, the idea was to have a film that was half-comedy and half-drama, but the comedic portions come off as annoying, time-consuming filler until the film can resume the interesting drama - and real story - involving Holden as the self-centered and unpopular fellow prisoner who is singled out as the traitor in the barracks.<br/><br/>Actually, the dry, cynical humor from Holden and some others would have provided just the right balance of comic relief. Unfortunately, the scenes in which the Shapiro and ""Animal"" characters all-too often dominate are virtually unbearable. Their inane antics are pathetically unfunny. The presence of the ""Animal"" in particular is made even more repulsive by the over-the-top attempt to appear grungy-charming while only coming off as a constant, grotesque and distracting irritant to what you really want to see.<br/><br/>It really is a shame. You can also take away the guy with the nasally voice who reads announcements. Toss him out with Shapiro, and the ""Animal"" and actually you might have a very enjoyable film."
"davidjanuzbrown","10","6","7","14 August 2012"," An Absolute Classic
","I have read a lot of reviews of this film, and sad to say, people do not get it. The problem (From the POW point of view) is a lack of discipline. The way that ""Animial"" and ""Blondie"" conducted themselves would not be tolerated according to any kind of military code you can possibly think of. This goes back to Duke (Neville Brand) who as barracks head, is responsible. The exception to this is of course, Sefton (William Holden), who although out for himself, is always neat, and organized. This kind of lose atmosphere makes it easy for the Germans (Or any other enemy) to slip a mole into the camp. Spoilers: The reason I like Sefton is he is smart. He knows that he does not really have a chance of escape, and will wait out the rest of the war (If necessary). In particular he is smart not befriending anyone except ""Cookie"" (Gil Stratton), who the film is shown through the eyes of. There is an old NAVY adage, ""Loose Lips Sink Ships"" and there are always informants (If not outright moles) in almost every kind of prison environment, so Sefton's strategy is correct. It basically is survival for Sefton, until he is suspected of being a traitor by the camp(Two POWs were killed by the Germans), and he is given a ""Blanket Party"" by his fellow POW's and beaten up bad. He realizes his strategy of deal making and having fun with Russian Women will end, and he has to uncover the traitor or he will get killed. His opportunity comes, when Lt. James Dunbar (Don Taylor) is snatched out of the Commandant Von Scherbach's (Otto Preminger) office, and Von Scherbach needs to contact the mole in order to find out where he is. What happens is a phony air raid warning is given and the men are ordered out of the barracks, and Sgt. Schultz (Sig Ruman) meets with the mole who turns out to be Sgt. Price (Peter Graves), who runs security. They set up a system where Price signals Schultz by tying the cord on the light, and the air raid warning comes, and he sends notes to Von Scherbach via a chess piece. This time however, who is hiding in the shadows but Sefton who now knows the truth. But the key is proving it. What happens is the POW's have to hide Dunbar (It turned out to be in the water tower), and Price was going to be involved, but Sefton demanded to be guarded my security, so if something bad happens, they don't have a patsy. Thus Price has no idea where Dunbar is. At the end of the film, the plan is to smuggle Dunbar out of the camp, and Price volunteers to do it. Everyone agreed except Sefton says that Duke already turned over Dunbar to the Germans, and Duke says how he had to keep everyone off of Sefton, but keep his mouth shut. Sefton then starts to interrogate Price and asks him when did the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, Price says December 7th. Sefton asks ""What were you doing?"" Price said ""Eating Dinner"". Sefton: ""Eating Dinner in Berlin."" Price said: ""That means nothing, you are not listing to him are you?"" Duke says ""I want to hear what he has to say."" Sefton then searches Price, and finds the chess piece, and has the proof he needs. Sefton then comes up with a plan about how to get Dunbar out of the tower, and the camp, which is to use Price as a decoy, throw him out in the yard, while Sefton takes Dunbar out. Duke is reluctant but Sefton points out ""It is Price or Dunbar, its up to you?"", and Animal says ""if we kill him they can retaliate and if he is freed, he can be placed in another POW Camp, but if the Germans do it, nothing can happen to us."" They agree to do it, and Price gets shot, and Von Scherbach has an evil smirk on his face, until he sees who got killed, as this occurs, Sefton and Dunbar get away. Much is made of the smile on Sefton's face when he said goodbye to the Camp, showing he is not the total hard ass as he seemed to be, but keep in mind, that he brought Dunbar with him, so he was a hero. What is unsaid but you know will happen is Von Scherbach and Schultz will pay for what happened to Price (The Reich did not tolerate failure) and will end up at the Russian Front or before a Court Martial. Note: Both were extremely deserving of this, in particular, Von Scherbach with his abuse of prisoners (In Nazi Germany itself, Field Marshal Hermann Goering would not approve of those actions (The Luftwaffe ran the POW Camps and he respected POW's, unlike the Gestapo, and what they did to Jews and other enemies of the state). Finally, I cannot believe anyone who has seen this film can give it less then 10/10 stars. It is an absolute classic."

The opening sets the tone of the story perfectly, as two prisoners attempt to escape through a tunnel.

"jem132","10","7","10","7 April 2008"," The essential POW drama!
","This exciting POW drama has to be one of Wilder's best films. Like nearly all his work, it is extremely well-written, cynical and very witty. It also surprises how much (dark) humour Wilder managed to pull out this situation.<br/><br/>William Holden (winner of the Best Actor Oscar, an interesting and worthy choice by the Academy) stars as Sefton, a Sergeant in a POW camp in Germany in WW2, who may or not be selling out his fellow soldiers in order to get a better deal from the Nazi's. Another thing that really impressed me was how Wilder sustained the suspense of the plot (Who is the traitor?) for so long. Wilder encourages us, nay, implores us through his silently roving camera and objectivity, to question everyone. And we do, from Sefton to ""Animal"" to Joey.<br/><br/>This should be regarded as one of Wilder's best films. It's exceptional film-making. Wilder's films remain so fresh today because of his near-perfect scripts that have possess honesty instead of sentimentality, and his willingness to let his characters and story impress instead of burdening the film with showy technique. He also took on a range of different story lines. Bravo, Billy Wilder!"
"elsinefilo","Null","7","10","5 July 2006"," not just a prison flick story...but a prison camp story tinctured with dark but entertaining humor
","Stalag 17 is surely not a typical,usual prison-flick story.It's set at a prisoner of war camp which is muddy,desolate and oppressive.The movie opens with the men of the barracks,where six hundred American sergeants are held,plotting an escape. While the prisoners talk every little detail of the escape plan and send their friends Manfredi and Johnson to a tunnel they dug under a barbed wire one of the prisoners stands out and opens a bet that Manfredi and Jonson never make it through the forest surrounding camp. When Manfredi and Johnson are shot right way after they emerge from the other end of the tunnel the prisoners jump to conclusions that Sefton,who bets on the escape, is a stoolie. They actually have the wrong guy but Sefton is not someone liked around either. He is a cynical,cold guy who trades blatantly with the German soldiers for eggs, silk stockings, blankets and other luxuriousnesses for a POW in a camp. He also organizes rat races and and manages a portable distillery in the barracks.So just because he is not a straight-arrow it won't be easy for him to disprove the rash conclusions of the sergeants. The plot may sound a bit common maybe as I put it but the movie actually is not.Generally I do not like a genre being tilted towards another genre.If you are doing a war movie then take your job seriously but I feel like for the first time I did not frown upon the amount of humor in the movie.I read some viewers have been disappointed at the amount of dark-humour ""in what should be a true war drama."" But in an environment where they have no heating facilities (like even a simple stove),eat terrible foot,bathe in the latrine sinks,walk through the muddy walkways they try to keep sane thanks to that humor.By this way they really defy the cynical,cold,mocking air of von Scherbach (Otto Preminger) and their stupid supervisor Sergeant Schulz (Sig Ruman.)I do not like to tell anything controversial about IMDb's top 250 list again but I can't help it.There are many(and probably will be many more) movies that I'm disappointed by in this list but this one (as specifically not a usual,simple faded prison flick story) perfectly met my expectations."
"Tipu","Null","9","14","15 November 1999"," An entertainer with serious questions
","'Stalag 17' is one of the best movies I have seen. It is uproariously funny, it is immensely suspenseful & it has characters you will root for (though not necessarily William Holden - the designated hero!). At times the camarederie between the concentration camp inmates is like boys in a college hostel. One of them is the teacher's pet & feeds him with confidential information. Some lust after the girls in the hostel across the road. Another one runs illegal gambling & bootlegging operations. The story is that of the coming of age of the last named, William Holden.<br/><br/>In between the fun & sweat, some important issues crop up. To whom is a person ultimately responsible - himself or his country. Both are causes worth fighting for & Wilder makes convincing cases for each. Class conflict in a strictly disciplined body is also tackled, as is the gay subtext in a prison camp. The last theme has been an issue in many POW movies - Great Escape, Bridge on the River Kwai, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence. In the interplay of the Shapiro & Animal characters in 'S17' with the latter's Betty Grable obsession, we see enough evidences of this. The film's most magical moment to me is when the inmates of Stalag 17 sing & dance to the old confed. song Johnny Comes Marching Home Again'. It is sure to give you goosebumps!<br/><br/>This is a great movie, & should be seen over & over again."
"dimplet","Null","4","5","6 August 2011"," One of William Holden's finest roles
","William Holden surely never expected that Stalag 17 would be one of the handful of movies he would most be remembered for. He didn't want to do the movie, and was forced to, under contract to the studio. I see that Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas both turned it down. Apparently, they all detested what the character represented. <br/><br/>But a juicy role like this is precisely what a real actor dreams of; it is a chance to prove your chops. Jack Nicholson understood this, and was always looking for out of character roles to extend his range. It is only when an actor delivers a performance out of character that you really know they can act. It convinced his peers, who gave him the Academy Award for best actor. <br/><br/>There is a lot of humor, surely more than in real life, but it seems to get the right balance, and to have set a precedent. Catch-22, Slaughterhouse Five, M*A*S*H and, of course, Hogan's Heroes (which was obviously based on Stalag 17) all use humor to make the awful blackness of war bearable. But I think if this were remade today, more realism in the secondary characters would be expected.<br/><br/>spoiler alert:<br/><br/>I like the arc of the story, the cynical POW who has no plans to escape ironically changing his mind and becoming something of a hero. It produces a very satisfying conclusion. But then, it is in character, as there is profit if he succeeds. And given all his scheming and bartering, Holden is more likely to succeed than the others.<br/><br/>Robert Graves takes on the role of the real bad guy, and from his performance, we wouldn't guess who he was, but then he was a lot younger. <br/><br/>If you don't already know Sig Ruman, you haven't seen enough old films. To Be Or Not To Be is another of his great roles. Otto Preminger is another German expat in the movie, and one we saw very rarely as an actor. <br/><br/>The movie begs the question of the viewer, what would you have done in a German POW camp? I have a fair amount of sympathy with the Holden character. Escape seemed improbable, and pointless so near the end of the war. Life was bad, but not nearly as bad as in a Japanese POW camp, where your chances of survival were not good. <br/><br/>The movie avoids stereotyping the Preminger and Ruman characters as evil Germans, though they were not nice people, either. What we see are a lot of different, colorful characters, each with their own strategy for coping with the situation, each honorable from their own perspective, even, I suppose, Grave's German-American spy.<br/><br/>In the end, Holden's character was honorable and redeemed himself. It's strange, in retrospect, that Heston and Douglas didn't understand this."

","Most Americans who never went to World War Two, received their information through wire services, radio and any outlet which brought the war home. Since films were plentiful, this movie took Prisoner of War life and brought it to the heartland of America. The film is called "" Stalag 17 "" and is the best representation of said life as envisioned by consummate director Billy Wilder. The story takes place in 1944, during the famous Battle of the Buldge. 600 American soldiers, Sargents all, share the minimal and miserable existence of Prisoners of War. One night, two prisoners try a planned night-time escape, but are quickly captured and murdered. Because they were so easily betrayed, the rest of the men in the barracks suspect a traitor lives among them. But who? Neville Brand, who plays 'Duke' quickly suspects the most cynical of their group, one J.J. Sefton. (William Holden). This is because, Sefton is at ease in the prison and creates suspicion when getting along with the enemy. He also is content to not be seen as a hero. When the two men are killed, his fellow prisoners suspect he will also betray the new arrival, one Lt.James Dunbar (Don Taylor) who is accused of destroying a German ammunition train. Otto Preminger plays Col. Von Scherbach, the German commandant of the camp. Robert Strauss who is Stanislas Kasava and Harvey Lembeck, as Harry Shapiro play the camp clowns and bring much humor into an otherwise dreary existence. Richard Erdman, Peter Graves and Sig Ruman who plays German Sgt. Johann Schulz complete the main cast. Together the entire film is a remarkable tribute to the soldiers who suffered at the hands of the German and thus created a living memory which in turn gave us this war time Classic. Easilly recommended. ****"

Their scenes in the mud and drooling over the egg like Marty Feldman reminded me of Young Frankenstein, only Mel Brooks would never have jammed two such glaringly unsuited styles together in such a ham-fisted manner.<br/><br/>I was ready to turn off the film again when the prisoner with the grover-like voice came in to parrot orders and attention a short while later.<br/><br/>While the suspense mounted and the film improved, moments like those and the amiable relationship between the prisoners of the featured barrack and their German babysitter for lack of a more adequate term (though I doubt one exists) stuck in my mind and prevented me from enjoying what seemed like a very well crafted story. I can see how it survived as a play, some of the dialogue is sparing and to the point. I doubt very much that theatre audiences would have tolerated the two near-imbeciles that Hollywood seemed to think were the missing ingredient for transition to film. But then again, I found the same character on everyone loves Raymond to be insulting to me as a viewer because I'm no longer 6 years old, but many didn't seem to mind it. Perhaps I am stuck longing for a perfect movie and this had a few ingredients to take it to that level, and many stumbling blocks to ensure it never reached that point.<br/><br/>Billy has done solid drama and comedy, but I would rank this a failure, despite what were likely good intentions on his part.<br/><br/>Fans of Billy should check out Some like it Hot, fans of Holden should check out just about everything he's ever done, apart from this, through no fault of his own.

Maybe if you had never heard of or seen Renoir's Grand Illusion, then it might seem worthwhile, but, in comparison, this film is a pile of manure. I did not laugh once, nor did I ever even crack a smile. The characters are of sitcom depth. In fact, the sitcom about a similar situation, Hogan's Heroes, has more depth (and more comedy) than this film. I wanted to murder the actor who played Animal throughout the whole movie. His mugging for the camera was painful to watch, as was his voice. The dialogue feels like it was written by a mechanic, it is so repetitive. And there is hardly an ounce of humanity to any character in this whole film...<br/><br/>with one exception: William Holden. He delivers an excellent performance as a man wrongly accused of being a snitch. In fact, I despised every other character in the film, thinking that the Germans, even the German spy, had more integrity than they did. Alas, Holden has no chance to save this film. Those people who had falsely accuse him simply jump onto his bandwagon near the end of the film and they are supposed to be forgiven by the viewer?

There are scenes in the movie that are classics and overall it should be dubbed as ""one of the best"" movies of the century. This is a movie that I believe I could watch over and over and never get tired of it. I rate this movie a ""10""."
"raggedclaws","5","9","17","20 November 2000"," An overrated comedy
","I saw this movie based upon the rating and user comments in this forum (usually they're dead on), but this movie is stupid.  A very predictable drama with way too much slapstick comedy that provides a far too euphemistic view of what it must have been like in a German POW camp during WWII.  It is basically Hogan's Heroes, a stupid TV comedy based on this movie (I would guess, given their incredible similarities).  If you like old comedies with a touch of easy drama, see this movie; if you're looking for a more substantive drama, see one of Billy Wilder's other more memorable movies like ""Sunset Blvd"" or ""Sabrina"".  William Holden is a wonderful actor, and he seems so out of place amongst this motley crew of comedians working through a lame plot.  A big disappointment."
"secondtake","7","5","8","29 January 2011"," The first great WWII prison film, bordering on farce, but compact and terrific
","Stalag 17 (1953)<br/><br/>A far reaching precursor to the Stalag 13 of television's ""Hogan's Heroes"" and a bracing splash in the face for Americans grasping, still, the repercussions of WWII, ""Stalag 17"" was and is sharp, funny, and compact. On one simple level, it's enjoyable as a tightly made film, period. The acting, writing, editing, and photography--coordinated of course by now legendary director Billy Wilder--snaps like a whip, and two hours goes by fast. A host of minor actors pull of major performances, and the one really big name, William Holden, has the most unusual role, and he gives it an unfriendly edge that really helps save the movie. <br/><br/>Save the movie, that is, from a kind of frivolousness. It is, at its core, a really well made sitcom. The situation is a Nazi prison camp, not the kind of place we expect humor. And the comedy comes from making fun of the Nazis, who are always fair game. The reference to ""Hogan's Heroes"" is no joke, for those who have seen that 1960s series around the same situation (even including a comic Sgt. Schultz). The producers of ""Stalag 17"" sued the producers of ""Hogan's Heroes"" and won. But Stalag is not just a comic romp. There are shades of bitterness that reflect a real camp--almost the kind of gallows humor you need to survive a horrible situation. And there is also a serious strand about who you can trust, about finding the traitor on the inside, and about persecuting the wrong man. <br/><br/>Strictly a studio production, this falls just three years after Wilder's ""Sunset Blvd""which uses Holden in another embittered role, and which makes fun of studio productions and Hollywood in general. Though based on a Broadway play, it rises above any sense of being set on a stage, and yet it really does not achieve any sense of realism. It's just short of a farce. The narration at the start announces that here, at last, we will have a movie not about the front and fighting, but about prisoners in a prison camp. It announces, that is, that it will be a different kind of WWII film.<br/><br/>And it is. Holden won best actor for his role. Otto Preminger, the great German director working in Hollywood (and bucking the censors there), plays the commandant of the prison. And Peter Graves is another prominent prisoner, a counterpart to Holden. The photography is by none other than the great Ernest Laszlo, and Franz Waxman heads up the music. It's no wonder it's a smart, sharp, snappy film. What it isn't, however, is deep or probing or moving. It's an entertainment, and a great one, but it keeps any larger expectations in check. And so should you."
"telegonus","8","8","15","26 November 2002"," Breakout
","This was the breakout movie that put its star, William Holden, on the map. He was in his mid-thirties when it came out, and had been making pictures for close to fifteen years. His first major role, Golden Boy, made him a promising newcomer back in 1939, and for the next decade he toiled as a medium grade star without showing any potential for growth. Then, director Billy Wilder cast him as the gigolo in Sunset Boulevard, and things began to pick up. It was an edgier Holden now, no longer the Smilin' Jim of his youth. Wilder also directed Stalag 17, and this is the one that put Holden over the top, winning him an Academy Award for Best Actor. He never gave a better performance. You can see why Holden became the top male star of the fifties here. Like all great stars, he works by contrasting different aspects of his personality. His character is a wheeler-dealer in a World War II German POW camp. He'll sell or make book or anything. Nobody likes him. Well, almost nobody. He doesn't horse around with the other guys. Holden's basically polite, seemingly All-American personality is at odds with the character he plays. There's a refinement to him, a vulnerability, that doesn't really fit in with this hard guy part. Yet this works in his favor, and makes him all the more interesting to watch. This is, after all, a movie, not a stage play, and movies work differently. Holden lets us see inside his character, not a lot, but enough to know that he's basically a decent guy. It's almost obvious. To us, that is. Because we're watching a movie. But the other POW's see Holden as he projects himself to them,--as a selfish jerk. This is fine for the character, who wants to be alone anyway. We know that this is basically a defense on Holden's part. The tension between what we know and how Holden presents himself is what makes the movie so marvelous. Holden's not just good in Stalag 17, he's sublime.<br/><br/>As to the rest of the picture, much of it's standard issue service comedy of the Mr. Roberts-Teahouse Of the August Moon kind popular at the time, only it's set in a prison camp. A nice gallows touch. No wonder Wilder was drawn to the play the movie's based on. He handles the straight suspense and intrigue stuff well enough, but overall this isn't his best work. The best scene is near the end, when the soldiers are celebrating and dancing, singing ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"", during which a crucial piece of information is revealed. It's a long scene, and at first seems like journeyman work, and when we realize when it's over that Holden heard everything that two characters were talking about, the effect is nearly breathtaking, and the movie, which had been a little fuzzy around the edges up till this time, comes sharply into focus, and stays there till the end."
"ksneath","7","4","6","9 March 2008"," Solid film in the vein of (but preceding) the Great Escape
","Among the countless WWII films, there are a relative few that focus on what transpired in prison camps. The most famous of course is The Great Escape, which is well deserving of its recognition. This subject matter makes for a very watchable film, as Stalag 17 is.<br/><br/>The plot focuses around a ""stoolie"" within one of the bunkhouses. The captives in this house are constantly having their secrets discovered and their plans stymied, with sometimes serious consequences. Obviously there must be a traitor among them, but who is it? This problem creates a certain tension throughout most of the film and keeps the film quite viewable throughout. This movie does an excellent job of progressively revealing more and more about the true nature of what is happening (to the point where you know exactly what is going on), while at the same time sustaining the tension.<br/><br/>The film also provides much comic relief, some of which is genuinely funny, and some of which fell flat (in my opinion) and distracted from the actual plot. Particularly distracting was the over the top performance of Robert Strauss as ""Animal"" who was just too goofy for my tastes. In several scenes the film almost gains a ""screwball"" feeling, which didn't fit the content of this movie.<br/><br/>However, in spite of that the film is very well worth watching for its underlying plot and the interaction between many others of the cast. Good war film which deals with an unusual subject."
"jack.hunter","7","4","6","26 August 2003"," Good for the time but the humor is severely dated.
","I remembered liking this film very much 40 years ago, but after watching it recently I was startled by how dated it appeared.  For me what was most distracting was the juvenile humor of the characters Animal (Robert Strauss) and Harry ""Hot Lips"" Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck).  Not only is the humor juvenile but both of them have much too much screen time.  I would imagine it worked much better in the stage play.  Holden, Graves, Brand, Preminger, etc., of the supporting cast are excellent as usual.  Unfortunately, there is way too much silliness going on in this POW camp for the movie to be taken very seriously.  When a German guard gives his rifle to a pow so he can play volleyball it completely loses any claim to realism and should be treated strictly as a comedy."

I'm afraid I'd have to say it's not even worth seeing. Especially if you saw Sunset Blvd. (which is an excellent film by the way, better than All About Eve in my opinion). It just acts as a stain in Wilder's opus. I'm not derogating his director skills but I really don't understand what was he trying to achieve here: a light comedy wrapped in a a war picture cellophane? It just doesn't do it for me. Off course it looks realistic (the scenery does) and it should 'cause it wasn't shot in the studio but the story, and those comic reliefs (especially the one in which German soldier gives his rifle to a prisoner so he could play volleyball) to shallow and simpleminded. Although the German speaking sequences give it an even more naturalistic tone (once again I would like to point out the main problem of the film is presentation of the story through humor) it's thumbs down for this one."
"Ben_Cheshire","8","5","10","18 July 2004"," Solid, classy Billy Wilder flick is nothing flashy, not hilarious, but it draws you in expertly.
","Stalag 13 is indeed another Billy Wilder classic. His movies develop well, have good characters, good suspense, and often utilise visual cues particularly well.  The light cord above the chess game which signifies that the mole has left a message for the Nazi officers is used wonderfully here.<br/><br/>Its just a nice, well-made POW drama. I think it was going overboard a little bit giving William Holden an academy award - he was always just William Holden! But he has a nice presence in this movie. My problem with him is as soon as he starts talking, the audience knows ""ok, this is a movie."" And, more often than not, it makes it feel like an old movie. So as soon as i get drawn into the world of the picture, Holden's voice shoves me straight back out again.<br/><br/>Despite this fact, its a very absorbing and involving drama. Not hardened drama, of course. This is not Five Easy Pieces. Billy Wilder's trademark was dealing with dark and bitter material with humour - so everything in his movies is palatable to all viewers. This'll mean more people will get the opportunity to experience the issues it raises.<br/><br/>8/10. Not groundbreaking, but very very classy stuff."

As the guards seem to be more and more aware of the prisoner's activities the POW's turn on Septon, who deals regular trades with the guards.  However Septon knows he's innocent and sets about to find who the real informer is.<br/><br/>Adapted from a Broadway play this film is an uneasy but enjoyable mix of comedy and Steve McQueen's sections from The Great Escape.  The comedy is pretty funny  ranging from the broad comedy of Animal, Schlitz et al to the more subtle things such as the German officer putting on his boots to speak to Berlin HQ.  However the wartime drama section doesn't work as well and is a bit of a letdown after a comedy first half.  However it's still quite entertaining  even if it is a little uneven.<br/><br/>The cast are good overall  although the comedy figures have the best characters.  Preminger, Taylor, Strauss etc are all good but I imagine it must have been quite a thin year when Holden won his Best Actor Oscar for this rather dour performance  maybe they were rewarding an earlier performance that he should have won for (that seems to be the way it's done now  Dame Judi Dench anyone?!).<br/><br/>Overall it's an enjoyable wartime comedy, but the uneven mix of drama and comedy doesn't sit well together and this is far from being Wilder at his best.  To prove the point  the spin off Hogan's Hero dropped the drama (and all but one character) in favour of straight laughs."
"denscul","5","5","10","12 October 2000"," Great Movie even with flawed plot.
","Any movie that launches a successful TV series and captures an Oscar for the lead can't be all that bad. But the idea that the Germans would put a ""spy"" inside an American POW camp (comprised of sergeants) is ludicrous. After watching the film in 2006, I learned that Wilder, who was the Director, Producer and one of the writers, broke off his relationship with Paramount when the film was shown in Germany, and the American spy became a Polish spy. Wilder, who had some relatives die in German concentration camps may have been justified for personal reasons, but I think the character ""Security"" was a way for Wilder to portray his anti-German feelings. (This movie was made less than a decade after WWII ended).<br/><br/>When an artist crosses the line between telling the truth, and starts to engage in propaganda he becomes a hack. There were many goofs made in this movie that illustrated to me that the truth was stretched to cartoon-like proportions. With Nazi manpower stretched to the limit, that the Nazi's would place a spy in a barracks full of sergeants does not make the main plot line believable. It would have been an odious job, and require a professional whose service would have been more valuable at another pursuit. Perhaps the Germans had used a Polish Prisoner to keep track of other prisoners, and wanted to give the film the plausibility it lacked in the original version.<br/><br/>The film begins ""a few weeks before Christmas"" in 1944. Hundress of American Bombers had crashed inside Germany. Not only did they know everything about their aircraft, the Nazi's had put together pieces of our planes, and had flown them inside US bomber formations as a battle tactic.<br/><br/>When Lt. Dunbar is assigned temporarily to the barracks, I wondered why the character couldn't have just been another sergeant. But then William Holden's character couldn't have given the audience the impression that Dunbar's mother's money got him through pilot training. I am not a writer, but I was a USAF pilot, and I know that money and influence doesn't help a bit when your flying solo. Also, did anyone notice that Lt. Dunbar had to look at his dog tags when asked what his serial number was? I can still remember my original numbers, and that was 41 years ago. The scene where Dunbar is sleep deprived (a Geneva convention violation) and in walks the Geneva Accord Representative. To quote one line from the movie, ""the Krauts may be dumb, but they're not stupid. And everyone seemed to have watches. Are we to believe that watches would not have been stolen by the guards, exchanged for food, blankets and other favors? The writers have Lt. Dunbar being taken away from the camp as a sabateur because he blew up an ammunition train. Is it plausible that a matchbook with a cigarette stuck inside could be thrown inside a train, and three minutes later an fire would consume boxes of ammo with a resulting explosion. How far can one throw book of matches with a cigarette? Do German Ammo cars always travel with their doors open? Did anyone associated with this movie ever handle ammo. It's very hard to ignite, except in the way its intended to be used., i.e, a firing pin, or a very hot fire is necessary for ignition.<br/><br/>Since this movie takes place in a mountainous area in Germany, and the time of year is the beginning of winter, Lt. Dunbar would have died of hypothermia, standing in the water tower. Why the Authors choose to put him in the water tower seems more far fetched that the smoke bomb excape from the SS guards. <br/><br/>Several commentators have mentioned King Rat in comparison with this movie. Holden won and deserved his Academy Award. But George Siegal was even better in King Rat, and the plot was more believable because Rat was a complete and believable movie. Siegal's character becomes just one more enlisted man whose throne is overturned by the liberation of the camp. In Stalag, as several reviewers have mentioned, is flawed because we don't know whether the excape is successful, and the consequences of the others is unknown."

","I was looking forward to seeing this film, after all the rave reviews, and was stunned by how flat-footed and obvious it was, not to mention how tone deaf it was. Hitchcock was a master at tone-blending (see, for example, North by Northwest). The tones in Stalag aren't integrated or meaningful. They're simply out of control, as the script veers from schtick to sentiment to hints of the brutal reality of World War II. Strauss and Lembeck are eating the scenery. Holden earns his name and Wilder's undying gratitude for giving this blather a center, providing someone to watch and something to think about. That said, the cinematographer and editor do a nice job despite being saddled with stage rather than film sets."
"Karl Self","6","3","5","31 August 2008"," Nazi Prison Camp Rigmarole
","Stalag 17 is easily the strangest movie I've ever seen. It's a whodunnit, a slapstick comedy, a thriller, and a gritty war movie, all rolled into one. Made by people, Billy Wilder among them, who knew full well about the horrors of Nazi camps, and a mere eight years after the end of the war. And this wild concoction managed to snaffle an Oscar and was later ripped off as a TV series. Wow.<br/><br/>While this has some hallmarks of Billy Wilder's genius, it's simply too wild a mixture. I never knew whether to laugh about the prison guards or to be afraid of them, and ended up doing neither. For the same reason the suspense doesn't work. The humour from the comedic trio Animal, Shapiro and Sgt. Schulz (""Do you speaken ze German?"" - ""Ya!"" - ""Then droppen Sie dead!"") or Marko The Mailman (""Alright, at ease, at ease!"") was a bit too low-brow and grinding for my taste, and eventually got onto my nerves.<br/><br/>Watch out for the evil Nazi camp commander played by Otto Preminger, an Austro-Hungarian Jew like Wilder. I'm sure he had a blast in his role.<br/><br/>While it's probably safe to say that no real POW camp was much like the depicted Stalag 17, the movie wasn't that far off the mark in many aspects. For an Anglo-American or French POW, life at such a camp probably was an ambivalent experience. I guess the jovial rapport between the prisoners and guardsman Schulz, for example, wasn't entirely without precedent. But don't make the mistake of mixing up the relatively sheltered situation at camps for Western POWs with the situation of Russian POWs (who were routinely murdered), the situation in concentration camps inside the Reich or even the large extermination camps in Eastern Europe.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I visited the memorial site of a real Stalag the day after I saw the movie. The contrast couldn't have been bigger. While the depicted Stalag 17 was like a summer camp behind barbed wire set in idyllic California, the camp I visited was an enormous, industrialised affair, with many tens of thousands of prisoners from all around the globe. And the nearby camp of foxy female prisoners was sadly lacking.<br/><br/>The title is erroneous, by the way. A POW camp set inside of the German empire would have been numbered with Roman numerals, i. e. ""Stalag XVII"".<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie. Like I said, it's a mixed bag, and hasn't aged too well. There are better Billy Wilder movies."

STALAG 17 (Paramount, 1953) followed the original Broadway Stage Production of May 1951-June 1952 and 472 live performances. The play's Director, old ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", Himself, Jose Ferrer, won a Tony for his efforts.<br/><br/>But once the arrangements were made for adaptation to the still Silver Screen (the Movie Version was filmed in ""Glorious Black & White!""); the Directorial Duties would cede to one Samuel ""Billy"" Wilder. Mr. Wilder had all of the necessary skills and balance of the serious, the tragic, the humorous and the ridiculous to pull off the Seri-Comic qualities which are inextricably blended and intermingled in the Play; be it on Stage or Screen.<br/><br/>WE notice that there are only 2 carry-overs in roles from the Stage to the Screen. Those two being Harvey Lembeck (Harry Shapiro) and Robert Strauss (called ""Stosh"" on Stage, but Stanislaus Kasava or ""Animal"" in the film. Same Character as ""Stosh"" or more properly, ""Stash"" is nickname for Stanislaus.), were the only two to make the cut.<br/><br/>OUR STORY.It's 1944, somewhere in Germany in a P.O.W. Camp barracks of Stalag 17. The camp is filled with Non-Coms*, being those paragons of intermediate authority, Sergeants. The camp's particular barracks has a problem for which that the inmates must find a solution. There is a one among them that no one wants; being a traitor, an informant a Kraut Spy! Aloof, cool and very business like, Sgt. Frank Sefton (William Holden) is Suspect ""Numero Uno"". Sefton, it seems, has no interest in anything else but himself and his sundry money making enterprises. His only confidant is Cookie (Gil Stratton) who runs some of his games (Rat Races, things like that!) and keeps his ""Books"".<br/><br/>The inmates deal daily with one German Sgt. Schultz (Sig Ruman) who seems very benevolent, but underneath this façade, he is a loyal German Soldier and true Nazi. On occasion, the prisoners have the experience of being addressed directly by the Camp Commandant, Colonel von Scheurbach (Otto Preminger, making a rare on camera appearance). The Colonel is a bitter former Cavalry Officer, who now, being relegated to this definitely below-his-dignity job. This is, by the way, a truly outstanding characterization by Mr. Preminger, quite possibly being done as a favor to Mr. Wilder.<br/><br/>All's well in the end as the real informant is discovered and dealt with as Sefton splits the scene, taking the Socially Prominent and Wealthy (in Civilian Life), Lieutenant Dunbar, out with him. THE END. (We tried not to give away too much, right Schultz?) STALAG 17 has a tremendous cast, and other than the appearance of some ""Russian Women"" prisoners, it's an all male cast. And what an outstanding line-up it is! Other than the previously mentioned William Holden, Harvey Lembeck, Robert Strauss, Otto Preminger and Sig Ruman; we have an ""Army"" of others. With all shining in their parts, we must salute: Richard Erdman, Peter Graves, Neville Brand (one of the top decorated Soldiers in the ""real"" War!), Michael Moore (not the same guy, obviously), Peter Baldwin, Robinson Stone, Robert Shawley, William Pierson, Jay Lawrence, Erwin Kaiser, Edmund Trzcinski, et al! Peter Graves once said in an interview that being in this picture should have been a real boost for his career. But going to the movies was in decline in the 1950's; so Mr. Graves joined his real life bro, James Arness (GUNSMOKE) in Television, as Mr. Jim on ""FURY"".<br/><br/>STALAG 17, of course, was the inspiration for its own take-off, ""HOGAN'S HEROES"" (Bing Crosby Productions/CBS TV, 1965-71); but that's another story! <br/><br/>NOTE: * ""Non-Com"" a Non-Commissioned Officer, such as a Corporal, Sergeant or, in the Navy or Coast Guard, a Petty Officer."

Sefton trying to find out who the mole in the barracks is after being accused of the title. Wilder pulls a genius move in never revealing if Sefton isn't the spy after all. He simply shows Sefton trying to blame someone else, and all we can do is sit and wonder if he really is a Nazi spy or someone else is. It all comes crashing down in the climax, and you will not be disappointed.

"billymac72","Null","3","5","3 February 2003"," 3 packs of cigarettes say they never get out of the woods!
","I grew up with this movie & have seen it countless times, so admittedly my opinion may be a little biased at this point. Nonetheless, there seems to be an issue with this film that can't be easily ignored. It is precisely the same issue that dogged ""Hogan's Heroes"" (which, along with ""Great Escape,"" this was loosely based): how can you make fun of war, especially the Nazis? Does making fun of them, or the situation, demonstrate total disregard for the nightmare they inflicted upon generations?<br/><br/>First off, there are a number of well-respected people (philosopher & Holocaust survivor, Viktor Frankl and even Mel Brooks come to mind) who believe humor, by virtue of its freedom, is a powerful threat against the villainous fools of this world. Not to mention, humor has a therapeutic value that has been utilized through the most horrendous of circumstances (wartime being one of them - again I refer back to Frankl). ""Hogan's Heroes,"" it could be argued, was irresponsible because it doesn't really portray the true villainy of the Nazis, and the motivations of the POW escapes are extremely implausable (Hogan would casually leave - often through such ridiculous escape devices as a hollowed out tree stump - to attend a Nazi ball with a hot date & inexplicably, willingly return to the camp! What happened to duty?). Apart from showcasing what is perhaps Holden's finest performance, ""Stalag 17"" IS responsible in its depiction of Nazi terror (at least relative to its own, contained story about a Nazi mole amongst American prisoners.). Watching this as a child, I never thought the POWs had it easy. Their living conditions are cramped, dirty, cold, uncomfortable & deprived (remember that this came out not too long after the war ended, and more than one veteran I've had the opportunity to meet was impressed by the accuracy of the conditions, uniforms, attitudes & lingo. By the way, many of these actors had served themselves, such as the highly decorated Neville Brand). There are no showers, mattresses consist of a pile of straw atop a blanket, and the food is of the watered-down stew and bread variety. I could only hope to have a Harry & The Animal around to help me cope with such a situation!<br/><br/>The commandant (Preminger) is somewhat cartoonish, but he's never shown as anything but cruel (he leaves the two bodies of escapees laying on display in the mud for all of the soldiers to look at; he continually punishes the men by depriving them of luxuries such as a stove - their only source for heat - in the wintertime; he lies and manipulates Geneva representatives and has escapees killed on sight). Does this compare to the terrors of the Holocaust? Of course not. Is it a fairly accurate depiction of German World War II POW camps for enlisted American G.I.s? From what I understand, yes. The soldiers are dedicated to escaping (okay, save for Harry & The Animal's foray into the Russian compound), are smart aleck and defiant to the Germans, entertain each other in highly creative ways and create the feeling of a community (albeit an incarcerated one) that comes off as realistic to me given their circumstances. For the type of movie this is, the details contained herein have always been enough to establish the underlying hardship for me without sacrificing the tone of the plot. This is a truly great film that functions well as a comedy, a mystery-thriller, actioner and drama. There are many different individual stories to be told in any war, and while each example can't possibly encapsulate everything, the stories need to be true at least unto themselves if they are to be told well at all. `Stalag 17' is responsible on those terms."
"jan-wiberg","Null","4","8","27 June 2004"," After three viewings, I saw the light
","The first time I saw Stalag 17, I mainly saw it as a comedy with serious undertones. I laughed myself silly at the scene where all the POWs do a nasty take-off on Hitler (that scene is still my favorite) and got a great deal of amusement from Animal's obsession with Betty Grable. When I watched the movie again after a year or so, I felt almost disappointed since I noticed how the humor wears out midway through and gritty realism gets the upper hand. The plot about finding the right stoolie and escaping the harsh conditions of the camp had me strongly rooting for the POWs, but after the film I felt a little depressed.<br/><br/>I just saw Stalag 17 a third time, and only now did I realize how well balanced the drama and humor were. We get the comedy relief first, and when it's time to concentrate on the actual storyline, the humor is shoved away (except for one last funny bit with Animal and Shapiro) and it's time to really start rooting for the prisoners.<br/><br/>I've seen nearly all movies Wilder directed, and, along with such later films as Some Like It Hot, One Two Three and Irma La Douce, Stalag 17 ranks among my favorites (I still need another viewing of Sunset Boulevard). And Holden - yes, he deserved that Oscar!"
"pzanardo","10","4","8","12 May 2000"," A masterpiece equal to Billy Wilder's major works
","""Stalag 17"" is a masterpiece, equal to Billy Wilder's major achievements ""Double Indemnity"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The seven year itch"", ""Some like it hot"".  Here we find the peak of Wilder's dislike for any rhetoric, for wholly noble characters, for untarnished heroes. The very opening of the movie is shocking: two American soldiers are trying to escape from the German war-prisoner camp ""Stalag 17"". In a barrack of the stalag, everyone is anxious about their destiny. And now comes sergeant Sefton (William Holden) betting that their mates will be caught by Germans! In fact, when they hear a burst of machine-gun, he calmly pockets the stake: the cigarettes (current money in the stalag) bet by his fellow-prisoners in the barrack. This first episode gives the tone of the whole movie. The plot is centered on the search of a mysterious spy among the American prisoners. This story is masterly written and masterly solved. The script is magnificent, a perfect blend of drama, suspense and comedy; it oozes ideas of genius. An instance: the endless queue of prisoners paying (with cigarettes) to use Holden's kind-of-telescope, to watch for few seconds the hut where the Russian female prisoners are taking showers, dreaming what is happening behind those wooden walls. Extreme care is paid to details. Have you noted that the German soldiers on guard of the stalag are all fat and old? Clear: every sound man is at the front. Holden is at his best in the role of the shrewd, cynical anti-hero Sefton. Otto Preminger, in the role of the aged, frustrated commander of the stalag, shows that he is a great actor as well as a great director. All the supporting actors are just superb. Even the funny, comic behavior of some American prisoners is psychologically convincing: young guys, even in a tragic condition, are not apt to give way to desperation. In conclusion: the genius Billy Wilder presents us a perfect work, a true masterpiece worth of his huge talent."

","I was actually extremely eager to watch this title, and rightly so. I mean : Billy Wilder, Willam Holden even Peter Graves. It's a WWII movie which is a particular favourite of mine to boot.<br/><br/>So Imagine my disappointment when this sometimes comedy, sometimes drama, mostly mystery unfolded on my screen over the course of 2 hours. What a sham! The poor directing, the over acting, the bad jokes and the rubbish story.<br/><br/>The story actually has some promise, were it to have received the right treatment. Surely the two largest problems I had with the movie is firstly the poorly timed, mostly unwelcome and often unwanted comic relief. The result is a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be : serious or silly. Secondly is the frankly abysmal mistreatment of the subject matter. This stems either from willful ignorance or shameful disregard. I'm not sure which is worse, especially considering that the movie was made less than a decade after the war in question had ended.<br/><br/>To be fair perhaps it is just a case of this movie not ageing gracefully at all. But for me this one is a confirmed miss at 4 out of 10. Go and see ""The Great Escape"" instead."

This movie is not a train wreck, but it is a huge disappointment and certainly belongs nowhere on anyone's top anything list. The story is compelling enough. There is a rat in the POW barracks and nobody knows who it is. But any hope this movie has of making it is dashed by cartoon like performances, cliché characters, preposterous situations and eye rolling stupidity throughout. Do not believe the hype. This is not a good film. Some Like It Hot is a good film, The Apartment is a great film, many Wilder films are fantastic, but this... this is not just a strike, it's one of those misses where the batter falls down.<br/><br/>William Holden won the best actor Oscar for his performance as Sefton in this film, and he deserves it, but don't let that fool you.

"Desertman84","10","2","3","26 October 2012"," A Black Comedy War Film
","Stalag 17 is a war film which tells the story of a group of American airmen held in a German World War II prisoner of war camp, who come to suspect that one of their number is a traitor. It was adapted from a Broadway play.Produced and directed by Billy Wilder, it features William Holden, Don Taylor, Robert Strauss, Neville Brand, Harvey Lembeck, and Peter Graves. Wilder also cast Otto Preminger in the role of the camp's Commandant.It was adapted by Wilder and Edwin Blum from the Broadway play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski who were both prisoners in Stalag 17B in Austria.<br/><br/>Stalag 17, exclusively populated by American sergeants, is overseen by sadistic commandant Oberst Von Schernbach and the deceptively avuncular sergeant Schultz. The inmates spend their waking hours circumventing the boredom of prison life; at night, they attempt to arrange escapes. When two of the escapees, Johnson and Manfredi, are shot down like dogs by the Nazi guards, Stalag 17's resident wiseguy Sefton callously collects the bets he'd placed concerning the fugitives' success. No doubt about it: there's a security leak in the barracks, and everybody suspects the enterprising Sefton, who manages to obtain all the creature comforts he wants of being a Nazi infiltrator. Things get particularly dicey when Lt. Dunbar, temporarily billeted in Stalag 17 before being transferred to an officer's camp, tells his new bunkmates that he was responsible for the destruction of a German ammunition train. Sure enough, this information is leaked to the Commandant, and Dunbar is subjected to a brutal interrogation. Certain by now that Sefton is the ""mole"", the other inmates beat him to a pulp. But Sefton soon learns who the real spy is, and reveals that information on the night of Dunbar's planned escape.<br/><br/>The movie survives the jump from stage to screen with flying colors, thanks to Billy Wilder's typically sterling direction and a darkly funny script.The good greatly outweighs the bad, particularly in the profile of Holden's character, a pragmatic, self-centered cynic whose heroism, when it is finally called upon, appears to come from deep within the barriers he has placed inside of himself.Despite the seriousness of the situation,it is as much comedy as wartime melodrama, with most of the laughs provided by Robert Straussand Harvey Lembeck. Other standouts in the all-male cast include Richard Erdman, Neville Brand, Peter Graves, Gil Stratton and Robinson Stone.It is a bleak, black comedy in which the laughter can die in the throat."

I never heard the word Stalag,so naturally,I was hooked. I think they showed a clip...a War movie in a POW camp,World War II.I could NOT take my eyes off the screen,they were STUCK to the TV,even during the commercials. I LOVE this movie.

Watch the film again,KNOWING PRICE was the Nazi,and you'll see some inside Dialogue that really incriminates him and even sitting under the Signal light to Shultz at the Chess board. I sometimes thought the movie was a little Stagy but it still moved.

","For a major part of the movie, i was quite convinced that J.J.Sefton, played by William Holden was the ""rat in the house"". Sefton is mistaken for trading the secrets of the camp with the Nazi officers for money and wealth. He is a connoisseur of cigars and alcohol. His collections draws a few 'raised eyebrows' and on one fine day they are convinced that he was the two-timer. He gets brutally hit by his roommates, stolen of his priceless collections and is ostracized from the rest. He takes a vow to prove his innocence and also bring the real culprit to the other inmates of the camp and he discreetly observes, construes, corroborates and then proves it to the others who the real double-crosser was, and also manages to escape from the POW camp.<br/><br/>The movie has every ingredient from Billy Wilder's recipe of making the finest movies- wit, cinematography, William Holden's acting and art-direction."

"daver6","8","2","3","11 December 2011"," A Who-Done-It set in a POW camp
","I will not describe the plot as it has been done elsewhere. I thought the film enthralling with one exception.<br/><br/>William Holden is excellent as the cynical prisoner who trades with the Germans to get the good things in life (including women!); he would have revelled in being a black marketeer in post-war Berlin. Holden is a master at moralising from a dubious position and the film's dichotomy of Holden representing self-interest versus the rest representing duty provides Holden with ample scope to display this talent. I have heard that Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas were considered for his role but neither of them would have been able portray the necessary cynicism (as apposed to unpleasant) with Holden's skill because Heston is too noble and Douglas does not have the talent.<br/><br/>The remainder of the cast gave sterling performances; especially the hut chief as the man of reason and the hot-headed Sgt playing the unthinking vigilante, and the ..........German spy! I only have two criticisms: <br/><br/>1. The 'animal' character was too stupid to be funny; he was merely irritating. I felt the film would have been darker and more intense if this character and the 'comedy' had been omitted. The 'animal' is the reason I did not score the film a 10.<br/><br/>2. Generally, the Germans treated western-allied POWs pretty fairly and I do not think they would automatically have opened fire at anyone within the compound or at escapees when caught. (The murder of 70-odd RAF prisoners was an exception and was carried out by the Gestapo).<br/><br/>I would thoroughly recommend this film to fans of POW camp films or fans of Who-Done-Its. You are in for a treat."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","19 August 2018"," What happens in the 'Stalag' stays in the 'Stalag'... or does it?
","A narrator with a slight stammer (Gil Stratton) introduces the film by saying that no war movie ever tackled prisoners of war (aka POW). Objection, your honor, how about Jean Renoir's ""Grand Illusion""? Granted there was no significant American POW film at the time but surely Billy Wilder must have heard about a French movie nominated for Best Picture in 1939, he must have heard a few anecdotes from Erich Von Stroheim during the shooting of ""Sunset Blvd. So, is the lie deliberate or not?<br/><br/>I think Wilder didn't feel he was telling the same story, and that ""lie"" is very revealing about the spirit of ""Stalag 17"": it tries to fool us but in such an obviously fraudulent way that it doesn't fool us, as if there was a joke somewhere but not on us. And I think that very lie captures the spirit of the film, it is cynical but deliberately deceptive about the human nature, to the point that sergeant Sefton's farewell line about pretending to have never met might have been a genuine statement. Yet it ended with a friendly gesture just to keep the right amount of ambiguity. And God, is this film ambiguous!<br/><br/>In many ways, ""Stalag 17"" could have been an Americanization of ""Grand Illusion"" with WW2 as the setting, and I guess that's the accomplishment made by ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" also starring William Holden, the bonding between the Japanese commandant and the British officer echoed the friendship between the two aristocrats in ""Illusion"". ""Stalag 17"" was adapted from a play written by 'Stalag' survivors Donald Bevan and Edmun Trczinski, where what happens in the Stalag stays in the Stalag ... or does it? The main drama consists of finding out the identity of the stoolie who warned the Germans about the upcoming escape of two prisoners, causing them to do escape but inside coffins. <br/><br/>As Camp Commandant Oberst von Scherbach (Otto Preminger) observed with a proud smirk: ""No one escaped Stalag 17. Not alive anyway"". It's interesting the way these deaths are handled. While the gravitas of the moment is heavily marked in the faces of the prisoners, especially Duke (Neville Brand) who spends the whole time with the expression of someone who wished he got Holden's part, William Holden's Sefton is proudly collecting the cigarettes he got from a bet against their lives. The two sacrificed lambs are only cinematic props to warn us about the presence of a traitor and to tell us that first-billed Holden is the number one suspect (aka the hero).<br/><br/>Once you get that the dead prisoners represent drama and that they're handled in a lighthearted way (the narrator even leaves a joke at their departure), you get the point of ""Stalag 17"", less a lighthearted drama than a serious comedy. And at that point of the review, I have to mention the two comic reliefs: Robert Strauss as Stanislaw 'the Animal' Kusawa and Harry 'Sugar-Lips' Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck), these two goofs crystallize the appreciation of the film, fans love it because they make the film feel like ""Animal House"" in a POW Camp and the haters hate it for the same reason. <br/><br/>Speaking for myself, I thought their comedic routine was overplayed at first but then I processed the tonality of the film in my head and figured out they needed to provide more meat for the story and give us a few comical interludes with the Russian prisoners, the raw eggs, the 'At ease!' moment and the 'Betty Grable' dance, until the unforgettable ""When Johnnie Comes Marching Home Again"" where they're so busy dancing and marching they can't notice the spy quietly delivering a message in the ""mailbox"". We're definitely not stupid, they are.<br/><br/>""There are only two guys who know I didn't do it. Me and the guy who did it"". Basically these two are also the only sane and reasonable people, though Sefton could have toned down his enthusiasm at the midst of the whole suspicion-ambiance and the traitor could have kept the incriminating piece out of his pocket, but nonetheless, the characters of Holden and a young Peter Graves managed to prevent the film to fall into the muddy trap of a nonsensical farce. There came a point where the last thrills came from the rat's race and the film needed one or two confrontations to spice it up. Humor and comedy can be great but with a right amount. As Schulz said ""one fuerher is enough"".<br/><br/>The film was released at the end of the Korean War and the peak of the McCarthysm and some found in Sefton's accusation an illustration of the Jews' persecution and the HUAC-related paranoia, I think there's something more relevant within its tone (not the content), somethiung about the disillusion of men who're entrapped in their own condition and become easy preys for foolishness, and they just need a culprit to shoot first and think after, I get ""Stalag 17"" works a little like ""M*A*S*H"" a movie that handles war in such a goofy way it contains a few bits of subversion but doesn't keep you quite at ease.<br/><br/>Holden won the Oscar while believing it had to go to either Lancaster or Clift who played in a more 'serious' picture as if he saw something of a fraud in ""Stalag 17"". Maybe it's a fraud, maybe it needed less ambivalence and that's why its follow-up ""Hogan's Heroes"" worked better because it was plain comedy, but this is a film that tells us one thing, no one can fool you without your consenting, and the only guy who wasn't fooled was cynical but had smartened up, patriotism is one thing but keep smart is a nice advice and modern for its taste.<br/><br/> ""Stalag 17"" might be more brilliant than it seems, for such a classic prison escape movie, there are many aspects that escaped me, I reckon that."
"classicsoncall","6","1","1","20 February 2016"," ""Sort of rough, one American squealing on other Americans.""
","I'm really having some trouble here folks. What was the intent of this film supposed to be? I think it might have been better off over all if the picture went for straight out comedy without the traitor among the soldiers angle. For me, the tone of the picture was all wrong, and considering it was made only eight years after World War II ended, I think it borders on the disrespectful.<br/><br/>It all starts right at the beginning of the movie. American prisoners of war all seem to be well fed, a couple of them wear fur lined bomber jackets and even wrist watches are allowed. I had an uncle who was a prisoner of war and his weight dropped to eighty pounds; I don't think he was having the kind of 'fun' these soldiers seemed to be having. A German guard hands off his rifle to a prisoner so he could take a swat at a volleyball? A soldier washes his socks in a pot of potato soup? Russian women prisoners arrive at the camp and except for their attire, look like they might have stepped off the pages of a fashion magazine?<br/><br/>It's not only that, but there are huge inconsistencies in the story line as well. After the escape attempt to open the picture, the Germans state that the barrack would spend it's time filling in the escape tunnel. But there was no escape tunnel, the soldiers simply descended through a trap door under the building and crawled their way out. At the finale, Sergeant Sefton (William Holden) and Lieutenant Dunbar (Don Taylor) were making their way out exactly the same way.<br/><br/>Not to mention all the jovial camaraderie between the prisoners and Sergeant Schulz (Sig Ruman). All of this seemed so wrong to me that it detracted from the actual reveal of Price (Peter Graves) as the plant in the barrack to communicate with his superiors. That's another thing, who uses the term 'barrack' to describe a barracks? It is a real word by the way, I just looked it up, but the term 'barracks' is more properly used for both singular and plural. Just another thing to agitate me throughout the story.<br/><br/>If the film had kept to straight drama like it did for the last half hour or so I wouldn't be going on this rant, but I really couldn't determine what director Wilder was going for here. Apparently I'm in a minority considering the complementary reviews on this board and the film's rating, but I just don't get it. The most creative thing coming out of this picture were the messages passed via a chess piece."

It's very well-written and directed. Never boring too. It isn't all grim and dreary--there's plenty of humor. I especially got a kick out of a Christmas Eve party the prisoners have--you see guys casually dancing with one another. The acting is good all around (with one exception). Holden won an Oscar for his role and Don Taylor, Peter Graves and Otto Preminger (having a whale of a time playing an evil German) are just great.<br/><br/>Still--I can only give this an 8. It makes living at a POW camp look like it's not that bad. I've never been at a POW camp but I don't think that was the case. I realize this (purportedly) was not the inspiration for the TV series ""Hogan's Heroes"" but I have my doubts. Also Robert Strauss goes WAY over the top playing Animal. I realize his character was supposed to be funny but I found him annoying. And there was another character who does a bunch of celebrity impersonations which are horrifically bad. Those elements lessened my enjoyment of this. Still I recommend it."

","MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>I found this film entertaining from start to finish.  Wilder took a huge risk with setting a Drama/Comedy in a Nazi prisoner of war camp.  However, Wilder in his prime could do no wrong.<br/><br/>Yes, it can be challenging to get over the fact that the environment inside that P.O.W. camp was very silly and light-hearted.  However, one must note the difference between inside and outside the barracks.  The men offered themselves a personal escape through the games, schemes, and jokes. Outside, a very serious no-nonsense kommandant and two of their friends killed trying to escape.  It amazes me how Wilder blended the two extremes so masterfully.  I believe that some people misinterpret this movie as a flop because they can't pull themselves out of the assumed seriousness of the camp.<br/><br/>Bill Holden is amazing.  He has an air about him that few actors are blessed with. Also the interaction with the spy and the rest of the barracks once we know he is the spy is gripping.

","If, the first time you 'saw' ""Stalag 17"" you were only allowed to listen to the dialogue, and then were asked to place the year the film was made, you'd probably answer that it is a new release, or perhaps from the late 60s or early 70s. You'd answer that way in large measure because the tone of ""Stalag 17"" is cynical and irreverent. The main character is what used to be known as an anti-hero; independent, anti-establishment, in it for himself and the rest of the world be damned.  You'd be surprised to learn that the movie was released in 1953 at the height of the Cold War and when memories of WWII were very fresh. <br/><br/>But Billy Wilder was the type of artist that could pull this off. And he had support from an extremely talented cast and crew. ""Stalag 17"" is ageless; the sharp bite of the dialogue, the great ensemble acting, the stark realism of the sets. If you haven't had the joy of watching this movie, by all means put it on your must-see list."

Holden teamed up with director Billy Wilder to create a hilarious parody of German P.O.W. camps during WWII.<br/><br/>If I had to make a list of my top 10 most arrogant characters in cinema history, my #1 would be Holden as Sefton in this masterpiece.  But it isn't only Holden's performance that makes this movie great.  The supporting performances are great and so is Wilder's directing.  The scene where Holden is caught by all his bunk-mates while giving the German guard all the goodies so that the guard can tell him who the stoolie is is absolutely genius because his bunk-mates are then sure he might be the stoolie.<br/><br/>There are many scenes of extreme laughter, especially the ones with ""Animal"" who is obsessed with Betty Grable.  It is a true cinema masterpiece and I highly recommend it."

","I've heard the term ""Guy Movie"" many times in my life. The other day someone I know told me that Stalag 17 was a total ""Guy Movie."" Now, I really like this film alot, I like it for it's male camaraderie and I like it for it's storytelling. The thing I like most about Stalag 17 is William Holden, who has to be the most under-rated actor of the golden age of Hollywood. Holden is dead on in this film, never once letting you think he could be the informant or not. There is an awful lot of comedy in this film, most at the expense of Shapiro and the Animal, alot of it aimed at the Russian camp across the compound where they hold the female prisoners. My biggest complaint isn't the comedy from the prisoners, it's the buffoonish way the German guards are portrayed. Maybe this is a ""Guy Movie."" Either way, I really enjoyed the film. But does anybody really think the Germans were that goofy?"
"schmigrex","9","3","6","8 August 2001"," It's a comedy, folks! Also -- a great ending.
","When thinking about this fine film, one should consider that its lack of ""realism"" is intentional.  Movies are not reality, and should not necessarily be judged against the grittiness or logics of real life.  Of course German guards weren't this buffoonish in real life -- but they weren't very funny either!  Sure barracks weren't filled with identifiable ethnic and class ""types,"" but that's one way to create comic possibilities. Movies are deliberate distortions of life, and that's why they're fun and entertaining.  Stalag 17 was considered to be edgy comedy for its time, along the lines of M*A*S*H later on.  The very idea of Americans at odds with each other over supposed traitors in the ranks is at once a challenge to the gung-ho images presented in more jingoistic war films, and an idea that would have resonated with paranoid McCarthy-era Americans.  By offsetting those serious issues with broad comedy, courtesy of Strauss and Lembeck, the drama is heightened rather than obscured.  And sure, Hogan's Heroes was inspired by this movie, but you can't blame the movie for that. But I wonder why more people don't note Stalag 17's influence on other films, notably The Great Escape, Dr. Strangelove, M*A*S*H, and even Good Morning Vietnam.<br/><br/>Now, the ending.  First, the original ending was much more caustic -- Sefton was to deliver the ""Let's just pretend we never met"" line and duck out with a scowl.  The studio wouldn't go for it, and made Wilder put in Sefton's little reappearance and grin/salute to the guys.  Boy, would it have been dark the other way!  Also, this movie has a great cynical closing line, like many Wilder movies, this one mouthed by Animal (I think):  ""Hey, maybe he just wanted to steal our wire cutters.  Ever think of that?"""
"carlgt1","8","3","6","1 March 2001"," OK entertainment, not sure of the ""classic"" status
","I really wanted to appreciate this film as a classic but it came off a bit goofy in my opinion.  I give it an 8 out of 10; good solid entertainment but not in the legendary, classic status you would think from it's IMDB rank of being the top #153 of all time.<br/><br/>I could overlook the obvious jingoism and ""Germans bad, Americans good"" since it's a product of its times, McCarthyism, and the Cold War.  But overall, as a war movie, I thought it was an insult to people in real prison camps!  I guess it's hard to take something too seriously which turned into ""Hogan's Heroes.""  Don't get me wrong, there are funny bits and the ""whodunit"" story interwoven with the comic stuff is pretty good.  I especially liked the proud capitalist wanna-be-rich-guy meeting up with the proud capitalist already-rich-guy (enemies at first, partners at the end). Basically this movie is a propaganda piece, although by the time it was made the war was long over, and the only war was ""cold"" with the Russians.  So it was a little odd that the Russians were OK in the film but the Germans were still ""dumb but not stupid"" (Einstein, Bohr, et al would be glad to know that ;-).<br/><br/>But the idea that Russian woman prisoners had nothing to do but giggle for strapping American lads to try and ogle them, or ""give a piece"" for some silk stockings was a bit tough.  And the obvious buffoonery of the German soldiers was a bit silly although you can see the segue into the ""Hogan's Heroes"" TV show.  I guess the only next step would be the ""Hoffman's Heroes"" parody that Mad Magazine did years ago (concentration camp humor).<br/><br/>So enjoy it for what it is, but I don't quite see how this is such a classic in the war film canon.  I prefer ""Duck Soup"" by the Marx Brothers for comedy and a statement of the inanities of war."

","What is trapped inside this film is a wonderful, intense mystery drama. The reason I say trapped is because so much time is wasted on comedy relief. Now, in this film, everyone inside a POW bunker in WWII Germany is accusing Sefton of selling the Germans information, because of his ample supplies and acerbic attitude. And so, Sefton has to find out who the informant really is, before his co-prisoners fully decide to blame and punish him accordingly. Sounds like a really great premise, doesn't it? And when it does focus on the premise, it sure hits the mark. Sadly, the drama is unsustained as two characters are thrown in simply to do a comedy relief every other scene. Obviously, someone decided that a flat-out serious WWII drama just wouldn't have enough impact at the box office, and tried to make it more popcorn audience-friendly with these scenes. And sadly, that's what ruins this film. However, it is still worth it for any William Holden fans to view the only film for which he won and Oscar, and well deserved. Holden is cunning enough that it feels like he belongs on the modern cinema screen , as opposed to many stiff male actors of Hollywood's early year. Truly, I believe Holden to be among cinema's first realistic, modern actors. Also, a young Peter Graves gives a stellar performance as well. So, pick up this classic if you are a William Holden fan, though not before you've seen his better films, like ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Network."""

"JamesHitchcock","6","2","4","30 January 2017"," Too Much Inappropriate Humour
","At the beginning of this film the narrator, Sergeant Clarence Cook, states that although there are plenty of films about World War II you don't see many about the experiences of prisoners of war. This is certainly one of the earliest war films to deal with this subject, although not the very earliest. The earliest I can think of is the British-made ""The Wooden Horse"" from 1950; this was to be followed by the likes of ""The Colditz Story"", ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Danger Within"", ""The Great Escape"" and ""King Rat"". Strangely enough, ""Stalag 17"" was made in 1952 but not released in that year, apparently because Paramount believed that audiences would not be interested in its subject-matter. They changed their minds the following year because the end of the Korean War and the subsequent release of American prisoners had focused public attention on the problems facing POWs.<br/><br/>The action takes place during December 1944 in a German POW camp ""somewhere along the Danube"" and concentrates on the inmates of one particular hut in the camp, all of them sergeants in the U.S. Air Force. The film opens with two men from the hut attempting to escape through a tunnel, but when they emerge outside the barbed wire fence they are shot dead by the guards. (This is unusual but not impossible; German guards generally preferred to recapture escaping prisoners alive rather than shoot them, although there were exceptions). The inmates conclude (correctly) that one of their number must be an informer who is letting the Germans know about planned escape attempts. (""Danger Within"" also had a plot involving an informer inside a POW camp).<br/><br/>The most obvious suspect is J J Sefton, an enterprising would-be capitalist who has a knack for turning any situation to his own profit. (He is in many ways similar to King in ""King Rat""). Although the other prisoners are happy to take advantage of Sefton's illicit alcohol and gambling rackets, he is not a popular figure, partly because of his cynical attitude- he regards escape attempts as foolish- and partly because he has no qualms about doing deals with the German guards for luxuries such as eggs, silk stockings and cigarettes. Of course, Sefton is so unpopular and such an obvious suspect that the audience will immediately realise that he must be innocent- indeed, much of the film is taken up with Sefton's efforts to clear his name by exposing the real traitor.<br/><br/>When I reviewed ""From Here to Eternity"" I had not yet seen ""Stalag 17"", so said that I would reserve judgement on the justice of William Holden's Best Actor Oscar, an award which he won ahead of Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift. Holden, in fact, always felt that he did not deserve the award and, having now seen ""Stalag 17"", I am inclined to agree with him. Certainly, his performance here as Sefton is a good one, but I felt that both Lancaster and Clift were better.<br/><br/>The film as a whole has the potential to be a very good one; it has an exciting plot, some well-observed characterisation and some well-written dialogue. Like some other reviewers, however, I feel that it suffers from the defect of too much inappropriate humour. It is, of course, quite possible to write a comedy set in a POW camp – the television series ""Hogan's Heroes"" was an example- but ""Stalag 17"" is not really intended as a comedy. It is, for the most part, a serious drama- it opens with two men being shot dead, and towards the end another character finds himself in danger of his life. Against this backdrop the antics of the German Feldwebel Johann Sebastian Schulz- clearly a frustrated comedian in civilian life- and of the American Sergeant Stanislas ""Animal"" Kuzawa- equally clearly a congenital idiot- seem rather out-of-place. ""Animal"", in particular, seems so mentally defective that I could not imagine why the U.S. Air Force ever accepted him in the first place, let alone promoted him to sergeant. I have heard it said that director Billy Wilder, himself a Jewish refugee from Nazism, found himself psychologically unable to deal with the subject of the war unless he leavened his seriousness with humour. That may be so, but I nevertheless feel that ""Stalag 17"" would have been a better film had it concentrated on its serious main plot rather than on its would-be humorous sub-plots. 6/10"
"Prismark10","5","2","4","22 July 2015"," Inside man
","Stalag 17 is directed by the legendary Billy Wilder. It is an adaptation of a stage play and was filmed just seven years after the end of the Second World War.<br/><br/>Its an uneasy mixture of drama, suspense and broad comedy. Given how some British movies made in the 1960s were so pompous about the war its refreshing to see an anarchic take of the war few years after the end of hostilities.<br/><br/>Stalag 17 is a Prisoner of War camp inside Germany with captured American personnel. The film opens with two men trying to escape who are soon captured and killed. The prisoners think that one of them is a rat and suspicion falls on Sefton (William Holden) the resident black marketeer and hence not the most popular person in the hut. Sefton's character is similar to George Segal's character in King Rat, a man who knows how to live on his wits and his mission is to survive, preferably in some comfort.<br/><br/>Some of the comedy did not work for me, I found it irritating. It focuses on Animal who is infatuated with Betty Grable and wants to break into the nearby compound which holds Russian female POWs and his friend Shapiro. The film would had been better if they were the two characters trying to escape at the beginning of the film and shot.<br/><br/>Yet there are some serious aspects to the film. The men are held in filthy conditions given new blankets for a few hours when the man from Geneva arrives to inspect the camp for human man rights breaches and are then quickly taken away. They receive letters from back home and find out that they are behind on their rental payments or their spouses might be cheating on them.<br/><br/>However it looks not all of the men are American. One of them is a German inside man, placed there to find out all manner of information that could be important to the Germans. Sergeant Schultz who regularly comes into the hut and takes part in the buffoonery with the prisoners is also exchanging messages with the insider. This plot only unfolds as Sefton realises he needs to clear his name quickly and sets about to unravel the rat.<br/><br/>I did feel that bit of the plot was not very strong. No one in that hut played chess, yet the chessboard was always out and no one seems to have noticed the knotted/unknotted cord. Also with Sefton now the prime suspect, we see the real insider asking one of the new men for information on a sabotage event that took place. Its clear that the men would eventually realise that Sefton was not the rat, especially if they managed to get Sefton out of the way like kill him.<br/><br/>I class Stalag 17 as a curious war film which was sold as a comedy. It is neither a comedy nor a straight drama. It inspired the television series Hogan's Heroes and William Holden won a best actor Oscar for his role."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","4","26 September 2014"," Another One Of Billy Wilder's Unpolished Gem.
","The more I'm watching films directed by Billy Wilder, the more I'm getting convinced that he could very well be the most brilliant & versatile filmmaker of the 20th century for this master writer-director had a remarkable knack for wit which kept almost all his films a light-hearted affair, including those which dealt with serious subject matters, yet effortlessly managed to deliver its message without ever compromising with the entertainment factor.<br/><br/>Set during The Second World War in a German POW camp that houses only American sergeants, the story begins with two prisoners from the barrack who after careful planning with the rest of inmates try to escape the camp but are discovered & shot down. The rest of the inmates suspect that one amongst them is an informer but when the suspicion falls on the camp's notorious black marketeer, he decides to find out the real culprit before it's too late for him.<br/><br/>Excellently directed by Billy Wilder, Stalag 17 is another one of his unpolished gems which is set during the final years of World War II, in a Nazi prisoner of war camp and yet, despite its grim setting, remains a fun & rollicking experience from start to finish. Cleverly scripted as well, Wilder effortlessly succeeds in balancing all its elements, provides just the perfect dose of every genre this film deals with & employs near-perfect use of humour in its plot.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, the camps depicted in the movie have an authentic feel to some extent, the black n white photography is brilliantly carried out, editing keeps the flow of entertainment smooth & although the use of music is minimal, it's fitting wherever it is present. Every character we interact with exhibit a distinct personality yet it's William Holden who plays an anti-hero here whom we choose to invest our emotions in & are finely rewarded in the end, thanks to his stellar performance.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Stalag 17 is one of the finest World War II prisoner of war films that has something in store for every kind of cinema viewer out there. It's a first rate spy-thriller that offers a first-rate entertainment with its brilliant take on the genres of war, drama, comedy, thriller & mystery and doesn't feel even slightly aged despite being over half century old. People who don't like something funny being made out of what was a horror event may find a lot to criticize but for me, it just works. Highly recommended."

","Billy Wilder has not disappointed me and rather has lifted my spirits. Whenever I feel low, or feel like bored, I get hold of a Wilder film and his films have each time surprised me, from ""Major Or Minor"" to ""One,Two,Three"" there is a charisma that I believe, only Wilder could bring to the film. <br/><br/>Stalag 17 is about a prison escapade and it's not a serious drama nor a suspenseful thriller, it's a plain fun-watch. It has many moments of wit and humor, especially for the good first part. Be it Animal (Robert Strauss) flirting with Russian women, or Shapiro (Harvery Lembeck) collecting letters, they are fun filled scenes and they did not seem to be cynical or mocking at the Nazis. They seemed just plain funny. Wilder, I must say is a master writer, who knows not just only the dialog but also in which tone if it is said, brings out what emotion in an actor, and what reaction can be derived from a viewer. He deliberates acts in this film and they sync well with the script. <br/><br/>Not for once, I felt anything was out of place, in this escape drama. Though most of the film focuses on the acts of the prisoners and how they have fun with each other day in and day out, rather than the plan of escape and all, I felt it was all right there, and it helped me engage and even empathize with their characters. <br/><br/>Wilder, is one of the few master of the basic principle of writing, that is actions and motives make characters, a set of these characters make a plot and better their actions, better the plot. I am speaking more of the genius of Wilder I think than the film in itself. <br/><br/>OK, the film touches all the right notes, in it's 2 hour length and fails to falter as per me. It's not a great Prisoners of War film like ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" or even ""Shawshank Redemption"" but this essentially a film where a set of people have a motive and they get their thing done. William Holden as Sergeant Sefton gives a delightful performance and there is a host of other actors who gave some wonderful performances too, like Robert Strauss as ""Animal"" <br/><br/>The sound design seemed perfect, considering that this is a 1953 film and it had to accommodate a landscape of War. The editing was fine too, and other aspects did a great job. Of all, I am impressed with the environment that Wilder brings with each of his films, be it ""Lost Weekend"" or ""Some Like It Hot"" or even ""The Apartment"". There is a sense of belonging such as being in that place, where the characters are, this is effectively done by right lighting and right art direction and even supreme cinematography. <br/><br/>But Wilder has proved yet again that he was one of the most original and most acceptable voices we had who used his pen to speak more effectively than most men do. I salute his dialog, his scene writing and even his screenplay. Though the credit is shared by Edwin Blum, I suppose so that Wilder was behind the writing.<br/><br/>I am going with 4/5 for this. It's not the ideal nail biting stuff if such is the expectation, it's laid back fun-filled watch that mostly you will not regret watching. I am happy to have caught up with this."
"Lejink","4","2","4","25 June 2012"," Not so great escape
","I'm a big fan of maestro Wilder's work, but have to admit to very mixed feelings about this concentration camp escape feature. Without even looking at the IMDb notes, I saw straight away the resemblance to the TV-derived ""Hogan's Heroes"", right down to dumbkopf Officer Schultz and found the mix of lame humour and gritty drama too much to take.<br/><br/>The plot, told in flashback by Willam Holden's resourceful Sefton character's pal Cookie, is naturally episodic, but I was never convinced that these soldiers were drawn from life. The humour is very dated, the episode where the inmates stage their own Christmas Dance being by far the strangest where not only do we get the unseemly sight of soldiers dancing man to man, but one even drags up to impersonate Betty Grable so his chum participates.<br/><br/>It does settle down in the last half-hour to a gripping finale as Holden uncovers the truth about the traitor in their midst and a (literally) killing-two-birds-with-one-stone escape plan is put into action (and turns out to be a real ""mission impossible"" for a young Peter Graves) but it can't make up for the uneven fare that's gone before.<br/><br/>Only Holden really emboldens his character with anything approaching depth, the rest have as much truth about them as Snow White's seven dwarfs.<br/><br/>As it boasts in the prologue, this was one of the first stories concentrating (sorry) on POW's but better takes on the subject were to follow, none that I can remember making the mistake of playing it for laughs."
"inhonoredglory","9","2","4","10 September 2011"," Funny and Serious, Rich in Character and Acting
","I was really excited to see this, since I knew it was the seed of inspiration for my favorite series Hogan's Heroes. The similarities are astounding - from a tubby guard named Schultz to the ""no escape"" record of the Kommandant to the fraternizing and trading between prisoners and Germans. It was humorously incredible! But the movie was as well, standing on its own. The opening scene with the overview of the huge prison camp really let us know what we were in for. I loved that they made a movie out of this concept. War and other dark subjects are frequently expounded and explained on film; the plight, struggles, hope, and humor of prisoners of war should get their share of attention from a civilian world that so often is ignorant of these military realities. A little introduction to this world can easily lead to more research, greater appreciation, and perhaps even a lifelong study (as what happened with me for my WWII appreciation, courtesy Hogan's Heroes).<br/><br/>But on with the movie - I was really surprised by the rich combination of drama and humor, laughter and poignancy, and of the brief character studies of many of the occupants of Barracks 4. Robert Strauss (as ""Animal"") and Harvey Lembeck (as Shapiro) really stole the show; their characters and acting really shine. The plot picks up about halfway through the film and doesn't let up from there. There are many memorable scenes (getting to the Russian women), laugh-out-loud moments (the reading of Mein Kamph), and heart-clutching moments (the lieutenant's interrogation).<br/><br/>The Collector Edition's accompanying mini-documentary on the real POWs of Stalag 17 puts the film in perspective and really made me appreciate what they went through.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic movie - rich and richly acted."
"knucklebreather","8","2","4","1 June 2010"," An enjoyable POW movie
","""Stalag 17"" is one of the first POW movies and, while it pleasantly breaks from the war movie tradition at the time, it seems to have set the tone for many good and bad war movies that followed. I'd say that movies from ""The Great Escape"" to even ""M*A*S*H"" followed in the footsteps of Stalag 17, which dared to say that a war movie could be more than just a melodramatic, pseudo-patriotic formula film.<br/><br/>The story of a bunch of POW sergeants trying to deal with prison camp life despite having a spy in their ranks, ""Stalag 17"" is mostly comedy with some light drama, an unexpected format for a war film. The comedy is not particularly high-brow or intellectual, mostly it's based on Sergeant ""Animal"" and his straight man doing their vaudeville routines, but it works. It's still pretty funny even in 2010.<br/><br/>The actual plot of the movie, the imprisoned Americans trying to ferret out a spy in their ranks, isn't delivered with nearly the gusto or energy we'd see in later POW movies, especially ""The Great Escape"". Still, this must have been quite the ground-breaking movie in 1953, and I'm glad it was made. It's still fun to watch, even if I wouldn't rate it as an all-time classic, even of the war movie genre."

Robert Strauss, who plays Animal, is the real heart of this film. Sure, William Holden is great, but Strauss is the comic relief and a lovable guy. Without his antics, the film wouldn't have been the success that it was and is.<br/><br/>The antics are great. There's gambling with cigarettes, using mice as horses to simulate horse races, including one named Seabiscuit who loses to Snickelfritz. There's the repeated attempts to get to the other side of the camp in order to see the Russian women.<br/><br/>The gist of the film reminded me of the television show ""Hogan's Heroes"", and apparently I'm not alone. Allegedly the creators of ""Heroes"" got sued and had to pay a large out-of-court settlement for ripping off the general premise.<br/><br/>And that's all I want to say about that.

","Stalag 17, though only a good ol' American testosterone-driven entertainment, is a great piece of direction on the part of the true master it bears at the helm, Billy Wilder. Wilder flaunts the atmosphere of a screwball comedy, and fires off a lot of gags you would probably only find in one. Simultaneously, he builds very stern suspense with inherent tension and subtle mechanisms set by a few characters.<br/><br/>The film's plot screens a lot of very tense things that get us all worked up. It's about a character that deals with false accusations by an entire POW camp full of men that while they're in prison at least have each other. This character does not. He's excluded, beaten, and can only think about that one character who is smugly getting away with all that he's being accused of. And then again, in the undercurrent, there's this interesting crop of quirky characters that populate the stalag. There's a big, scruffy lug named Animal who looks like an American Danny Trejo and could break a few chains apart at once, but he's got an insufferable crush on Betty Grable, and when the news is heard that Grable is married, Animal falls apart. He's got a smaller friend with a higher voice who gets caught up in mishaps with him, like a mixture of Abbott and Costello and George and Lenny from Of Mice and Men. Then there's a guy who shows up at the camp who can do impressions of any actor, and does throughout the film.<br/><br/>Stalag 17 is a great American counterpart to Grand Illusion, perhaps. The only difference is that Stalag 17 all but ignores the war and closes in completely on the characters themselves, using the period in time as an incidental part of the plot. It's pure entertainment, and beautifully done by a master of such."

","The casting of Holden is just spot on as the cynical Sefton. Premminger is equally well cast as the vain Kommandant. The sets are accurate and authentic in appearance. The story is very good and has many interesting characters. The problem is just that there is way too much campy comedy from the Animal character and his sidekick. It really begins to get old as the movie progresses to the point of obscuring the excellent dramatic work by Holden and others.Perhaps at the time audiences needed some comic relief after having endured WW2 and then the nightmare of Korea. But the slapstick shenanigans of the two morons dulls the dramatic edge of the situation and the plot. It is not a film that is easily viewed more than once due to the endless heavy-handed comedic inanity of Animal and his sidekick. It is , all in all , a very good film, due above all to William Holden's stunning portrayal of a selfish, cynical Sefton with a tarnished sense of patriotism and duty that shines brightly when put to the final test. It could have been a classic, but falls short due to the silly camp."

What is the greatest in Wilder's movie? Firstly, riddle. Who is the traitor? Who collaborates with Germany? Wilder gives us many fake clues: amazing Sefton's storage cannot be deliberate, what is the role of handicapped Joey(always ignored but in one great scene he watches mysteriously lynch on Sefton) etc. Secondly, characters. Sig Ruman(corny Sgt. Schulz)always indicates his love to funny Americans and spending time with them gives him a genuine pleasure. Sig Ruman gives us top performance and his dialogs with Shapiro and Animals are one of the funniest moments of whole cinematography. William Holden(Sefton) creates exemplary appeal to opponents:if you want to survive you must learn how to cope with opponents and have rational attitude to your neighbors and war.

","Personally, I always thought that if WILLIAM HOLDEN deserved to win an Oscar, it was for SUNSET BLVD., not STALAG 17. But don't get me wrong. He's very effective here as the man everyone in the prison camp thinks is the ""stoolie"" who is getting favors from the Germans because he's a thief and a snitch.<br/><br/>Holden plays the role without any redeeming character traits other than as a man looking out solely for himself. Most of the time he's quick with a cynical one-liner or smirks rather condescendingly at the foibles of his fellow prisoners. And always, he's on his guard because he knows he's got to look out for the real mastermind hiding among them.<br/><br/>The suspense comes from wondering when the real villain will be unmasked. And how. And along with this suspense, there's a lot of dark humor and rowdy laughter, particularly when the men are hellbent on enjoying whatever freedoms they have.<br/><br/>It's a taut exercise in suspense laced with humor throughout. As the prison warden, OTTO PREMINGER is almost a caricature of a German soldier, but PETER GRAVES is very effective as the security officer who keeps a low profile. <br/><br/>The ending is very effective, with an unexpected twist, and the final impression is one of a strong prison drama enacted superbly by its all male cast, thanks to the solid direction of Billy Wilder."
"writers_reign","10","2","4","15 November 2005"," King Rat
","As usual the sterling quality of Wilder's writing-direction was well able to withstand Bryan Forbes rip-off, King Rat, twelve years later. Of course novelist James Clavell who opted to write about a POW whose idea of coping was to become a Black Marketeer a la William Holden's Sefton has to shoulder some of the blame. King Rat wasn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination but teenagers and even twenty-somethings who saw it in 1965 may not have realized that Stalag 17 got there first in 1953. Wilder's touch is present in every frame and one of his tricks - he used it again notably in The Apartment - was to lull the audience into thinking 'comedy' and then subtly injecting drama into the proceedings, in this case drama that involves loss of life. Holden, who became a personal friend, was always at his best working with Wilder and his Best Actor Oscar for Sefton was well deserved and here, despite his own initial reservations and a wish to 'soften' the character, he excels as the morally dubious Sefton who can take the loathing of his fellow prisoners in his stride but is averse to being worked over for something he didn't do. Wilder invented the role of Cookie, the nearest thing to a friend/confidente Sefton has and significantly the Segal character in King Rat also befriends another prisoner, Robert Fox. Another brilliant Wilder film."

","Well, damn, this is the third time I've tried to write my review of this film. Hummmph. Anyway, having read many comments on this film, and despite not having lived through the Second World War, although I must admit that the film is very well-made, the acting excellent, and Billy Wilder's direction and comedic touch second-to-none, it seemed to me that the depictions of the Nazis were a little too generous. The POW commandant seemed comical almost, to me. He seemed as though he'd been drawn from archetypes from rejected Saturday Night Live sketches. His menacing, insinuating monotone seemed to suggest a parody of German commandants rather than that of a real person. Admittedly, commandants might come in all shapes and sizes, but nevertheless, the depiction did seem rather generous. I would have expected a nastier depiction of the German camp leaders rather more fitting than the nearly comedic rendering of the camp commandant that was presented. I don't know if this is just a characteristic of seeing the film 50 years after it was released or if this is a fair criticism. Also, the men seemed rather more upbeat than I might have expected. Obviously they had to keep their spirits up in order to survive, but they just didn't seem very unhappy about being in a prison camp.

","What impresses the most about Stalag 17 is how it holds up after nearly 50 years & countless P.O.W. movies - mostly inferior - trailing behind it. Billy Wilder's account of the antics of the enlisted men of Barracks 4 is gripping & engrossing, due mainly to the Oscar-winning performance by William Holden as the headstrong shyster of the bunch who finds himself accused by his fellow soldiers of leaking info to the Nazis.  Holden gives a tour-de-force performance & the rest of the cast lends able support.<br/><br/>Some parts of Stalag 17 disappoint - the method in which the mystery of the snitch unfolds doesn't meet the worthy standards of the rest of the plot. The Germans, especially Otto Preminger as the Commandant, come off as cartoonishly evil, and the Abbott & Costello-like antics of Robert Strauss & Harvey Lembeck become tiresome midway thru the film.<br/><br/>Still, though not the greatest P.O.W. film I've ever seen (The Great Escape, for one, is better), Stalag 17 is a worthy predecessor.  7 out of 10."

","Stalag17 (1953) :
Short Review -<br/><br/>Master Billy Wilder delivers a Cracking Classic escape of POW. Among all the POW films i have seen till date, Stalag 17 should be called the Best. I would love to tell many reasons for that but i just got 2 perfect reasons to sum up all. First is, Stalag 17 came much before any other classic on same subject arrived, take 'The Great Escape' for instance. 10 years gap filled so many shortcomings of film technics but Stalag 17 still has a magic. Second reason is, Stalag 17 has got brilliant grip and entertainment. Most of the Escape flicks were too dark, too long and also seemed little bit boring in repeat watch but Stalag 17 is Funny, thrilling, captivating and re-watchable. William Holden deserved that Best Actor Academy Award like no one else among his contemporaries. There is a huge cast behind this classic and each and everyone deserves the credit for making this classic very much watchable by their excellent performances. Billy Wilder did something which all other directors have failed to do with this topic. I tell you i can't watch The Great Escape with the same joy on 10th viewing as 1st one but Stalag 17 would be in my watchlist any time, any day. With a perfect runtime of 120 minutes Wilder immersed all the elements of filmmaking whether is Comedy, Drama, suspense, sympathy and breathtaking climax. He created that atmosphere with every particular scene in the first 40 minutes and one we are in that world, there's no escape till The End. I don't remember any POW film having so many ingredients in such a short runtime. Stalag 17 is just Mind-blowing. Billy Wilder is a Genius and Stalag 17 proved it once again.<br/><br/>RATING- 8/10*<br/><br/>By - #samthebestest"

I still have to find a bad Wilder film..."

","It's an interesting thing how filmmakers seem to be reacting from one movie to the next. A movie with a certain outlook is followed by another that seems to have another outlook entirely, but because they're both coming from the same filmmaker, they still carry many of the same hallmarks and even core conception of the world. In Billy Wilder's previous film, Ace in the Hole, a cynic destroys several lives in the pursuit of his self-interest. In his next film, the cynical self-interested party ends up the hero because of his cynical self-interest.<br/><br/>It's late 1944, the German army is fighting its last great offensive in The Battle of the Bulge, and Stalag 17 is filled with Allied POWs. A barracks of a few dozen American sergeants does what good military men should do and plan on escape. The movie opens with an attempt by two of them. As they're preparing to leave, the ones staying behind start betting about how far they'll get. Some say all the way to Switzerland, other's to at least the lake that borders Germany and the neutral state, but JJ Sefton cynically says that they won't get out of the forest that surrounds the prison camp. Sefton's right, unfortunately, and he takes his winnings of cigarettes and adds them to his large collection of contraband he keeps in a chest.<br/><br/>He's set apart from everyone from the opening of the movie, creating a palpable sense of suspicion between him and the rest of the barracks. All of their plans are getting foiled. The two men died, but the Germans also know exactly how it happened, how the two got out of the barracks, and where the tunnel outside the compound started and ended. That feeds into the suspicion against Sefton that he's a mole, giving information to the German guards in exchange for the goodies he's keeping in his chest. But Sefton knows he's not the mole. He tries to fly above the concerns of his fellow prisoners, continuing his rackets (like a telescope that looks into the neighboring Russian female prison, and mouse races) like normal, but he can't tamp down the suspicion and his actions are just making it worse.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't completely hinge on the identity of the true mole. We find out the method of the mole's communication at about the half hour point and the mole's real identity at the hour mark. The mystery of the film isn't what drives it's second half, but the tension of how Sefton is going to convince the rest of the barracks that one of the most trusted members of the barracks' leadership is actually the mole. Sefton plays his hand perfectly, and his motive is always selfish. His selfishness accidentally put him into the crosshairs of his bunkmates, and his selfishness is what gets him out of his predicament and out of the camp as a whole.<br/><br/>Now, Sefton dominates the plot of the film, but the film as a whole really is an ensemble piece. Sefton's a much smaller part of the overall picture than a plot summary would imply. There's a large cast of characters that provide different types of entertainment, the most prominent being Animal and Shapiro who provide most of the comedic elements in the film, largely centered on Animal's infatuation with Betty Grable. This feeds into the movie's masterful command of tone.<br/><br/>It's deceptively hard to move from one tone to another in a film. Going from a comedic scene to a dramatic one too suddenly can create a jarring effect that takes an audience out of the film, but Stalag 17 knows exactly how to glide between them. Lighter moments feed into dangerous moments feed right back into lighter ones like a juggler easily moving from one ball to another.<br/><br/>Wilder's command of visual storytelling is on display as well. He has many of the trademarks of some of the great studio directors who knew how to shoot entire scenes exactly the way they were going to end up in the final product (a protective measure he learned very early in his career), so long single shot scenes play out without ever feeling like there needs to be a cut. The reveal of the messaging system to Sefton (which we already know at this point) is so easily and elegantly executed wordlessly.<br/><br/>The film as a whole is a great accomplishment by Wilder. It's funny, scary, and tense in equal measure while feeling like a cohesive whole the entire time. It's filled with great performances, looks fantastic, and is such a great entertainment from beginning to end."

","William Holden is always in the shadows in 'Stalag 17', he's always behind the characters or off to the side of the camera. You see, despite Holden's character Sgt. J.J. Sefton being the film's main character, he is only seen through the eyes of his fellow POWs, rarely ever alone. When they start to think he's the spy so do we. Oh, sure, we know he isn't the rat (movies don't do things like that), but since the story is told by all of the POWs who think Sefton is the rat, we start to think like them too. That is the mastery of Billy Wilder's 'Stalag 17', it takes the film's most interesting character and sets him apart from the rest for most of the film, letting us learn about him as the characters do.<br/><br/>The story focuses on a group of POWs living in the American section of Stalag 17, supposedly the 's best POW camp. Among them are barracks chief Hoffy (Richard Erdman), Price (Peter Graves), Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck) and Animal Casava (Robert Strauss). They all have their own special job when their fellow prisoners try to escape, Price, for instance, is 'security'. The film starts when two prisoners try to escape the barracks. Everyone inside is enthused, thinking the two will make it very far, except Sefton, who bets precious cigarettes that they wont make it past the outer forest. When he turns out to be right the POWs start thinking there's a rat and that rat is Sefton. And as the first hour passes we think so too, it's only logical, Sefton has any luxuries because of his deals with the s.<br/><br/>The POWs start to bully Sefton, and once they beat him to a pulp he decides to discover who the real rat is (at this point, of course, we know he is ). His investigation isn't handled with dialogue though, we get this by seeing his facial expressions and his lurking in the shadows of the barracks.<br/><br/>So, what starts as a light, 'gung-ho' type war movie (there's lots of comedy in the first hour) turns into a dark, sort of gritty thriller with a twist that left me with my mouth open. I wont reveal it, but I'll just say that Sefton smartly solves the mystery and redeems himself to the rest of the barracks (I didn't spoil anything, come on, it's expected).<br/><br/>As I said, there's lots of comedy in the first hour and some in the second, mostly from Strauss and Lembeck's characters. Some of the comedy is key in showing how these characters cope with their nearly hopeless situation, handled well by Wilder and the actors (Strauss' performance even gained him an Oscar nomination) but some of it just seems tacked on and out of place, like when a drunken Strauss thinks that Lembeck is a hell.<br/><br/>But that is a small qualm, and the rest of the film is excellent. The direction and writing are great in showing us a war film, a mystery, a thriller and a dark comedy all at once. I'd have to say I like the acting the most though, Holden (who won a leading Oscar for his work in this) is suave and charming, as well as mischievous and cynical, he creates a real 'cool' character without trying too. And the rest of the cast - Graves, Otto Preminger - are admirable as well. The POWs aren't clichÃ©s or caricatures, they're all their own separate people.<br/><br/>'Stalag 17' is great as a war movie, a mystery, a thriller and a dark comedy. It's a classic film, for all who appreciate good cinema, 8.5/10."
"rbverhoef","9","3","9","29 June 2003"," Not Wilder's best, but still very good
","'Stalag 17' is a movie about a German POW camp with American prisoners in World War II. All of them are sergeants. The movie starts with the death of two of two of them while escaping. They must be betrayed. The movie is a kind of whodunit in that way and the secret stays a secret for a long time, also for us, which is a very good thing. The only thing we do know that it is probably not Sgt. J.J. Sefton (William Holden). Every prisoner in his barrack suspects him because he has nice little deals with the Germans. Then a Lt. James Dunbar (Don Taylor) arrives in the camp. He is accused with bombing an ammunition train and he must escape from the camp before he is taken to Berlin, probably for execution. Of course they have to find the informant first or Dunbar will die anyway.<br/><br/>The movie has some dramatic elements like the deaths of the two who escape in the beginning, but in my opinion the movie shows the camp a little too friendly. It seems that the live there was not so hard, and I guess it must have been terrible. Leaving that the movie is great. There are a lot of funny and exciting moments. The twist near the end is a nice one and the performances are very good, although sometimes it is a little too much. Especially a character named Animal (Robert Strauss) seems to be more like a cartoon figure than a real person. It doesn't make much of a difference. Director Billy Wilder has made another fine classic."

","The only thing that made me see this movie was a thousand references to ""Hogan's Heroes."" Now I have to admit that I like and appreciate both. With the wry wit of ""MASH,"" this movie has given me a faint glimpse into the prisoner of war camps of WW2. The plot starts out like the show with Bob Crane and Werner Klemperer and turns into a whodunit that leaves you wondering who the fink is. Even after seeing this movie a dozen times, I keep returning for the humor, my favorite being the Hitler take-off. ""One Fuerher is enough for me. "" says Schultz played by the obscure Sig Rumen. My favorite characters besides William Holden's are Harvey Lembeck and Robert Strauss as they are at the hub of most of the humor. The cold reality of the war is also present in the superb plot as is the POW's way of handling it. Otto Preminger turns in an excellant performance as the Commodant. All together, the Billy Wilder material comes through perfectly in this classic film."

","I am incredibly surprised this movie is so high up on the IMDb top 250, when it really deserves to be higher. I think it is one of the most intelligent, funny, sad but feel-good movies I have ever seen. Action packed, but perfectly balanced. The good with the bad, the happiness with the sadness... this film is truly beautiful. Stalag is a comedy/drama ""dramady"" about a World War II P.O.W camp. This is a strong contrast to Wilder's other work: The Seven Year Itch(1955), Some Like It Hot (1959), Sunset Blvd (1951) etc, but perhaps one of his best.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple. The boys are plotting to escape from Stalag 17, however it isn't proving easy as they thought. After two guys got killed trying to escape, they figure there must be a mole amongst them. The finger is pointed at Sefton (William Holden - GREAT PERFORMANCE!!) - an obvious target as he trades and deals with the Germans, just trying to ""make the best"" of his stay there, causing a great deal of jealousy. He somehow has to prove that he isn't the mole, and more importantly, he has to prove WHO IS the mole.<br/><br/>This is a thrilling and funny film that leaves you guessing. The end is worth waiting for, as I believe it is one of the most rewarding and triumphant endings I have ever seen. It resolves wonderfully, and leaves you feeling positive and hopeful about an otherwise depressing topic. As I said before, I am rather disappointed that this isn't in the top ten - or top 50 or 100 - because it truly deserves to be. It is a beautiful film - it was beautiful then, it's beautiful now. Don't miss Holden's Oscar winning performance."

","If you want to see what a POW camp was really like, then Stalag 17 is probably not the film to watch.  But if you want to really laugh while also really think (as in trying to solve a mystery), then you can't do much better than this classic.<br/><br/>Holden is tremendous as the scheming, hustling Sergeant Sefton.  He is also clearly the star in this film as the remainder of the cast play their roles admirably yet none of them is clearly the ""co-star"".  Special mention should, however, go to the characters of Shapiro and The Animal.  Look, comedy is very very subjective, and I know these guys' schtick isn't for everyone (having read some other comments!), but for me, these guys were drop dead hilarious.  I always looked forward to their antics, and they didn't disappoint me.  And I have to say that in such a miserable environment, I would have appreciated guys like this who tried to keep things as light as possible.<br/><br/>As for the plot, I was really taken by it.  You can read the summary more quickly than I can try to summarize it, but it's definitely original. Factual?  I don't know...and I also don't care.  It's a Hollywood movie, and a very entertaining one.<br/><br/>Finally, I can't say enough about the dialogue.  They don't write 'em like this anymore, probably because they CAN'T write 'em like this anymore. Quick-witted is an understatement.<br/><br/>Give it a shot, hope you enjoy it!"

While this is comedic at times, it is actually a serious drama (unlike an abomination like ""Hogan's Heroes"" which is loosely based on this film). The strength of this is the ensemble acting where we get to meet and enjoy the different prisoners. William Holden, because he is enterprising, becomes the focus of his own men when it seems that the Germans are getting information from inside the barracks. Because he seems to have the ear of the commandant, they are sure that he is he rat. It will be his job to find out who is really behind all this.

","""The story of that struggle cannot be read without admiration for the courage, the perseverance, the vital force which enabled him to challenge, defy, conciliate and overcome all authorities and resistance which barred his path. I have always said that if Great Britain were defeated in war, I hoped we should find a Hitler to lead us back to our rightful position among the nations."" - Winston Churchill <br/><br/>Heavily influenced by Jean Renoir's ""La Grande Illusion"" (1937), Billy Wilder's ""Stalag 17"" takes place within a German prisoner of war camp during World War 2's final years. The film was released in 1953 and is regarded as one of Wilder's early masterpieces.<br/><br/>""Stalag's"" first half develops a subplot in which J.J Sefton, an American black marketeer, is suspected by his comrades of having spied for their German captors. This subplot has been read as a comment on McCarthyism, but if that were so, its resolution, in which Sefton and his buddies band together to weed out the real rat, misses the historical lesson of McCarthyism entirely.<br/><br/>""Stalag 17"" is aided greatly by Ernest Laszlo's grim black-and-white cinematography. Wilder's direction is also expert, though the film too often prettifies life in the camps. This is a feel good POW movie, very Hollywood, and anticipates Wilder's later, lighter, Lubitsch styled comedies (as well as the transvestite humour of ""Some Like It Hot""). On the flip side, Wilder teases out a number of very bittersweet and even grim moments, and his Sefton character, infectiously played by William Holden, is always interesting. Pragmatism incarnate, Sefton is a profiteer, a merchant, always taking bets and treating the survival of his comrades as a game of profit, loss, risk and reward. Like Rick in ""Casablanca"", Sefton then calls himself into action, the film ending with him risking his guts for another human being. Is this an act of altruism, though, or another scheme by Sefton undertaken solely because he likes the odds? <br/><br/>Bizarrely, Wilder portrays Sefton's profiteering as being detrimental within both the collective confines of the barracks, and the larger landscape of war. When Sefton is labelled a traitor by his fellow Americans, his bounty and profits are then appropriated by the group and distributed amongst the men. Ironically, ""Allied"" involvement in WW2 was designed to stop precisely this kind of collectivism. As the Governor of the Bank of England himself quipped, ""British loans to Hitler should be seen as an investment against Bolshevism and communism"". Far from an enemy, the monarchs and aristocrats across Europe, of whom Winston Churchill himself belonged (most of the royalty in Germany, England and Russia were related), championed the German Army. Fearful of revolutions, civil wars, and losing their power, they saw Hitler (and even Mussolini, who Churchill routinely praised) as a weapon to be used against Marxists, ""Jews"", Bolsheviks and Russia itself. A further irony is that, without Stalin's bloody brand of collectivization, Hitler perhaps wouldn't have been defeated; statistically, 79-89% of all Nazi casualties were inflicted by the Soviets.<br/><br/>""Stalag 17"" would prove hugely influential, shaping everything form ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"" to ""The Great Escape"" to ""Papillon"" to ""King Rat"". It would influence the farcical TV show ""Hogan's Heroes"", and would be one of Wilder's last dramas (""Witness for the Prosecution"" and ""The Spirit of St Louis"" would follow some years later), the director gradually moving toward comedies.<br/><br/>8/10 – Worth two viewings."

","William Holden won an Oscar as JJ Sefton, the amoral prison-camp spiv who hustles his fellow internees out of their food parcels and cigarettes in order to trade with the Germans for better privileges. His success at both makes him an unpopular character. So; when a traitor is suspected, he is number one on the list.<br/><br/>Of course; we all know that's far too obvious. Sefton may be a heal but he's no rat.<br/><br/>Wilder's work is one of a number of wartime comedies, but perhaps because of its vintage it hasn't aged quite so well. Some of the comedy comes too close to farce and seems at odds with the Germans' readiness to shoot escapees. Most of the gags are in the first half, after that it drifts towards a who-dunnit. Sefton sets out to discover the spy after he is beaten-up and his possessions indiscriminately plundered.<br/><br/>There's no great shakes. Almost all of the characters are stereotypic. Some of the conflicts appear contrived. I really enjoyed it when I first saw it as a kid half a century ago, now I'm less inclined. And I'm no longer a fan of ongoing narrative in a movie. It's okay for an intro, but after that the characters and plot should speak for themselves. The viewer shouldn't need additional prompts.<br/><br/>Still well worth a watch if you get the chance and haven't seen it before, but it's certainly no classic. Holden is very good, yet it's hard to believe that his performance was the best of the movies for 1953."
"mjneu59","6","1","2","4 January 2011"," Billy Wilder's Heroes
","Billy Wilder's adaptation of a popular stage play drafted the blueprint for every subsequent World War II POW drama, and by now it's been seen in so many familiar variations that the original can't help but look a little stale. The searchlights and barbed wire, the Old World Prussian kommandant, and the elaborate escape tunnels are all here, together with the same bunch of gruff GI Joes, always cursing the krauts and moaning over dames. Who would expect a Nazi concentration camp could be such fun? The pendulum shift in tone from boyish humor to stark melodrama probably owes more to its theatrical source than to any sort of cinematic expression, but the spy-in-the-barracks plot is still effective, once the fun and games finally end. But the only member of the cast able to rise above the ranks of cardboard cutouts is William Holden, both in character and performance. As the cynical lone-wolf prisoner who bargains with the Germans for his own comfort (and draws the resentment and suspicion of his barrack mates), he single-handedly makes the film worthwhile after all this time."
"BennetDarcy","9","2","7","25 July 2003"," Excellent Movie!!!!!
","William Holden rightfully earned the Oscar for his portrayal as Sgt. Sefton, a cynical and yet humorously sarcastic soldier stuck in an German POW camp during WW2. I first saw this movie several years ago and was immediately captivated by the humor and witty remarks by all of the characters, especially Animal, Shapiro, and of course, Sefton himself. It's a lighthearted movie, even though it takes place during a difficult time in history. Still, everyone (and I mean everyone) will enjoy it. even my brothers, who only watch contemporary movies, really enjoyed this movie. (I admit it, I'm probably one of the very few under eighteen years of age who loves watching classics.) Even one of my brothers now considers this as one of his favorite movies, and I know that this definitely is in my top 5, and always will be.

"DRomm","9","2","7","27 August 2000"," 50 years later there have been grittier war films, but few better
","The dialog is terse, the acting exceptional, the humor gallows.  Stalag 17 was made in 1953 and even then talked about other WWII movies.  Since then, there have been many more war movies that have explored gritty themes.  The mud of Stalag 17 looks tame compared to the blood and guts of Saving Private Ryan and the desperate humor can't match the irony in Full Metal Jacket. But the movie holds up astonishingly well.  Maybe it's that there aren't time specific elements like money or armaments.  Two cigarettes might get you a shot of bootleg booze in any war.  That gives the film a timeless element that could apply to any prisoners, in any war.<br/><br/>It's too bad that the spinoffs from Stalag 17 include Hogan's Heroes (who took some of the characters unchanged) and Alvin and the Chipmunks (as Ross Bagdasarian has an uncredited singing role).  While the humor is an important element of the movie, it's the character interaction which lies at its heart.<br/><br/>Stalag 17 is a vintage WWII movie that stands the test of time.  Billy Wilder knows what he's doing in any genre."

","I loved this movie when I was a kid. Unfortunately the comedy doesn't seem as funny now, just juvenile. Many other reviewers agree with me and say this makes the movie unrealistic. On this point I have to disagree for the following reasons.
The play upon which this movie was based on was written by two former prisoners of war. One of those writers played the role of the husband of the adultress who ""found a baby left on the porch "". This man should know first hand what life in a POW camp was like. Secondly the comedic tastes of ""The Great Generation"" were not subtle. <br/><br/>These were enlisted men. Just before the war, the country was experiencing the great economic depression. A high school education was not typical of these men. My father for example, had only attained a 6th grade education. Even though hollywood movies were replacing vaudeville circuit shows, they still existed and their level of comedy was still of the pie in your face variety.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is; while today we may see the attempts at comedy as juvenile, it was very much typical of the times and that does not make this movie unrealistic."
"ofpsmith","9","1","3","27 April 2014"," It's kind of like a ""Who done it.""
","I just finished watching this movie. I felt immediately like I should review it. So here I am now. The film is about a prison camp in World War 2. It focuses on one barrack. Well in this barrack, there is an informant who tells the Germans of escapes and anything else. The informant is suspected of being Sergeant JJ Sefton (William Holden). Sergeant Sefton is a cynical US Airman who never wishes to escape. He also gets many unexplained luxuries. Sergeant Sefton needs to clear his name to avoid being beaten for a second time. Sergeant Price (Peter Graves) is the head of security. One time Sergeant Sefton overhears Price talking with (get his) Sergeant Johann Shultz (Sig Ruman) about secret information. Price puts the secrets he learns in a chess piece. And then later Shultz comes by and picks them up. When a US Airman arrives in the camp named Lieutenant James Dunbar (Don Taylor) he tells the prisoners that he sabotaged an ammunition. Soon the Germans find out about it and they capture Lieutenant Dunbar. All the pressure is on Sergeant Sefton who has to reveal that he is not the informant, by finding out the real one. He eventually reveals it to be Price while at the same time breaking out Lieutenant Dunbar. I say that everyone should watch this movie."

"sddavis63","7","1","3","22 February 2010"," Pretty Good POW Camp Mystery
","The mystery in this starts right from the beginning. Two POWs attempt to escape from Stalag 17 (apparently, the toughest POW camp in Germany, with a perfect record.) POW Sefton (played by William Holden, in a role for which he won an Oscar) bets the others that they won't make it. They don't. Everyone suspects that there's a ""stoolie"" in Barracks 4 passing information on to the Germans. Sefton trades with the guards, and gets a lot of extra privileges from them, and so he becomes the prime suspect. From the viewer's point of view, it's pretty obvious that Sefton isn't the guy. First, it would have been way too obvious, and, second, if he had been the Germans wouldn't have made him such an obvious target. So the mystery revolves around who the stoolie actually is, and director Billy Wilder does a pretty good job of keeping us guessing. There's nothing that really gives it away until that mystery is finally revealed a little more than halfway through the movie with a rather devious question from Sefton (who's committed himself to finding out who the stoolie is) about Pearl Harbor, but the solution to one mystery leads to another - what are the POWs going to do with the real stoolie?<br/><br/>This is a pretty decent movie. Aside from a few brief moments, it's not especially exciting, but the mystery is well enough developed that it keeps you watching all the way through. It does have a lot of unnecessary material. Animal's obsession with Betty Grable is funny for a little while, but does get tired eventually, and the whole Christmas Party in the Barracks goes on a bit too long. I also thought the whole idea of female Russian prisoners in a separate compound of the same camp (who looked - shall we say - pretty healthy!) was a real stretch to the credibility of the movie. It seems to me that this is a bit over-rated, although the story is generally good, as are the performances - Holden's, I thought (while good) being somewhat understated for a Lead Actor win. <br/><br/>As an aside, it's interesting to note that this must have given birth to the later TV series Hogan's Heroes. There are too many similarities in the basic story to be coincidental (the toughest POW Camp in Germany from which no one escapes, the bald-headed Commandant - played here by Otto Preminger and in the series by Werner Klemperer, and even a character named Sgt. Schultz.)"

These guys want to escape but a German stooge has been planted amongst them to prevent it by getting information about their activities. The story goes through & finally figures out who the stooge is & mete out his just punishment.<br/><br/>The film is solid because it is borrowed from a Broadway show included some of the cast & tells a powerful drama with a little comedy mixed in to help it through.

","""Stalag 17"" is one of the finest films set in a POW camp.  Obviously, there are going to be comparisons to ""The Great Escape"" by everybody, but I think that they are each great in their own way.  Whereas ""The Great Escape"" is an excellent action film, there is little action in ""Stalag 17"", with the focus being more on the drama.<br/><br/>The film begins with POWs attempting to escape they boredom of their lives. Two of them attempt to escape, but are killed.  The men know that there's a snitch somewhere, and they pin it on Sgt. Sefton (Holden).  This leads to all sorts of trouble, culminating in an excellent ending.<br/><br/>The characters in this film are quite interesting, especially the cynical Sefton, whom Holden does a standout job of portraying.  Where this movie shines is in one area that is usually associated with Wilder - the sharp, witty dialogue.  The comments the men make around each other all create a sympathy that you can understand the suffering of the lives they are living.

"Trespassers Will","8","1","3","23 January 2002"," It's sad and funny at the same time.
","Stalag 17 is a war film that may not have action, as war films are usually characterized, but it is still a fine war film none the less.<br/><br/>
What sets it apart from other war films is that it takes place inside a POW camp in Germany during WWII. Stalag 17 is escape proof. At least that's what the commandant wants you to think. But inside Barracks 4, there are several men who continually try to break out. Their attempts are always foiled, and it is assumed that someone in the barracks is a rat. The movie continues on as the men beat up on one guy they believe is the spy. *spoiler* He's not. You have to see the movie to figure out who it is, and you probably will have never guessed.<br/><br/>Aside from the great little mystery, there are several memorable characters. Most memorable is Animal, a man who continually tries to find a way into the Russian compound because of the female POWs constantly being brought in and has a ""slight crush"" on Betty Grable. You have to see the movie to see what I mean. Shapiro, Animal's best friend and often partner in scheme. Sefton, the man who has it pretty well off because of his trading with the Germans for little luxuries. Joey, a piccolo player who has been so traumatized that he never speaks and barely even looks at anyone. <br/><br/>It was sad to see these men being held in clearly uncomfortable conditions, to see them break down occasionally and hear of messages that seem to make them think their incarceration doesn't mean anything, like when Shapiro gets a half a dozen letters that say they want the payments for his car and then they say they've taken it, and the man whose wife said that she found a baby on their doorstep that looks exactly like her (sure). <br/><br/>This film is an unforgettable classic. 8/10"

","In Hollywood and other film industries, there have been many movies on Prisoners of War (POW'S) of the Second World War.

Stalag means prison in German and this movie deals with the POW's of Stalag 17. This particular prison has surprisingly all sergeants as inmates who are continuously trying to flee prison but in vain. After the death of two of their companions in a bid to escape, they suspect a spy amidst them. Their main suspect is a flamboyant Sgt. J.J. Sefton (Holden) who has a very good rapport with the Germans and exchanges many goodies for other favors. Many events occur consequently that strengthen their suspicion on Sefton. To prove his innocence, Sefton decides to find the real culprit. Is he successful in his conquest and who is the 'real' spy is the basis of the story. Wilder in his inimitable style has not kept this movie an all serious affair. This is actually a very light-hearted thriller drama which makes you laugh all along. I personally feel this movie inspired some of the scenes in the greatest POW movie ever 'The Great Escape'. <br/><br/>This movie has got a gang of characters. But some who stand apart with their performances are obviously William Holden as the complicated Sefton, Robert Strauss as the somewhat weird, silly but lovable Stanislas Kasava and Robinson Stone as the mute music lover Joey.It certainly has got it's moments, but I felt there was something missing somewhere.<br/><br/>Rating : 7/10"

","Stalag 17, like lots of other movies who have won veteran actors an Oscar, is a completely forgettable movie that would be looked at as mediocre at best if not for the simple fact that it won a veteran actor an Oscar. Would Butterfield 8 be famous if Elizabeth Taylor didn't win an Oscar? How about Lilies of the Field? Probably not, and neither would Stalag 17.<br/><br/>In a prisoner-of-war camp, William Holden, Robert Strauss, Harvey Lembeck, Richard Erdman, Peter Graves and others are stuck together, none of them outranking each other, and each suspecting the other of cooperating with the enemy. Their German captors are getting leaked information about planned escapes; who is the mole? You'll have to rent this one to find out, and also to find out if they wind up with a successful escape plan. Personally, this isn't the best escape-from-prison flick, nor is it the best POW camp flick, nor is it the best William Holden flick.

"TheLittleSongbird","10","1","5","15 July 2015"," Classic Second World War comedy-drama from Billy Wilder
","Billy Wilder was a truly great director, whose best work was up there with the best films ever made (i.e. Sunset Boulevard) and even lesser films like The Emperor Waltz were still worth watching. Stalag 17 is not quite one of my favourites from Wilder but that doesn't stop it from being a classic.<br/><br/>As always with Wilder's films, Stalag 17 visually is a very well-made film, and German PoW camp life is very effectively and accurately depicted as claustrophobic. It's beautifully photographed and atmospherically lit, still managing to look aesthetically pleasing while still making the claustrophobic setting as evocative as possible and never looking too flashy or static. As always, there is nothing really to fault Wilder's direction, his visual and writing always shines and he doesn't fail to make the story or characters interesting. Franz Waxman's score is another winner from him, stirring, luscious and haunting while always being appropriate to the film's mood and not being too syrupy.<br/><br/>Stalag 17 has a very compelling story, with a good mix of the hilarious, the poignant and the foreboding, emotions are never forced, the pacing is both controlled and exciting, for me the comedy didn't get too much or too goofy and the suspense and tension reach nail-biting heights. The script superbly balances comedy, drama and even satire, what the film tried to be and do not once coming into question. The comedy, a lot of it deliciously dark, is genuinely funny and quite endearing, it may be too much or too goofy for some viewers (depending on whether the antics of Animal and Harry are to your tastes or not) but it appealed to me just fine, and Animal and Harry's antics were appropriately light-hearted and gave the film its heart. The drama doesn't fall into clichés and doesn't slow the film at all, also avoiding the mistake of some comedy-dramas seen of jarring with the comedy to the extent the film feels like two different ones. It's also very charming and poignant. The satire is sharp and biting without falling into attacking or bitterness, never does it feel like it's too much.<br/><br/>The performances are spot-on from a top notch, and they are advantaged by the fact that the characters are interesting and their situation relatable without falling into stereotypes (even when more stylised that's even including the Germans). William Holden got a well-deserved Oscar for his powerful performance in a somewhat unsympathetic role, while Robert Strauss is funny and moving as Animal, the character that can be seen as the heart of the story, and Otto Preminger (in a surprise piece of casting, considering I know him better as a director) mesmerises as a particularly nasty character, looking like he was having a whale of a time. Harvey Lembeck, like Strauss, was part of the original Broadway run, and it's easy to see why in a fine performance that endears far more than it annoys. Sig Ruman gives a character that could have easily been a buffoonish caricature some welcome subtlety and genuine menace while clearly having a ball.<br/><br/>Overall, another Billy Wilder classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"jcohen1","7","1","5","6 August 2007"," Father of Hogan's Heroes?
","As a big fan of The Great Escape (1963) Stalag 17 is the parent and I imagine the first film portrayal of American soldiers at a German POW camp. Stalag is a very good film with excellent performances by Holden, Strauss,Lembeck, Ruman & Preminger. Still, I can't say I prefer the ""father"" to the son. The Great Escape is a much grander scale movie with many heroes. The Allies are all true to each other, no rats or spies. Maybe the fact that soldiers appearto turn on one of their ""own"" is upsetting. Frankly it's not believable to me that Sefton would survive his beating. If the boys felt he really was a spy they would have killed him. Wilder's film spends as much time with men dancing with men or dressed in drag, presumably comic relief, as the spy story. You shouldn't really mix Some Like it Hot Redux into this film.<br/><br/>According to TCM, the final scene with Sefton's salute was an add on to soften his prior remarks."

Holden is the camp opportunist, the conman, the guy lookin' for an angle - any angle - for himself. He orchestrates stuff like in-camp horse races, using mice as the subs for horsies. He's the one with the chest full of prime stuff, while everyone else slogs their way through with nary a cooked egg to their name. But Holden's wily ways catch up to him: his cynicism and willingness to bet on men failing to escape earn him the enmity of almost everyone in the camp. And when it becomes apparent that there is an informer among the men, probably selling info to the Germans, he naturally becomes the prime suspect. This soon earns him a beating and a reputation lower than the lowest rat. His only option: ferret out the real informer and clear his own name. There ain't much to celebrate for any of these jokers, having to spend the Holiday in prison overseas. Director Billy Wilder, known for his comedies, instills a sense of humor in scenes involving the German guards, to the point of making them all look clownish. In this day, this calls to mind the TV Series ""Hogan's Heroes"" - a comparison I'm sure the filmmakers did not have in mind. So, amid the death & drudgery, we have a few laughs. I've always found Holden to be miscast in the prime role; he seems much too stolid and heroic-looking to be the weasel here. Based on a famous play."

","This is a great Billy Wilder film, made mid-stream in his career at the height of his movie making. Wilder and Edwin Blum adapted the story for the screen from the 1951-52 Tony Award winning Broadway play by former prisoners of war Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski. José Ferrer won the Tony as Best Director in the play from which Harvey Lembeck as Harry Shapiro and Robert Strauss as Stosh Kasava reprise their stage roles in the film. Also appearing in the movie is playwright Edmund Trzcinski as Triz. William Holden leads the cast in this movie for which he won Best Actor for the 1953 Academy Awards. Stalag 17 received two other nominations fro Wilder as Best Director and for Strauss in Supporting Actor. rounding out the cast is Actor/Film Director Otto Prminger, Don Taylor, Peter Graves and Neville Brand. Veteran Cinematographer Ernest Laszlo photographed the film where much of the scenes are outdoors in the camp compound as opposed to the mostly interior set of the play. This is arguably Holden's finest film role in the comedy/drama about prisoners of war in World War II Germany that inspired the television comedy show Hogan's Heroes.

Six hundred guys who are angry. And one of them is an informant. The question is: which one? This is a good movie. The acting is first-rate and although the movie is somewhat theatrical, the story helps keep the movie watchable. Peter Graves is great in this movie. His character is both engagingly clever and peculiarly sinister, more so because of Mr. Graves's powerful performance. Who would think that such a wholesome looking soldier would be so loathsome? Who would think that such nice looking man would be so duplicitous? Indeed, Peter Graves's performance overshadows and in fact dominates the movie. In a way this movie is like ""The Westerner,"" which ostensibly starred Gary Cooper but in fact was dominated by Walter Brennan, with Mr. Cooper playing a supporting role.

This is some fun, but it has various undertones and a harsh side opening in the scene, when the 2 guys trying to escape are mowed down relentlessly and with an unbelievable amount of ammo being wasted. And it continues, when the assumed traitor is beaten up and threatened by his comrades, but comes to detect the real stoolie and his ways.

","Although the play by Edmund Trzcinski and Donald Bevan had been a smash hit on Broadway, most insiders did not expect STALAG 17 to succeed as a film. The story concerned WWII American POWs held in a Nazi camp--but it combined serious drama with broad farce and offered one of the first anti-heroes in American film in the leading role. With the war still very fresh in every one's mind, the combination seemed more likely to offend than appeal. Every one concerned held their breath when the film debuted: would audiences get it? They did indeed, and STALAG 17 became one of the most critically-lauded and commercially popular films of the early 1950s, picking up an Academy Award nomination for director Billy Wilder and a Best Actor Oscar for William Holden in the process.<br/><br/>The story concerns American prisoners of war held in the German ""Stalag 17"" in 1944, and it begins grimly: after much planning, the Americans have devised an escape for two of their number, but the next morning the bullet-riddled bodies of the two men are dragged into camp and dumped in the mud. But the escape plan should have worked. It was perfect. How did the Germans know? Suspicion begins to settle on J.J. Sefton (Holden), a bitter cynic and hardbitten opportunist who spends his time running various scams designed to strip his fellow prisoners of what little they have.<br/><br/>While this might have worked as drama pure and simple, the film counterbalances its darkness with streaks of a sort of ""boys will be boys"" broad farce played out in the most over-the-top way imaginable. And strange to say, even given the overplaying typical of the early 1950s, the balance works: for every dramatic twist there is a stroke of comedy, and for every stroke of comedy there is a dramatic twist. In Wilder's hands the ensemble cast, which includes the likes of Otto Preminger and Peter Graves, performs some of the most remarkable juggling of the decade. But the glue here is William Holden. Interestingly, according to most sources Holden hated the play and hated the character and did the project under duress. Whatever the case, he gives a truly remarkable performance: Sefton is not a likable man by any stretch of the imagination, but even so he has certain self-integrity that you cannot help but admire. While Holden is now probably best remembered for his performances in SUNSET BLVD and NETWORK, his work here is likely the finest of his entire career.<br/><br/>There has been some complaint that STALAG 17 is disrespectful to WWII prisoners of war, for it paints their Nazi captors as buffoons and camp conditions as not so much horrific as merely unpleasant--and it is true that the film makes no serious portray the extreme difficulties most POWs encountered. But to say that it is disrespectful to POWs is akin to saying that 42nd STREET is disrespectful to chorus girls: we know, just as 1953 audiences knew, that this is not an attempt to portray reality; it is instead a story told via our willing suspension of disbelief--and a very entertaining story it is indeed.

","Having just watched this movie for the nth time, I was once again struck by this entertaining yet serious portrayal of a difficult subject.  However, it seems obvious that the treatment of our WWII POW's was far worse than depicted.  As such, in light of some of the recent films dealing with WWII, this movie screams for a remake.  I believe Kevin Spacey would be superb as Sefton (perhaps as good as Holden) and Matt Damon would make a good Price. I strongly encourage the Hanks and Spielberg combo to create a version of the story in the same vein as ""Saving Private Ryan""...it could be huge!"

","""Stalag 17"" is about 30 minutes of compelling film starring William Holden padded out with about 90 minutes of strained ""comedy."" <br/><br/>Holden plays an inmate in a German prison camp during WWII who comes under suspicion by his fellow prisoners of being a spy because of his ""every man for himself"" attitude. For about an hour and a half, scenes of the prisoners being grumpy with him are interspersed with long segments of superfluous antics which make being an inmate of a German POW prison seem about as serious as being away at summer camp. Then, in the film's last half hour, Holden decides to find out who the spy really is, and does so without breaking a sweat.<br/><br/>Holden's entire performance consists of attitude, which is exactly what the character calls for, but it's not the stuff of an Oscar-winning performance, especially because he seems very much like a supporting character. I wasn't timing things with a stopwatch, but it felt like Robert Strauss, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor as the lunkhead Animal, had more screen time. He's one of the actors included for comic relief, but man does he wear out his welcome early on, as do all of the other actors who are there only to provide what we are supposed to think are hysterical hijinks. The film would feel like an inferior knock off of ""MASH"" if it hadn't come out first. <br/><br/>Billy Wilder joined Holden and Strauss at the 1953 Oscars as a nominee for Best Director. <br/><br/>Grade: B-"

"Leofwine_draca","7","0","1","14 September 2016"," Likable prisoner of war movie
","STALAG 17 is one of the granddaddies of the prisoner of war genre and stands out from having a lightness of touch which comes to the production courtesy of director Billy Wilder. Certainly Wilder skirts the more depressing aspects of life in a Nazi prisoner of war camp and instead concentrates on presenting the larger than life characters who occupy one of the buildings. There's a lot of incidental character humour inserted into the movie, particularly with the antics of a couple of losers who spend their days boozing and dreaming about women.<br/><br/>Thankfully the comic hijinks don't retreat from the thrills of the main storyline, which is about one of the men being a secret informer who keeps telling the German camp commanders all of the prisoners's secrets. Poor old William Holden - a likable everyman hero - is suspected thanks to his wheeling and dealing ways, but of course he's innocent so he has to try to figure out the identity of the man for himself.<br/><br/>This is a breezy movie with little material to offend or bore. The acting is exemplary and the pacing, although slow, is sufficient enough to keep you intrigued throughout. There are some good actors in support including Neville Brand, Peter Graves, Otto Preminger, and Robert Strauss. Some of the set-piece scenes, particularly towards the climax, are particularly thrilling. STALAG 17 is a lot of fun."
"robert-temple-1","8","0","1","25 June 2016"," Prisoners of war, a tragi-comedy
","This was a very famous film at the time and made a big impact. One of the reasons for this was that the story was largely true. There really was a Stalag 17 (the name of a POW camp in Germany), and the characters really existed. One needs to remember that this film was made only a few years after the end of the War, and everything still resonated very strongly. The lead role is played by William Holden, who won the Oscar for his performance. If you want to know the truth, his performance is nothing to be excited about, and did not deserve an Oscar, but he himself claimed he was given it to make up for his having been denied one three years before for his role in SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950). Who knows. He was in any case a very popular and talented lead actor of the time. One surprise in this film is that the director Otto Preminger appears as an actor in the film, and plays the German commandant of the camp, Oberst (Colonel) von Scherbach. Preminger did not direct the film. It was directed by Billy Wilder. Stalag 17 is a camp for captured American non-commissioned officers, so everyone in the camp is a sergeant. They keep trying to escape but keep getting caught. The film begins with two of them being shot for this. They all know there is a 'stoolie' amongst them who is telling the Germans of all of their plans, but no one can figure out who it is. They all decide it is William Holden, who is not a team player and keeps himself to himself, and refuses to go along with group-think. But of course it is not Holden. Holden eventually figures out who it really is, but how can he prove it and expose him? The film is full of raw comedy, laughs, jokes, and teasing. This sounds very unlikely for a film about prisoners of war, and it certainly is, but it works. The film makes lively and entertaining viewing, and has been released in a restored version on Blu-Ray."

","Stalag 17, Billy Wilder's adaptation of the 1951 Broadway hit, is a rowdily entertaining prisoner of war movie, screened as a lusty comedy-melodrama, loaded with gallant, masculine humor and the original's uninhibited earthiness <br/><br/>The film surrounds the inhabitants of one of the myriad prisoner of war camps established by Germany during World War II â€“ Stalag 17. When two American prisoners, attempting to escape from the camp, run into a German ambush led by German commandant, Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger), it becomes clear to the men in the barrack that they have an informer in their midst. Suspicion fastens on master trader Sergeant Sefton (William Holden), a charismatic, slick-talking yet cynical loner who irritates his camp-mates because he brazenly makes swaps and takes odds on who's going to live or die. All the men in the barracks start to suspect him of trading more than cigarettes and silk stockings with the Germans. A second betrayal seems to confirm their suspicions and he is beaten up by the men mercilessly. Of course, we're certain from the beginning that Sefton isn't the guilty party. Our cocky black- marketeer however, refuses to play the patsy and resolves to expose the traitor before embarking on his own bid for freedom. <br/><br/>Set entirely within a WWII German prison camp for American servicemen, this serio-comedy depicts in a raw, edgy, and humorous way their daily existence, defined by cruel ironies, prickling situations, jousting schemes, rivalry feuds and oneupmanship games. Like a lot of Wilder's oeuvre, Stalag 17 is open about the comic side of lust, and that frankness, however slight, still sounds refreshingly adult. Wilder uses a suspense approach with plenty of leavening humorous byplay springing from the confinement of healthy young males. He superbly balances elements of drama, satire and comedy, and captures the claustrophobia of camp life. He also manages to extract a wonderful performance from his cast, including a truly award-winning turn by William Holden as the cocky, self- serving American prisoner and Otto Preminger, who relishes his part as a nasty Nazi.<br/><br/>Stalag 17 has a certain humanity and realism that involves you with the intensity of its settings. Like all of Wilder's works, it is not transparently jaded, preachy or egocentric but an astounding blend of revelatory, entertaining and riveting."

","""Stalag 17"" betrays its stage origins. The director, Billy Wilder, has opened it up a bit to show the assembly area in the middle of a dismal continental winter in Germany but most of the action takes place inside Barracks Four, where about two dozen Air Force sergeants are kept as POWs.<br/><br/>William Holden gets the lead and is the pivotal figure but it's really an ensemble movie with memorable characters and some equally impressive scenes. It may seem a bit hokey now but when it ran on Broadway in 1951 and 1952, the war was only a few years behind us and still fresh in our memories, so what seems stilted now was news at the time.<br/><br/>Among the two dozen inmates of Barracks Four, Holden is the odd man out, a wheeler and dealer with a treasure chest of wine, cigarettes, silk stockings, and other delicacies. The sociologist, Erving Goffman, described such places as ""total institutions"" in which life was regimented. Part of any functioning total institution was what he called ""the small reward system."" And Holden is the savvy broker who seems to win every bet and whose prices for small rewards resemble usury. He was stuck in the role of operator for several other films, such as ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and ""Sunset Boulevard,"" and he was good at it.<br/><br/>One of the better performances is Otto Preminger's as the camps commander, Colonel von Scherbach. His imperious mien is overdone to the point of hilarity. He struts about, making flippant remarks about dead bodies, has a subordinate put on his boots and then take them off again. As a director he was intimidating and authoritarian. One wonders how he took direction from Billy Wilder.<br/><br/>Amid all the jokes and improbable events there is one moment of genuine pathos. A complete slob of a POW, Robert Strauss, gets drunk on Christmas and convinces himself that his friend, Harvey Lembeck, is really his ideal woman, Betty Grable. The men dance with each other, Strauss whispers into Lembeck's ear how much he loves her, how he dreams about her every day. When Lembeck, stunned, brings him back to reality, Strauss breaks down into a torrent of convincing tears. It's the only moment in the movie that isn't undercut by irony, cynicism, or triteness.<br/><br/>It's a tightly written comedy/drama and not likely to be forgotten quickly."

However it stumbles because it doesn't live up to that story, its soul if you like, a tense whodunnit war film. There is a severe lack of tension throughout the whole thing, from the opening scene when the 2 POWs are shot, to the finale. It could have been given so much more of a claustrophobic feel, and really ramped up the drama. I didn't particularly care who the rat was as nothing during the movie made me want to find out (my first instinct was correct too).<br/><br/>To summarise, this movie gets a solid 7 based on great acting, great story but average direction."
"bob-790-196018","6","0","1","8 February 2011"," Pretty Good Drama Combined with Routine Service Comedy
","Shades of Martin and Lewis, Abbott and Costello, and all the other comics who made service comedies in the WWII and postwar years. You'd almost expect Dean and Jerry to show up in Stalag 17. In fact, Robert Strauss, who frequently showed up as the loud but stupid sergeant in some of the service comedies, appears in Stalag 17 as Animal. He was Jerry's bete noire in ""Jumping Jacks"" and ""Sailor Beware."" <br/><br/>Strauss's simple-minded humor is kind of fun in those other movies but not what you would expect in a picture by the sophisticated Billy Wilder. You can laugh at the first depiction of Animal's unrequited love for Betty Grable, but not at the tenth. Similarly, the sequence of men dancing with other men to romantic music is funny at first, then gets boring and even a bit disconcerting after the sequence is prolonged and the men give no further evidence that this is at least partly being done in fun. There is much other laying on too thick of humorous material that is usually seen as kid stuff.<br/><br/>In the midst of this, we have a drama, played out by capable actors, including William Holden in a fine performance. Sig Ruman does his ""comical German"" schtik as in so many other films, and this is a humor very different from the Robert Strauss brand. Even higher on the scale of sophistication is Otto Preminger's riff on the Erich von Stroheim role in Grand Illusion.<br/><br/>Two movies in one, then. Much of the goings on, particularly the humorous parts, seem improbable, yet the movie was based on a play by former POWs. So go figure. It's hard to imagine that being in a German prison camp would give rise to big laughs. Maybe you had to be there.<br/><br/>On the other hand, maybe World War II has been reduced to raw material for the likes of ""Hogan's Heroes."""

","From what I've seen of Billy Wilder, his movies tend to have well defined characters and a clear course of action.  Sometimes they are funny, and when they are funny, they are funny by virtue of being clever.  As well, the pacing in his movies always seems to be one of a sense of urgency, as if every moment is important.  There is really never meandering and wasted moments.  At least in his best works.  Unfortunately this movie is not one of his best works.  It is just okay. <br/><br/>The problem with the movie is that it takes a while to get off the ground and there never really seems to be a sense of urgency and real tension, not until about the last half hour that is(and that saves this movie).  The comedy is more infantile, and mostly produced by a character called Animal. However, Animal comes off as more annoying than funny, and is over the top. A poor directional choice from the usually outstanding Wilder.  It seems that the movie tried to take itself seriously, without ever really doing it. <br/><br/>William Holden gives a fine performance, and was really the only character that came off as interesting.  However, he was in another POW movie called 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'.  All though the latter isn't a movie that makes the greatest philosophical statement, it is much more entertaining throughout than this movie is.  <br/><br/>In all fairness, this is a fairly well directed movie, and if it was directed by John Hughes or Chris Columbus then it might be considered a greater achievement.  As it stands, Wilder did work that was much better than this, so the expectations are high, and it didn't meet them.  Still, the last half hour saves what would have otherwise been a wasted experience. 7 out of 10."
