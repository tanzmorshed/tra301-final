","I'm sick of all the bad reviews for this movie. I really don't give a damn if it's true to the Iliad or not. The movie is extremely entertaining. I really like the fact that the gods are downplayed in this movie. It makes the story a lot more realistic. The acting was good. The story was good. The dialogue was good. The action scenes were good. I really can't see what's not to like in this movie. I guess I could pick it apart and find flaws, but I could do that with every movie ever made. For those upset by the fact that there was no definite good side or bad side, I have some shattering news. In war, there is never a good side or bad side. War is all subjective depending on whose side you are on. Every side thinks they are the good guys. A lot of people were upset about Paris, who is cast as a coward, becoming heroic in the end. Like it or not, we all have cowardliness and heroism within us. We just don't like to admit it. So, ignore the critics and watch this movie. Remember, critics have an opinion just like everyone else and as the old saying goes, opinions are like a**holes. Everyone has one and a lot of them stink. You don't have to agree with me, but don't let someone else make up your mind for you either."
"MR_Heraclius","8","61","67","22 February 2020"," One of my favorite movies
","I love this movie, by far my favorite R rated movie and in the running for one of the greatest and most epic in my opinion. The acting, the world-building, the character depth, and the thrill of such an incredible depiction of the time period. I didn't think it was possible to make an accounting of the Trojan war void of the supernatural presence of the Greek Gods that rivals the old story in excellence, but this movie does."
"Wuchakk","10","44","51","11 March 2014"," ""Where does it end?"" -- ""It never ends.""
","If Homer's mythical epic ""The Iliad"" is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 epic ""Troy."" In other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like Athena popping out of thin air because ""Troy"" is a realistic portrayal of the Trojan war.<br/><br/>More than that, ""Troy"" is arguably the best sword & sandal epic ever put to film. You name the picture -- ""Samson and Delilah,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Ulysses,"" ""The Viking Queen,"" ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Braveheart,"" ""Attila,"" ""The Odyssey,"" ""Gladiator,"" etc. -- ""Troy"" is superior. At the very least it's as good as some of the better flicks just noted, like ""Ben-Hur,"" and far edges out ""Spartacus"" and ""Samson and Delilah."" As for more recent sword & sandal epics, like the overrated ""Braveheart"" or ""Gladiator,"" ""Troy"" blows 'em out of the water.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of ""Troy"" is all wrong. Ebert's major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons I have such high respect for this film: He complains that Petersen omitted the many Greek 'gods' & 'goddesses' and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not larger-than-life caricatures. This can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film ""Ulysses,"" but this is not what Petersen was shooting for in ""Troy."" His goal, as already noted, was to depict the actual Trojan War on which Homer's myth is based. (Even if it never really took place, wars LIKE IT did).<br/><br/>Regarding Brad Pitt's heavily criticized performance as Achilles, I couldn't care less about Pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying Greece's greatest warrior. No, he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. Eric Bana (from ""Hulk"") is also great as Hector, Achilles' Trojan counterpart, who's sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family. These two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest mano-a-mano sword & sandal duel ever filmed.<br/><br/>What's interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other. When Achilles and Hector have their powerful face-off, my wife and I couldn't decide for whom to root. Maybe that's the point. Don't get me wrong, Agamemnon could be viewed as the villain in this picture, and I wasn't rooting for Menelaus when he fights Paris (Orlando Bloom, who seduces Helen, Menelaus' wife), but neither the Greeks nor the Trojans are painted as the 'good guys' or 'bad guys.' They're just people at war, and in war there's no real glory, as Hector points out... and it never ends, as Achilles states. An additional point is that living in a state of war is a JOYLESS existence. And both Bana and Pitt get this across well.<br/><br/>As for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionable: Diane Kruger plays Helen, ""the face that launched a thousand ships."" Some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but I disagree. I'm not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me (not to mention has an impressive behind shot). Besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. If Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.<br/><br/>I should point out that ""Troy"" was one of the most expensive pictures ever made at the time and it definitely SHOWS on the screen. Make no mistake, ""Troy"" is breath-taking just to WATCH -- the colossal armies, ships and battles are awe-inspiring to behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations. And the CGI effects are outstanding for the time, not fake-looking like the Rome & Coliseum scenes in ""Gladiator.""<br/><br/>Another complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout, including Achilles' comment that the 'gods' envy people because we're mortal and ""Everything's beautiful because we're doomed."" Thankfully, there's not one goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.<br/><br/>James Horner's score should also be mentioned. If you enjoyed the soundtrack of ""The Passion of the Christ"" you'll love this one because it's just as good/serious/reverent/powerful. For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hector's showdown is magnificent.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon during shooting. Fitting, no?<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: If you're in the mood for a sword & sandal epic, ""Troy"" more than fills the bill. The story captivates from the get-to and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour runtime (technically 2 hours, 42 minutes, with credits). It extravagantly visualizes the Trojan War for you, something I never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.<br/><br/>GRADE: A+"
"amigdala06","10","19","21","1 January 2014"," Best fight scene
","The sequence between Hector and Achilles is the best choreographed fight scene amongst epic fight movies. Cons for Jaime Abregana Jr. <br/><br/>The harmony of the deathliest attacks of the heroes, usage of the camera plans with minimum keeps the sequence to watch in breathless. <br/><br/>Until the warning of the shocking rise of the back music with the first death injury of Hector, you completely forget to inhale. If you don't care the out of the plan insertions of the castle balcony people (King/father, wife, Helene etc) the whole fight sequence is planned and played very well.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good enough with a special note for Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox. Their lines are well delivered and their characters are believable."
"nickmesafilms","8","48","60","26 April 2012"," Troy (2004) - Long Live, Achilles!
","Loosely based on Homer's 'Iliad', Wolfgang Petersen directs this epic war film, with an ensemble cast including Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Rose Byrne, Garrett Hedlund, Peter O' Toole, Brendan Gleeson, & Tyler Mane. Set in 1193 B.C., this movie tells the story of a war between the two cities of Troy and Sparta, and the story of one of the bravest warriors to roam ancient Greece named Achilles. Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of his career as Achilles, giving the right amount of power and strength. Eric Bana is also terrific as Prince Hector, trying to negotiate peace between Troy and Sparta. Besides the supporting cast, Peter O' Toole is just perfect playing the king of Troy. The only disappointing character in this movie is Orlando Bloom as Hector's prince brother, who seems to overreact in every scene he is in, as if trying to end the project early, and walk away with his paycheck. Although the movie contains a running time of 162 minutes, director Wolfgang Petersen perfectly makes the audience forget about those 162 minutes, because they'll be distracted by all the incredible action. This movie contains some of the most elaborate action sequences that I've ever seen on film. The costumes and the art direction all stay true to the ancient Greece setting, and they all create a realistic feel to the movie. This movie is perfectly well-made, from the distinguished art, to the intense battle sequences. Yes, the movie is somewhat inaccurate to Homer's Iliad, but at least this movie is flat out entertaining. I haven't seen that much gladiator movies in my time, but I can safely say that ""Troy"" is one of the most remarkable and action-packed motion pictures that audiences will never forget. ""Troy"", in my review, ""action-packed, beautifully well-made""."
"MickeyTheConstant","10","7","7","13 January 2020"," Still love this movie
","Watched this movie last night. Had not seen it for years. Loved it then and loved it now. Yes, the acting is a bit naff but seriously what a movie. It really is a historical war movie rather tran an action flick. The battle and fights scenes are superb, some of the best you will see. The costumes, set design and CGI are excellent. Everything is bathed in glorious sunshine, I don't know how anyone can really knock it. It also does challenge you on who to support. The Greeks kind of go looking for war but at the same time it was the wimp Paris who ran off with Helen. The Trojan's don't want to fight but at the same time Paris did instigate it. Hector is the most noble but then stupidly steps into his brothers duel to save him, ending the one chance of peace Troy has. As for Achilles, well he is super cool and moody. Don't bother taking sides, just enjoy the sun."
"BBBrown","9","83","118","16 May 2004"," So it's not(!) the Iliad...
","But it's an inspiring tale of men(!) at war in ancient times.  The movie, albeit long, moves along a good pace, with mercifully brief romantic and philosophical breaks between the combat scenes.  This movie is action, with more than a little thought put into accurately presenting the realities of the tactics used in Greek warfare.  Troy is also to be congratulated for not over-armoring the cast like previous Hollywood productions and staying true to the lightness of armor prevalent during the historical period.<br/><br/>Lovers of Homer and Greek mythology may be disappointed but keep in mind this film is about the Trojan War, not the Iliad.  This war is epic in scale and isn't about poetry.<br/><br/>Still, it would be great if Sean Bean were given the opportunity to play Odysseus again.  Although not on screen much in Troy, his performance is edgy and true to the legends of the cunning king of Ithaca."
"Paok-Kilkis","10","9","10","14 January 2020"," Great Underrated Epic
","Wolfgang Petersen's Troy is one of my favorite war dramas ever. Althoughthe movie has lack of dialogueit delivers some of the best action sequences in cinema's history. If you love the battles in Lord of the Rings trilogy you would love this as well. The score is amazing. The cast includes great actors like Eric Bana, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Diane Kruger, Orlando Bloom, Garrett Hedlund, Sean Bean, Julie Christie, Vincent Regan, Rose Byrne and of course Brad Pitt who steals the show as usual. He portrayes the Greek demigod Achilles son of Peleus and Thetis. He considered as the greatest warrior ever lived. He wants to be remembered for that, that's why he decides to join his fellow Greeks to Troy. The thing that I like most in this movie is that it dosen't choose sides. There is no good and evil like most of the movies. Every character has his own motive in this war. Unfortunately it is not considered as great as Gladiator, Breveheartor Lawrence of Arabia but I find it highly underrated. It's one of the first movies I have ever seen and it holds a very special place in my heart for that. Highly underrated movie."

","Recent Hollywood epics are usually not as good as older versions. This film is an exception. Unusually good for the era of comic book superheroes.<br/><br/>All the cast is superb. Main, secondary and even large scenes were very good. A prime king Priam, an excellent Hector... Historical details seem correct at first sight. Looks like homework was done, this time. KUDOS for the whole team! This is important. As in so many things in life, details make the difference.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Brad Pitt, because he's a good movie barometer.

","Well well,.................. expected the worse because of hype, but i was gladly surprised .

If any thing else Troy will go down as having one of the most impressive fight scenes of any film in history. The fight between Hector and Achilles is reason enough to watch Troy alone..."

","The Good: Peter O'Toole Sean Bean Eric Bana Rose Byrne Brian Cox Fight Sequences<br/><br/>The Bad: Some of the dialogue THE MUSIC! (So disappointing considering how good the music in the trailer is)<br/><br/>There have been a lot of reviews making very sweeping statements about this movie. Especially regarding the casting of Brad Pitt and the acting of Orlando Bloom. To be honest, the above is nothing to worry about, both do a more than adequate job. One review on here said the movie would have been spectacular if it was on mute. I didn't know what he/she meant, but I can laugh about it now. (they're right) As the only downsides to this movie is the music and some of the dialogue. Other than that it great entertainment. O'Toole was awesome (like there ever was a doubt) every scene Sean Bean was in boosted the credability of the film. I felt sorry for Eric Bana's character Hector which means he did his job well. Rose Byrne and Brian Cox were the two surprise packets, delivering powerful and believable performances. All of which adds to the theory that if you want a great epic: You can't leave all the acting to the Americans! one needs some Brits or Aussies.(like in.. Gladiator, Braveheart, Lord of the Rings and now Troy.)<br/><br/>Don't worry about all the hype, this is a great and inexpensive way to spend an entertaining 3 hours. The scenery and fight sequences are awesome, it's almost worth paying to see how Brad Pitt moves with some of his weapons (shield especially).<br/><br/>7/10"
"sdillon-1","6","118","194","2 June 2004"," An infuriatingly mixed bag
","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>Wolfgang Peterson's Troy is an infuriatingly mixed bag  by no means the disaster most critics say but not the masterpiece it could have been.<br/><br/>Based (somewhat loosely) on Homer's The Illiad, Troy tells of the ten year siege of Troy caused by Prince Paris illicit romance with Helen of Sparta  the face that launched a thousand ships.  And those thousand ships, battles, and numerous special effects certainly please the eye.  But huge battles do not a great film make.  Fortunately, the Illiad is such a superb story it's virtually impossible to mess it up completely.  <br/><br/>Most of the cast acquit themselves well, despite mispronouncing certain names.  Brad Pitt makes a fine Achilles, Brian Cox a suitably scheming King Agamemnon, and Orlando Bloom an appropriately cowardly Paris.  However, all are totally outclassed by Peter O'Toole's King Priam, an outstanding performance.  In fact, it made me wish David Lean had directed The Illiad in the 1960's and cast O'Toole as Achilles.  The only actor who even comes close to his brilliance is Eric Bana, who strikes a suitably tragic note as Hector.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Diane Kruger does not convince as Helen, and I am forced to agree with Empire magazine  her face might launch a rubber dingy or two, but not a thousand ships.<br/><br/>Also, James Horner's music score is rather pedestrian which is hardly surprisingly considering he had very little time to write it.  Apparently some brainless studio executive thought it was a good idea to replace Gabriel Yared's reportedly marvellous original score because it wasn't `thumping enough'.  <br/><br/>Why on earth anyone thought it a good idea to eliminate the supernatural elements of the tale I will never know.  Integral to The Illiad are the gods and their petty squabbling, and Achilles, whose identity as a son of the gods is never explained.  Those with no previous knowledge of Greek mythology will be wondering why on earth an arrow in the heel kills him.<br/><br/>Overlong, overblown, and ultimately taking itself way too seriously, the film is worth watching for a single brilliant scene where Peter O'Toole begs Brad Pitt for the body of his dead son.  In that moment the film ascends, temporarily, to the level of the great Greek tragedy."
"urbanlegend23","8","389","680","11 May 2005"," ""Troy"" is a thrilling ride, one of the year's best and most underrated action movies.
","""Troy"" (2004) Dir. Wolfgang Petersen I, like so many others, was expecting A LOT out of ""Troy"" when I headed along to opening night and sat in the dark cinema, watching the action unfold. Initially, I didn't think as much of the movie as I now do. I gave it a 7/10 on first viewing, but I knew I had to see it again, it is just one of those films that demands multiple viewings.<br/><br/>So I saw it again for History class (since it's not historically accurate, perhaps that wasn't the best idea). And I bought the DVD.<br/><br/>And look what happened.<br/><br/>I strongly suggest to anyone who was looking forward to ""Troy"" in cinemas to rent or buy the DVD and give it another chance in your home. It is truly a much richer, perhaps even exciting experience, as your expectations have been lowered, and often this makes a movie-watching experience better.<br/><br/>Anyone who is not tired of the two-huge-armies-face-off battles we've been seeing in ""The Lord of the Rings"" films and now many other films following in that trilogy's footsteps will sure love the battles in ""Troy"". ""Troy"" takes it's battle sequences very seriously and while they have an epic grandeur look about them, at the heart of the battle - men are dying, men are killing other men. It's not all about kicking ass in this film. The battle sequences are a little more graphic than you might expect, and they are certainly brutal.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, looking absolutely incredible here (the months of training sure paid off), shoulders the movie with much confidence and adds layers to his arrogant, self-centred Achilles. It's refreshing that Pitt, though technically the central hero of the piece, plays the character in a less likable way than you might expect. Achilles is unpredictable and dangerous, he was ""born to end lives"". As the greatest warrior in history, he is most definitely convincing.<br/><br/>Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom play more emotional heroes, and while Bana manages to give Hector an awesome kick-ass edge, strong nobility and adds many dimensions to his heroic part, Bloom doesn't quite handle the job as well. I do not dismiss Bloom's part in the film to be the ""pussy"" as so many have put it, but in emotional scenes, Bloom simply falls flat. His lines (""I'll hunt deer and rabbit, we can live off the land!"") are often laughable due to bad delivery. It is more likely Bloom was put in this part for his looks rather than his talent, which is still in question by yours truly. I did like, though, that Bloom had a more realistic touch, the scene in which he faces Menelaus and fails to defeat him, running back to his brother, is nerve-wracking and powerful, not all men were great butt-kicking heroes, even back then, so it's good to see that put into the film, even if he does play the more ""pussy"" role.<br/><br/>One of my main complaints about the film the first time around was the unnecessary relationship between Briseis and Achilles. With more viewings, I have come to appreciate this subplot a lot more. As Achilles puts it, she gave him peace in a time of violence and war. Achilles is a character so often covered in other men's blood, constantly killing and fighting, that Briseis allows for Pitt to show the more sensitive side is actually useful to the character's development. Their final scene together is very emotional and the actors have genuine chemistry.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen was criticised for being too much of a claustrophobic director to take on one of the biggest films ever made, but he handles the epic, large scale of the film nicely, if perhaps maybe not using as many swooping, stunning shots as he could. I certainly would've liked to have seen more of the set of Troy exposed. In the inevitable fire-fuelled finale it is showcased brilliantly, but more of these kinds of sequences would've been useful for Petersen to shut his critics up. He does a good job with the film, rooting the battles in genuine emotion and intelligence, and giving it a distinctive, memorable atmosphere and artistic look.<br/><br/>Perhaps as a historical piece, ""Troy"" isn't the film you're looking for. But for sheer entertainment value, it is one of the best films of 2004. Again, I urge anyone who was disappointed by the film to rent/buy it on DVD and give it another spin, it's not a decision you'll regret, I know I didn't.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Brad Pitt portraying Achilles,was absolutely spot on to me.I never had much regard for Achilles in Greek Mythology,until I seen this movie.I am a fan of all Brad Pitt's films,but this one really made me think,""man he can do it all"".He is what I inspire to be in the movie world,and that is a lifelike character in any role he takes.I never see him as an actor,I see him as that character,what ever it may be,he brings it to life,is real,and doesn't seem to just be a pretty face reading lines.For all the haters of him,I will say this,name actors that feel ""real"" in their role,such as Samuel L. Jackson,John Travolta,Denzel Washington,and you will quickly find that Pitt fits the same mold.Some people are meant to act,and do it with no problem,and that is how Pitt feels as Achilles in this film.<br/><br/>Now Don't get me wrong though,this movie is more than just about Pitt as Achilles,there is great acting throughout,great cinematography,and the story is raw and as close to the myth as possible,without leaving out the hardcore,raw,fighting that would almost surely be present in those times.Great Film and I promise after seeing Pitt as Achilles,you will have a new image of the Great Achilles!

"rainman-33","10","346","612","19 May 2004"," Good film for war/history fans, flawed, but worth every penny
","Troy is an excellent movie. For any war/history buff there is enough here to feed upon to overlook any flaws.<br/><br/>First, in response to all the Gladiator lovers who said on the boards that there is no one to cheer for in Troy, I say they are idiots. Gladiator was about a single protagonist. Homer's Iliad was always a complicated, ensemble story. The audience has to deal with a lot of main characters and THIS IS A GOOD THING. Its the Iliad, not Batman.<br/><br/>There was a complaint about the film not having a good side to relate to. This one irritates me. Real life seldom has the simplistic good guy vs. bad guy dichotomy. This in my mind makes Troy that much more believable. When events unfold I actually believed they could happen. Japanese cinema is so good at times precisely because we don't know who the good guy is. The question is simply irrelevant.<br/><br/>The script was written with a mind to keep the important details of the original story intact but to make it as realistic as possible. The gods are there but only in spirit. They don't get directly involved in the action like the original. I think this is a good thing as well. Troy looks like historical recreation rather than a literal translation of the poem. In one scene I thought there was an unlikely event and researched only to find it actually is in the Iliad. When the writer was asking for too much, he was in fact being true to the text. My bad.<br/><br/>OK, visually this film is amazing. Not just the army special effects but the sets and scenery are all beautiful. The costuming is first rate and feels very authentic. Remember, we are going back 3200 years. Quite an accomplishment.<br/><br/>The violence is likewise beautiful. Blood and guts galore, but interestingly it is both on the battlefield AND in single combat. A fight fan will appreciate the attention to detail in the combatants' moves. I had never seen a shield wielded so realistically on film. Spear and sword are given very realistic treatments as well.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is a good actor. No question about that. Here he has a few moments where he seems out of place, a pretty boy in a soldier's world. But the combat scenes with him are more than enough to make up for that. It has already been discussed how much bigger he is than in Fight Club. The womens will have plenty to look at. His character is complicated and this is also true to the Iliad. Brad Pitt does this internal conflict lots of justice. His actions in the film really seem appropriate. I never asked, like I do in other films, ""Why did he do that?"" But this is not Brad Pitt's film. It's Eric Bana's.<br/><br/>Eric Bana was amazing. If Achilles was complex, then Bana's Hector is even more so. I had only seen Bana in Black Hawk Down and The Hulk and while BHD was good, there wasn't much for his character to do but be a soldier. The Hulk was so bad I wrote him off completely, blaming his acting for not saving a horrible script. But here in Troy I have new-found respect. He is the main character in the film if you judge by acting power. Lots of emotional struggling going on here that Bana takes on like a pro. He will join this generation's acting elite if he finds more roles like this.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good enough with a special note for Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox. Their lines are well delivered and their characters are believable.<br/><br/>The writing is good as far as plot development goes but I would take a few points away for some of the modern vocabulary. ""Stop playing with me,"" the pretty Helen tells Paris. ""Playing"" should have been ""joking"" in that scene since I associate playing with modern English and even worse, with modern hip hop English. I shouldn't be getting that feeling in an ancient epic.<br/><br/>

"Cube_TX","7","523","939","8 September 2004"," Proof that critics should be ignored
","I finally got to see this movie in the bargain theaters here in El Paso on Labor Day. I originally hadn't thought much about the movie, but as time went on it had left the regular theaters here in town and I realized that I'd wished I'd gone to see it. I remember hearing several outside critics blasting the movie as horrible and wanted to judge for myself. I'm very glad I finally saw this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is not the usual Clash of the Titans/Jason and the Argonauts type of movie where the gods are constantly shown and portrayed as more important and powerful than the lowly humans. In fact, this movie completely ignores the so-called gods and instead places the focus where it belongs -- on the warriors themselves. I have studied the Iliad as well as other stories surrounding the mythical Trojan War since my days as an elementary school geek obsessed with mythology and Dungeons & Dragons. Instead of being targeted toward that audience this film demystifies the Trojan War and treats it in a manner in which it could have actually happened. We see that the elders who continually refer to their so-called gods come across as fools. One of the most telling lines is when Hector (Eric Bana) refers to the fact that Apollo did not strike down Achilles (Brad Pitt) for desecrating the statue. It is very telling that Hector seems to doubt the gods he has been taught to worship.<br/><br/>I have been a longtime critic of Brad Pitt as a second-tier talent who became famous only because of his looks, but in this film he surprised me. He is the TRUE star of the film. Achilles is easily the most interesting and entertaining character. I applaud Brad Pitt's effort in making his character a tragic hero. Achilles acknowledges that he is NOT the son of a goddess and is not immortal or invulnerable. The movie basically shows us how a rumor can blossom into a legend unto itself. Achilles' legend BECOMES immortal. He even refers to this in my favorite scene when he is inspiring his men and starts the invasion heavily outnumbered and still triumphs. Later in the same scene he scoffs at the so-called gods the Greeks and Trojans worship by decapitating the statue. I found this scene symbolic of the movie itself. The gods are nothing to both the characters and audience.<br/><br/>Instead of supernatural powers and impossible feats we're treated to realism. Even Achilles' death is more realistic than in the myth. In the myth Paris does kill Achilles with an arrow, but because he has no battle skills his hand is actually guided by Apollo.<br/><br/>If there was one thing I did not like in this film it was the transformation of Paris into some kind of hero. Paris was a coward in the original myth and I saw no reason to transform him into an overnight hero in the movie. I guess Orlando Bloom fans wouldn't be able to bear seeing him as the bad guy and were given the uninspired transformation of Paris into a better archer than Robin Hood.<br/><br/>While this movie was nowhere near the epic masterpiece that the producers had hoped or that it was advertised as, it did not deserve the bad publicity it received from critics. I applaud the makers of this film and look forward to buying it on DVD."

","Troy could have been a great epic film... if wouldn't have been for some really disrespectful and unnecessary alterations that they did to the immortal story, the great Iliad written by Homer, and considered a masterpiece of literature through thousands and thousands of years... but this guys here just modified it like if all this wouldn't matter...<br/><br/>Note: Spoilers coming!<br/><br/>Yeah! I am talking about Menelaus killed cowardly by Hector, or Agamemnon killed by Briseis, or Achilles being the cousin of Patroclus, or Hector killing one of the Ayaces, and where is the other Ajax, Diodemes, and all the other Heroes??? If it would not have been for these alterations to the original story, which really disturbed be (if you ever read the Iliad, you'll understand me)and which i really regard as unnecessary, and the usual Hollywood crap added to most American films (a good dose of machismo, exaggeration, historical inaccuracy, etc) This could have been a great film but unfortunately it is not...<br/><br/>But this movie is also far away from being a terrible film. The director and the actors did a nice job, Brad Pitt acts very good as usual, The guy that plays Hector does it in an amazing way too, taking most of the sympathy of the public. The movie is exciting and the battles are good, my favorite scene is before Achilles fights Hector, and he repeats the same line that in Homer's book ""There are no pacts between men and lions""!! Another thing that I quiet liked and that was different that the book, is that in the film the GODS don't have much to do with the story, while in the Iliad they are central... but that's not too bad, I didn't miss Zeus or Apollo in the film, and I think this is a smart move for the film, because including the Gods would have been quiet difficult for a film like this.<br/><br/>What i missed was the respect for some important aspects of the story, which i mentioned before, and which were removed unscrupulously ... It could have been and immortal epic, but those omissions and alterations are unforgivable, and bring my given note from 10/10 to 7/10"

","Now I'm fully aware that most film adaptations cannot relay all the themes and as a result, never truly live up to the book. However this one is something else!!! Best I can describe Troy is that it's a bastardised version of the Iliad. It's puzzling why they even tried to squeeze the epic into a feature length film in the first place. Hopefully we'll see the Iliad made into a great series one day, as all films and mini-series thus far have been major disappointments.<br/><br/>However the film does have some redeeming features despite it's many floors. But for starters (I do apologise) I'm going to rant about the things I really hate about this film first just to vent my disappointment!!! I don't want to spoil the plot for you if you haven't yet seen the film so instead I'm going to mention some of the great things that never made it in from the Iliad.<br/><br/>***this section contains some plot clues and spoilers*** <br/><br/>First off, Menelaus! The character is completely different from Homer's original epic, to the point which makes me want to cry... for those who have read the Iliad, one of the greatest moments for me was when Menelaus fights like a lion standing guard other Patroclus' lifeless body. And other moments when he's shown to be honourable, like during the duel with Paris and saying he would rather leave Helen than risk the lives of so many of the Argives.<br/><br/>Also Telamonian Ajax, his character butchered with poor casting and a premature death at the hands of hector. What about when he rescues Achilles' body from the Trojans!!! <br/><br/>Another potentially great role hampered by poor scripting and bad casting was Nestor (which should have been Anthony Hopkins) and Diomedes and his 'Aristeia' that never made it. Not to mention Achilles never lived to see the wooden horse built let alone use it to infiltrate Troy/Ilium. Don't get me started on Orlando Bloom!!!<br/><br/>Yet despite all this Troy has its moments and some good performances and cast choice. Pitt as Achilles was the good obvious choice as with Bana as Hector. The rest of the cast did the job... The Myrmidon beach landing was quite entertaining and their armour was stylist if a little too fantasy inspired for my tastes.<br/><br/>I didn't really want to put people off as the film was reasonably entertaining. Just felt like I needed a rant, being a bit of a purist having loved studying Homer's Epics and other Greek tragedies."

"Gilliam123","7","15","22","14 April 2012"," Troy
","This is a review of the film Troy, which was released in 2004. It is directed by Wolfgang Petterson and written by David Benioff, and based on the Iliad by Homer. King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is ruler of Mycenea, but wishes to rule an empire, so his army slowly conquers the rest of what is now Greece. The only threat to his empire is a neighbouring country called Troy. Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) is tired of war, so he negotiate's peace with the Trojan princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom). Upon leaving, Paris reveals to Hector that he has taken Menelaus's wife, Helen (Diane Kruger) with him, as he loves her. Menelaus goes to Agamemnom to start a war, and Agamemnom manages to convince legendary warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) to fight among the Greek army. Hector and Paris arrive in Troy, and tell their father Priam (Peter O'Toole) of the upcoming war. Agamemnom arrives on the beaches of Troy with 1,000 ships, but after day 1, Achilles refuses to fight, and instead cares to Trojan prisoner Briseis (Rose Byrne). Over the next two battles Hector kills Menelaus, Ajax (who is the Greek's best warrior after Achilles), and Achilles's cousin, Patroclus, and finally Achilles decides to don his armour and face Hector in a duel to the death. Achilles wins and kills Hector but makes a pact with Priam to allow the Trojans 12 days of peace. After 12 days, Priam and his men ride out to find the Trojan horse, and all the Greeks gone. Priam orders the horse to be brought into the city of Troy. That night, Odysseus (Sean Bean) and his men escape form the horse, and open the gates and allow Agamemnon and all of his thousands of men in. Achilles also escapes from the horse, and goes to find Briseis. in the confusion, Priam is killed by Agamemnon, who is in turn killed by Briseis, and as Achilles escapes for a new life with her, Paris shoots him through the ankle and he dies. While all three of leads have both good points and flaws, it is Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie in small supporting roles that, as per usual, put in the best performances. Brian Cox seems to ham it up to much, but Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean do well enough with the bland characters they are given. The fight scenes are great, although some of the close combat tactics used by Achilles are all but impossible. The more rough style used by Hector of Ajax feels more realistic, but the duel between Hector and Achilles is the best scene of the film."

","To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make. But what can I tell you? Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star. It crosses that barrier. It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory. Brando had it in spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course and in more recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt has, singlehandedly, redefined the concept. He is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get into a theatre to see ""Troy"" If you liked epics in the ""Jupiter's Darling"" style you may enjoy this. But if you don't, go all the same, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business."

""Kalifornia"" ""12 Monkeys"" ""Fight Club"" ""Snatch"" His self deprecating humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately ""Troy"" will soon be forgotten. Only still photographs with Pitt, semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans.

"kate1148","1","264","526","9 January 2005"," A travesty of a great classical story
","My disclaimer for this is that I am a graduate student of Literature; but I like a good action movie as much as anyone else. I was totally excited about this movie: great cast, great director, a timeless epic story; all the right components right? WRONG! Certain tales are *timeless* and should not be changed too much. I was all right with the screenwriters taking out the role of the gods in this story, I was moderately all right with them cutting out the women in this tale (overplaying Helen who never speaks in the Illiad, and cutting out Hecuba--Priam's wife and Queen of Troy--completely, cutting out Cassandra), and I eventually came to terms with the fact that the Trojan Horse was in this version (the Trojan Horse was not in the Illiad, it was written about in the Aenied which was written a few hundred years later by Virgil and NOT Homer), and even that the Trojan war took place over the course of a few days instead of years but there are LOTS of things that suck about this movie.<br/><br/>Who was that girl who Achilles ran into the burning city to get? Who is she based on? For a second I thought she would be Cassandra mixed with some other people but then no. And I am completely SHOCKED AND AMAZED that the director took such artistic license as to kill Agamemnon in Troy. That is such a desecration of literature that I cannot believe that he thought he would get away with it. Does Petersen think that he is above yielding to the true nature of the story? That was it for me, I turned it off then, I don't care how the movie ends now.<br/><br/>For all of these reasons I hate this movie, what could have been a brilliant combination of action mixed with art Petersen missed completely; because he changed the story *SO* much this is a sad and lame excuse for both an action movie and a cinematic version of Homer's tales. Petersen missed both marks by a LOT. I don't know who I'm more upset with; the screenwriter who produced this crap or the director for making it viable. All of these things have been written and recorded and translated into every language for over a thousand years, certainly the screenwriter could have picked up some Cliff notes for a reference.<br/><br/>*For those who are interested: Agamemnon did not die in Troy. He went home with Cassandra as his concubine and was killed by his wife Clytemenstra because--before sailing for Troy-- he sacrificed his daughter to appease the god of the wind for good sailing. After his murder Clytemnestra cuts him up and serves him in a stew to her children Orestes and Electra. Wouldn't that have been a better end for a great villain?"
"Monotreme02","6","148","288","27 October 2005"," Remarkable production value but very flawed
","For a movie loosely based on a poem written thousands of years ago, the director and screenwriter have done an excellent job in re-creating the epic story and the ancient world on the screen, which was probably quite a difficult task. The production is fantastic, visual effects are great, and yet my opinion on Troy is divided in two: The movie is built in such a way that we, the viewers, aren't entirely sure who are the bad guys. Brad Pitt's Achilles is displayed as the star, the hero, and yet he fights for the Greeks, who are displayed as brutal warriors under the rule of a greedy tyrant, Agamemnon. In fact, the entire Trojan War was started only because of the greed of the king of Sparta, Menelaus. Paris, the prince of Troy (son of Priam, the king) took Helen, Menelaus' wife, back to Troy with him after a peace meeting in Sparta. This enraged Menelaus and so Agamemnon, his brother, rounded up the entire Greek army to attack Troy and retrieve his wife. On the other hand, the Trojans are sort of shown as the ""good guys"". Just because of one mistake that Paris made, the Trojans now have to hold back an attack of 50,000 Greeks, while loosing thousands of husbands, sons and cousins in the process. Hector is displayed as a family man: He doesn't want to go to war, he'd rather stay home with his wife and newborn child, but he is loyal to Troy and must fight for her. This is slightly different than the way the Trojan War had always been conveyed to me: Helen did not run off with Paris, but Paris seduced her and practically kidnapped her with him back to Troy. Hector was a big, brutal warrior who had absolutely no problem with killing as many people as he possibly could. I really liked the way the movie showed the Trojans as the good guys and the Greeks as the evil, greedy tyrants. It's definitely a fresh and original approach to the story.<br/><br/>Production-wise the movie is stunning. The costumes, the sets, and the weapons everything is top-notch, with excellent attention to details. The visuals are also stunning. The shot of Brad Pitt standing on the deck of a ship with the camera slowly zooming out, eventually revealing the entire Greek navy consisting of 1,000 ships is really a treat to the eye. The computer graphics are excellent. It's really hard to tell in the huge battle scenes which soldiers are computer graphics and which are extras, although you know that some of them must be CG because there are so many. The long shots of the city of Troy are also great eye candy. In all, the one thing this movie is especially excellent at is entertaining, and it is definitely a visually satisfying movie.<br/><br/>The acting is also pretty good. Brian Cox definitely stands out as the power-hungry Agamemnon. His acting is top-notch. Peter O'Toole is also good as Priam, the king of Troy. Eric Bana was great as Hector, although I don't think he physically matches the part. Brad Pitt wasn't as bad as I was worried he would be. In fact, his acting was quite good. Which brings me to my second opinion: While Brad Pitt's acting was quite good, I just don't think he fits the character of Achilles. It seems as if Brad Pitt wasn't entirely comfortable with Achilles' character, so he took it and dressed it over his own personality, which changed the character a bit. Physically, though, he looks perfect for the part. Eric Bana, on the other hand, is just the opposite. He truly captured the essence of the Hector character, and his acting is great, but I don't think that he physically matches the part. He's just kind of small and scrawny, while Hector is supposed to be taller and more muscular than Achilles, which is not how it seemed in the movie. It also seemed that his character was a bit too weak. He's supposed to be the greatest fighter on Earth, matched only by Achilles, and yet he struggled a bit just to kill Achilles' cousin, who had never even been in a battle before. When you look at how easily Achilles killed the giant soldier in the very beginning of the movie, it kind of makes Hector look far weaker than he's supposed to be. Also, while Agamemnon was supposed to be power-hungry and greedy, he was not hasty, and was considered to be one of the wisest kings. And yet, in the movie he makes very hasty and stupid decisions, which kind of lower his character to a stupid power-hungry oaf, while he was really quite smart. One character that I'm really happy about is Odysseus, played by Sean Bean. His character's essence was truly and perfectly captured: He's cunning, a good warrior and extremely smart. He constantly gives Achilles advice on how to approach Agamemnon, and is conveyed perfectly as Achilles' close friend. Odysseus also suggests various war strategies to Agamemnon, who is reluctant to listen. Now as much as I dislike Orlando Bloom, he actually pulls off the Paris character quite well, and fits the part of the weak, cowardly, naive pretty-boy prince perfectly.<br/><br/>All in all, Troy is definitely an entertaining movie, and the production is remarkable, but a few major historical inaccuracies, strange casting choices and a particularly cliché Hollywood ending lower my appreciation for the film."

","Hello there,<br/><br/>This is my first post in IMDb even though I use it as a reference for quite a while. I would therefore like to salute you all. The fact that I am a Greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement I hope not to your annoyance.<br/><br/>I spent 2 years of my life, (all we Greeks did actually), analysing Omirus epos (and not Homers as you see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. If I recall well it was Iliada (Iliad) on 8th grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) on 9th grade. Warner's Troy, was a big disappointment to me and my fellow Greeks around the campus (I study in the UK).<br/><br/>Iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made. It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war. Historians put Trojan war around 1200 BC, and the actual reason of the war not being Helen's beauty but the strategically crucial position of Troy. That said one may now understand that Omirus epos is not presenting the actual events (as it's not accurate historically) but this was never the purpose of this work. <br/><br/>Reading this huge poem, one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour, love, anger, hate, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle. None of these though were revealed in 'Troy'<br/><br/>Warner's Troy was really cheap to my eyes, and to other intellectual people English Finnish and German colleagues of me as well. It is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computers graphics did the whole work), and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br/><br/>I conclude saying that you'd better watch something else instead. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It is a really expensive B movie.<br/><br/>Cheers <br/><br/>Alex"

They were cousins. Never mind what history says.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole can tell an entire story with just an expression.<br/><br/>Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names, but their statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole in drag.<br/><br/>Greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting, much like American men.<br/><br/>All of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color... Light Egyptian, by Max Factor.<br/><br/>Troy had only three women.<br/><br/>There were lots of blond Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who would otherwise have really stuck out.<br/><br/>Despite their coastal desert locale, Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires, funeral pyres, Trojan horses and the like.<br/><br/>British actors look silly with Greek hairdos.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes.<br/><br/>Greek soldiers fought constantly, but their outfits always looked impeccable.<br/><br/>Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts.<br/><br/>Apparently Greek temples were always in ruins, even back when they were all new."

",".......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL<br/><br/>More than just a movie, TROY is a species of cinematic time machine. In a most compelling and exciting way, it will transport you to a time and place far away, to the Greek islands of over three millennium ago, to be precise! For those of you with a good ""Home Theater"", this film will provide two hours of historical battles, conducted in a very realistic and impressive way, spectacular vistas of both land and sea, seamless digital effects that are difficult to distinguish from reality, and for women, a well- oiled Brad Pitt projecting a multifaceted and enigmatic Achilles, whose performance was highly underrated by critics.<br/><br/>In contrast, Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings , Pirates of the Caribbean) as Paris was somewhat indecipherable, leaving one with the question of whether the lack of character in his portrayal of Paris, was intentional or due to an under-par performance . The rest of the cast appears to be generally well chosen (with the exception of Diane Kruger in the role of Elena, who looked like a mechanical porcelain figurine) and bestows a resonance and a dimension to this historical drama rarely seen in a movie of this genre.<br/><br/>As announced in the end credits, TROY was ""inspired"" by Homer's Iliad, authored some 2,500 years ago. It's hard to understand the logic of ""purists"", who have cried ""foul!"" because Troy's plot often differs notably from Homer's original work. They complain that the movie is neither faithful to the Iliad nor to history. Well, the fact that the thousands of gods and demigods present in the book are absent from the movie is, perhaps, not necessarily a bad thing!.<br/><br/>As for historical events themselves, nobody really knows for sure what happened in Troy three thousand two hundred years ago! Practically everything is purely conjecture! So consider that TROY is a completely separate film version , with a different name , of the written work, the Iliad.<br/><br/>It is worth making a few comments on some technical aspects of the production : costume design , sets & scenery , weapons, boats and other elements of war demonstrate a work done taking his time, with enough love and an almost obsessive attention to an endless number of details , almost impossible to see and perceive well the first time you've seen the movie, but that clearly stand out during a second viewing.<br/><br/>There have been many works where the Seventh Art has spent a fortune, and the result ends up being anything but artistic! In the case of Troy, at least, it seems that the budget of $200 million has presented us with a very harmonious and aesthetic result . Even the sound, for those who are set on these things, is some of the best that has been produced so far for DVD! We must recognize the director, Wolfgang Peterson ( Das Boot, Air Force One , The Perfect Storm) which reached orchestrate an intense, clear and consistent cinematic vision of Troy .<br/><br/>A final recommendation....Despite the fact that Troy, really lacks any scenes of graphic violence, much less any sexually charged ones, because of the amoral, indecisive and unfocused tone of some of its protagonists, it would probably be a good idea to do a pre-screening with family and friends over 12, and then decide if you deem it suitable for younger people in your family!.<br/><br/>Hoping you really enjoy your two and a half hours in the city of Troy, in the second millennium before Christ ... and do not forget to pump up the volume ! <br/><br/>8*....ENJOY!// DISFRUTELA !!!<br/><br/>Any Comments, or Questions, In English or Español, are most welcome......................................................"

","The primary question about the Trojan War is do you take Homer's poetry as literal truth? For instance, did a goddess actually save Paris from being killed during his duel with Helen's husband or is the grain of truth in the episode that Paris somehow survived in a less than noble manner? Similarly, was Achilles' mother a goddess who dipped her son's body in the River Styx making him invulnerable in battle or is the grain of truth here - as some historians have suggested - that he had some of the first iron armor which could not be penetrated by the bronze weapons of his opponents.<br/><br/>As Homer did Troy focuses on the relationship between Achilles and Agamemnon and not the love story between Paris and Helen. If her face launched 1,000 ships it was because she was the pretext, not because she was the reason.<br/><br/>What Troy accomplishes is a very well done depiction of the human egos, ambitions, flaws, anger, and tragedy that lie beneath Homer's poetry. The acting is excellent, the costuming beautiful, the special effects are flawless, and the battle sequences are wonderfully choreographed. If you aren't interested in any of that then you can just relax and enjoy watching Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, and the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Hundreds of years later Troy was still remembered in Homer's time because it was a clash between two great civilizations which went to war and destroyed themselves."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","34","61","14 March 2007"," Mediocre Troy story (spoilers throughout)
","Troy is an incredibly mediocre film. It neither offends nor inspires. Instead it leaves you feeling like an opportunity's been wasted  the money is there, but the will and the talent are sadly missing.<br/><br/>Apart from the leaden script and nondescript direction, the film's main deficiency is Orlando Bloom. The man has always been a hopeless actor, but here he plumbs new depths, turning in a performance that is based entirely on puppy eyes, simpering looks and flat line delivery. The man is wholly incapable of emoting. Although, to be fair, he is lumbered with a near impossible part  the snivelling Paris. Even the most talented actor would have a hard time bringing such a wretched person to life. But seeing as Bloom is among the least talented actors in Hollywood, it makes the character all the more unbearable.<br/><br/>The most infuriating thing about Paris is the way he stumbles through the story, causing nothing but trouble, and yet he ends up killing the mighty Achilles and smelling of roses. Perhaps in more talented hands, this would have been fine, but here it makes you question why you watched the film. This pathetic loser condemns thousands of people to death (including his brother and father) so that a blonde strumpet can play with his winkie. Brilliant! <br/><br/>It's hard to pick a single scene that had me baying for Paris' blood (there are so many), but his most cowardly act comes during his fight with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). He's meant to fight to the death, ignorantly thinking that this skirmish will prevent further bloodshed. But even with his honour and the lives of his countrymen at stake, he runs away like a big baby and hides behind his brother. What a pathetic excuse for a human being. I share Menelaus' outrage when he exclaims to Helen that this is what she left him for.<br/><br/>And the scenes between Paris and Helen are nauseating. The two actors have zero chemistry and both have the screen presence of a couple of fruit flies. Do we care about their all-consuming love? Of course not. It's played like a couple of kids who have just discovered that their genitals are there for more than secreting waste material.<br/><br/>And speaking of Helen, isn't she supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world? Instead we get your average foreign starlet with too much mascara and a larger than average schnoz. Sure any man in his right mind would tap it, but start a war over her? Forget about it.<br/><br/>In fact, a lot of the guys in the film are just as pretty as Helen. Just take the numerous ass shots we get of Brad Pitt. Then you have Achilles' cousin. He's your typical blonde-haired dreamboat. And is it any wonder that the only thing that truly enrages Achilles is the death of his beloved cousin, a cousin who he frequently engages in some light-hearted sword fighting with? But even though the film fetishes the male form (as well as a zillion shots of Pitt's toned butt, we also get to see an oiled Orlando Bloom  he's completely hairless of course), it's strictly a torso and arse film  no tits or willies.<br/><br/>But while the film fails spectacularly in terms of romance, character development and inter-personal relationships, it succeeds when it comes to action. The fight between Hector and Achilles, in particular, is superb. With lots of close contact and athleticism, it thankfully resists the urge to become overly fanciful. Instead you get something that feels pure and believable.<br/><br/>Another excellent fight scene is the one between Hector and Ajax. Again things are kept simple and the sequence benefits from it. I also enjoyed the fight between Paris and Menelaus  the camera in the helmet is an excellent way of generating fear and claustrophobia  but unfortunately its somewhat spoiled by Paris' cowardly actions. As is the final sequence where Achilles is slain. Here you have a character you're finally starting to like and he's cut down by a skinny imbecile with a bad curly haircut.<br/><br/>That reminds me, what's up with the haircuts in this film? All the men seem to have these weird semi-mullets  Sean Bean, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom especially. And then you have Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson who seem to have acquired Gary Oldman's bizarre tit-head hairstyle from Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula. It's actually rather distracting  I spent a lot of time looking at people's heads; the haircuts here are worse than the ones you see on a football pitch.<br/><br/>But as bad as his haircut is, I did enjoy Brian Cox in this film. Sure he's hammier than a ham sandwich, but at least he seems to be having some fun with it. I also think that Eric Bana is pretty damn good  the film suffers badly when his character dies; Hector is the heart and soul of the movie. However, I think Pitt's performance is less successful. He's great in the action scenes, but everywhere else he seems out of place.<br/><br/>However, I like the idea of Achilles being a celebrity, a man who wants to further his own image at the expense of everything else. But as it is, this element of the story, like all the other ideas, isn't developed enough. The film aims low and scores small."

","In the overall scheme of making movies based upon classical literature, this is one of the worst attempts I've seen in my 63 years. The screenwriter and director, and ultimately the producers, took ""The Iliad"" and tossed it into the movie blender that is Big Money. Then they pressed the ""liquify"" button. It amazes me that the director of this movie directed ""Das Boot"". So, I supposed some hard examples are in order, so here's a few: (1) ""The Iliad"" has nothing whatsoever to do with the Trojan Horse; (2)Achilleus, probably one of the most complex characters in all literature, is not a hybrid between Conan The Barbarian, a Zen Buddhist and the father, on ""Married w/Children; (3)The ""Atriadae"", Meneleus and Agamemnon, had an entirely different fate than that in the movie, and without those fates, the entire sense of the story has vanished; (4)With the possible exception of O'Toole's Priam, all the characters essences were stood on their heads, and (5)The Theme(s) of the epic was utterly lost. This movie was awful. Just awful."

","Yesterday I finally bought the TROY DVD. However my disappointment was enormous. <br/><br/>The epic story of Homerus is twisted in the most extraordinary way. <br/><br/>The producers/directors whoever  most probably have not read the whole Iliada.<br/><br/>In conclusion, apart from the fact they present the Greeks been idiots and war thirsty, they skip one of the most tragic moments of the war. The Ifigenia's sacrifice to goddess Artemis in order for Greeks to sail the port of Aylida. <br/><br/>Just for the record this sacrifice is one of the best plays by Sofokles and is called Ifegenia En Aylidi (free translation Ififenia at the port of Aylida). And of course since there had been no sacrifice Agamemnon dies in Troy. <br/><br/>For your information as per Homerus, Agamemnon was killed by his wife as he was taking his bath when he returned form Troy. Famous Klytemnistra killed her husband because he did sacrifice their daughter to Artemis in order for the Greek vessels to leave Aylida. And definitely he was not killed by any Trojan girl by the name of Brhshida. <br/><br/>Another peculiar thing is that Achilles died in deed by Paris but along time ago before we, Greeks entered Troy. It was disgusting and very insulting to the epic story to see Achilles dies inside the burning Troy with several arrows on his chest and belly as Achilles was invulnerable because his father Pileas baptized him in a blessed water when he was an infant but as he was holding him upside down he did not sink his feet holding him from his ankles. That is why his only vulnerable spot was his heels. That means that only one arrow was enough to kill him at his heel. <br/><br/>This was a point that should be highlighted. It was not the fact that Achilles was a blood thirty warrior who he was just capable of being a 'Jean Claud Vandam' of ancient Greece beating any opponent. HE WAS JUST INVULNERABLE. He could not be killed. Furthermore he was killed by Paris indeed (one of the few things according to the story) but not in order to save his cousin, but after Hector's death as revenge and after Apollo revealed to Paris that Achilles has only one week spot.<br/><br/>One thing more is that according to Homerus, the war lasted ten years. It seems in the movie it lasted what???? A few weeks?<br/><br/>In addition there are many other points created out of director's mind and not according to the original.<br/><br/>I really feel that from now on, anyone who really wants to make a great movie must very very carefully read the original. However I understand that some things cannot be presented to cinema like in the original. But this is a totally different thing than twisting is that disgusting way story.<br/><br/>It is like for someone to make in 1,000 years a movie about world was 2 and describing Hitler as the good guy or even more to say that Hitler did not commit suicide but he was killed by Winston Churchill or Abraham Lincoln after they had decided to fight each other and whoever wins the other troops will surrender. Just imagine that. How stupid it is. But it is what the producers of Troy have done. <br/><br/>I would be really glad to find copies of Iliada translated in English and to send them as gifts to the production."
"TheVintageArchive","10","68","133","24 May 2004"," A Movie of Epic Proportions
","This year's starting blockbusters of the summer include TROY, but don't expect the movie to be anything like the epic poem, 'The Iliad'. Characters that die in the poem live in the movie and characters that shouldn't die in the movie live in the poem. There's a reason why this movie is called TROY and not 'The Iliad', as the movie's ending credits clearly point out that the movie was 'inspired by the Iliad', so don't watch TROY expecting it will be like 'The Iliad'.<br/><br/>TROY, directed by Wolfgang Peterson, is entertaining from start to finish, considering it contains three of the most hottest men in Hollywood: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom, all in skirts. The movie starts off in ancient Greece, where Trojan Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) have come to Sparta on a diplomatic mission to make peace with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), the Spartan king. Unbeknownst to Menelaus, Helen (Diane Kruger), his wife and Queen of Sparta, is having a passionate affair with Paris, the Prince of Troy. Their love will ignite a war that will lead to endless destruction and devastation of both countries. Thus when Paris steals Helen away, Menelaus is insulted and wages war against Troy with his brother, Agamemnon, (Brian Cox) who finds this a perfect excuse to conquer Troy. But in order to conquer Troy's vast defensive walls, Agamemnon needs the help of Achilles, (Brad Pitt) believed to be the greatest warrior alive. And thus ensues a vicious battle fought over greed, honor, destiny, but most of all, love. And for love, a nation will fall and burn to the ground, leaving history its most devastating story ever.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is perfect as Achilles. Besides his finely chiseled body, which for some reason the director felt had to be shown in almost every scene, his performance truly brought out the defiant, arrogant, rebellious, invincible warrior side of Achilles. However, Pitt's acting was wooden in a few scenes, which is hard to blame him because he is a terrific actor and it isn't his fault his lines sound so lame. The fault goes to the atrocious script that David Benioff wrote and the terrible soundtrack James Horner offers. Orlando Bloom as Paris, still needs to hone his craft; however, he played Paris convincingly enough for the audience to understand that Paris is a womanizing, pathetic excuse for a warrior. His best scene is when he loses to Menelaus and crawls back to his brother, clutching his brother's leg, imploring Hector to save him, showing the coward that Paris really is.<br/><br/>But the true star and savior of the movie is Eric Bana with his excellent portrayal of Hector, the heir and Prince of Troy. His performance was truly memorable and his screen presence was captivating; he was one of the film's few truly sympathetic characters. Bana is very convincing as this passionate father, son, husband, and warrior all wrapped into one human being. His battle scene with Pitt is perhaps the best and most riveting fight scene of all time. Bana conveyed perfectly all the expressions of love, anger, fear, hatred, pride and suffering in his eyes, while Brad just looked fierce the whole time, even in his death; the only exception was when Achilles sobs over Hector's body, which was Pitt's best scene. Helen's scenes, played by Diane Kruger, are nothing short of contrived; in fact, they're barely bearable. She looks stupid half the time and there is no chemistry between her and Bloom, but she is no doubt beautiful, but it is very hard to believe that her face is the face that launched a thousand ships. Instead, Saffron Burrows who plays Andromache gives easily the best performance out of all the female characters. The chemistry between her and Bana is very believable. <br/><br/>In the end, it all comes down to Eric Bana's brilliant deliverance and TROY's terrific CGI sequences. The choreographing for the battle scenes can be at times, tiring but it's nothing like The Matrix Reloaded's monotonous fight scenes, in fact the battle scenes in TROY were very well done, but don't expect any Oscar award winning performances, save Eric Bana's. TROY is just a nice summer blockbuster to get viewers excited about Spider-Man 2 and Harry Potter 3. It's a nice way to spend $9.50 and 3 hours in a movie theatre, plus it's a perfect excuse to watch and drool over three very good-looking men with very chiseled bodies."

","I was impressed with this version because it presented the characters as genuine people without the mystical involvement of the ancient Greek gods. <br/><br/>Most importantly, Achilles is presented as a superior warrior whose skills and talent prevent him from being defeated. There is nothing of his immortality from being dipped into the river Styx. Pitt portrays an Achilles who is human and questioning his reasons for killing and his role in life. <br/><br/>The kings are presented as people driven by greed for power. Human nature is the directing factor, not the gods.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are terrific especially the choreography of the sword fighting.<br/><br/>I rarely see a film twice in succession.

"mvarda","10","72","143","15 May 2004"," Though it deviates much from the Iliad/myth, Troy is still a very good epic movie
","Spoilers!! I'm a lover of the Iliad. Achilles has been my favorite hero since I was in primary school and was learning about our myths for the first time. I didn't expect/demand, however, from a Hollywood blockbuster to be a class on the Homeric epics. So I'll initially quote my comments on this movie judging it on its own merits and not as an adaptation of the Iliad.  Some of my friends, Iliad purists, told me ""don't go and see this Hollywood trash"". I'm glad I didn't take their advice, because ""Troy"" definitely is not trash.<br/><br/>I saw ""Troy"" yesterday, May 14, in my small city's one of the two theaters, which the audience is usually reluctant to fill, since people prefer to wait for a while and rent a DVD to see a movie in the comfort of their home. Since it was the early afternoon Friday screening (people still at work or resting home) I thought my company and I would be alone in an empty theater. I was wrong. The theater was full.<br/><br/>-------------POSSIBLE SPOILERS--------------<br/><br/>The story, though it deviates much from the myth, is still compelling and captivating. Thankfully in Benioff's version of Trojan War the violent battles don't overshadow the human drama. On the contrary, the human factor is emphasized and there is an admirable balance between action and emotion. There are many moments in the story where the culmination of the action and emotion makes the audience hold its breath, sigh, or cheer and clap (equally in support of the Greeks and the Trojans, depending on the case). It's an absorbing story.<br/><br/>The cast is overall excellent and delivers wonderful performances. Brad Pitt carries the movie on his wide shoulders. He shines with an outstanding performance. Visually he's male perfection, as ""godlike"" Achilles was, fair-haired, exceptionally beautiful, with the body of a classical ancient Greek sculpture. Pitt renders masterly all the subtle nuances of his complex character. His Achilles is convincingly fearless, powerful in the battle (and not only in the battle), violent, proud, arrogant, thirsty for eternal glory, tameless spirit unwilling to submit to any power (not even that of the gods), but he's also thoughtful and wise in his own way, with his own code of honor, brave enough to admit his mistakes, capable of feeling/offering love or admiring and praising the enemy when it's worth it, noble, generous, compassionate, and humane at the end.  Pitt's fine acting ability makes us feel with Achilles' emotions, his doubts, his grief, his anger, his regrets. Pitt's Achilles is so amazingly complex and fascinating, that you can't do anything but hate him and admire/love him at the same time. He's so solid and imposing, that when he eventually falls you think that what falls is the pillar of the Greek side.<br/><br/>Eric Bana is very good, too. He has the much easier task to portray Hector, a one-dimensional character that can be portrayed comparatively more easily than Achilles. Bana's Hector is a noble, brave prince, a lovely family man. There is nothing negative in this character (unlike the Homeric Hector who has some serious flaws). He is the Trojan equivalent of Achilles, an equally powerful and admirable man for Achilles to fight with. When they duel, you wish they could win both of them. But tie isn't an admissible result in such a duel. And when finally Hector falls, you think that what falls is the pillar of the Trojan side. Orlando Bloom is decently good as coward Paris. He makes us not really hate him (because in the movie -unlike in the Iliad- he has the ""noble motive of true love"" that purifies him in a way in our eyes and justifies his actions) but rather feel pity for the coward, weak, small fry he is. Peter O' Toole is great as always. And all the other actors do a very good job with their supporting roles. Brian Cox is outstanding as villainous Agamemnon. He's so convincing, that all at once I heard my friend next me whisper ""Oh! The mother f*cker!"" (though he knows that Homeric Agamemnon wasn't a villain). The weakest performances come from Diane Kruger and Garrett Hedlund. Kruger is a very beautiful woman, indeed, but she recites her lines quite unconvincingly. As for Hedlund, I just wish they had selected someone else in his place (poor Patroclus!)<br/><br/>The film has a decent pace. But as a viewer who is familiar with the Iliad, where sometimes a single event of the movie is described extensively in more than 800 verses in more than one rhapsodies, I caught myself wanting some scenes to last more and when they came to an end I was wondering: ""That was it? Is it already over?"" Of course I know it would be impossible for the script to present more extensively some events, because something like that it would increase prohibitively the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>The costumes and set are impressive and represent convincingly and realistic (to the best of one's ability) the ancient world of that era, subsidizing the film's ambience. The score is absolutely functional at times, making the viewer shudder, but in some other scenes one feels that it should be a little more intense and  ""epical"". Petersen directs with steady hand and his direction sometimes takes off and become exciting, but not throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion Troy is a very good, absorbing, entertaining movie with top-notch performances and a compelling story, and with the help of a little more inspired direction it could be a masterpiece.  Despite the almost three hours I spent in the theater's uncomfortable sit, when it finished I found out that I just wanted to last more.  And I'm going to see it for the second time tomorrow, because I have to wait too long until it's released on DVD, so that I can enjoy it again.<br/><br/>That's all I would say about the movie if I had never read the Iliad, that masterpiece of the world literature. But since I have read it I can't do anything but criticize some points of Benioff's ""adaptation"", some deviations of the myth that really hurt. Unlike some Iliad purists, I don't really bother for alterations to the events' sequence or for inventing or omitting characters or for inventing events non-existent in the poem, so long as the message and the substance of the myth remains immutable. But I do bother as a Greek for falsifying the characters of the Greek heroes'. For instance:<br/><br/>I don't bother if Agamemnon is killed by Briseis in Troy (he's killed anyway in the myth by Aegisthus and his wife Clytaemnistra after he's back home). But I do bother if they portray Agamemnon as a demon and an unscrupulous villain without any virtues, concerning only over his power. Something like that doesn't render Homer's spirit.<br/><br/>I don't bother if Patroclus is portrayed as Achilles' young cousin and not as Achilles' dearest friend. But I do bother for portraying Patroclus as a young frivolous brat who needs Achilles' babysitting and cheats Achilles by stealing his armor without his permission in order to be glorified in the battlefield. Something like that doesn't render Homer's spirit, who depicts Patroclus as a brave hero who is distressed by the sufferings/defeat of the Greeks and desires to help them, and eventually helps them with Achilles' permission, since his (Achilles') anger gradually blows over.<br/><br/>I don't bother if Achilles lives to see the Trojan horse and is killed during the fall of Troy (in the myth is killed much earlier and the Trojan horse is invented by cunning Odysseus because the Greeks aren't able to defeat Trojans in the battle without Achilles' help). But I do bother if they include only that brutal scene of Achilles dragging Hector's corpse around the walls of Troy, without pointing out that earlier Hector was trying to undress Patroclus' corpse from its armor, cut his head, fix it on a stake and give his rest body as food to the dogs of Troy. (In the myth Hector would have accomplished his intentions if the Greeks hadn't fought bravely to protect Patroclus' body). Something like that doesn't render Homer's spirit, doesn't show that what is actually savage/brute is the war, and makes Achilles (who is my favorite hero) look like the uncivilized savage and Hector look like the tragic noble prince.<br/><br/>All in all they have portrayed the most of the Greeks as a little more villainous and the most of the Trojans as a little more nobles than they really were. And that disappoints me as a Greek, and, furthermore it weakens the original story. One of the reasons that the Iliad is the mother of all stories is that it throws off the hackneyed pattern of ""the good guys versus the bad guys"" and depicts ""good but flawed guys versus good but flawed guys"". There isn't black-or-white in the Iliad, but the things are a little more complicated in the poem, just like in the real life. And Benioff should have realized that his story the most close it would have been to the original myth the most advantage would have gained.<br/><br/>
Thankfully my beloved Achilles is the character they falsified less. They have portrayed him a little more arrogant than he really was, a little impious (towards Apollo) -he isn't impious in the Iliad- and concerning only over his glory in this war (in the Iliad he fights not only for his glory but for honor, too, for king Menelaus' insulted honor namely). Aside from that, he's the complex, interesting, amazing character who has always fascinated me in the Iliad. I love Troy's Achilles almost as I love the Homeric one.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would say that, though it deviates a lot from the Iliad/true myth, Troy is still a very good epic movie.  Go and see it, you'll have a nice time for about 2.40 absorbing hours, which pass in a blink of the eyes. But after you leave the theater go and read the Iliad. It's worthwhile. You'll be connected with the magnificent and timeless qualities of the Homeric universe."

","Gladiator won Best Picture at the Oscar's. It was a joke then, but now that Troy is out, it is especially clear how Gladiator was a trifle compared to Troy. <br/><br/>Troy is film-making as good as it gets when it comes to complex and difficult subject matter compressed into a movie less than 3 hours long. Wolfgang Petersen doesn't have the sumptuous and warm visual aesthetic of Ridley Scott, but stages the fight scenes and battles beautifully and gives us locations and buildings and uniforms we've not seen before. Troy has a much more you-are-there feel about it than any other film about the Classical Age.<br/><br/>Gladiator homogenized and made pretty its ugly world, and had so much CGI, you almost thought you were watching a George Lucas film.<br/><br/>Troy gives us extras in uniform for the battle scenes, hundreds of them at least, if not thousands. The CGI is kept to a bare minimum and the difference really shows.<br/><br/>Let us remember that Troy is based on The Ilaid and the story covers at least 10 years. So it is no small feat to compress the timeline.<br/><br/>I wasn't thrilled with the choice of removing the supernatural from the story, or the homosexual relationship between Achilles and Patroclus - two of the central pillars upon which this epic story is built. But, hey, this is Hollywood, and we have Oliver Stone for the homosexual love story in his version of Alexander the Great (to Stone's credit he didn't shy away from the reality of this actual historic figure), and most Americans under the age of 50 are so undereducated and/or dumbed-down that it would take a 2-hour movie just to explain all of the Greek gods and their significance as it relates to the human characters in the Iliad/Troy.<br/><br/>Troy, as is, really works, with no homosexuality (it is obliquely referenced for those who've read the book), and no Mount Olympus gods. Achilles' mother Thetis is a sea-nymph but that is also referenced indirectly.<br/><br/>It would have been really cool to see Achilles' new armor glowing, but, Peterson chose to keep his film grounded in the human dimension. An explanation of just why Achilles was vulnerable in his heel (his mother held him there when dipping him in the River Styx to make him invulnerable thus that part was not made invulnerable) would have proved helpful for the purpose of heightening the drama when he is finally felled by Paris at the end.<br/><br/>What is great about the film is its pacing, the superb acting by all involved, the look of the film, the visceral and effectively executed battle scenes, and the sense of another time.<br/><br/>A weakness of the film is the casting of Helen. My vote would have gone to German actress Xenia Seeberg, but Diane Kruger did a fine job acting-wise... her beauty and presence were not grand, as required though. It would have been nice to have a beauty that was truly breathtaking to underpin the story for the viewer as to why she could launch a ten-year war.<br/><br/>The greatest weakness of the film has to be the music. The original score was tossed out and excellent composer James Horner was brought in at the last minute and created a score that lends nothing, really, to the film. Imagine some of the surreal music by Nino Rota from Satyricon in place of Horner's music and you get an idea of how otherworldly and brilliantly the right kind of music could have elevated this film.<br/><br/>Despite its minor flaws, I give the film a 10 out of 10 because it is clearly the best film ever made in the genre."

Professors in Classics, Historians, but also filmmakers joined their efforts with the purpose of tracing an historical outline of the movies dedicated to Greek history and mythology from ""The fall of Troy"" by Giovanni Pastrone (1911) until today. Troy by Wolfgang Petersen is very well considered by these scholars.Vito Zagarrio (III University of Rome) advises ""to enjoy the glamorous special effects, to enter the new digital universe that allows any journey across the time"" and to ""enjoy the magnificent duels, especially the one between Hector and Achilles"". The Historian of Antiquity Francesco Lucrezi (University of Salerno)is particularly interested in the character of the ""self-conscious, rebel, invincible Achilles"", with special regard to his representation in ""the excellent movie Troy"". I agree with these statements. Troy is a fine work, with good acting and a magnificent production design (very close to literary sources and archaeological evidence). I think it is worth watching."

","A real disappointment. Historical movies are so scarce these days that I badly wanted to like this movie more than anything in my decent movie going history but had to watch in between my yawns how in a tediously boring way the movie was parsed together. I really miss the old Hollywood style of using real actors in situations where thousands of extras were used (read Spartacus) to visualize the mass battles. The CGI effect of copying the same thousand extras here was too easy to notice and for me it flattened the visual glory of what it might have been.<br/><br/>Brad gave a good performance, Sean Bean was again as natural within his acting maneuvers as a freezer full of frozen ashes and Eric Bana couldn't unfortunately rise above the acting in Chopper or Hulk. Bright star here was Bloom as whimpering gayish Paris.<br/><br/>And the ships would have been seen from Troy many many days before they were actually even near the coast if the movie was supposed to have been shot on Tellus. Some sort of surprise attack at this kind of situation would only have been possible in the minds of ignorant movie makers."

","Are you surprised? Of course, it is only a joke. In the ancient archives of Hattusas, a group of archaeologists found the name of Alaksandu, king of Wilusa, and identified this man with Paris/Alexandros, prince of Troy, son of Priamus an brother of Hector. It is a little odd that Homer portrayed me (oops...Paris) as a silly, inconsistent woman chaser. But as Troy, in the thirteenth century B.C. was the most powerful city in the Aegean sea, it is natural that Helen, daughter of Zeus, followed me: Helklen was a goddess, and represented ROYALTY, just like some Oriental goddesses such as Inanna and Ishtar. But I don't mean to annoy you. On the other hand, I am ANNOYED by some big mistakes that I read in some reviews of Troy. The movie is very good, the acting fine, the archaeological reconstruction of places and monuments excellent (especially as regards Agamemnon's palace and the walls of Troy). But above all, Achilles and Patroclus were REALLY cousins. Hesiod says so, other ancient sources confirm this statement. So, please, stop mocking the readers by saying that Troy is a homophobic movie. It is only faithful to the mythological tradition."

The pacing was so slow, the dialogue laughable and the film - well apart from a nice fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow.<br/><br/>And why, oh why does Hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit 'consumer approval'. Agamemnon didn't die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle! It annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap.<br/><br/>And don't even start me on the 'lack' of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman the war was fought over and it didn't even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other. No sparks, no emotion, no hope.<br/><br/>I have to say in the films defence Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O' Toole acted very well with a bad script but that isn't enough to save this awful movie. <br/><br/>Can anybody tell me where the £200 million budget went?

If you haven't got any Greek historical background, you think this movie sucks anyway. Because the way Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot) makes this Hollywood-crap is unbelievable. The audience have seen enough mass-fights last decade. It is just simply not overwhelming anymore. And let that aspect just be the only one that's 'good' in this movie. The acting sucks badly. Orlando Bloom is totally annoying, Brad Pitt is a good-looking Hollywood-guy, but hell no, use him for a good purpose, not for Achilles. The audience (you) can't take Achilles seriously if he is Brad Pitt?! Always use more anonymous actors for this kind of movies (like Peter Jackson did with LOTR).

But Patroclus advised Achilles to choose Briseis...ans so they got rid of me. Now look at the movie: I am the girl who sleeps with Achilles at the beginning. In any case, I must admit that all the girls who appear in the movie are characters that you really can find in Homer or in the later mythological tradition. Maybe Briseis is a mix of herself and Polyxena (who helped Priamus to bring home Hector's corpse, and under that circumstance met Achilles and fell in love with him).

"creston","1","47","92","15 May 2004"," waste of time (SPOILERS)
","I find it hard to believe that any studio executive thought it worth putting up $200 million to film the the shoddy script in the first place, but the fact that so many great actors have now ruined their reputations with this film is the biggest tragedy. Troy had so much potential; action, romance, greed, jealousy, a great setting and story, and yet everything was completely screwed up. What's more, they altered everything that was originally part of the myth; Agammemnon died at his wife's hands on returning home after conquering Troy, Achilles was dead long before the horse entered the city gates, and Ajax hung himself as opposed to being killed by Hector. On top of this, the battle scenes were unambitious and pedestrian, marred by the incessant Gladiator-esque waling music used in the background. The dialogue was laughable in the first five minutes until it became evident that it would continue like this for a further two and a half hours. I feel ashamed that a) I paid to see this film, and b) I managed to repeatedly convince myself that the next battle, whether between Achilles and Hector or with the Trojan horse, would be worth staying for instead of leaving the cinema. The entire cast, with the exception of Brendan Gleeson, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean, were horribly miscast, and contributed to one of the most boring afternoons of my life. Even the costumes, make up and CGI looked painfully out of place - not something you would expect from a film with so much riding on it and so much money pumped into it. Proof, as if more were needed, that Hollywood has been entirely drained of any credibility it might once have had. 1/10"
"davidemartin","10","62","125","15 May 2004"," Interesting political parable
","When I was a Film Major, I groaned inside whenever my classmates attempted to instill political themes into whatever movie was up for discussion. Well, sometimes they could be right. TROY is definitely a movie with a contemporary political subtext.<br/><br/>Growing up I used to read Greek mythology.  I grew up believing the Greeks were the good guys, out to rescue the fair Helen from the nefarious Trojans. I also grew up believing that America was always the good guys in any conflict.  The invasions of Grenada, Panama, and Iraq sure dispelled that belief, both for me and for a lot of the world.<br/><br/>    Watching the movie it struck me fairly quickly that the Greek invaders were symbolizing the US invasion of Iraq.  Agamemnon is clearly George Bush Junior, seizing the convenient excuse of Helen's abduction as rationale for the invasion he wants more than anything.  Odysseus seems to be Powell, the only one of the Greek kings with any integrity or real intelligence.  When Odysseus protests the men still believe the war is being fought to help Menelaeus rescue Helen, Agamemnon coldly replies that the invasion was never about Helen.  One can easily imagine Powell being similarly rebuffed by Bush Junior.  Agamemnon is obsessed with destroying Troy as a means to increase his power.<br/><br/>Notice how Agamemnon is always accompanied by his two vassal kings, analogous to how Bush Junior rarely acts without Rumsfeld or Cheney.<br/><br/>Achilles then comes to represent the American Fighting Man.  He is the one who actually fights, who actually faces danger.  But Agamemnon, like Bush, sits back in safety and gathers the glory for himself.  When Achilles points out that Agamemnon had done none of the fighting he claims credit for, Agamemnon merely gloats. Achilles is more than willing to commit atrocities but he is also capable of noble acts.  <br/><br/>Agamemnon, like Bush Junior, denounces any attempt at negotiation.  The one time he does pretend to negotiate, when Paris challenges Menelaeus, Agamemnon intends to break the pact.  Again, consider how we now know that Bush had no interest in any negotiation or cooperation with Iraq.<br/><br/>The Trojans have strong religious beliefs.  The Greeks, on the other hand, give lip service to the gods and happily desecrate temples to gods they ostensibly worship.  <br/><br/>Note that Helen soon moves into the background, almost disappearing from the story of a war that should center on her.  Likewise, Osama bin Laden, the reason for the twin invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, is rarely mentioned. <br/><br/>
Is the film anti-American?  In some aspects it can be seen thus.  After all, even when the Greeks know there is no longer any possibility of reuniting Menelaeus with Helen, they continue their onslaught.  Likewise, even after the world knew that Iraq had no connection to 9/11 and that there were no Iraqi ""weapons of mass destruction"" the US continued their invasion.  The film is clearly even more anti-Bush in the form of the homicidal demagogue Agamemnon.  That Greek king thought nothing of killing his own daughter to get his fleet underway.  Has anyone seen Bush exhibit any real regret at the 700+ American soldiers already killed in his trumped-up war?<br/><br/>
Bravo to Wolfgang Petersen and David Beniof for speaking truths that are increasingly hard to say in America."

"Scrooj","8","6","8","30 April 2014"," A Song of Pitt and Bana.
","I suggest fans of A Game of Thrones rewatch this film, as I'm almost certain they will appreciate it all the more. <br/><br/>Written by David Benioff, the man responsible for bringing the SOIAF series to HBO, Troy shares a number of resemblances to the acclaimed stories. What both tales do so well is create ambiguous characters, blurring the hero/villain dichotomy. Achilles (Pitt) is a bit of a prat, and Paris(Bloom)is a fool, leaving Hector (Bana) the 'hero' if one must be assigned. <br/><br/>The film is a blockbuster at the end of the day, and the acting is of variable quality, but this adaptation is a strong depiction of the honour and respect of Ancient Greek warfare- if not particularly faithful to its mythology. Going beyond the brief appearances of Ned Stark (Sean Bean) and Maester Pycelle (Julian Glover), Benioff's two productions converge with the multiple deaths of main characters, and the conflicted emotions felt by the audience. Without elaborating, players on both sides meet their end, and we are not necessarily aligned to wish death upon either party. <br/><br/>Focusing on the humanity and personality of individual soldiers creates a powerful emotional connection to both warring parties; a complex narrative achievement perhaps all too often taken for granted."
"tiddlebit04","1","32","60","28 September 2004"," Worst movie, ever.
","I've been reading other comments on this movie and here's my 2 cents:<br/><br/>This was by far one of the worst movies, ever. Period. They tried to make Brad Pitt another Charles Heston and that didn't work out for him considering this was not his best movie ever. Movies like Fight Club and Seven are where we see Pitt best... This movie makes me want to hit him.<br/><br/>The acting was not all that great by any of the characters except for Hector. He I actually believed.<br/><br/>The musical score blew beyond anything I've ever heard. It sort of reminded me of Gladiator but not nearly as good.<br/><br/>The historical aspects of the movie are extremely far off. The clothing and such was mostly correct, but there are things that were never even mentioned in the movie that played a larger role in the book. As far as I remember, Achilles was killed before the Trojan horse was brought into the city and he was killed in the middle of a battlefield, not alone. It was Odysseus who played a much larger role in the Iliad in the creation of the horse. Patrocklus is Achilles lover, not his cousin, and Achilles was fully aware that Patrocklus took his armor into the battlefield... Patrocklus even furthered them in the battlefield until he was struck dead by Hector. The Iliad ends with Hectors burial whereas the movie does not. Helen was also kidnapped... She did not go willingly. She was a prize won by Paris granted by... I want to say Aphrodites but I forget if it was her or Hera or the other goddess competing for the golden apple. Where are the gods and goddesses in this movie? The only goddess we are made aware of his Achilles mother and I don't recall her even being mentioned as a goddess (although I could be wrong).<br/><br/>I gave this movie a '1.' I wasn't aware that I went to see a comedy. This movie made me laugh all the way through. I especially loved Achilles ""signature move."""
"okyroe","10","50","99","28 July 2005"," What about menhirs?
","I really can't cope. From an antiquary and archaeological point of view,""Troy"" is the only serious film about ancient Greece I have ever seen. Nevertheless, a lot of silly things have been said and written about it. Why? Because the gods are excluded from the action? There are lots of ancient and modern retellings of the story which exclude the gods. Or because Hector shows scepticism about the ""winged messages"" alleged by Trojan priests? But this is Homer (Iliad, book 12). Religion, temples and sanctuaries in ancient Greek epics are a very difficult and delicate matter. The movie treats this subject with intelligence and information. In the Mycenean era, the temples were usually annexed to the royal palaces, and this is very well shown in ""Troy"". But Homer (and later epics) tell about independent sanctuaries, such as the one of Athena (Ilias, book 6), which is probably an anachronism, just like the temple of Apollo Tymbraeus, sacked by Achilles out of the walls of Troy (Cyprian tales, Apollodorus and so on). The Greek religious architecture begins in the VIII-VII centuries b.C.: the movie tries to reconstruct a temple belonging to that time, with reference to insular and ""Orientalizing"" evidence (Gortina, Prinias). But the most intolerable mistake I read in some reviews concerns the building where Achilles trains with Patroclus. The movie was located in Malta and Mexico...so, please, remember that there are NO Greek temples in Malta or in Mexico. The structure is a MENHIR, placed in Malta, and dating back to the third millennium b.C. There were menhirs also in Greece, and obviously we can suppose they were ruined when the Trojan war was beginning. It is possible that Achilles trained in the ruins of a menhir, and in any case the idea is very suggestive."

","I am always disappointed when people judge a movie on whether or not it is historically correct. Unless that was the intention of the producers.... WHO CARES!! Troy was an amazing movie. I have a Master's degree in ancient history and I have read Homer's work numerous times. I don't really care that the movie differs because I think they did a great job on it. There are certain things they had to alter in order to make the movie more entertaining to the average viewer. If they hadn't, history buffs would have been the only one's satisfied.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are spectacular, especially the moves they were able to give Achilles. And on that note, Brad Pitt did a great job of portraying him. The only problem i have with this movie is Orlando Blooms performance. Although Paris was supposed to be a coward, I think Orlando was too much of a baby and overdid it a little. Sometimes it made me a little sick.<br/><br/>Anyway, these comments people are making remind me of when Gladiator came out. It was a wicked movie but obviously historically incorrect. It wasn't until the movie won some awards that people started to back off.<br/><br/>So lay off of Troy. It's a great movie. I loved it and own the DVD. Being historically incorrect is not a reason to judge it since that was never a goal of the producers... they were just out to make an entertaining flick, and they did a tremendous job of that."

","I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid (even before Tolkien). I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to ""Fabio on the beach"" in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn't even hold a candle to them. Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. I wouldn't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was (at least they got that part right)."
"Bogmeister","8","43","84","18 July 2005"," Return of the Epic
","I'm not sure why there's a large camp of people who've seen this and regard it as one of the worst movies of 2004. Usually, these are brief, offhand remarks, and don't explain the reasons for this antipathy. I do agree there are definite flaws. Most detractors (and even some fans) believe Brad Pitt was miscast, but I wouldn't go there. Pitt's Achilles is a curious mixture and can be divided almost squarely in two: half the performance is just fine; the other half is not so good. It all depends on what scene we're talking about. An example of the negative is when Achilles and his men are in their boat, on the verge of reaching the beach of Troy. Achilles makes a brief statement to his number two to fight for him. I think Pitt's intent was to make Achilles super-casual in moments like these, when everyone else is tensed up. But it just doesn't work; his line reading reminds me of an office manager asking his assistant to buy some more paper clips. However, there's something to be said for the view that Pitt was born to play this role. There's no getting around the fact that, physically, he is ideal. And, there aren't too many actors, whether thru presence or sheer egomania, who can stare down an entire army and make them feel small. The film, as a whole, is filled with such moments and it's a compulsive re-watching experience, not for the obvious 1000 ships sailing in, but for seeing mythical characters come alive and interact on screen for you. And for, oh yes, seeing Achilles down a giant warrior now & then. Now, as for GOOD line readings, I must mention the actor who impressed me the most - Brian Cox as Agamemnon, the 'pig of a king.' His performance was flawless and his was as a magnetic presence (in some ways, more so) as Pitt's Achilles. The actor Bana was excellent as the strong, heroic Hector and Gleeson great as the brutish King Menelaus. Sean Bean seems well suited for these epics and is very smooth as the legendary Odysseus. O'Toole brought in his usual class as the elderly King Priam. I've missed the Epic; I'm glad it's back."

I vaguely knew the story, just the fact that the Greeks destroyed Troy by tricking them with a Trojan Horse. 'The Simpsons' helped somewhat on the background, as they also had an episode on The Trojan War. Of course, though, I didn't take everything to be entirely correct, whether it be The Simpsons or Troy. When it comes to a historical film, it is very rare you find one that is completely free of Hollywood's twists and additions.<br/><br/>Homer purists will HATE this movie. Well, most of them anyways. Each purist I have spoken to have not liked this movie. It goes the same with LOTR purists. They are so attached with the original story that they cannot bend the lines a bit. Since Troy is so far off from The Iliad (remember, people, it was ""Inspired By"", NOT based!) they just cannot cope with all of the changes. Both minor and major.<br/><br/>People have to understand, though. When you hear a historical story is going to be made into a major summer blockbuster, with an A-List cast, do you REALLY think they will stick to the story completely? Yes, I assumed they wouldn't stray as far off as they did with Troy, but still. The people on these boards are over-reacting just a tad. I expect some emails yapping about this or that, but honestly? I don't care, and you want to know why? This is my personal opinion.<br/><br/>Yes, if you say ""Well, me not liking Troy is my personal opinion, too."" Thats true! It is! But those who are spamming the boards with ""TROY SUCKS"" or ""WHAT A TERRIBLE FILM, JUST TERRIBLE!"" and not even giving a good reason why they didn't like it, just don't seem to get that this is a Hollywood version of The Iliad.<br/><br/>So, please, please, PLEASE think your post/review over before posting it here. Troy was a fantastic, entertaining film, and all of the actors did a wonderful job in their roles.

"Thalia_A","Null","44","87","8 June 2004"," Homer's bones will be rattling in his grave!!!SPOILER
","We(my friend Tania and I) were very disappointed to see that such a literary masterpiece was altered to an unrecognisable extent! At Cannes Brad Pitt mentioned that he felt he was in the middle of the Iraq crisis. This in fact is not a wrong assumption to make, considering how much Agagmemnon was portrayed as a power mad dictator such as Saddam. Even if someone tried really hard they couldn t have distorted the story as much as they did. In fact it is not that they wanted to convey a negative Greek identity but you would think that a multi million budget like that would be supported by thorough research. Essentially apart from key plots being omitted, the nature of the characters was depicted in a very shallow manner. Yes Achilles was the strongest of the Greeks and yes he was arrogant, but that was because he was a king and a semi-god, not a spoiled bratt! What is really peculiar is that they could have made twice their budget in box office taking, had they tried to be as faithful as possible to the book. Obviously with this screenplay it is natural to think in terms of the aggressive Greeks and the honourable life saving Trojans( just to make clear that the war was between Greek kingdoms thus sharing the same language,faith in the 12 gods of Olympus and especially fear of their wrath) yet this is an unspeakable abuse of Homer's ideals. The iliad is about honour, civil war, love, ambition, the power of the 12 gods over humans and the importance of their interference, but not in the brutal and sacrilegious way it was portrayed. There are far from a few inaccuracies and most of all the viewer is not informed of the power of Helen's beauty. She was not a scorned wife, far from it. Menelaus was terribly in love with her and the reason all the Greek Kings decided to follow Agamemnon was not to fullfil his alleged empire building tendencies, but because they had made an oath. What this entailed is that because Helen was so beautiful and most of the Greek kings had been her suitors, they had pledged allegiance to her and Menelaus and had vowed to protect this marriage. This is one of the few misinterpretations which could have been avoided, had the screenwriter had been more interested in Greek mythology. Our question is why Tolkien's and J.K Rowling's work deserves to be carefully adapted and respected and Homer's legacy is not."

You have to be an incredibly poor director to make a film that drags on for more than three excruciating hours feel rushed in terms of storyline. Most of the actors felt as though they were mired in some horrendous high school production. In fact, many high school productions are far better than this ill-conceived piece of garbage.

Diane Kruger as Helen was unpardonably miscast. She had neither the beauty nor the acting chops to make one think she was worth all the lives and cultures sacrificed. Too many actors slipped in and out of bad accents that distracted one's attention from the storyline. As for the costumes, they looked like something cobbled together from a hippie vintage shop. I taught art history for several years, and the sets were just plain wrong in terms of chronology, location and architecture. Many of the sets looked like the Egyptians meet the Incans. As my partner pointed out, it is unforgivable to present a film that could have been a golden opportunity to interest students in reading the Greeks as some Hollywoodized gore fest at the end. It is far more powerful to follow the texts and have Priam witness the destruction of his family and land, just as it is more intriguing to have Agamemnon return home only to be ensnared in Clytemnestra's net."
"Ziya90","10","21","38","6 January 2010"," Intellectual expectations!
","Despite, Troy is one of the best modern historical epics so far, many people including critics did not like the movie almost at all. Yes, the reason of all the people who did not like the movie is not the same, but I believe that generally this is because of intellectual expectations. It is said that the movie is very bad, because there is no mythological material, or the movie is very bad, because it is not a smart adaptation, instead so conventional. And there are also people who say that they did not enjoy it. If this is not entertainment, what is it then? Troy is not an unusual movie or it is not postmodern or an art house work, but these make the movie bad? Another director might have focused on Helen Paris love affair, then the movie would have been unbearable, but we get involved in the adventure quickly. I know that either, there are some people who hate Brad Pitt and always say he cannot act! Brad Pitt is a great actor. To me, he proved that in Jesse James and Burn After Reading. And his performance in Troy is one of his bests. He reflects his character's power, arrogance and extreme self confidence. And watch the Patroclus scene and see yourself whether he is talented or not. By the way, after the killing, I hated him, he became my enemy, for a while, I even could not follow the movie. If we hated the character, it means that he did a very good job. You don't care about the characters in some movies, Troy is not one of them. The fight between Hector and Achilles is one of the most exciting and fresh fight scenes ever made. Very high adrenalin and great movements. And the mark on the shield. That is matter a lot. The fights in Troy are very critical, not only that one, but also the fight between Paris and Agamemnon. Again very exciting, high adrenalin. Paris does not know how to fight, he is too young to die and if it happens, it becomes a real pity. By the way, in a scene, Paris shows his 'Legolas side'. I said to myself, you are the prince! And the war scenes, the big war. Despite we have seen similar scenes almost a lot of times, it captures you and looks dazzling. I watched it over and over again and still do. In some moments, it is obvious that the army is CGI based, especially the opening scene and the scene which the army walk to the castle throughout the beach. However, it does not ruin the movie exactly. The sneak peek of Troy was from the scene that thousands of ships sail on and every time, it looks dazzling to me. Besides all, Troy has soul. Lastly, all the characters are human being in the movie, as mentioned no mythological material, but this realism somehow becomes an advantage instead disadvantage. Despite I love fantasy genre, realism seems a great idea in the movie."

","Troy was a great movie i really enjoyed watching all the action and drama was great. I truly enjoy watching films that deal with history or at least what had supposedly happened in troy.

Imortatality is one thing everyone wants and Achillies had except for that little detail he could not get hit on his heal.

"jannagal","7","43","86","4 July 2004"," Did Homer really write this?
","I remember a time in eighth grade when Eddie F. challenged me to a fight. I was class monitor, charged with upholding the values of decency and honor. (My main job was to keep kids in their seats when teacher was out.)  Eddie F. was the leader of kids who wanted out of their seats.  Anyways, about 25 people gathered around in a littered alley as Eddie F. beat me to a pulp because he received too many demerits. I guess that's the same scenario in ""Troy"", when in the middle of a pitched battle, 100,000 sweating, bloodied and ferocious warriors ceased stabbing each other to watch Hector and Patroclus(thought to be Achilles)fight to the finish. Sound reasonable?<br/><br/>  In another scene, Achilles comforts the beautiful cousin of Hector, who is now a captured ""guest"" of Achilles, and who has just been beaten and tossed about by sweaty, hell-bent Greek soldiers.  ""Are you hurt?"" he asks while attempting to wipe her blood-covered face.  Another example of inane dialog is when Helen of Sparta/Troy says to Trojan prince Paris, her illicit suitor of the past two nights:  ""That was a mistake."" <br/><br/>  I think Homer must be summoning the gods for a sign that this was really the Iliad that he envisioned.<br/><br/>  However, I sheepishly must admit that I was entertained nevertheless. Brad Pitt looked good, leaped handsomely around the set during fight scenes, and gave the suggestion that the film should have been called ""Achilles"" instead of ""Troy.""   The computer-generated armies looked convincing, and the acting was at least better than average. 7* out of 10*."
"rivendal","10","33","64","16 May 2004"," Fulfillment of the main issue
","First two hexameters of Homer`s Iliad are the main point of this heroic-epic story, and this is the Achilles`s ANGER, which is the essential part of his character and his very doom. According to this, as the second hexameter told us, he was the one who put all the host of Achaeans (not Spartans, yet!) in many of the troubles. Homer`s Iliad described just about 20 days of the Troy war, which lasted 10 years, and it was the last year of war (Agamemnon and Odysseus mentioned they`re abiding on the shores before Troy a full 9 years, since they left Peloponeses). Somewhere in the middle of this story we can reveal the cause of this war - Alexandar-Paris took from Menelaus his wife Helena, which shows that she was dwelt in Troy for 9 years, ere all those things happened Homer telling us. The Achaean host actually waited and dwelt before the strong walls of the city of Troy and it`s destroying, for full 10 years (remember that Odysseus was apart from his kingdom on Ithaca for 20 years, 10 in Troy war and 10 in his wanderings - ""Odyssey""). The death of Achilles we can recognize only in Hector`s prophecy words while he was dying, told to Achilles alone, that he will be slain by Paris. Also, Agamemnon (son of Atreus) the king of Mycenae, was nothing else but the first between the equals in that time (bronze age of Aegea), so Achilles had no any obligations or obedience to him, he was free to release his anger and to follow his doom defined by gods. There are only 4 great battles in Iliad, including one-on-one between Hector and Achilles, as the crucial one. Now, Hector, noble too, had completely opposite character, but in the very first of meeting the Achilles he fled before him and after their running around walls of Troy (3 circles they ran) Hector finally decided to confront Achilles. Nevertheless, Hector was the greatest hero of Troy indeed, for he knew Achilles is invulnerable, given to him by Nymphes and gods, but he was farsighted, knowing Paris would shoot the Achilles`s only weak spot, so he excepted his own doom, to be slain by Achilles. All the gods were directly involved in this war, by love, or hate, or by cunning.<br/><br/>So, Wolfgang Petersen made a great movie, for the main issue of the Iliad, ACHILLES ANGER, is fulfilled in his excellent deed.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is wonderful Achilles, the right one (Homer ever called Achilles handsome and blond)), so, Brad, I don`t know if you like this roll or not, but you was born to act the Achilles, as Viggo Mortensen was so to act the Aragorn (I don`t want to compare the actors!). Splendid.<br/><br/>Eric Bana is so noble and valiant, but full of sorrow and love, care and loyalty. In Iliad Hector was similar. Bravo.<br/><br/>Brian Cox, well done, though Agamemnon was a bit more cunning and he gave up Briseis much earlier (she was Achilles slave and lover before Agamemnon took her from Achilles, the reason for the one of the first arguing of these two men, and the cause of all the further troubles in the last year of war).<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is no one else, but Paris, young, a bit spoiled, but his courage grows as the time passes during war, his love for Helena as well. Orlando`s acting satisfied the Paris`s character, the intact mimics of his face, especially.<br/><br/>Sean Bean as Odysseus is brilliant, acting wise but cunning man, opened to the others, but hidden in his minds, as Odysseus was indeed.<br/><br/>Now, there are some unclear things. First is that Ajax (the Big Ajax, there are two with the same name in Iliad)is in the battle changed with Diomed, it`s confusing one person with another. Second confusion, more exactly of the rolls in movie, considers Briseis. She was Achilles`s lover, the war ""trophy"" from the city of Lyrnes (Lirnes), long before Troy war and she never was one of the virgins of Apollo`s shrine near Troy, but it was Kasandra, Priam`s daughter, sister of Hector and Paris, who was farsighted (a gift to her from Apollo alone) and she was the very person who foretell all the troubles in Troy and the final destroying of the city and Priam`s realm, forever. In a movie it is a big mistake. Where is Kasandra, anyway?<br/><br/>Yet, I voted 10, for this movie by itself is the great one, perfect done. All the details (costumes, tools and weapons, ships etc.) are very convenient. Excavations of built levels of Troy shows that the levels VI or VIIa might be the Priam`s realm, so the costumes and tools I mentioned are well reconstructed, considering the artifacts from those levels, also they`re of the same kind with those in Agamemnon`s Mycaena, from the same period.<br/><br/>Congratulations!"
"ExoticSarah","Null","27","51","19 June 2005"," Troy was easily a 10 (Excellent)
","Troy was excellent. Definitely not over exaggerated or boring. Based on reading ""The Iliad"" and watching the movie itself, I was highly impressed. David Benioff also innovated such a wonderful script for these amazing actors to follow upon. The movie was much more diverse than to be expected and very unpredictable; as it possessed Adventure, Drama, Action, War, and Romance movie genres. The Epic was very clear and not confusing, yet effecting. Lucinda Syson knew exactly who should have played these roles, when she picked out the wonderful cast members. Brad Pitt was the perfect choice when it came to portraying the handsome brute warrior Achilles and Eric Bana was the perfect choice to for the role of Hector (soldier and prince of Troy). Peter O'Toole as King Priam (King of Troy)totally enlightened the story and made it more vivid, as his character was a spark to add to the movie. Brian Cox once again pulled the movie through, by playing the perfect villain, Agamemnon. I think when Wolfgang Peterson created this movie, he had the word ""life"" in mind, as he brought the story to life. He took a fictional movie and made it very real. The plot totally focused on realism and the war was very believable. The battles, fights, the swords, the archery, i.e. is completely fascinating and so realistic that you will have chills. Peter Honess edited the movie to perfection. James Horner knew how to create a theme song and was wise to pick Josh Groban to sing ""Remember Me"" (as Josh has an amazing voice) This movie defines the term used by Sun Tzu ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"". People who dislike this movie, obviously don't understand it. If you have never watched this movie, I highly suggest watching this movie, as it is easily a 10."
"nas-7","10","26","49","24 May 2004"," ***Thumbs up!***
","I have always been fascinated by Greek History, and this movie is the best that I have seen on the topic. I think the movie is excellent, especially compared to most of the movies that have been shown recently. All areas are not altogether accurate, however, the general idea was presented well. My husband who has never read anything, seen anything or even cared about the matter, after seeing the movie, was able to relay the 'big picture' of what really happened during those days.<br/><br/>I confess, however, that my only hesitation in viewing this film was because Brad Pitt was one of the actors. I have never really liked his acting in past (except for Legends of the Fall . . . which I only recently watched as well.) To my surprise, and enjoyment, Brad Pitt was phenomenal! He was able to portray a very confused, tormented, yet heroic Achilles very well indeed. There was very little left to be desired in the acting of this character. And how could anyone not be impressed by the skills used int he fight scenes. Again, Brad was phenomenal! He was good shape and form, and he showed that he could easily play an heroic figure. When I compare him with Tom Cruise in 'The Last Samurai' or Russell Crowe in 'Gladiator', Brad simply comes out shining. He has won my respect through this movie. Hats off to you, Brad!<br/><br/>Eric Bana also did an excellent job in his character. In fact, I would say that he portrayed his character better than any other in the movie. His character was the most believeable, and that's because he played it so well. My favorite scene with him was when Paris comes to him while they were on the ship sailing back to Troy from Sparta. Paris reveals that he has Helen on the ship, and Hector goes ballistic! In this scene one can easily see what Hector's life was about . . . protecting Troy at all costs. I liked the speech he gave to Paris about war and death and that ""there is nothing glorious about it, nothing poetic."" Eric has always been a good actor, but he has really taken his acting to another level in this movie. He was able to portray love, anger, fear, courage, and some other emotions and attributes that are so real. Everyone should love Eric in this film!<br/><br/>Everyone else in the movie did well, and contrary to what some are saying, I do believe that Orlando Bloom did justice to Paris. Paris is really not a 'likeable' character to play. Because of his inability to control himself, these two great cities were at war. So at the very beginning, you have no choice but to hate him. In spite of that, Orlando played his part well.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to all of my friends and acquaintances because it really is a balanced movie. Thats more than I can say for most. I believe that it's going to win many awards this year!"
"marcyg68","10","26","49","20 May 2004"," The Best Film of 2004 so far. Brilliant! (minor spoilers)
","I am a Greek mythology addict and have been since childhood. To say that I was anxiously anticipating this film is a major understatement. Not only is it a story that has endured through many centuries but it also has the star wattage of Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean - actors that I greatly admire.<br/><br/>I was prepared for disappointment but ,as the credits rolled, I found myself very satisfied with the outcome of the film. There were some shortcomings, to be sure: some important plot points were changed (who lived vs who died, who killed whom, the length of the war), a somewhat ""hollywood-ized"" ending and some clunky dialogue. But the positives more than outweighed the negatives: the impressive battle scenes (second only to ""The Lord of the Rings""), amazingly good-looking and talented cast (men and women alike), almost flawless visual effects, sumptuous sets and cinematography, high production values, and the overall effort by the cast and crew to make this film as faithful to Homer's vision as possible while making it resonate to modern audiences. <br/><br/>Greek mythology enthusiasts, for instance, will appreciate the mythological traditions and customs sprinkled throughout the film: burial rites, the influence of the Gods in their daily lives, the temples and many statues of the Gods shown throughout the film. <br/><br/>A film wouldn't work, of course, if the story doesn't draw audiences in and Homer has not earned his reputation as one of the greatest storytellers of all time for nothing. The Trojan War is one of the greatest stories ever told - a tale of greed, ambition, love, glory and courage. Apart from the story, credit should also be given to its talented actors and director Wolfgang Petersen. Brad Pitt is the physical embodiment of Achilles - the perfect warrior. He moves with the grace of a gazelle, looks like a Greek god and fights like a lion. Eric Bana is flawless as the honorable, brave and heroic Hector (my favorite character in ""The Iliad"" and in the film). Orlando Bloom fits well into his role of the immature, selfish and naive Paris (the anti-Legolas). Diane Kruger is beautiful and luminous (if not rather placid) as Helen. Peter O'Toole is heartwrenching as the noble yet misguided King Priam of Troy. I could go on and on. In a film filled with great actors, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger are actually the weakest link. The 'love scenes' somewhat pale in comparison to the powerful battle scenes and hand-to-hand combats. I was most impressed by Eric Bana. Hector was the one character that I truly empathized with. Finally, Eric Bana (""Black Hawk Down,"" ""The Hulk"") has been given a role where he can shine. I hope for great things for this handsome, talented and charismatic Australian actor.<br/><br/>Many films have been made on the Greek heroes and myths, and particularly the Trojan War, in the past (""Clash of the Titans,"" ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" ""Helen of Troy,"" to name a few). ""Troy"" is, by far, the best and most impressive. But instead of ""Clash of the Titans,"" you get a film that is more akin to the realism and historical feel of ""Gladiator.""<br/><br/>If you are a fan of classical mythology or enjoy epics like ""Gladiator,"" ""Braveheart"" and ""The Lord of the Rings,"" then this film is for you. It is - to date - the must-see film of 2004. And even if classical mythology seems all Greek to you, this film is well worth seeing if only for its spectacular battle scenes and pleasing ""eye candy."" GRADE: A-."

","The performances of the actors were great. The story line also was on the money. Their option to leave out all of the gods involved and to focus more on what the people did was an excellent idea. If Gladiator was a movie to remember, this has gone one step further. From opening shots to striking take down, from battle scenes to dialogs, this film captures you. You almost forget that this movie is over two hours long. Its as though you get consumed by the movie and get set in a trance. Even thought you know what is coming next, you are still surprised to see the delivery and interpretation. The main fight scene leaves you in awe. If you have not seen it yet, there is no need to wait! This is an instant classic..."

","Is it possible to do a review without a least a little spoilage?<br/><br/>This movie was so fantastic that I actually managed to shake my anal book-to-movie requirement checklist and just enjoy Troy. So what that Patroclus was not Achilles' cousin, that Briseis was nowhere near that prominent of a character, that the only god/goddess to make a cameo was Achilles' mother, Thetis, in a much smaller role than she was entitled to? Okay, so it bugged me a little bit. But the book is 3000 years old, and has been retold thousands of times in thousands of ways. If people don't get the gist of it by now, then who's to say that they ever will? It did bug me that they left out the whole story of Nestor leading Patroclus to his death. And I was a little miffed by the mispronunciation of Briseis, Menalaus, and Priam. But the discovery that Eric Bana actually CAN act well made up for it, I must say. And even though the scene with the knife was never in The Iliad, I must say that I appreciated its addition for Brad Pitt's Achilles.<br/><br/>All in all, I got past the book, which is something I can almost never do. I highly recommend this beautiful movie to anyone, and it is worth every minute of the three hours it takes. Four stars."

I wonder what would have happened if the Trojans hadn't let the Trojan horse in. I think that the Trojans would have won the war if they hadn't.

Just as it was said in the movie ""Two worlds will go to war for honor and power. Thousands will fall in pursuit of glory. And for love, a nation will burn to the ground."" and the questionable existence of the ancient God's and Goddess but look at the heart breaking scene of men killing men, and then the end of men just killing every Trojan in sight. Greeks killing womyn, children (which somehow very few were shown in this movie but imagine that there too were being killed without mercy). All those for greed of power. E.g.

"dollyhoney","10","15","26","19 May 2004"," Character review of 'Troy'-contains major spoilers
","Troy was always going to be massive, it was always predicted to storm the box offices and i believe it took over one hundred billion in it's opening weekend. But then how could it not with a host of famous actors starring in it? Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom all pull at the heart strings, and i suspect there was a great many females out to see Brad Pitt and his co-stars in skirts.<br/><br/>So did it deserve that profit?<br/><br/>The talent is undoubtedly brilliant. Brad Pitt stars as the great warrior Achilles and he makes a stunning performance of it, portraying the different emotions of the cool yet possibly disturbed warrior. He, of course, looks ideal for the part and his fighting scenes are the most impressive of the lot.<br/><br/>Eric Bana gives an equally impressive performance as Hector-Prince of Troy. He portrays Hector perfectly not only as a might warrior but as a loving husband and father, and so the scenes between him and his wife, Andromache, are the most emotional.<br/><br/>Also starring is everyone's favorite elf Orlando Bloom-or famously known 'Legolas'. Orlando plays the young Prince Paris, who ignites the war by whisking away Helen of Sparta. Orlando gives a more average performance as the boyish Paris, but the character is the reason Orlando does not perform as well as expected. His role as Paris is done as well as it could be, because whilst all Bloom-fans want him to be a great warrior, he is in fact meant to be a young and not very wise youth. The only real problem in his acting is where at the end he kills, he is basically transformed back to being Legolas with that bow, even though he's not meant to be trained at fighting.<br/><br/>Other roles worthy of mention are Brian Cox doing a great job as the greedy and merciless Agamemnon,Peter O'Toole as King Priam-exceptionally good-and Garrett Hedlund as the young beloved cousin, Patroclus, of Achilles.<br/><br/>In female roles, Saffron Burrows is easily the best portraying proud and suffering Andromache, wife of Hector. Her emotional scenes are the saddest especially as she clutches her baby son whilst she says a tearful goodbye to her husband, who is off to fight Achilles- a doomed battle.<br/><br/>Diane Kruger and Rose Byrne come together next and both are equally brilliant. Diane-pronounced 'Dionne'-portrays Queen Helen of Sparta, the wife of King Menelaus who runs away with Paris to Troy. Diane looks-of course- stunning, but her best lines are probably the first she ever says: 'before you came to Sparta i was a ghost. I walked and eat and swam in the sea. But i was just a ghost' these lines are absolutely beautiful. Rose Byrne shines as the fierce Briseis, who is captured by Achillies men after they sink the temple of Apollo. Briseis turns out to be Achilles love interest and her love shapes him in a way he has not felt before. Her last scene is another emotional one that sheds a tear and is probably the most significant- the scene where Achilles dies.<br/><br/>All in all Troy is an fantastic film full of great effects and great acting.<br/><br/>It's now one of my favorite films and i must admit-Brad Pitt tugged at my heart strings."
"golliwog-1","10","33","65","15 May 2004"," Troy is well worth seeing!
","Whilst the subject matter of this film has been around for some time and read by academics and students alike, make no mistake, this isn't Homer word for word. Having said that, Troy does stand on its own and does tell a tale of heroes long passed into myth and legend. It's not important that parts of the story were changed or even missing. This is a movie after all. Go read the poem I say to purists and critics. Visually stunning and with scenery fit to match, who couldn't fall under the captivating spell that Wolfgang Peterson has wrought. I for one will be seeing it again."
"mangotango112","9","23","43","16 June 2005"," A great movie, and occasionally moving
","I recently watched Troy, unfortunately not in theaters, and was pretty impressed. My favorite character is Achilles, and I think his scenes are among the best in the film<br/><br/>One thing I thought fell flat was the Paris/Helen romance. The pair simply didn't have the same chemistry as Achilles and Briseis. <br/><br/>Other than that I liked it a lot. The costumes were beautiful (I am absolutely dying to have Hector's wife's blue dress) and a lot of the acting was pretty good.<br/><br/>My favorite parts were anything with either Hector or Achilles & Briseis in them. Eric Bana was excellent at playing the perfect man (he is the one every woman wants to marry) and Brad Pitt simply WAS Achilles. I especially loved seeing Achilles with Breseis, his one true love (aaaaw!), because it showed another side of him. I personally think his character was very well developed, and would have liked to see more romance w/ him. But, then again, I am a hopeless romantic and tend to fall for the vulnerable bad boy, so my opinion might not be totally reliable.<br/><br/>My advice is to watch this movie as a story, not as a history book or the Iliad. It's not the Iliad, or totally accurate, but it's still a good, moving, believable story. Rent it, give it a fair chance, and don't cry too hard when Hector dies."
"inuyasha_starfb","10","28","54","25 May 2004"," An exciting movie of war where heros and legends come to life
","Troy features the battle between Troy itself and the united nations of Greece. The war is caused by one woman, helen who created a dispute between the king of Sparta and Prince of Troy, Paris. This leads to the greed for power of one man, he brother of the king of sparta. He decides to fight the war and win Troy. A hero, Hector, brother to Paris, fights the war for his father, King of Troy, Priam, bravely as a general. However, this all comes down to the main character of the movie, the legend that comes to life, Achilles, the greatest fighter ever known in history. He is partially immortal, except for one of his ankle that is his weakpoint, the only part of him capable of sustaining a mortal wound. His mother, thetis, a nymph, told him that if he goes to war, he will never return again as his glory and honor will die with him. But if he stays, he will find peace. However, born to be a fighter, Achilles sets off for the battle. He dies from an arrow shot by Paris when he was unaware for he was in the process of saving his love, Paris' cousin. (The arrow was shot at his ankle, his mortal weak point). Of course, even hector died at the rage and warth of Achilles when he actually slayed Achilles' cousin whom he thought was Achilles himself. Troy fell in the end and both the kings died. However, the name of Achilles and the other heros will always endure. The story is remarkably captured in the movie and it is a must-see show for all who are into action movies. The show is about 2 hours and 30 minutes."
"gobi102","10","28","54","23 May 2004"," excellent film
","This is the first time i have reviewed a film so... I watched Troy yesterday and i am not ashamed to say I almost felt like crying at the end. The tragedy in this film is amazing. All these people dying for the love of 2 people. Eric Bana is incredible as Hector. Brad Pitt plays Achilles equally well. The fight scene between these 2 is very tense and sad. Achilles relationship with Rose Byrnes is very poignant and the fact he dies just when he reaches her adds to the story. Orlando Bloom plays Paris effectively showing his love for Helen. the fight scene between him and Menelaus is very revealing and shows how much of a coward Paris is. even though he does try to redeem himself at the end. Diane Kruger is beautiful as Helen and i could truly believe she was the face that launched a thousand ships! overall i would give this film a 10/10."
"martinev2","8","14","24","13 May 2004"," good movie
","it's a good movie, if you can get over the fact that the original story of troy didn't happen the way it was told in the movie.And that the ten year war lasted only for a couple of weeks in the film.<br/><br/>But overall, great sets, great special effects, great battle scenes (esp. one on one) and the acting was OK to good. With the exception of orlando bloom who's always playing......... well ... orlando bloom, whether he's in pirates, lotr or troy.<br/><br/>And i didn't know that the ancient greeks spoke English with a British or an irish accent either.<br/><br/>So let me put it this way: the less you know about the original myth/ story, the more you will enjoy this film."
"popplolo_luvs_orli_bloom","10","44","90","16 May 2004"," Excellent, Truly Excellent.
","Troy is truly one of the best films I have ever seen. The casting is spot-on and the digital effects are a definite rival to the Return of the King.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's portrayal of Achilles was the best I have ever seen, filled with the arrogance and sensitivity contrast that I am looking for in 'The Illiad's Akhileus!<br/><br/>Eric Bana's nobility as Hector wiped the floor with any Oscar nominees of the last two years (Sean Penn? what is that? Johnny Depp was well better!!!) and deserves recognition for his finest work yet.<br/><br/>Though Orlando Bloom's performance is quite weak in comparison, I believe that his portrayal of Paris really captured the cowardice that is Paris. The slight arrogance of naivety and selfishness that became the doom of Troy.<br/><br/>Newcomer to film, Diane Kruger's Helen was, though very restricted, quite emotional. She seemed genuinely afraid of her husband and in love with Paris. Her line ""Every day I was with him, I wanted to walk into the ocean and drown. I don't want a hero. I want someone I can grow old with"" was one of the most emotional for me. However i found her voice incredibly annoying and hard to bare.<br/><br/>Achilles' lines are sure to be the most memorable. for example ""You will not have eyes tonight. You will not have ears or a tongue. You will wander the underworld blind, Deaf and dumb and all the dead will know; this is Hector: the fool who thought he killed Achilles."" is a line a believe i will never forget. However it was quite a wooden performance and the accent was less than perfect.<br/><br/>Appearances of such greats as Julie Christie as Thetis, Peter O'Toole as Priam and Sean Bean as Oddyseus were, however, by far the best performances and the only flaw is that there was not more to there characters. <br/><br/>I love the cast, the action, the drama and the most impressive part was DEFINITELY the Hector/Achilles fight. Though no match to my beloved Lord of the Rings, Troy is definitely ONE OF my favourite movies of the year."
"kissme_169","10","27","52","13 August 2005"," Troy is one of the BEST movies I have seen in years!!!!!!
","TROY is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. Not only do I own TROY, but every time it is on satellite I watch it. And I mean every time. LOL! TROY has something for everyone. It has action for the guys and a love story for the ladies. Troy also consists of some of the best actors and actresses of today's movies. Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom are a few to mention. Not only are these actors extremely HOTT!!!, but these talented actors really helped to make this movie. I recommend this movie to everyone (except for small children, due to some of the graphics). But overall I rate TROY a 10!!! If you have not seen it yet, you need to go rent it a.s.a.p."
"FlmingFangirl","9","27","52","11 July 2005"," ""Troy"" is one film worth watching.
","To start this off, I'd just like for everyone to keep in mind that I started watching this movie at eleven o' clock at night on HBO, despite the fact that both my parents had said it was absolutely horrendous.<br/><br/>I have ADD, and thus was confident that if my mother couldn't sit through it, I probably wouldn't be able to. But, of course, I tried it anyway, having heard both excellent and terrible reviews of it.<br/><br/>Holy crap, what a movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed nearly all of the film, and not just because of all the extremely beautiful man flesh that was being tossed around. Although that was a plus, the story was so huge and epic I couldn't help but fall madly in love with it.<br/><br/>I have heard people whine about it be historically inaccurate, to which I say this: It's the Trojan War, people. Were you there for the Trojan War? Do you know what happened? And, more importantly, do you really think that Homer was only writing history? The man took some artistic license, and if you haven't figured that out by now, you are a complete fool.<br/><br/>But enough bickering, onto the facts. I found most of the acting to be outstanding, especially Eric Bana's performance as Hector. Upon seeing him in that god-awful letdown, ""The Hulk,"" I wanted to see him redeem himself. He did an astonishing job here. He made Hector come to life with such humanity and such grace. Thank you, Eric.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was halfway decent as well as the super-beautiful demigod Achilles. Of course, he barely attempted an accent, which sort of made his character seem less real. But I think he made up for it in the long run. Achilles is one tough character to portray. His inner struggle is something only the best can pull off, and since he did ""Fight Club,"" I have considered Brad Pitt to be one of the best. He was melodramatic, but not so much in a way where he took away from the story. I applaud him.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom as Paris and Diane Kruger as Helen were the weak links in the chain. Sure, Orlie's almost as pretty as Diane, who is absolutely gorgeous. But Paris came off as a cowardly little naive girl, and Helen...I don't know what to say about her. I just didn't CARE about Helen. Kruger failed to give her the personality needed to support a character of that magnitude.<br/><br/>Everyone else was rather good, and I loved seeing Sean Bean in there. He is such a fox. Peter O' Toole was lovely as well, and the various ladies scattered about the film were very good.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a movie that kept me interested from beginning to end. I fought serious fatigue to get through it, but in the end, it was well worth while."
"miss_thang_808_lhs","10","27","52","28 May 2004"," The Movie of the Year
","I watched Troy twice and I'm gonna have to say that I haven't had enough. I'll probably watch it 2 more times. I am seriously Infatuated with this movie. And Brad Pitt is definitely the meaning of BEAUTIFUL. I love the time period the movie took us back to, the Trojan War, the era, the feeling and aura of the whole movie. I realized that I am not infatuated with Brad Pitt. But I am infatuated with Achilles and his love for Briseis.<br/><br/>There was a big commotion on how over-budgeted this movie was. Sure, it definitely was. But whatever Director Wolfgang Peterson wanted the audience to grasp thru TROY, he definitely succeeded. I feel fulfilled by the movie. No not in a sexual way. The movie fulfilled me in a deeper way that is difficult to explain in words. Its more of a inner feeling that probably only a few can share with me. I feel that the movie can tie in any theme possible if u dig deep, its definitely a timeless flick. Wolfgang Petersen is a genius. I will watch the film a couple more times just to grasp a deeper understanding on what emotions, feelings, morals, etc. my peers and I feel on the spectacular film. As I depart, I just want to state that the movie had a huge impact on me as of right now and probably years to come. I definitely think its the movie of the year. (Well, besides The Passion of Christ) As the movie stressed the honor of one's name to ring throughout the centuries, so Will TROY. Well, at least for me it will. REMEMBER TROY!<br/><br/>I long to live in the time of Achilles."
"em_babyblue20","10","11","18","30 January 2009"," my favorite one. a masterpiece
","Troy was and remains my favorite movie ever. The first time I watched Troy I was stunned. I didn't think that movie would change forever my top. I was truly impressed by the acting, the story, the fight scenes and most of all, the love story between Achilles and Briseis which deeply impressed me. All he wanted was glory, and this movie is a story of Achilles, the hero, the super man, the soldier that obey no one but himself, but at the end, his desire of immortality, of glory is left away by his love for the beautiful cousin of prince Hector and Prince Paris, Briseis. I loved also the battle scenes, especially the one between Achilles and Hector. I must say I think this movie is the best of Pitt's, and in my opinion, he deserved to win an Oscar for this movie. Also I liked Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole as actors in this movie. All I can say is ""Bravo"" to all the actors, producers, directors...etc. If you didn't see this movie, go and see it, you will be extremely surprised."
"rohangk","10","31","61","15 June 2005"," Great Movie
","If you love period movies,TROY is a treat.Brad Pitt makes u believe he is Achilles.The War sequences are beautifully shot and so are the one to one combat scenes.The combat between Hector(Bana) and Achilles is the best I have ever seen,especially cause the fight is not the usual,basic sword/spear fight,rather it is very intelligently choreographed; with unconventional fighting styles.The special effects are very convincing.The cast is perfect and everybody does justice to their character,and i don't think any other could play Achilles as good as Brad.The movie may be just under 3hrs long but is fast paced and keeps u engaged.It's a must watch for all period movie buffs."
"terrimeadows","10","31","61","11 June 2004"," Very interesting film
","It has been years since I've read Homer's epic, so some details have slipped my mind. The filmmakers do make some changes, but none that struck me as so awful it diverted my attention.<br/><br/>This film is 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Therefore, if you're going expecting to see one long bloody battle, reconsider. Much time is spent on the human relationships and the characters- thus making the audience care before someone is killed in battle.<br/><br/>THis film is for those who have read, actually understood and appreciated Homer. If this isn't you and you are one who loves bloody battles with little dialogue or character/relationship development, I suggest skipping. Otherwise, you will probably enjoy this.<br/><br/>My score 9/10"

It was not historically accurate, but it was an amazing site to behold. The fight scenes were what epics are created of. This movie grabbed me from the first line to the credits. The acting is excellent, especially Brad Pitt as Achilles and Eric Bana as Prince Hector. I hope many people watch it and talk about it for a while, I loved this movie. Orland Bloom did a good job at playing Paris. And again i can not describe how great the fight scenes were. Not only were the armies clashing a great site but the 1 on 1 fights were amazing. The 1 on 1 fights were the best battles or fight sequences of Troy. Now that you are done reading this, head over to your local theatre and GO SEE TROY, AN EPIC TO BEHOLD. TROY IS AMAZING."
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","10","31","61","25 May 2004"," An Excellent Film
","There are films with heart and there are films that are epic.  Troy folds in both those categories and much much more.   Because of bad criticism I was not looking forward to it as much as I was before.   It's fascinating to know what we expect from an epic like Troy.   Look at the list of epics we have been gifted with over the last five decades.   Ben Hur, El Cid, Spartacus, Cleopatra, Braveheart, Gladiator and now Troy.   They are pretty much the same in the way of size, as they all contain huge battles scenes with lot's of heroics and sad endings.   Troy doesn't change that and it brings something a little extra to the table to make it all the more glorious.   Gladiator fans will love this and I think it's fair to say that Troy is a lot better than Gladiator.   As soon as the opening credits pop up the whole movie starts off straight away without a moment to rest and this is how it is till the very end.<br/><br/>I have never had the pleasure to read Homer's masterwork Iliad so I wasn't comparing the movie to the book which I prefer because then for me nothing is taken away but straight away after the film finished I wanted to get my hands on the book and see what was in the film and what was taken out as it is just one of the most fascinating movies I have seen for a long time.   I never go home disappointed from the Epic's and continue to do so with Troy.  Orlando Bloom is obviously falling into the same trap as Leonard Di Caprio did with titanic because everyone just seems to hate the guy but,  is he the worst actor in the world that he is made out to be?   I'll admit he is not the best actor but surely he must be praised for the brave performance he gives as Paris.   Some parts did make me feel a bit uneasy with some cheesy dialogue but there were others where he was just fantastic.  Take the scene where he decides to fight Menaleus to win the heart of Helen.  I won't go on any further but it brings to the character of Paris and who he really is. The scene is so well acted by all concerned especially Orlando Bloom who is more than just Legolas in Lord of the Rings.   Brad Pitt is a big surprise as Achillies, Eric Bana as always is on top form and has a rising rising career ahead of him.   Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson are on top form but I don't see what the fuss is about with Peter O Toole.  No one could ever take away his performance as TE Lawrence but I was lead to believe that he was the strongest actor in  the film.  As far as history goes he is but I have seen him in better films than Troy.  Oliver Reed will always get a vote ahead of O Toole's performance.  In some scenes it was like Wolfgang Petersen shouted `Ok Peter, can you make that face now' and after making it's done it's like he shouts `Ok Pete, that's it' because his expressions during some of the battle scenes and others just don't seem convincing and very put on.  The single scene with Pitt and O Toole is very well done and extremely important but the rest is very questionable.   Deborah Unger was quite a waste of time but that's the script writer's fault for not giving her the time she so well deserved but I still expected to see more of her towards the end.   The battle scenes hit you in all the right places and has plenty of emotion to back it up and bring you to tears in some parts.  <br/><br/>
I look upon Troy with a lot to say about it but can't describe the words I am wanting to say.   It's more epic than you could have ever imagined.  The acting is first class, the music and photography are very well conceived and has quite an old fashioned feel to it.   <br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen has never made a bad film.  Das Boot is the prime example of that and along with Air Force One and The Perfect Storm that are good add on's to his collection of movies Troy will open the eyes to people who have never heard of the man and know that he is up there with the best.    Ignore what they are saying, people just can't get over the fact that this is what Hollywood do to famous scriptures and will do for many years to come.   I would feel the same if it was something that I had loved and admired for years and years but I would appreciate that someone is trying to make a film out of it the best way possible and I know there are parts in the film which don't add up to the story but we should be grateful that this does what it's supposed to do and that's wow us and keep the faith.  It deserves that much."
"roastmary-1","1","21","39","20 December 2005"," Not recommended, even for Brad Pitt fans.
","This is a dreadful film. Brad Pitt, who usually turns in a good job of acting, was completely miscast, and utterly uncomfortable and unbelievable in his role of Achilles. The screenplay was a conglomerate of war and killing, killing, killing...with a smattering of love scenes. Wolfgang Petersen did a terrible job of directing and was shameless in his constant posing and posturing of his lead actor, so much so that even though Brad Pitt is beautiful to look at, one became really bored with watching him strutting around flexing his muscles. Since that's not the type of thing this wonderful actor does, one has to lay the blame on the director.<br/><br/>Too bad, too bad. What a waste of time and money."

I think the actors do a splendid job, and I know it sounds corny, but it is a very touching film. I think Troy is just plain fun. Wiat, no, that isn't right, I think its very complicated fun. The battles are so well-put-together, you get out of breath just watching! You will find yourself completely intertwined with the characters as they push on through the movie.

"odysseus-6","1","38","77","14 May 2004"," very inaccurate, overall poor
","firstly i should say that i know the story of the Iliad and its associated plays and poems very well. i know the Iliad by homer, the aenead by Virgil, the orestia by Aeschylus etc etc. you don't need to know these stories before you see the movie. i am also a fan of gladiator even though i know it's inaccurate and it is just a remake of the fall of the roman empire. that didn't stop me enjoying that movie. <br/><br/>if i was to give troy a grade it would be 7 out of 10 for entertainment value (not as good as gladiator) and it would be 3 out of 10 for its literary and historical value. its treatment of the original stories stink just about as bad as anything i have ever seen. i wish the liberties they took had been in order to inject something greater into what remained, but everything still felt flat and never really took off. it never really ever even approached the level of a masterpiece and that is a real shame.<br/><br/>the battle scenes are without question fantastic, though there are not as many as you would expect, and the special effects are by and large seamless with the actual landscape. the music was very dull and forgettable and the camerwork was for the most part very good. <br/><br/>brad Pitt has an amazing body and i think he is an excellent actor but in troy he seemed uncomfortable in the role and that surprised and disappointed me. peter o'toole was an excellent priam and his scene with Achilles was tremendous. hector was played by Eric bana and he really surprised me. the role of hector is very close to the original, and despite the fact that hector was physically bigger in the stories, Eric bana really made up for his lack of stature. he was a wonderful hector. Paris was played by Orlando bloom and he played a coward very well indeed, he surprised me too considering. the lady playing Helen i don't remember but i didn't find her either very attractive or very good and she doesn't even appear a the end of the film, she's lost from the story completely! sean bean who i usually don't like played one of my favorite Greek characters, the wily odysseus he was okay. vigo mortensen is the prefect odysseus, but bean also surprised me. the man playing menelaus was completely miscast, but on purpose it seems, and agammemnon was good. <br/><br/>the movie starts with agammemnon at war with thessaly and Achilles fights under his flag and wins a duel with thessaely's best. this sets up that Achilles hates agammemnon who is a war monger, it's a love hate relationship true to the spirit of the original. since it's ironic considering Achilles is the best warrior and lives for battle. Achilles wins and Greece is united for the first time. this is not historically accurate, Greece was never united as such, but it will do for the movie in place of complicated explanations. <br/><br/>then we go to a peace banquet at argos which in the movie they call Sparta since it's the same place. the banquet is between king menelaus and his wife Helen and Paris representing troy with his brother hector. this is the first diviation from the original because before it was Aeneas, who was second to hector as a Trojan general and went on to found ancient Rome. but in this movie he doesn't appear except for one line at the end, and Paris doesn't even know him, odd for the cousin of king priam! <br/><br/>Paris woos Helen, hector covers for him, and when they leave, Helen is smuggled out because she doesn't love her husband. i should say here that is all wrong too. originally menelaus was called away to his grandfather's funeral on Crete, and Paris and Aeneas then looted menelaus's vaults and took women (plural) as a prize. menelaus was also young and had been chosen by Helen herself and after the Trojan war they got back together and had other adventures, but in this movie menelaus is a fat old bully. this makes the Trojans look better i suppose but it's a distortion and not a pleasing one. <br/><br/>so Agamemnon decides this is the perfect excuse to go to war to get troy for himself. however, if you have ever read Herodotus you will know that the Greeks had been undergoing many attacks for decades and the in actual fact this was the first time in history that the Greeks collectively had had enough and decided to fight back! so that is all wrong.<br/><br/>the Greeks go to troy once odysseus has convinced Achilles to fight, that was a good scene, with Achilles practicing fighting with his (now cousin) patroclus. patroclus's treatment in the film mirrors the motives in the original so it was fairly entertaining. patroclus comes with him and wants to fight but is not ready. <br/><br/>the Greeks arrive at troy and a ferocious battle takes place and a priestess is taken captive, trophy for Achilles. this is all greatly condensed but done very well and is very exciting. we meet ajax who is known as the equal of Achilles. in the original ajax after all the years of war goes mad when his friend Achilles is killed and commits suicide. in this film he barely know Achilles and is killed by hector in the first few minutes! ajax was the character with the soul but in this he's a big oaf. that disappointed me greatly but there was more to come. <br/><br/>in the original the Greeks declare that troy can save themselves if menelaus has a duel with Paris, but Paris is pressed into fighting bby hector who is furious for his brother starting this war, and Paris is a coward. in the movie it is Paris who asks for the duel, and again he acts like a coward and tries to run away halfway through. but because it is him who asked for the fight it makes the Trojans look nobel again when they're not! menelaus goes after Paris, and now hector kills him! so menelaus who for three thousand years has always got his wife back, now doesn't! this is so stupid and also forgets that it was a nervous Trojan archer called panadarus who fires out of nerves that starts the next battle. <br/><br/>the Greeks take a pounding which is very exciting and they must retreat. the Trojans breathe a sigh of relief and at dawn they attack and try to burn the ships (with bizarre flaming balls, i don't know where they got that idea from) Achilles refuses to fight for Agamemnon so patroculs wears Achilles armor into battle and hector kills him, this sends Achilles into a frenzy and the most gripping duel takes place between Achilles and hector and he drags hector's dead body around in the dirt. this part of the movie is more or less just like the original and is the best part because this is the only part of the movie that seems to work for everyone in the audience.<br/><br/>what is missing completely however is the sense of futility that occurred during the Trojan war. in the originals, every time the Greeks thought they had won, more reinforcements would arrive to help troy. amazon warrior women and the black memnon with his Ethiopian forces, but this is all completely missing. in the film instead cuts to the end of the story, priam rightly gets hector's body back from Achilles, and Achilles grants him 12 days for funeral games, but now the film does its own story again and the Greeks use this excuse to build the horse as an offering to the gods for their ruse.<br/><br/>in the original odysseus had managed to get inside troy and desecrated their temple to pallas-Athena, a horse called the pilladium. the Trojan horse was built as a fake apology to the god for their safe trip home. in the film it's an offering to Poseidon. it makes no odds, but it's annoying.<br/><br/>anyway the Greeks get in and torch the city, but Agamemnon, who in the original went home and was murdered by his wife ina fantastic play, in this film gets killed! Paris does kill Achilles with arrows, but who knows if he goes off with Helen, she disappears completely from the story.<br/><br/>with the story annoyances to one side, i did not like how the film was directed or written, many parts had very hammy dialogue and the way it was directed was very cheesy, gladiator dealt with the cheese much better than this film does. i did like the battle scenes they were excellent, but it was very obvious that many of the actors also had problems with the cheesy parts. <br/><br/>what really annoyed me the most was that movie made the war feel like it lasted about 4 days not the 10 years it's supposed to be, and i also absolutely loathe the fact that the movie came down heavily in favor of the Trojans and not the Greeks. but the originals are supposed to be about each side finding humanity in the other, in this movie it's al about finding humanity in the Trojans - who are the ones that did wrong to begin with, and finding no humanity in the Greeks. that is all wrong. period.<br/><br/>overall it was moderately entertaining, not as good as gladiator, which it was trying to be in some parts, and whatever you do if you're studying this in class don't use this film as reference. you will fail.<br/><br/>overall 5/10"
"Caps Fan","3","44","91","16 June 2004"," A terrible disappointment (some spoilers)
","Apart from his excellent turn in ""Twelve Monkeys"", I've never rated Brad Pitt as much of an actor and his reliably terrible performance in ""Troy"" bears much of the blame for this movie's weak impact. But I did hope the presence of such stalwarts as Brendan Gleeson, Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole might give us something to hang on to. The task, however, proved beyond them. <br/><br/>What we're left with is a story where the inability of one prince (Paris, played in dreadfully limp, self-righteous fashion by Orlando Bloom) to keep his hormones under control leads to an avoidable war, thousands of deaths and the destruction of a city and its culture. The rather murkily presented spectacle of a thousand ships taking to sea on a quest for revenge forms little more than background to some massive egos and the actual fall of the city is presented almost as an afterthought. The music is eminently forgettable.<br/><br/>To give what little credit is due, Peter O'Toole does turn in a strong and sympathetic performance as King Priam, while Sean Bean is credible, even interesting, in the role of Odysseus. Their efforts, however, are not enough to save the film.<br/><br/>It would have been more honest to call the movie ""Achilles"" and have done with it. If you must see this one, wait until it comes out on rental.<br/><br/>Rating: 3/10"

","I usually trust most critics when it comes to epic movies since it's not one of those genres like comedy that would be described by most of them as ""low intelligence art"". Brad Pitt was truly excellent, all actors were truly excellent. Got some points of Homer's Illiad quite well, of course it couldn't include everything and hey, they were honest to say it was 'inspired' by Homer's ""Illiad"" not even based which would be OK. And anyway I'm from Greece and here we are taught Homer from Junior high school but not in any way does a comparison with the original poem makes the movie any worse or any better. The only way actually to make a book or a poem like that into a movie is to make it a series of many, many hours.<br/><br/>Thumbs up, that was a 9/10 movie no doubt about it."
"trojanmemory","9","25","48","15 November 2004"," Not perfect, but great enough to be truly epic
","This movie is an epic adaptation of the ancient poem ""The Iliad"" by Homer. The producers changed the story about a bit (eg. the relationships of the characters) and changed the time span of the war from 10 years to a mere 16 days or so. But the end result is a fabulous movie to watch. Although the special effects are not really what I consider ""one of the world's greatest"", the camera direction is one of the best I have seen and the sound effect is entrancing. Wolfgang Petersen has carved himself a real reputation from directing this movie.<br/><br/>I will not call the overall sets and costumes colorful, as they are all mostly earth-tone colors. But they do fit in very well with the movie. The costume designs are really not bad. The costumes for the Greeks are plain, simple, nothing we have not seen before. But the costumes for the Trojans are something. Very original. Something different from the other ancient Greek or that type of genre movies.<br/><br/>Let us not forget the cast. I have watched many movies, and of all I will have to say that TROY has the best cast of all. The actors ARE the characters the play. I highly doubt that another set of cast would be able to bring these legendary characters to life like Brad Pitt and gang did.<br/><br/>The war scenes and combat are extremely well choreographed, some of the best I have seen in fact. I would rival the first war scene from TROY with the one in LOTR 3. In comparison, TROY's war scene special effects are better that LOTR's. TROY is definitely a movie worth watching again and again. So buy the DVD. I highly recommend this movie. I highly doubt that there will be another movie coming soon which will be able to match the scale and grandeur of TROY."

I was told only to see it if I wanted to see Brad Pitt's iron hard abs and pecks and then a cheek or two of his.<br/><br/>I would just like to say that they were wrong. I was completely enthralled by this film. It moves at a rapid pace and I never wanted it to end. Whoever said that the writing was bad is on crack because the screenwriter did a marvelous job. You, or at least I felt for each character. <br/><br/>SPOILER!!!!!!<br/><br/>When Erica Bana's genius Hector died I cried. I loved him so much and I don't think I've ever been as mad as I was at the time at Brad Pitt. I guess it's just the power or vengeance.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ARE OVER!!!!<br/><br/>Even from the first opening scene where we are introduced to Brian Cox's character, Aganemnon, the film was visually stunning. The camera work was brilliant and so was the direction, dialogue, and editing.<br/><br/>Before I see a movie I like to buy a large soda, specifically Coka Cola. I like staying until the credits finishes rolling, but sometimes my blatter doens't permit me. I don't think I've ever had to relieve myself as badly as I did when Troy concluded. However, I was so engrossed by the piece of art I'd just witnessed that I stayed in my seat depsite the burning sensation in my bladder. That's how amazing this film is. That's how much this film effected me. That's how great this film is. I hope to see it go down as a classic movie. Wolfgang Peterson does it again.

","Definitely much better than the insanely overrated visual effects display known as Return of the King. That is because Troy is actually about something. It is one of the best anti war films ever made. Right from the opening scenes the characters, the music, the imagery grabs you and won't let go for the whole 2 hours and 45 minutes showing the destructive and tragic nature of war. There are no sides to root for in this film and that is why it is a great and in a way original film because war is pointless and humanity's dark nature. There is no point to comparing it to Braveheart and Gladiator becuause they were completely different movies about different subject matter and did not play as anti war films. If you are going to compare Troy to Illiad in terms of Historical accuracy then you are really being an idiot becaue that was not the point of the film and Hollywood movie event as smart as this is strong rarity these days. A 10 out of 10."

"Silent_Storm","10","24","46","23 May 2004"," Best movie in years...
","Warning: Spoilers contained below!<br/><br/>Troy is one of those movies that comes along once every five or ten years, that has everything that you could want in an epic, and more. It stays remarkably true to the Iliad for historical accuracy, especially for a Hollywood film (the cameo by Aneas was great). <br/><br/>The cast, special effects, dialogue, and sets were perfect. When I heard that Bradd Pitt was playing Achilles, I'll admit that I winced a little (he's not a bad actor, but I just didn't see him as Achilles). He end up pulling the role off beautifully, though, as does every other actor in the film. Peter O'Toole's (Priam) look when the city is burning is priceless. And besides, it's got Brendan Gleeson in it! What more could you want?<br/><br/>The special effects look great, but they aren't overdone. The Trojan counterattack was one of the best special effects sequences that I have ever seen; very flashy, and very original. The fight scenes are perfect for the movie. They look about 90% realistic, with a few unbelievable actions. This actually is a plus towards painting the characters as larger-than-life heroes.<br/><br/>As far as dialogue, this is the first time in a long time that I have seen a movie with quality writing like this. Witty arguments are strewn throughout the movie, and not a one is cheesy or cliché. Major kudos to Benioff for this. IMHO, he deserves an Oscar.<br/><br/>Finally, the sets were incredible. The walls of troy really conveyed a sense of grandeur to the whole movie. The Trojan horse was also very well done. It really looked improvised by the Greeks, and yet they managed to give it a slightly sinister look.<br/><br/>I fully recommend seeing this movie before it leaves the big screen. You won't regret it. I plan on seeing it at least one more time. Ten stars out of ten."
"mircea_dragan","10","24","46","16 May 2004"," The rebirth of the epic movies
","I went to see this movie the first day it came out, but I took two days to have the impressions settled , instead of rushing in to post them into the fray without giving them a thought at all. Maybe there's a lesson to learn for many who didn't do so and now are ashamed of the heated words they uttered with heads still buzzing from the movie showing.<br/><br/>I liked this movie. It is from a genre thought long gone and dead, the epic movies, which supposedly have no place in our age of politically correctness and financial greed. This is a movie for men, and men alone, a story about brotherhood, friendship, courage, patriotism, and above all heroism (yes, that defunct concept akin to stupidity). There's no romance to appease and bring into the cinema room the middle class housewife; there are no silly/funny sidekicks to amuse and entertain the kids. Leave them at home. It's not a movie for the pacifist or for the intellectual - there are no attempts in openly preaching the ugliness of war and no convolute psychological and moral twists of kafkian or dostoievskain nature.As such, the movie is doomed not to make 'enough' money as it caters to a very thin category - and this will undoubtedly please those critics across the world which have , for a long time , tried to fit every movie in a bed of Procust and bash it if it doesn't fit one or another rigid demand.The story *is* flatly told, and some of the lines *are* ridiculous. There is some bad acting and some absurd moments.For that , I would have given the movie an solid 8.5 but I've given it a 10 to balance the 1's and 2's a bit and to reward the risks taken by ignoring all the above described marketing wisdom.<br/><br/>For I am glad that once in a while movies like this are still coming out.Movies that speak about times when a man had to guard his own with a sword and a shield and he had only the support of a handful of neighbours and friends to count upon - and he valued and cherished these men above all the pleasures and delights of life. When your enemy would stare you straight in the face and would expect no quarter - for he will give you none. A time of darkness and blood undoubtedly - but also a time of heroes. When I'll need to show my boy an *ideal* of what being a man really is about, this will be one of the movies I'll show him. And when I'll need to show him how men *really* are, I'll show him ""American Beauty"" :-)<br/><br/>*I*, as a fanatic of movies accurately depicting large scale battles, could never have enough of them. And since the '60s when the large armies of figurants began to cost too much for such movies to be produced, people like me were left waiting. It's good that the CGI tech is finally coming of age and enables us to see spectacular scenes of fighting once again (it all started again with a B movie called ""The Mummy"", if you remember...""Gladiator"" came long after that).<br/><br/>I tire of telling people not to blame the actors for the flatness and stupidity of some lines a dumb scenarist is placing in their mouth. As of late (see ""The Lord of the Rings"" ) Hollywood seems to think any 120$/h scenarist can do better in writing than Homer or Tolkien and thus it shamelessly mutilate ages-old stories at the whim of a producer who knows what ""sells best"" at the moment. Case in question , some of Brad Pitt's lines , which always begins with ""You are "" (""my best friend/the single king I am listening to/the only one I care about /the one that brought me peace/ a courageous man/ the best fighter I've fought"" and so on. Now I've seen the lines being derided all over the movie's forum, but is it Pitt's fault that the scenarist lacks, of all things , talent and imagination?<br/><br/>How about the ""sword of Troy"" moment? ""What's your name, you unimportant faceless teenager running scared in the dark?"", ""Aeneas, mylord"" , ""well, here's the future of our nation, you take good care of it , allright?"". Why bother with the sword of Troy altogether? It's textbook inacurate and useless for the movie except for the embarrassing moment that I described above (and yes, I do count Paris partially redeeming itself by running back hurt to recover it in the face of advancing Greeks). And if you do place it in, why not let Aeneas be who he really was, a minor son of the king , but a courageous participant in the siege, and indeed, the saviour of his people.<br/><br/>I went through all this because I did like Brad Pitt's acting and I feel like defending it. Achille is a larger then life character. Like Aragorn in LOTR, it's impossible to play it perfectly. But if anyone can play a Greek demigod, a culmination of beauty and power, a creature of lust and war, with the lack of sensitiveness and remorse afferent, Pitt's the man. I think he did a very good job. And he *does* look incredible , a reason more to leave the wife at home :-)<br/><br/>But the great role was Eric Bana's Hector. I was following this guy since ""Black Hawk Down"", I am glad someone had finally seen his potential - and he delivers a Hector exactly as I imagined it. If he does nothing else after this, which I hope is not the case, I'll always remember his name for this one role.<br/><br/>They wasted Sean Bean again - I thought his Boromir was worth a secondary role Oscar nomination, well, he has even less opportunity to show how good he is in this one. But for the moments he was on screen, it was*his* screen.<br/><br/>Excellent Peter O'Toole - well the guy's a legend anyway , but don't you like seeing someone who kept acting for 50 years still able to raise the bar for all the crew?<br/><br/>Also very good Brendan Gleeson and Brian Cox - the fight with Paris was one of the highlights of the movie.And while at this, they must have had one of the best individual fight choreographers this side of ""Rob Roy"" - can anyone tell me who it is? See the culmination point in Hector's duel with Achilles (and the build-up to it, Hector's farewell to his wife) - now I feel that's a classic moment that will stay in the cinema's history for years to come. <br/><br/>Helen and Paris - I thought they were the weaker spots of the movie. While I can see that Paris's inconsistent character is clearly due to a lack of understanding from the scenarist on how(or whether) a spineless, spoiled, don-juanesque prince can grow up into a leader of his people, Helen's character was consciently diminished to make apparent the director's take on the fact that the real reason for the war was political supremacy and not the beautiful princess. While consistent with the realism that Petersen tried to maintain in the movie(see the lack of gods interference, so important in the Iliad itself), I think this was a mistake. An increase in Helen's role would have not only brought more women into the cinemas, but would have given an interesting twist to the old question of how far are men willing to go for a pair of beautiful er..., eyes. <br/><br/>I have only good words for the battle scenes. If there were mistakes, I didn't see them. Highlight: the Trojan phalanx pushing the Greek one, decimated by ""the best archers in the world"" . <br/><br/>Nice music, though the mix of archaic vocalisis with Hollywood like drums and tuba seemed odd at points. Better if they would have kept only the first side of it and use the primitive drums (that work so well in the Hector and Achille's final confrontation) across all battle scenes.<br/><br/>I thought the costumes and the scenery were great, and it did fill my imaination on how protoistoric high Mediterranean civilisation cities might have looked, as architecture and dressing code. As far as I could tell, Troy was very accurately built, looking very much like in a documentary I've seen a couple of years ago (no, I don't watch the crap they put on History Channel before each historical movie to keep the hype up).<br/><br/>Overall, a good men's for men movie. Grab your beer drinkin gang and see it, leave the wife and kids at home. And if you read the professional critics opinions about it, remember that these are the same guys who criticized Spielberg's ""Jurasic Park"" for lacking the depth of ""Schindler's List"". Do not compare pears and apples, the Greeks used to say: place the movie in its category and then rank it. This one, I say , stands up very high ; indeed, up with the best of them."
"surveys-2","10","24","46","16 May 2004"," Not Your Father's Illiad
","This is a very different interpretation of the Illiad than any I've seen.<br/><br/>Gone are the meddling gods; this is a war between men. And it is fought for greed, honor, and religious fanaticism--not entirely unlike the war we're fighting today. Achilles and Hektor are no longer pawns on the chessboard of the gods, but two noble heroes fighting each other for ignoble causes. <br/><br/>This allows Achilles to finally become sympathetic to the modern audience.<br/><br/>(And as much as it makes me grind my teeth to admit it, Brad Pitt did an excellent job.) <br/><br/>It takes a lot of cajones to change the greatest masterpiece in the history of mankind, but the changes they made were, in most cases, necessary for the sensical abridgement of the story or to explain things without using the gods. In all cases, the changes were extremely respectful to the original. <br/><br/>Gone is Achilles hiding in a dress. Gone is Patrocles as the lover in exchange for Patrocles as the ward (which humanizes Achilles greatly). Gone is Briseis as mere war-trophy. She is transformed by a compelling actress and a vital role in the story. And thank Apollo, gone too is the profound injustice the Illiad does Hektor's courage. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, also gone is the most recognizable and poignant scene of the Illiad--Hektor, his son, and his helmet. It is not quite made up for by the poignant scene of Priam in Achilles' tent. But Peter O'Toole does a masterful job there at realizing the undercurrent of the real Achilles story--this is, after all, where Achilles grows up.<br/><br/>The eye-candy in this movie is extraordinary, and I'm not talking about Brad Pitt's butt. Looking at the Greek ships from the walls of Troy is a heart-stopping visual. The war scenes are wonderful. The confrontation between Achilles and Hektor is quite good. I'm not sure why the critics have chosen this movie to gripe about 'boredom' with computer generated scenes--perhaps we should blame Van Helsing. <br/><br/>Yes, there are special effects and CGI, but it doesn't lose its focus, and the sight of Troy is a beautiful one. Hektor's fighting seems mortal next to Achilles', but Achilles himself does not seem a God. It is a glorious fight scene.<br/><br/>Nothing can really be done to make Helen or Paris sympathetic, but blame Homer for that. There's also the moment when Paris is shooting arrows, and you suddenly think, ""It's Legolas!"" For that you can blame the casting director. There is also the brief, eye-roll inducing, guest-appearance of Aenaes. <br/><br/>Purists may be disappointed in this movie, but historians and general movie-goers needn't be. It is a valiant effort and a respectful ode to Homer. <br/><br/>It actually attempts to answer the question: 'What was the Trojan war _really_ about and what was really behind the Achilles hero-worship'. It offers a thoroughly banal and Hollywood answer--but it at least tries to answer the question.<br/><br/>Most significantly, this movie does the impossible for the modern audience: it makes the Illiad Achilles' story again, not Hektor's. As classics majors everywhere know, that's no mean feat."

","This stirring epic based on Homer's Illiad shows how little has changed in over 3ooo years. Men still yearn to leave their mark on the world, to gain immortality at cost to their families, their lives, and their mortal souls.  Kings and Tyrants  still send innocent souls off to fight their wars rather than fight them themselves.  And a nation of a thousand years can disappear in a day. <br/><br/>Proving that old aged addage is true; the more things change, the more they stay the same.  <br/><br/>But what has disappeared in those we tend to hail  as heroes, in general, is honor and self sacrifice; the true heroes, even in our culture, do these things and tend to become legends only shortly after they have died.

","Wolfgang Petersen has made a true match for ""Das Boot"" (1981). Give him a serious war and he will give you a serious film. This is the shortest 163 minute movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Perhaps a little short on the Iliad legend, the movie carries a lot of punch. From a film full of stars, three excel. Peter O'Toole gives Priam one of his best performances in the last 20 years -- since his Oscar nominated role in ""My Favorite Year"" (1982). His scene with Brad Pitt pleading for the body of Hector is pure power.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt as Achilles brings back memories of Kirk Douglas as another doomed hero in ""Spartacus"" (1960). Am I really comparing Brad Pitt to Kirk Douglas? Unlike the wacky Jeffrey Goines character in ""Twelve Monkeys"" (1995), this hero had to be fleshed out. I felt his disdain for Brian Cox's Agamemnon, his camaraderie with Sean Bean's tricky Odysseus, his rage with Eric Bana's Hector, and eventually his compassion and tenderness with Priam are more push than I have ever seen him give.<br/><br/>The personal hit with me was Eric Bana's Hector. This pivotal role was fleshed out in the finest heroic tradition. To my reading, Hector is the true unsung hero of the Trojan war who is overwhelmed by events and super heroes. This film makes the dedication and heroism clear. Bana does a knock down job.<br/><br/>I have singled out these few of the many stars of the film. Cheers has to be given to Wolfgang Petersen for finding the performances from so many competing egos.<br/><br/>There is a lot of combat, but nothing like Saving Private Ryan (1998). This was war fought by warriors, not soldiers. Even the weakness shown by Achilles in his revenge against Hector is restored to strength in his chivalry towards Priam.<br/><br/>There are a few bare asses, but nothing to stop the kids from seeing this harshly ""R"" rated movie. Eating a heart would have been an interesting ""R"" touch -- but omitted in this film. This is a classic movie about a classic legend.<br/><br/>I give the movie a 10 for action, story, direction and stars.<br/><br/>My only disappointment was the cinematography and effects. Perhaps it was a hard movie to film due to the logistics, but I would have hoped for more in this area.<br/><br/>  - Michael"
"sweetrupturedlight","8","28","55","28 May 2005"," Fantastic despite its obvious shortcomings
","Primed as being spectacular and a dizzying summer blockbuster, I was excited to see Troy. Not only is it the type of movie that drags me to the cinema (Epics involving love, honor, bravery and of course beautiful men...gotta love them!) but also the cast included some of the hottest talents at the moment. I was initially neither here nor there about my feelings. I knew that I liked what I had just seen, it being my kind of movie, but I felt a bit at sea as to the degree of that like. I had a lot of initial criticisms, but now I find Troy still occupied my thoughts days later.<br/><br/>The story itself is a classic, and there is no doubt that the director chose to portray that classic in a way that would appeal to audiences worldwide. <br/><br/>The cast is a more interesting focal point. Brad Pitt, having taken a break from Hollywood, had undoubtedly chosen to come back with a bang. I initially thought that Pitt was miscast; an opinion that I felt very strongly about. The more I think about it...I still think that he was, although I cannot offhand think of anyone that could have potentially done a better job  The greatest problem for me is that in order to make the character memorable (and by memorable I mean NEVER being able to see anyone else play the character better) the actor needs to embody not only the words, but the character itself, in spirit, mind and body - you've got to own the role (E.g. Viggo as Aragorn  I mean, can you picture anyone else in that role? I didn't think so...) therefore, Brad was OK. He had the body down pat, the mind...urr...perhaps...the spirit...I think he tried... He managed to pull off a role that someone else could potentially have mucked up. <br/><br/>Where he lets down in some parts, he more than made up for in others. The scenes in which he seems emotional and vulnerable were beautiful and Pitt could not have done a better job there. For those scenes alone I rate his effort highly. But will he be forever remembered as embodying the character of Achilles? Will people ever see another film of similar nature and miss him as the warrior? I think not. But others may disagree. I too am caught in the man's beauty and appeal in the film. Perhaps that makes me totally biased. However, he did portray many of Achilles's traits with conviction. There just seemed to be something missing. His scenes with Rose Bryne, Briseis, were for me, some of the best in the film. She tamed the beast, and his vulnerable side was wonderfully contrasted with the glory-seeking scared warrior. I would have enjoyed greater character development here, but then again, they were not the primary love story.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of hype about Orlando Bloom. Many hated him; others loved him. I realize that the character of Paris is a soppy, rather wimpy one. With that in mind, I say that Bloom did a good job. He was wispy and innocent enough to pull the character through the movie. I am in no way saying that he could not have done better, but the part of Paris is clearly one that has not endeared him to fans. His previous roles, most recently LoTR and Pirates of the Caribbean, the former with hardly any dialogue, and the latter in the shadow of Johnny Depp, were both adequate, especially his endeavors with LoTR. I have to also admit that he charmed me in PoTC, so I really have no real problem with him. As an actor I cannot deny that he needs growth, but he portrayed Paris as any other actor would have done. (Perhaps with a little more weird facial expressions..) Diane Kruger though...what a disappointment! She is beautiful, no doubt, but the most beautiful woman...? I think not. Saffron Burrows as Andromache was much better in the acting department, and the looks, although on closer inspection seemed a tad too gaunt) Helen seemed rather indecisive and frankly, I cannot imagine any man risking life and country for her. She lacked adequate chemistry with Orlando too. She somehow seemed older and more mature...? Being the love story everything revolved around, this disappointed. However, my romantic illusions were more than adequately resolved with the Achilles/Briseis love story. Those two had a great chemistry, and outshone the aforementioned couple by a mile. But, I also realize that to find the perfect Helen, so beautiful, so elegant... a task I would not have wanted. I suppose that Diane's beauty is debatable. Some may think her stunning; others like me think she's beautiful, but not beautiful enough (what an absurd statement) Eric Bana was superb, excellent as Hector. Not only was he brave and strong, but also he loved his country and family and portrayed all these elements with sincerity and enough emotion to touch me. He definitely delivered one of the best performances, if not the best.<br/><br/>So, with this rather useless dissertation, I say that Troy is no Gladiator, but it touched me. I felt emotion envelop me as * SPOILER * Achilles knelt over Hector's body, and that brave, fearsome, arrogant warrior was humbled and sincerely vulnerable; and indeed the death scene (beautifully done by Brad and Rose) His, ""you gave me peace in a lifetime of war"" wrapped itself around my heart. Therefore, although this movie doesn't rank among my all time favourites, the DVD will be mine. And the more times I watch it, the higher my overall rating becomes. So the 7.5 to follow may have progressed to a 8.5 by the time you read this.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"Amore_emerald","10","23","44","24 July 2005"," Amazing film, great performances, an overall great epic!
","I don't understand people who think that the movie was bad because it wasn't true to the Illiad. Here is what it said: *Inspired* by the Illiad. <br/><br/>I thought the movie was amazing. They made it deeper than just a war movie. I like that this movie actually had character development. <br/><br/>The battle scenes were done perfectly, it's worth seeing only if you want to see Achilles(Brad Pitt) fight. <br/><br/>Now for the acting: I thought Brad Pitt did an outstanding job as Achilles. It made me feel like he actually Was Achilles. He gave an outstanding performance. People think he is no good and became famous because he is good looking, no,he became famous despite that fact.<br/><br/>Another outstanding performance was given by Sean Bean. I don't know why so few even mention him. I would give him an Oscar for the role. He stole the scenes he was in. I couldn't have imagined a better Oddiseyus. I am amazed!<br/><br/>Of course we all know who the ""weakest links"" are : Orlando Bloom was just flat, he did nothing with his character and neither did the actress who played Helen.<br/><br/>I watched this movie a number of times and the more I watch it the more I get the feeling that some actors are just reciting their lines.On the other hand, the more I watch the movie the more I am amazed by Pitt,Bean. <br/><br/>Also I would like to point out the actress who played Brisseis- Rose Byrne. She did a very good job and she is very pretty.:)<br/><br/>All I know is everyone sees what they are able to see. Some only see the outside glow of this movie, well,I could only feel sorry for those. I would say that this movie is not for people under a certain age and a certain mental ability.<br/><br/>It is an amazing movie."
"bobsteimle","9","23","44","12 July 2005"," Great battle scenes with some nice acting and a good story
","This was a very realistic portrayal of an almost mythological story. Perhaps it really happened this way. All the characters were well-acted, even the sniveler Paris, played by Orlando Bloom, but especially Peter O'Toole, who is brilliant. From the first battle between Achilles and a Goliath-like giant of a man, we learn that speed and agility are more important than size and brute strength.<br/><br/>But this movie is about more than just battle scenes and violence. It's about philosophy and politics and faith. It's also about love, but not just romantic love between a man and a woman. It's about Achilles' love for his brother, whom Hector kills, and Hector's love for his brother, Paris. It's about Peter O'Toole's love for his son, Hector and his faith in his Gods. It's a little long with its big battle scenes, but otherwise this is a very good movie."
"Wallflower293","9","23","44","21 May 2004"," A successful version of an old old tale
","The reviews of this film were so mixed - especially of Brad Pit's acting - that I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this film. I need not have worried. Wolfgang Peterson's directing was superb, the action flowed fluidly and the camera work was brilliant. Reviews have suggested that the film lacked pace but I didn't find this to be true and even though the ending is well known, the unfolding tragedy was deeply moving. The acting was for the most part very good. Brad Pit made an extremely convincing Achilles and Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana were also excellent. Rose Byrne as Briseis made a good foil to Achilles and was very convincing. I was not so impressed by the other female stars and was especially disappointed in Diana Kruger as Helen. I would have preferred a little more time spent on setting up why Paris eloped with Helen. Although Orlando Bloom's Paris developed and grew as a character - Helen seemed very cardboard. The film certainly was different to the book in many ways but I think it succeeded it giving the essence of the tale."
"cloverclash","10","23","44","12 May 2004"," A gorgeously precise rendering of the most humanly flawed tale of all time.
","The Illiad being one of my favorite works of all time, I was dismayed when I originally heard about Troy.  There's no way, I thought, they could capture everything, there's no way 95% of the story will translate to screen.<br/><br/>Thank god, then, that David Benioff was not trying to rewrite the Illiad for the screen.  His goal (and his accomplishment) was far more complex: turning the myth into a history, giving us the ""real"" story of the doomed city of Troy.<br/><br/>Troy is an achievement, and while I think Wolfgang Peterson is wonderfully talented, I think what made this work was the team he made with Benioff, and the dedication of the actors.  Troy transports you.  I sat in the theatre in absolute awe of what had been accomplished, scenes I had been imagining since my childhood being played out in front of my eyes in spare yet rich detail.  There are no extraneous words or scenes in the screenplay, and the direction is deliberate and precise.<br/><br/>The breakout star here, if he wasn't already on his way, is Eric Bana, as Prince Hector, Achilles' Trojan counterpart.  His Hector is at once confident and conflicted, pure and weak of heart, soulful, passionate and unrelentingly brutal.  Bana is stripped bare, he's thrown the whole of himself into this, and his huge presence is more than just his build. He's larger than life and humble at the same time.  He's managed to take a character written as the most pure, the most self-sacrificing with the most to lose, and made him unbearably human, as flawed as the rest of them, the rest of us, but overcoming it with a minute-to-minute internal struggle that's written all over Bana's open, mobile face.  It's worth seeing again for his performance alone, and for the chemistry that he sparks with every other actor.<br/><br/>I will attempt to assuage some fears about Troy that I've been hearing since the moment rumors about the script and the casting started:<br/><br/>1. No Gods:  This is a history.  This is not a retelling.  And in the oral tradition of the time of the original telling of the story, Benioff and Peterson have made this THEIR telling.  They made the decision to take out the gods, but they did not take out the spirit of the gods, they didn't take out the faith of the times or the people.  Yes, we all loved Clash of the Titans, but Troy is years better than men in togas presiding over claymation beasts.<br/><br/>2. Brad Pitt:  A friend of mine said when the movie was announced, ""I have no ideas for casting except no Ben Affleck and no Brad Pitt.""  We were all, I think, a little shocked to hear about Brad's casting, because no matter how good he was in Seven and in 12 Monkeys, we all do just see him as his character in True Romance, right?  Rest assured, he's no Kevin Costner-in-Robin Hood.  Brad makes one of his finest turns as Achilles. Maybe not the best performance of the movie, but Brad committed himself to this role.  Spending hours researching and training , throwing himself into Achilles with a dedication I have to respect.  He does a fine job, and after the shock of actually seeing him for the first time, he blends into this new world that you suddenly find yourself believing in.<br/><br/>3. Patroclus:  The love bond between Patroclus and Achilles, sadly, has been played down I assume because of the unfortunate general public reaction to an ""action hero"" being anything other than 100% straight.  I did feel like this detracted from the story, because while those of us who know their original relationship will be able to see it there (a deft bit of screenwriting and directing, as well as some excellent acting by Garret Hedlund), viewers who don't know this story inside and out will wonder at Achilles' motivations for his final choices, as ""cousin"" just doesn't have the same ring to it as ""brother"", ""partner"", or ""lover"" (depending on how, exactly you've chosen to read their relationship in Homer's tale.<br/><br/>
Orlando Bloom has a great turn as Paris, and has possibly the hardest role in the film: making an audience feel for who is possibly the least loved character in the history of literature.  His Paris is no longer the self-centered coward of the myth, but is what's inside all of us, the desperate struggle for life and happiness, torn between what he knows is right for his world and the simple life he wants.<br/><br/>His performance and Benioff's crafting of his character is beautifully echoed in Saffron Burrows' portrayal of Andromache, Hector's wife and mother of his young son, who begs Hector to choose her, to choose life, over his love of his family and his country, his all-consuming honor.  Her honesty and her complete lack of guile is heartbreaking, and it makes her story with Hector one of the most tragic in a sea of tragedy.<br/><br/>All in all, I found Troy to be more than I possibly could have hoped for, living up to my every expectation for a story I've been dreaming about since I was nine.  It's unpretentious and raw, precise and unrelenting.  It's a beautiful rendering of love, hate, honor and fellowship, and the choices we have to make as individuals when faced with options too big for one person. Homer would be proud."

It was so bad from the opening title on, that I was actually able to leave forty minutes into the movie, and save myself somewhat. And I was denied my refund. Why does an ancient Greek king, Menelaos, speak with a Scotish accent? Why does Priam, king of Troy, prey to Rah, the Egyptian sun god? Why is Agamemnon, a great warrior, so fat? Why is Odysseus, the great mariner, the last one on the beach? This movie is bad writing, on top of bad acting, on top of bad editing, on top of bad directing. I was hoping this movie would be great, and go down as one of my favorite movies to watch. Now it tops the list as my favorite movie to protest. To the great author Homer, I can only offer an apology from me, for living in the same time period as the people who made this movie. I would have more to criticize about this film, but I couldn't take any more after the taking of the beach.

","This movie has everything. From start to finish, you laugh(not that much) you cry, you smile, and you scream. The cast was well chosen. Brad Pitt was very good playing Achillies. But Orlando Bloom disappointed me with his selfish role. My favorite character would have to be Bersais. Mostly all the war scenes had some very gory images and I would not recommend this movie to anyone younger then 13 or 14 depending on there macheraty level. I have watched this movie 3 times since I have owned it and I still bawl my eyes out. The first I watch was 4 months ago. I was half asleep so I misted quite a bit. But a month later I watched it with a friend and we both loved it. A great movie to rent or buy. Filled with lots of emotion, and romance that makes this movie really great. The last time I watched this movie was 2 days ago and I cried more then ever. When you look at this movie, you think ' Oh it is just going to be one of those epic war movies with no story' But the movie is filled with a remarkable story. See this movie if you haven't already. And if you have and you didn't like it, watch again( maybe you missed something). And if you have seen it and love, watch it again just for fun, or invite a friend along.<br/><br/>I list this movie as "" The best of its kind"""
"Sparrowmaniac","10","22","42","19 June 2005"," Best War Movie For a Long time
","WHAT A GREAT MOVIE. Absolutely mind blowing. I went to watch this movie at the theater, and what a movie. Stupendous acting. Finally after a long time, Bradd Pitt proves his worth as an actor. Also Eric Bana is superb. Totally mind blowing.<br/><br/>The story is well written, although there are a few goof ups, (like Menelaus, who never actually dies in the entire Trojan war is killed even before it starts, also, Agamemnon, is not killed according to Homer, Helen who supposedly goes back to Menelaus after the end of the war, flees from the Greeks, and the best of the lot, Paris, the prince of Troy who supposedly was to be brutally killed by the Greeks manages to escape through a secret tunnel), but all these goof ups can be overlooked, after watching the movie. The epic battle, the love for one's country, the love for a family member, the love for a brother. Everyhing is so amazingly depicted, it is hard to ignore it. An amazing amazing story, which will surely move your heart. The scene where Hector takes his father's blessing before going out to battle with Achilles, knowing fully well, only death awaits him, is mind blowing. Also, extra ordinary, is the sequence where Achilles' nephew gets killed by Hector, and his men are shocked into learning that he killed a child. And Lastly, the scene where old King Priam begs for Hector's body before Achilles, will surely make your eyes moist. Troy, is indeed a classic, and'm truly surprised that its rating is so low. With such amazing screenplay, mind blowing action, and soothing music, Troy has all the qualities of making a classic, it is very unfortunate that it is so lowly rated.<br/><br/>I give it a full 10/10...."
"maoche","10","22","42","22 May 2004"," One of the best movies in recent memory
","Troy was an amazingly entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The visual presentation, from camera direction to costume, was impeccable. The director and choreographers may have created the most visually impressive fight scenes with what they did with Achilles. The entire audience was awed almost the entire time Brad Pitt was fighting or leading soldiers. The iconic poses he hits during battle are going to be memorable to film. The epic battle scenes, the type that infects all of these movies, were thankfully kept to a minimum. Even though, the director was able to convey the sense that this was the biggest war ever waged to that point.<br/><br/>All of the casting was perfect, and each cast member played their part as if they knew this. Each part was captured perfectly and acted as best they could be; I struggle to think of one role that could have been done better by another actor. I especially enjoyed how the writer made it clear that the romance between Helen and Paris was actually secondary to the real story: that of power hungry kings and glory hungry warlords, the men of wisdom caught between them, and the inevitable doom all men face.<br/><br/>The retelling of the story was the best aspect of the film. The writer really amplified all of the tragic and ironic events of The Illiad, making you really care about the fate of Hector, Achilles, and Troy, and did so with perfect pacing. I was never bored, and I never thought a scene dragged on for too long. The retelling was also honestly believable and at the same time really sad: In the end none of it accounted for anything. Achilles' only gift was his curse, dying the moment he was finally liberated from his role as a warrior. Hector died for nothing, save the pride of a doomed nation. Paris lives for nothing. Troy falls for nothing.<br/><br/>I am forced to give this movie 10 out of 10."

","This movie is a masterpiece! The part of history details is not really high. This is the reason why this movie isn't really made for people with a huge historical interest. However you will be part of the old time if you watch this movie. Huge battles, kings and generals and of course soldiers as well. Achilles is one of those. This character is played by Brad Pitt. From the first scene with this extraordinarily man you want to follow him into every fight. The scenes from every fight are perfectly shot. They underline the epic picture of this ultimate warrior Achilles and how strong and skillful his fighting techniques are. The performance of the actors is also really good. Not only Brat Pitt plays really well.The movie is just very authentic. After a huge battle, many dead soldiers, big sorrow and a love story, this movie come to the final. Achilles has to decide - follow the love or endless glory."
"Jessimaca","10","21","40","9 June 2004"," Troy was one of the most devastating battles fought in history.
","Troy is an interesting movie because it focuses on the battle of Troy, rather than the emotional story behind it. One would most likely opt to represent the emotional story but then, one would opt for the epic motion picture as well. <br/><br/>And so the makers of this movie have chosen to go down that path of making this a huge movie. And in concentrating the majority of the movie on the war, rather than the emotion has caused this movie to lag.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this movie is bad. I recommend it to those people who are interested in Ancient Greek History... or seeing Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean in a skirt. It's great for entertainment, but the audience gets no satisfaction out of it and wonder what went wrong and why it feels like something was missing in the film.<br/><br/>One thing that failed in this movie was the chemistry between Helen (Diane Kruger) and Paris (Orlando Bloom). The actors were unable to persuade the audience to sympathies with them because their relationship was not emphasised enough. I do not blame the actors for this. It wasn't their fault. There is only so much two actors can cram into not even 20 minutes of screen time together.<br/><br/>Aside from Hector and Achilles, the story did not build up enough character for the audience to fully empathise with the other characters. Diane Kruger is beautiful, I'll give her that. And I felt sorry for Helen when she was crying to Hector because she felt it was her fault that this war started. But other than that, her character failed.<br/><br/>And it is not entirely her fault. The movie was unforgiving to the rest of the characters because it chose to show the battles other than the emotion of the story. Diane Kruger did the best she could in the small amount of time she had to represent a portrayal of Helen of Argos/Sparta/Troy <br/><br/>Did anyone else think that the beginning of this movie went awfully fast? It was almost like the direction of the film said ""Stuff the emotion, we want the battle!"". <br/><br/>I agree with the fact that Troy is said to be one of the most devastating battles fought in the history of the world but is it worth sacrificing the emotional story for it? <br/><br/>As for the story telling, it confuses audiences. Achilles (Brad Pitt) is not someone you would admire for being a hero. He is a legend and a hero to some extent. But he did not fight for anyone. He only fought for his own glory. The audience is following the story on the side of Achilles (or the rest of the mainland Greeks) Which the audience finds troubling. Because the audience usually sees the side of the story on a ""good vs evil"" side or a ""hero vs villain"" side. Achilles was not a villain but the audience feels he is when he kills Hector and drags his body back to the camp. And of course, the film makers try to get the audience to empathise with Achilles when he cries over Hector's body. <br/><br/>On the other hand, before Hector dies, he is the hero. He's the noble one to the audience. He fights for Troy. He sacrifices himself for Troy. And the audience finds that admirable. He is the ""Good"" in this story. But us, as the audience, are seeing the story on the side of Achilles. It is slightly frustrating in this way because the audience wants to follow Hector who is the other protagonist in this story.<br/><br/>I also want to mention the performance of Sean Bean (Odysseus) who is best known for his role as Boromir in the Lord of the Rings. If Sean Bean got more lines or more screen time, it would have been excellent. For someone who is so underrated as Sean Bean and for someone who got not nearly enough the screen time he deserved, he did a fantastic job.<br/><br/>If the movie balanced the emotion with the battles, it would have been fantastic. It is still a good, watchable movie if you have nothing to do one Saturday arvo, highly recommended."

","This movie suffers somewhat from negative publicity. Before it even hit the cinemas critics were writing it off. Never one to accept the critics views at face value, I went along to the cinema to check it out for myself. I have to say I found in thoroughly entertaining. It makes Homer's epic poem very accessible and fulfills the role of great escapist cinema very well. Brad Pitt is perfectly cast as Achilles and there are also memorable performances from Brendan Gleeson and Peter O Toole. Orlando Bloom and Eric Banna let the movie down slightly. I can just never take Orlando Bloom seriously. He'll never play anything other than romantic leads. The battle scenes are particularly powerful and some of the cinematography is quite breathtaking. Especially the thousand Greek ships sailing for Troy to bring back Helen. When it was released on DVD I bought it immediately.So don't be dissuaded by the critics, this movie is well worth renting at least."

"jditlev","Null","34","70","2 June 2004"," terrible script
","The main thing that's wrong with this epic is the script. Compare this piece of Hollywood formulaism to a REAL epic, like Lawrence of Arabia, and all you can do is say, 'yuck!' <br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>The love story between Achilleus and Briseias should never have been there, but that's not the worst. The worst is that the movie just plays like any other formula action movie you could imagine, instead of using the great potential in the classic story at hand.<br/><br/>And some things are just plain ridiculous. Why in the midst of a brutal battle does everyone stop to look at Achilleus (really Patroklos) and Hektor fighting? In a battle your LIFE is supposed to be at stake!<br/><br/>And why is Achilleus, the cynical warrior, so very, very, very upset that his cousin Patroklos is killed? Isn't he used to people being killed around him? And why is he so upset at Hektor for killing him? Isn't war about killing people? Have I got it wrong? And Hektor apologizes to Achilleus because he killed Patroklos, and says he only did it because he thought it was Achilleus. BUT... does any man stop in the middle of brutal combat and choose who to fight or kill? Isn't that kind of fighting ABOUT killing as many as possible and hopefully surviving yourself?<br/><br/>Another thing; thousands of men die during the battles, presumably, but does each an every one of them get a kings burial with a lot of burning wood etc.? It seems like each time a main character dies he gets the gloriest of gloriest of funerals, even if he's not remotely royal. The soldiers really must spend a lot of their daytime collecting wood for those burials.<br/><br/>The actors try their best, but most do not come wholly unbruised away from this thing; they are let down by a terrible script and surprisingly unsure direction, especially in the early scenes in the film. Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean do really well throughout, though.<br/><br/>Disappointing all in all, especially with the story at hand. The music is terrible, too. I cannot understand why so many people like this film so much. Are these the same people who liked Pearl Harbour and The Last Samurai? P*** with bubbles is NOT champagne!"

","I hesitantly went to see this movie because I couldn't find anything else worth seeing right now, and my husband likes action/adventure movies. Having watched most of ""Helen of Troy"" last October on USA network, I must admit that I feared seeing a regurgitation of a storyline I'd already seen and couldn't believe the playtime of nearly three hours, but I went anyway.<br/><br/>If I had to sum up my review for this movie in a single word, it would be `Wow!' I predict that both Brad Pitt and Eric Bana will be nominated for Oscars next year for this movie, and it will win the Oscar for Best Costumes and Best Picture. I also believe that history will write this epic movie on the scale of ""Gone With The Wind,"" ""Cleopatra,"" ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Titanic."" The only thing that will hurt the `classic' status of this movie is the R rating; though in hindsight, I can't help but think they were aiming for a PG-13 and just missed.<br/><br/>After watching some of the promo interviews, I was kind of nauseated by Brad Pitt's disgust over the fact that the interviewer wanted to talk more about his physique rather than his role in the movie. The phrase `don't hate me because I'm beautiful' just kept popping up in my mind. But after seeing the film, I must say that I believe that this film will be the defining performance of his career. The only performer that `wowed' me more was Eric Bana who played Hector, and I have to give an honorable mention for Peter O'Toole as well. The stunts, the costumes, the settings, the screenplay, the cinematography, the casting (with one exception noted below), and the performances were nearly flawless.<br/><br/>One other group that may be disappointed in this film is the one going to see blood fly and body parts severed. This movie makes Gladiator look pale in comparison, with the exception that the focus is on a well-planned plot and not on showing as much bleeding and carnage as possible. It does have many grand fight scenes and blood *is* shed, but the focus is on plot-necessity, not gratuitous gore. I count this a plus, but I know some will not appreciate this omission. I followed one viewer out of the film whose immediate response was, `That movie was so boring, but I'm sure it will win a lot of awards.' My guess is that she would fall in this aforementioned group of viewers.<br/><br/>I am having a hard time coming up with criticism for this film, though I did find a couple of points. The movie is merely `inspired' by the original poem, `The Iliad.' While I think the `rewrites' are clever and add to the plot of the movie, I'm sure that history buffs will be annoyed by the introduction of `facts, not in evidence.' Also, whomever hired the *very* brightly blue-eyed son of Hector ought to be taken out and shot. Both Hector and his wife have *very* brown eyes, and this baby is much too large to be passed off as a newborn. The kid's cute, but the least they could have done was change the eye color in post-production. If I were Hector, I'd be wondering, `Who's the daddy?' because it definitely couldn't have been him. There's even a greater than 80% chance that the mom isn't his either, if you follow the genetic probabilities.<br/><br/>Historically, I've not been a huge Brad Pitt fan, but I must say that this film is now in my Top-10 list of all time. And, believe it or not, I left wishing they had *added* five minutes to the movie to solidify the fate of one of the main characters but understand that the focus of the movie wouldn't allow for this clarification."

","Spoiler!!<br/><br/>  The best movie so far for 2004.  Well acted with a strong cast, no one is weak in their role.  This will be Brad Pitt's break through role.  Finally a leading role, instead of a smaller role to display his talents; another Heston.  The director keeps a great pace between the action, personalities, and the film's development.  Fast, yet not to fast, like many video game style movie, where the viewer can absorb the movie.  The fight between Hector and Achilles is a present day classic, that will be copied and remembered for years.  The script shows the actions and characters as human who thought and believed before Christian time.  3 d characters who were both bad and good, this is not a good guys and bad guys script more like a reality investigation.  I am sure with time, and filming some parts were wrong or shorten, but I gained a better understanding of classic history. Thank you Wolfgang!  I wish you the best, and keep making these believable portrayals, instead of bombarding the viewer with politically correct agenda. 10/10"
"george-kakaletris","3","25","50","19 June 2007"," Beware of Hollywood bearing Greek skits.
","I read in some of the reviews, within this site, of how historically balanced and/or accurate Troy is. In what alternate reality or universe would that be in? This movie is historically and geographically inaccurate from the get go. If you visit Sparta and then visit the ancient areas of Menelaos or Agamemnon, you will realize that the nearest beach is about 30 miles away, not port cities as the opening of the movie portrays. Second, if you should read the Iliad you would see that: A) Menelaos does not die, but in fact is reunited with Helen and both go back to Sparta. B) There were two characters named Ajax, and they did not die on the beach. C) The war lasted 10 years, not a few weeks as portrayed in the movie. D) Achilles and Petrocles were lovers, not cousins.<br/><br/>I could go on, but what is the use. Hollywood did it once again, deciding to take what is already a great epic, with great characters and great plots and twist them into a mindless spectacle (as they Did with ""Alexander"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"").<br/><br/>I also find it old and irritating that the same character actors who portray Barbarians, or other medieval warriors, are here portraying Greeks. Are there not enough actors, or make up artists, to make actors look and sound like the characters they are supposed to be portraying? Must English (or for that matter, Irish or American) actors sound English? Even on the shores of Troy and in the palaces of Peloponneso?<br/><br/>If you read any review that tells you this movie is in any way faithful or close to or has only slight variances to the real Iliad, please inform them to either take a Western Humanities I college course, or to pick up a copy of the Iliad and read it before they go on to make such blatantly incredible statements. <br/><br/>The irony is, that the director could have stuck with the original poem as story line, and it would have been more interesting in suspense, character development, drama and alike, than the movie they made.<br/><br/>But why do that, the Iliad has only been around for approximately 2800 years, where as Hollywood has been around for approximately 100 years. Of course the latter would know better what the former was trying to articulate and do it so much better.<br/><br/>As far as the acting, Pitt and Bana are excellent, and the movie oscillates in drama and action between these two. Bloom does not convince me of anything in the movie, let alone a Lover and stealer of other men's' women. This is where the idea of Helen, being given to him as a prize for naming a most beautiful Goddess, would come in handy, for Bloom does not have what it takes to steal another man's wife. His best acting came when he had to portray the real Paris, as sniveling, kneeling coward begging for his life. Peter O'Toole is a great actor, one of my favorites, but this movie was not for him.<br/><br/>Final assessment: some great acting by a few, the cut and paste warriors is old, the scenery is magnificent, the history is laughable, and finally, when will Hollywood even attempt to get something right?"

"puhr-1","8","16","30","7 February 2005"," Troy and Pitt -- a fortunate combination
","Short and sweet -- I have not been a Brad Pitt fan before, and I still find it painful to listen to him speak extemporaneously. It is the usual wearisome, monosyllabic new-speak one has become accustomed to with his entire generation.<br/><br/>So, perhaps it was simply a genius of casting that brought him into the role of Achilles in this movie, but however it was done, it was inspired. Whatever ability this actor has to convey and project the power of the Achilles personality was used here, forcefully, believably, and in the most visceral way I can imagine -- convincingly, but with subtlety.<br/><br/>In the Pitt interpretation, Achilles is a lion -- almost superhuman. He's one of an uber-menschen class who rise innately at the opportunity to be part of an event that will make their names resound throughout eternity. But do not mistake this for some overly-directed, ""Charlton Hestonesque"", one-dimensional performance. Far from it.<br/><br/>Pitt is keen and as fresh as the ocean spray he speeds through to be certain that he and his men are the first to burst upon the the shores of Troy, to capture the glory in taking the Temple of Apollo, long before bloated, jaded King Agamemnon and his 50,000 plunderers can get there.<br/><br/>See Pitt's confusion and revulsion when King Priam appears in his tent. The sheer inability and unwillingness to countenance that singular human moment, finally submerged in respect for the old king and the son whom he killed. That alone was the equal of anything Brando ever did, and that is very, very good.<br/><br/>Yes, Brad may well look back on this as being the movie that had him most-favorably cast, for there are few stories of any real interest that could focus on a persona like his. This one is it. It's all about Achilles. And it's quite well done, making you wonder if Brad Pitt doesn't have tremendous potential after all, even after you doubted it for years.<br/><br/>Well, yes, Diane Kruger will render you speechless with her indescribable beauty. In another coup of casting, she is indeed a face that could ""launch a thousand ships"". Her beauty recalls that of Sophia Loren forty years ago, and that is magnificent.<br/><br/>I didn't speak of Orlando Bloom as Paris. If you know Homer's story you know the rest. Believe it or not, there was a time when this was required reading in high school. It's somehow poetic justice to see ""Legolas"" with the Paris mission, so, I will say no more. Actually, they say Orlando has gotten quite good with a bow and arrow. ""Why doesn't that surprise me?"" <br/><br/>I didn't even want to rent this move, but did so because my wife wanted to see it. Bummer, but one does what one perceives keeps the peace. Now I'll very likely buy the movie. All in all, it's that good, although they did leave out one of the most compelling characters in the whole saga -- that of Cassandra, the prophetess.<br/><br/>Pitt was so very good, though, they probably could have dressed him up in drag and had him play that part, too. If you like Pitt, or just wondered what it would be like to see him, just once, in something that didn't suck like an industrial-strength vacuum cleaner, then see ""Troy"". His magnificence in the role of Achilles cannot be denied. I am trying to think if I've seen one better...."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","19","37","5 July 2005"," Flawed in many ways but yet perfectly entertaining to watch.
","""Troy"" is a movie that will not live long on in the memory. There are several problems with the movie but yet it serves its purpose well; to bring some popcorn-entertainment.<br/><br/>First problem I had with the movie was the story. This version of the famous the Iliad is extremely Hollywood-ized, including a typical Hollywood like love-story. The 'villains' are also stereotypical, which brings me to another problem, who was actually supposed to be the main hero and villain? Brad Pitt's character Achilles is way too arrogant to sympathies for and Eric Bana's role is too small and uninteresting to regard him as the big hero. The story never picks sides, so with as a result that the movie is almost like a documentary like observation. Only problem is that it is not very good documentary material. They simply took too many liberties with the story for my taste.<br/><br/>But seriously, this doesn't take away that this movie is entertaining to watch. OK the movie is not really epic in terms of the battles or story but the man-against-man fights are well choreographed and spectacular to watch. Most certainly the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with some big names in both small and large roles. Brian Cox is unfortunately a bit overacting at times and Diane Kruger is not perfect enough to play Helen. Helen is supposed to be the most beautiful woman to have ever lived, I agree with Wolgang Petersen on this one, the Helen character should have never been showed in the movie, no actress can meet the expectation of all the people in the audience in terms of beauty. Best actor of the movie for me was Peter O'Toole. It was nice to see him in a big production again and the same goes for Julian Glover.<br/><br/>But why oh why did they ever rejected Gabriel Yared's musical score? James Horner's score is mostly unfitting at times and once again sounds too much like most of his other work.<br/><br/>The movie is simply at times a too much of an epic-wannabee. It never succeeds in creating an epic feeling, or any really memorable sequences. I think we can conclude that Wolfgang Petersen was simply not the right man to direct this movie. Still it's way too harsh to call the movie a disappointment or failure.<br/><br/>Expect to be entertained and maybe impressed at times but don't expect to be blown away by it.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

The plot was never dull, however, none of the plot lines were cheap and the acting was entertaining (I especially liked Peter O'Toole and Eric Bana.) The last ten minutes of the film, as well as the scene where Achilles (Brad Pitt) killed Hector (Eric Bana) reached the quality of Braveheart, but the other scenes were not cliché either, and I especially liked the depths of Achilles' character.

"phubbs","8","5","7","29 April 2014"," Troy
","Homer's The Iliad is the basis of this film and whether or not the actual Trojan War took place this film actually does the story/fable/myth great justice with its glorious lavish looks. For me the mystery behind this ancient Greek plot is all the more intriguing and boosts my favour for the film. From what I see and have read Petersen's film is quite accurate to what we know of the event, everything seems to play out as it should and there doesn't appear to be much Hollywood tomfoolery going on with the details, well not too much.<br/><br/>One Slight argument could be raised about a minor detail, Achilles relationship to Patroclus is not known for sure, where as here they are cousins. As for some other bigger issues...King Agamemnon wasn't killed in Troy but returned to Greece, Paris did actually die in Troy during the war and Helen of Troy was suppose to have been taken back to Sparta. So a little artistic license used it seems but not too bad, why it was done that way I don't know.<br/><br/>As for the film...well it looks gorgeous, the location work really sets this up beautifully as everything looks a soft sandy golden colour against the piercing blue Aegean Sea although not actually filmed against the Aegean Sea. The Walls of Troy are powerful and impressive looking as the Greeks attack them throughout, the battles are huge with vast channels of warriors facing off against the city walls and each other, some excellent battle sequences I assure you. The scope of the battles is probably the best aspect of the film really, a lot of historical films have good battles in them these days but you really get a sense of size here plus its all in broad daylight so its gotta look sharp.<br/><br/>The visuals, the costumes (LOVE that dark coloured Myrmidon armour, very striking, very cool), the sets and the battles can't be faulted but unfortunately one thing lets all this down badly and that's the casting. Pretty much every member of the cast is a bad choice and doesn't fit the bill at all, harsh but true. Brian Cox as Agamemnon is far too much of a villain in the film and hams it up atrociously...you'd think he was in the next ''Die Hard' flick! Gleeson looks the part but his Irishness keeps coming through, he's in the wrong time period and army. Pitt simply can't act too well I'm afraid, always his major downfall, plus he looks too buff and pretty for the part really which takes away any sense of realism. Yep Pitt looks too good, too super heroic for his own good.<br/><br/>Bana really puts in a poor show here for some reason, I just didn't feel the power he should have, the emotion just wasn't there plus his Aussie accent kept creeping in. The same for Bean with his Yorkshire accent which isn't covered at all!! so you have King Odysseus with a Sheffield South Yorkshire accent for Christ's sake! Then you have the very weak talented Bloom who somehow manages to keep getting cast in big films, yes he looks perfect for this role but he simply can't handle the weight of this type of epic film. Lastly we have the mighty Peter O' Toole who again like other cast members just doesn't seem to have the power or weight needed for the role, he came across as tired and almost reluctant to embrace the role, a stunning actor for sure but he didn't seem right here.<br/><br/>Its a damn fine film to take on Homers ancient poem but I just wish Petersen had used a cast that wasn't simply chosen for their big name status at the time. I would of thought he had more sense than that and as a result he lets down this film which could of been truly epic in every aspect. Its definitely a visually spectacular war movie that's for sure, very pretty looking ancient battle porn, but methinks that's all it really is.<br/><br/>8/10"

But then, I discovered the Blue-ray which added 30 extra minutes giving me closure on the issue once and for all. If someone said to you, choose a side: The Greeks or the Trojans? Then it becomes a personal war because you study closely what your choice is doing and why. Lots of lessons here for runaway egos, pride and smugness and in the end we all get what we deserve. The battle scenes here come across as very realistic and make no mistake. You fight until you cannot fight anymore. There is no yelling for a medic at the top of your lungs. Also note that the swinging of a sword tires one out more than you would think making even the most brutal warriors vulnerable after a short time.

The scene where Achilles cried while he was wrapping the body of Hector or even the many scenes with Paresia fits well in a historical war movie. I love the fact that Achilles is shown sometimes as bad and others as good; this makes the audience in a more objective attitude toward all the characters.<br/><br/>The words and citations chosen are good enough, they didn't exceed citation from the Iliad nor removed a lot of citations, they have chosen enough citation to affect us and leave an impact in us without making a pure boring historical movie.

That is because there are many deep scenes and stuff to be learned behind each act; starting from the fact that GODS (religion) are not be followed in a blind way, to the fact that love is a Healer-Feeling but also is the origin of many problem, finally to the fact that we are all humans; brothers and sisters; we all make mistakes then ask for mercy!

","I can't entirely hate this film because Julie Christie was in it.<br/><br/>This film really does deserve the criticism directed at it. Brad Pitt is as wooden as the horse itself. My friend and I were discussing how much difference it would have made if they had swapped him for the David Beckham gladiator in the British Pepsi adverts, they performed roughly the same. The supporting cast are not so bad, well maybe they are but they are not on screen for so long but almost all of the major characters are woefully two-dimensional. This allowed for no atmosphere and a forced sense of drama that you had to prod yourself into staying focused to and thus plodding along to a conclusion. What several people said on here about unbelievable characters is certainly true. It would appear that a few mis-castings took place. Certainly Brad Pitt was, he simply is too 'Hollywood' to carry off an epic role. On the other hand, Eric Bana is competent and Orlando Bloom carries Paris off well enough (even if Helen and Paris have no on screen chemistry) but both contributed to an overall underwhelming feeling. You know this when the first 35 minutes have felt like 2 hours.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are impressive as are all of the sets and infrastructure of the film but again this is nothing that hasn't been done in a bigger and better fashion by LOTR already. The film picks up into the final hour when the horse arrives and the final battle inside of Troy kept me focused and redeemed the previous 90 minutes to some extent. <br/><br/>Then the ending went and blew it all... I have laughed at how people have stated that the film is 'loosely' based on The Iliad. They want to try and have respect for the magnitude and endurance of the tale before being so dismissive. The ending is appalling.<br/><br/>Suprisingly, the eight o'clock showing of this was only about 25% full. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, far from it and I'm not necessarily right but it was a missed opportunity. Size is not everything and from the hype of the past few weeks, empty vessels clearly do make the loudest noise. 3/10."
"TOMASBBloodhound","9","15","28","7 August 2005"," Better than expected. Much better.
","You'd think this film was another Ishtar if you'd paid attention to some of the critics when it came out. Troy is a modern-day epic loosely based on the poem of Homer written centuries ago. We see what happens when young prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) seduces and steals away with another king's wife and takes her back to the heavily fortified city of record. All the kingdoms of Greece align and attack the city with everything they've got. The result is one hell of an entertaining film.<br/><br/>I am not well versed in ancient Greek history or mythology. Apparently this film differs greatly from Homer's poem, but since I am only vaguely familiar with the story, that was not a problem for me. Much of the mythology surrounding the story was dropped to make it look like a historically plausible picture. We are left with a story about warlords who pray to Greek gods, but are very much mortal.<br/><br/>The film has large cast made up of great actors (O'Toole, Cox, Bean) and people who are just nice to look at (Pitt, Bloom, Kruger). The script has some cheesy lines, but most of the actors give as much dignity as they can to them. Apparently this film was a very negative experience for O'Toole who was reportedly so unhappy with director Wofgang Petersen, that he refused to see the final product. That's unfortunate, since O'Toole gives the film's best performance. Brad Pitt plays a brooding and vengeful Achillies. His acting skills aren't quite right for this part, but any women in the audience are sure to be impressed by his physique. It took him nearly six months to attain those muscles, and the results are impressive for any man his age.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are brutal and exciting. There are some characters in this film that can whip some butt. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt have a fun, but too brief one on one match at one point. The large-scale archery effect is getting a little old. We've already seen it in Braveheart, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings movies, so the spectacle isn't as awesome this time. Most of the effects are computer generated, but look good enough.<br/><br/>The film is a little long, but it won't cause you to daydream. The film had ridiculously high budget ($185,000,000), and it failed to make that money back in theaters. DVD sales and rentals over the years may yet make it a profitable venture. Heck, even Waterworld has about broken even after all these years of being on the market for home ownership.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an exciting story with tremendous production values, then Troy is right for you. I consider it to be a superior film to Gladiator, and that one snuck away with an Oscar.<br/><br/>9 of 10 stars. The Hound has spoken."

I found myself cheering for Hector when he fights Achilles and was sad when he died. Many reviews did not like Brad Pitt's performance because he didn't let you get into his character. However if you know anything about the book you will realize that Achilles is just a tough, egotistical man and Brad Pitt portrayed that very well. Eric Bana was outstanding as Hector and I liked his character the best, and I liked how the director showed the struggle with him debating whether to fight Achilles or not. I'm not a huge Orlando Bloom fan but he portrayed a very good coward in the character of Paris. They picked the perfect woman to play Helen because hey, isn't Helen supposed to be extremely hot. Last but not least Brian Cox does a phenomenal job as Agamemnon. Brian Cox plays every bad guy in his movies to perfection.<br/><br/>Action-10/10-This movie had many great action sequences. I loved the beginning when Brad Pitt does his little jump and stabs the 7 foot tall guy. Another great action scene is where Achilles' men take the beach of Troy with 50 men. And how can you forget the Achilles vs. Hector battle. In my opinion this is the 3rd greatest action scene ever made, next to the Obi-Wan and Anakin lightsabre dual and the The Phantom Menace lightsabre dual.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is a classic.

He was a veteran surrounded by amateurs. And that Krueger-chick is a lame travesty for a Helen of Troy.<br/><br/>2. The plot - I will not tell the story considering those who haven't seen the movie, but one thing just must be said - IT IS NOT HOW THE LEGEND GOES. Peterson changed it all, he made the story average and DRY. He took away that little something, that not only makes the story epic but also intriguing. <br/><br/>3. Gods - WHERE ARE THEY? If the movie was based on a true story (that probably happened some thousand years ago) no gods would be needed, but it is based on a Homer's epic poem where gods were the ones who carried the story. THEY WERE THE REASON TO EVERYTHING and played a very big part in the development of the war and people. Without them the story became so dry it was painful to watch. <br/><br/>Yeah, it was painful to watch, what Peterson did to the story, and that people actually like it. It ruined Brad Pitt for me, before I even got to now his movies better :(<br/><br/>And even if we drop Homer and legends and all this, the movie - the movie itself (acting, casting, war scenes, lines...) is bad. It's just a bad movie. Pitt is stale and woodsy, Krueger's only plus is that she's young and Bloom is none. <br/><br/>If you want an entertainment antique saga which is both entertaining and faithful watch Homer Simpsons ""Odessy"" (with Agness Skinner as Helen of Troy :)"
"The Overdrama","6","29","61","9 January 2005"," It's not often that a big-screen epic is not as good as it's TV counterpart
","I hate to say it, but TV's recent ""Helen of Troy"" was a better portrayal of the Trojan War, recounting it far more accurately (though not totally correct, of course).<br/><br/>""Troy"" starts off on the wrong foot by setting Paris up in the story incorrectly, his origin and place in the kingdom of Troy forsaken to have him more easily seen as a noble prince. Moreover, the entire catalyst for the war was dismissed - the Apple of Discord and the Judgement of Paris were non-existent. Such omission is forgivable if filmmakers wanted to steer away from the fantastic elements of myth; however, Thetis, an immortal Nereid (sea nymph), was included in the movie (she is the mother of Achilles). So, the 'taint' of myth was already present.<br/><br/>The movie's second major error was the omission of pivotal characters, namely Hecabe (Queen of Troy); Cassandra (Trojan Princess whose prophecies went unheeded); Laocoön (Trojan seer silenced by Poseidon); and Clytemnestra (Helen's sister and vengeful wife of Agamemnon). The absence of the latter led to a wrongfully depicted murder at the movie's end (other deaths were incorrect as well).<br/><br/>A more understandable error was the use of the name Ajax - that name is Latin for the Greek warrior Aias. The name was probably used, though, because it is more familiar (as is the common mistake of using the name Hercules, the more recognizable Latin name of the Greek hero Heracles).<br/><br/>The other major flaw of the story was the absence of Achilles' origin. With Thetis present in the movie, the hero's dipping in the river Styx after birth should have been mentioned, even if Achilles himself were to not believe it. Its absence, however, makes his death in the film seem ludicrous - when Paris shoots him in his foot, he falls as the myth details, but to the viewers that do not know the myth, they wouldn't see the significance of it.<br/><br/>Craft-wise, the movie was excellently executed. The only major flaw was bad performances from usually phenomenal actors. One example is how certain actors (Gleeson, Kruger, etc) allowed their accents to slip through. On the other hand, the best performance in the film goes to Eric Bana as Hector, Prince of Troy. Despite his initial haughty dialogue, he comes across as the film's saving grace. Brad Pitt's turn as Achilles was all right (as was Rose Byrne's Briseïs and Saffron Burrows' Andromache), but the film would have been purely superficial were it not for Bana.<br/><br/>It was also nice to see Sean Bean in an admirable role. He is too often the villain (even as Boromir in ""Lord of the Rings"" he had a villainous streak to him). I can't say the same for Brian Cox, though. He was still a villain."
"arthurclay","10","14","26","1 January 2005"," A solid movie
","Not completely historically accurate and it took some liberties (Not that I care because I don't) but it was remarkable in many aspects. The cast was more than adequate and the realism was impressive. You feel like you are in the middle of the action and it never lets up. Watch it with surround sound and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. I have never been a Brad Pitt fan and probably never will be but I have thought that three of his performances have been noteworthy (Seven, Interview with A Vampire especially) and this is the third. This film needed a big big name to play Achilles, the greatest warrior who ever lived and they found one. You actually like his character and want him to win the battles and get the woman he loves and who loves him more than anything. This is the romance that the viewer really cares about not the silly and ultimately self-destructive one between Bloom and Kruger. The women were also very beautiful and added nicely to the viewing experience. I am also not a big fan of ""star-crossed lover stories"" but they did a wonderful job of weaving in the romance with all the action sequences. Bravo Peterson for not trying to give us another friggin Titanic which we didn't want or need. Eric Bana did a fabulous job as Hector he gave the film added credibility and Sean Bean as Ulysses was also a good if unexpected pick. Peter O'Toole as King Priam didn't hurt either and Brian Cox is back in the saddle riding high as the SOB Lord of Men King of Kings Agememnon with some clever dialog and witty banter with Pitt. Almost as good as Gladiator and Braveheart to be sure a great way to spend a Friday night. If the Gods are pleased they will follow up with The Odyssey as a sequel I would love to watch that as well and don't forget to cast Bean again."

","I've seen many many movies and Troy really stands out, it is on a higher level than most other war epics. The fact that Brad Pitt will not win any awards for the movie just because he isn't a ""Russell Crowe"" (Gladiator) is ludacris. He acted brilliantly as Achilles-I couldn't have picked a better Cast. Eric Bana was outstanding as well, Orlando Bloom, I know all the ladies love him, but I don't enjoy his acting style as much...The balance between talking and battle scenes is something I notice a lot in these lengthy films. Many either have too much fighting or too much talking but TROY was so evenly balanced, I'm disappointed the DVD wont be released until January 4th, thats almost 1 year but it hopefully will be worth it!

The film is plodding, dialogue is boring and the battle scenes were done better on Xena & Hercules not to mention those shows had witty writing spirited directing and good acting from then unknown actors. The casting is also uninspired. Diane Kruger who plays Helen is pretty in a blonde sort of valley white girl way and she didn't  have much to do in this film, the Greek  kings  all look like old bikers, and even Brad Pitt who I do like, looked ridicules.

"FilmSnobby","3","23","47","22 May 2004"," Hector vs. Fabio.
","The good news is, *Troy*  isn't as bad as the trailers would lead you to believe.  It is certainly better than Ridley Scott's  *Gladiator* . . . but this is not saying a great deal, as the latter was terrible.  Director Wolfgang Petersen deserves praise, first and foremost, for knowing how to film a fight scene.  The one-on-one fights, between first Paris/Menelaus, then Achilles/Hector, are thrilling and realistic, but more importantly, FILMED SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.  Petersen eschews the lazy new mode of fight scenes, which is to quick-edit them out of all comprehension.  His camera floats around the battles, giving us a nonpartisan and omniscient view.  Much the same can be said for the larger battle sequences as well, even though the overuse of computer-generated armies deducts credibility.  (We're told that Agamemnon's army is 50,000 strong, but what we see are millions upon millions of computer-generated cartoon-men.)<br/><br/>A few ideas even manage to sneak into  *Troy*, along with the fabled wooden horse.  I liked the contrast between the older, far more civilized, Trojan culture, with its reliance on omens and religion, and the more grounded, realistic, Machiavellian political culture of the invading Greeks.  Petersen even gives Brian Cox's Agamemnon a decent speech about how proud he is of turning a ragtag assemblage of superstitious barbarians and  ""snake-eaters"" into a modern, imperialist nation.  Understanding the difference between the two cultures is crucial for engendering an interest in how things turn out.<br/><br/>But therein lies the problem, because anybody who attended high school already knows how things turn out, and therefore a $200 million epic that puts its trust in plot to the general exclusion of other interests is bound to be ultimately forgettable.  It's not the STORY that's important  (and I don't even care about the screenwriters'  wild liberties with the Troy legend, as it's legend anyhow and not history), it's the SETTING, and the IDEAS, that count.  However, this movie simply cannot afford to immerse us in the pre-historical world of Agamemnon and Priam:  there's too much money at stake.  And so they'll have a big weekend, make their money back, maybe win a technical Oscar next April, but no one will remember the actual film. Big accomplishment!  Why bother?<br/><br/>And there are other problems.  Let's start, first of all, with the score, which has got to be one of the worst I've ever heard in a major motion picture.  Written by James Horner, it consists of a woman moaning atonally for minutes at a time.  ""Ahh-yah-ahhh Yaaa hhaaa"".  It keeps cropping up whenever there's a battle about to take place or whenever some hero lies bloody in the sand.  It makes you want to tear your hair out and poke knitting needles in your ears.  Second, let's consider Brad Pitt.  God bless him, but the fellow has a speech impediment, and that never really works when you're playing one of the globe's most legendary heroes.  It's an unkind thing to say, but there it is.  Further, he looks like a cross between an aging California surfer and Fabio:  his physical presence carries zero credibility.  (How many BLONDE Greeks do you know?)  Third, Achilles is given a love interest in the form of a young Trojan priestess Briseis:  this is a mistake, because the actress playing her is prettier than the actress playing Helen.  A story about the Troy legend should always to defer to Helen as the sublime example of feminine beauty.  But then, I guess the writers couldn't figure out a way to get Achilles romantically involved with Helen, so they had to trump up something.  This flatters the movie's Big Star, but it hurts the movie.<br/><br/>Pitt's miscasting is countered by an otherwise excellent cast  (Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom as Hector and Paris are particularly strong), but there's not enough good stuff here to warrant a recommendation.  4 stars out of 10."

","I know its an epic movie and they usually have over-acting conceded, but add that to a bad epoch adaptation (screenplay, customers, make-up, manners, crafts, everything...) and the result is this gladiator-lordoftherings-wannabe that falls very short at the attempt. Shoudn't get any academy awards nominations, except maybe for visual effects or ... i don't know... hair-styles? But who knows, we've seen other overrated movies win a lot of Oscars before, like Titanic, where each statue represents like xzillion dollars invested which represent a lot of jobs....

A movie you can really get lost in. There are a couple of pacing problem, fast-slow-fast-slow, but overall a worthy night out. Brad Pitt's movements are as impressive as his acting, and Eric Bana has more than redeemed himself for his role in the awful Hulk movie. He is fantastic in this film! A true tragic hero. The CGI was not up to Lord of the Rings standards, but was still excellent. Sweeping battle scenes, and hacking and slashing a plenty!

Troy is captivating in many senses as it realistically shows war as having heroes on both sides and in this case no clear bad guys.... of course there are bad guys in it but neither side is really portrayed as the goodies or the baddies which makes for an interesting spin on a war film. Watch this film asap if you haven't had the pleasure already, it really shows that films of the older type (Jason of the Arganourts and Clash of the Titens) really should be remade with the advanced CGI because a realistic film of the era works."

","Might contain spoilers!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Since the release of the last installment of the Lord of the Rings, viewers have been craving for another epic like tale. Troy could obviously be considered more of an epic then L.O.T.R. but they both can be granted the praise for amazing battle scenes. From the beginning of the film till the end you are dragged along a tale of epic battle scenes, the struggles of heroes, and the tragedy and beauty of love. Some have accused this movie of being rather ordinary and a chic flick. One must keep in mind that this classic story could very well be the bases for many of the epic like tales we as movie goers have seen in the past. This movie stands alone because the story was the first of its kind , and it should be respected for that. Wolfgang beautifully transitions the movie from scene to scene. At no point is the viewers mind transfixed on the thought that the movie exceeds 2 hours and a half. Some male viewers considered this might appeal more to woman with the fact you have Brad Pitt running around in barely anything. The truth of the matter is Achilles probably would have been wearing that - so if it happens to appeal to woman - it was not intentional. In closing, this movie was worth the money, worth the time, and probably one of the best films ( excluding harry potter) that you will see all summer. A quick praise to Brad Pitt for showing all those people who doubted him. His amazing looks just come with the package- he is an amazing actor and that is what he should be recognize for."

","Troy was well paced, well edited, well written, well directed and for the most part, well acted. What went wrong? The soundtrack and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Mr. Pitt does not act, but rather poses his way through this lengthy adaptation of The Iliad, like some cross between a rock star and the vainglorious Achilles. Is this posing,superficiality and transparency supposed to symbolize Achilles' vanity and egotism? How then, do we explain his interest in Perseus, and his ability to inspire warriors in battle more profoundly than the greatest Greek kings? Pitt indulges a grand total of two facial expressions - disinterest and mild annoyance - throughout the entire recounting of Homer's epic detailing the Trojan war. The rest of the actors are quite excellent, making Pitt's flashy performance stand-out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>Although this is probably a personal peeve, the soundtrack for this film really aggravated me. The score consisted of pseudo-classical meanderings-about a redundant theme - with tempos all too perfectly suited for the various battle scenes etc. My guess is that the music was supposed to heighten the excitement of these scenes. Unfortunately, for me, it only distracted me from them.<br/><br/>All considered, I enjoyed Troy. I think it could have been a much much better film, however, had Brad Pitt been encouraged to use more of his talent and less of his abs and pecs. The film easily would have achieved a rating of 8 or 9 from me had Achilles role been more competently handled - even with the tedious soundtrack."
"J5iftY5iveXtreme","8","16","31","31 August 2005"," Underrated film
","""Troy,"" as we all know, is an adaptation of Homer's classic poem, ""The Iliad."" It tells the tale of Paris, the prince of the Kingdom of Troy, who falls in love with Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, and kidnaps her. This outrages Menelaus, and he begs his brother, Agamemnon, for help. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity to make war on Troy, and he gathers all the kingdoms of Greece in a war against Troy. Warriors from every Greek kingdom is present at the war; among these warriors is Achilles, one of the most famous figures in Greek mythology. And thus begins the tale of the Trojan War.<br/><br/>The story of the Trojan war is, perhaps, one of the most popular myths is human history. It has had several film adaptations, including the 1950's ""Helen of Troy,"" a 2003 film of the same name, and, of course, 2004's ""Troy,"" released after the success of epic films like ""Gladiator"" and ""LOTR.""<br/><br/>David Benioff, using ""The Ilaid"" as a primary guide, writes the screen play and retells many of the most famous events in the myth. Of course, every adaptation of a literary work has some changes to the original tale, and ""Troy"" is no exception. It is filled with many changes to the ""Iliad"" in the name of artistic licensing. Example of changes include:<br/><br/>-The Death of Menelaus under Paris even though he's supposed to survive the war and reclaim Helen as his wife again <br/><br/>-The death of Agamemnon under Brisies even though his wife is supposed to kill him when he comes home from the war <br/><br/>-The fact that Achilles is on board the Trojan Horse even though he's supposed to die even before it was built <br/><br/>-Paris living in the end even though he's supposed to die during the war <br/><br/>-And, perhaps the biggest change in the original story are the omission of the Greek gods, who play a major role in the story.<br/><br/>But despite these changes to the original tale, ""Troy"" is a fair adaptation of the Greek myth. The omission of the gods is tolerable and makes the story realistic; ""Troy"" is an attempt to tale the tale from a realistic point of view, excluding many of the supernatural elements. There is no mention of Achilles' immortality (unless he's struck in the heel) and it takes several arrows to kill him. But this does not mean that ""Troy"" is an unfaithful adaptation, since it has the basics. The war, like in the original tale, in this film, is triggered by the abduction of Helen by Paris, and this film also has the famous Trojan Horse.<br/><br/>With an acceptable script to work with, ""Troy"" fell under the direction of Wolfgang Petersen, famous for his work in ""Das Boots."" <br/><br/>This movie includes an all-star cast, a cast headed by Brat Pitt as Achilles. Gaining muscle for his role, Pitt portrays Achilles as a strong warrior. But even though he is the star of the film, the real star is Eric Bana as Hector, the Trojan prince and hero of his people who comes face-to-face with the mighty Achilles. Bana portrays a noble warrior like Hector and makes him a person you'd want to root for. The best performance in this movie goes to Peter O'Tool as King Priam of Troy, a loving father and wise ruler. Other stars include Brian Cox as a believably vile Agamemnon, Brian Gleeson as Menelaus (angry that his wife left him for the pretty boy prince of Troy), and, of course, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger as puny Paris and beautiful Helen, the two lovers who started the Trojan War.<br/><br/>Now, for the technical parts of the film, one word - impressive. The sets are realistic, and so are the costumes. The cinematography is breathtaking (this film was filmed in Mexico and Malta). And, of course, no film is complete with a score. Originally, Gabriel Yared's music was supposed to be on this film, but it was deemed too ""classical"" a replaced with James Horner's music that he made in less than two weeks, a score that is considered inferior to Yared's, but I still found it tolerable. This movie also includes Josh Groban's ""Remember"" in the ending credits.<br/><br/>When ""Troy"" premiered, it receive mixed reviews from critics and the public. The criticism was based on its changes to the ""Iliad,"" while others blasted others like Orlando Bloom's portraying of Paris as a weakling (even though he's supposed to be) and several others. However, despite criticism, this movie still manages to get a 7.0 rating on the IMDb and has some decent reviews.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Troy"" is a fair adaptation of the Iliad and a good epic film.<br/><br/>163 minutes Rated R for graphic violence and some sexuality/nudity"
"michael_chaplan","8","12","22","1 February 2005"," Troy is about the Trojan War, which took place about 1000 BC.
","As far as I know, this story has been made into a movie only once before... Robert Wise's Helen of Troy (1955). Those who think that Troy is a travesty of the original should be lashed to a mast and forced to watch Helen of Troy (for which the story of Achilles is over with in 20 minutes.)<br/><br/>I majored in Latin and classical literature, so I know the story of the Trojan War and the sources. <br/><br/>There are a few things the screenwriter did (to change the original) which can be forgiven... and something you, as the audience can do, which will improve the viewing experience.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for the screenwriter was to telescope a ten year war (which would have been incomprehensible to viewers) into a couple of weeks. Another problem was to take a story which was well known to those who heard it when it was first composed, 3,000 years ago or so, and make characters who could only appear for a few seconds into memorable characters.<br/><br/>As the first reviewer mentioned, the Trojan Horse does not appear in the Iliad. Neither does the death of Achilles (from an arrow in his Achilles' tendon). Could a modern audience stand a story about Troy, however, which does NOT contain the few things about the story which he DOES know? For me, far more troubling is the ending, where Paris escapes with Helen from the burning city. This was added to make a nice happy ending... but in fact, Helen returned to her husband. If you don't believe me, read Homer's Odyssey, where Telemachus visits Sparta to look for his father... and meets Menelaus reunited with his wife, Helen.<br/><br/>Cassandra may have a speaking part in the Iliad... I don't remember. Clytemnestra and her boyfriend did kill Agamemnon and Cassandra when they returned from the Trojan War, but did not serve his body up to their children... at least not in the Oresteia, by Aeschylus. Nor in Ovid's Metamorphoses, which goes over the same material. In Aeschylus' first play in the trilogy, the reasons for killing Agamemnon are complex... and fascinating.<br/><br/>Now if you know the original story and don't want to be disturbed by the screenwriter's changes, the logical thing to do is to watch Brad Pitt's masterful creation of Achilles, and Sean Bean's surprising Odysseus. The remaking of the story can be endured... until just after the funeral of Hector, when Odysseus watches one of his men carving a wooden horse. At that point, the wise person will walk out of the theater or turn off the video or DVD and be left with a fairly satisfying experience. Everything after that point is a letdown. It even SEEMS like Hollywood changes to the story."

","First of all, there are no 'gods' in Troy so don't expect them. The story is quite good without them however, if you can just say 'cinematic license' and get over it. Brad Pitt does a credible job as a sensitive Achilles, but also an Achilles that knows that what's most important to him is glory and renown. The young boy that plays Patroclus (in the film he is Achilles cousin, not his lover) is very good and looks enough like Pitt that you believe they are related. Of course, He is, along with Achilles and Helen, one of only 3 blonde-haired people in the movie! Brad is beautifully buffed and we get to see most of that, so if you are female that is very good.<br/><br/>Sean Bean (Boromir from Fellowship of the Ring) does a nice job as Odysseus, even if his hair looks too modern and his heavy Yorkshire accent is distracting.<br/><br/>Helen -- oh dear, she can't act and her accent slips into heavy German rather than the cultured British it's supposed to be more times than not!<br/><br/>Eric Bana does a spectacular Hector and Peter O'Toole - well, even at his advanced age, he is still Peter O'Toole, brilliant as Priam and heart wrenching in a scene where he pleas for Achilles to let him bring Hector back inside the walls of Troy for a proper burial. I admit I cried and I was pleased with the way Achilles seemed to admire and even fear this frail old man, while knowing that he could kill him with one blow. O'Toole is worth seeing.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom... since I loved him in Lord of the Rings, it wrenches my heart to say that in 'Troy' his facial expressions were horribly over acted. Did the director not view the rushes? If so, he should have told Bloom to turn it down, especially during some of his scenes with Helen. I was also not prepared to see him clinging to Hector's knees begging for life after running away from a hand to hand combat with Menelaus! To be honest, this Paris is a selfish, spoilt little rich prince who has been coddled by his family and knows nothing about courage or honor. It makes one wonder at Helen choosing him at all - even if he is very beautiful. Yes, Bloom looks pretty, who could deny that? But he has much to learn about acting. His saving graces for me seemed to be the opening body shot with Helen where we get to see him standing next to the bed, near naked and damp with sweat, and when he finally takes up a bow and arrow and reminds me of Legolas. It seems he's retained his archery skills from Lord of the Rings - a perfect stance, a beautiful pull to the corner of his mouth and a deadly release... but all that only serves to make you wonder why Paris couldn't use any other weapon well and why, when his brother and countrymen were going to war over his folly - he wasn't obliged to fight. <br/><br/>Worth seeing once at a matinee price - if only for the gorgeous choreographed battle with Pitt and Bana, the marvelous acting of O'Toole, and the scantily clad man-flesh. If none of these appeal to you, wait for the DVD."
"leon-cavallini","10","15","29","26 December 2004"," The Trojan War against all Wars
","The true revelation of ""Troy"" is David Benioff, the author of a tough, demystifying screenplay, which is also able to give coherence to a scattered, contradictory mythical tradition. Benioff eliminates the gods, lifeless ghosts of an ancestral religion, who already in Homer appeared to be only vain, even ridiculous puppets. Achilles cuts the head of Apollon off, but on the other hand Hector openly contests the useless superstitions of some grotesque Trojan priests. But the main target of Benioff's polemic script is the thirst for power of Agamemnon and Menelaus, the Homeric ""hateful sons of Atreus""; the Trojan war itself is condemned as a prototype of every ancient (or modern) imperialistic war. But if the movie blames the war, by presenting it as a dreadful myth of the past (but, unfortunately, of the present too), on the contrary it shows a deep respect towards Homer and his poetry. Entire sequences of the Iliad are carefully translated into images of flawless visual suggestion. If one knows the Iliad well, it is easy for him to identify keen references to single verses of the Homeric masterpiece: the Achaean ""phalanx"" which tightens itself, ""man close to man, shield close to shield""; Achilles who ""puts his hands on the chest of"" the dead Patroclus, and stays awake near his friend's pyre for a whole night; the impeccable representation of the Greek camp, of the ships and of the tents. The so often criticized 'alterations' of the Homeric text represent a discussion of the myth, not of Homer's poetry. As a matter of fact, the most significant changes do not concern Homer, but the final part of the Trojan saga, which was originally narrated by some modest rhapsodic poets trying to imitate the great Homer. It is worthwhile to indicate that the final of Troy, with its precocious sentimental implications, is inspired to the Medieval tradition, especially to Benoit de Sainte Maure's ""Roman de Troie""(very well known also to Dante), while the movie gives less importance to the incoherent, disordered tales of the late Epic tradition. Some more words about the acting. Brad Pitt is incredibly able to identify himself with the melancholic (although lethal)Achilles; but also Eric Bana is convincing in his interpretation of Hector, and Orlando Bloom manages well the anti-heroic character for excellence, that is to say Paris. Only the women are a disappointment, excepting Julie Christie and Rose Byrne/Briseis."
"Aussiemovielover","10","2","2","23 May 2020"," Raw and crude but so real
","Great to have the chance to revisit this movie ðŸŽ¥ 16 years after its release and my last viewing. It is undoubtedly a very thrilling show, everything from start to finish, plot to actors, sound to music ðŸŽ¶ , scene to costume. Its greatness is magnified by great acting skills of great Hollywood heavyweights like Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Orlando Broom.
While being highly bloody and crude, this movie is deeply fascinating in that it depicts a very genuine picture of human nature. As we all know everything in this world is complicated, so is the soul of this movie. Politics and history, war and peace, love and hate, women and sex, greed and generosity, enmity and respect cannot be more paradoxically reflected in the story, so much so that I find it a bit hard to accept although able to comprehend, and so much so that it makes you feel a bit psychologically hard to breathe, like jumping into freezing waters in the middle of the Atlantic. Yet again my cynicism has somehow captured me in that I pity human nature just as Briseis the princess in the movie pities soldiers.
I find it very real and almost a bit surreal that we all exist to serve the function of a larger mechanism, sometimes at our free will or otherwise with little or no choices.
What a well spent evening with such a wonderful movie . I find myself increasingly engrossed into movie ðŸŽ¥ plots. Even right now the scene in the movie ðŸŽ¥ are still playing in my mind. I did not expect myself to be such a philosophical and perhaps a bit literary person."

","I'm not much of an ancient war movie type of girl. But this really caught my attention. Other than the fact that I saw loads of people die horrendously and having to cover my eyes for a quarter of the film. It truly was really good. The acting was marvellous and the music was amazing. I especially love when the music builds up up to an intense scene. The scenery really captured that essence of history. I would definitely recommend this to any war movie lover.

"byrann_gowan","Null","2","2","16 October 2011"," Some flaws, but overall a good movie
","Troy is a good movie that history buffs can relate to, and while it is not perfect, overall it delivers.<br/><br/>What makes this movie good, in my opinion, is the way it depicts reality today. This is not a movie that is ""good vs. evil."" Every character of this movie has flaws. Achilles is arrogant, Paris is selfish and ignorant, Agammemnon is power-hungry, Priam is cocky; I could go on and on. This is what gives the movie its spark, and I thank Wolfgang Peterson for giving it that.<br/><br/>Now, to the actors: If anybody stole the show for me, it was Eric Bana. His character had depth, he had feelings, and his character was the most sensible out of all of the characters. You really believed Bana every time he was on screen. What he lacked in ""Hulk,"" he more than made up for in ""Troy."" Most of the rest of the actors were good as well. Brad Pitt was good as Achilles, although he did look and sound a bit out of place. Diane Kruger was beautiful, but that was the main thing that saved her; she could have done a bit more with the acting. Brian Cox is great, as is Brendan Gleeson, and Peter O'Toole shows that he is still as great as he was back when he played ""Lawrence of Arabia."" My one problem: Orlando Bloom. He was not believable, in any sense of the word. His acting could have been way better, and his dialogue was really cheesy (I blame the writers for that one). So far, he has only been good in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and of course, the Lord of the Rings movies, but here, he's just not at the top of his game.<br/><br/>That being said, overall, it's a good movie. It's obviously not awards-worthy, but if you're a history buff, or you love a good action film, this is the movie for you. Go see it, enjoy it, in the end, it's all good fun."

","Eh - not bad. I almost forgot how much I enjoyed the Iliad and the Aeneid when I was a strapping young teen of a more rebellious nature. This movie brought me back a bit and made me want to strap on a spear and some leather. Minor qualm: Brad Pitt mopes about like a Hollywood movie star who lost his crayons. Greek heroes don't mope - they kick ass - and Greek ass to boot! Then they listen to cheering and eat and have lots of sex. There is some ass-kicking and sex and cheering but Brad's Achilles is too brooding and moody. The FX are pretty good, I liked the launch of 1000 ships. Peter O'Toole looks like he was happy to be surrounded by so many young boys again like in Lawrence of Arabia - his scene was good. Orlando Bloom plays a good Paris. Best of all is Eric Bana as Hector, who would've been better in the Pitt role. I could've done without the stupid 'reaction' shots - 50000 men on a field and Helen and Priam can see Menaleus and Paris fighting through all of them? Dumb. All and all, ""eh, not bad"". Gotta check out Alexander next. B-. 8 out of 10."
"CinemaBrit@aol.com","10","11","20","20 May 2004"," The legend re-born
","I am grateful for how well this was handled. Thoroughly expecting the romance to take centre stage in the narrative (as has been the case in many costly movies of late), between Paris (Bloom) and Helen (Kruger), I remember thinking, as I left the theatre, how little screen time they shared together. Benioff and Petersen have instead simply given us The Trojan War as fought by the two great warriors of that age: Hector (Bana) and Achilles (Pitt).<br/><br/>The story has always been a great one, but never satisfactorily rendered on the big screen. These Greek legends hold the origins of modern storytelling, but where are they now? Cinema has barely touched the richness of ancient folklore: maybe now is its time, as special effects become more miraculous by the week, and studios are embracing the scope of epic fantasy and history like never before. Where are the great movies of Hercules, of Theseus, of Odysseus... <br/><br/>'Troy' was terrific entertainment. The battles are everything you'd expect, and comparing them to Helm's Deep or Pelennor Fields is unfair in the extreme. This is gritty, chaotic warfare in which good and evil isn't as clear-cut as men vs orcs; Homer saw it as bravery fighting destiny, and that is precisely what is presented here.<br/><br/>Pitt is perfect as the arrogant but soulful Achilles, a warrior so deadly that his renown can literally turn the tide of a war. The actor displays a breathtaking physicality here, superhuman in both agility and grace. His presence fills the screen in every way. Bana is hugely impressive as noble Prince Hector, the only real bona-fide hero of the film. He radiates strength through every word, and is a commanding presence throughout. His performance is comparable to Russell Crowe's 'Maximus'.<br/><br/>Most notable among the high calibre cast are Peter O'Toole (wonderful as King Priam), Brian Cox's loathsome Agamemnon and Sean Bean (fantastic as the fabled Odysseus). No one is conspicuously weak, but many roles are unfortunately only given the focus that a (quite strong) three hour script can provide. Sets are stupendous, costumes dazzling and the special effects are as grand as you'd imagine.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to the climactic one-on-one fight between the two warriors. It's a truly amazing five minute sequence of cinema.<br/><br/>The film as a whole works very well indeed, and the changes given to the original story (apart from one) are handled admirably. Ranks easily among the best historical epics of yesteryear, and offers a fascinating interpretation of the legendary Achilles. An impressive, old-fashioned extravaganza."
"pchinelis","10","11","20","16 May 2004"," Biased review, film buffs look elsewhere
","For a Greek who was raised by these stories as part of his heritage and history to actually see them unfold in front of him is a really huge thing.<br/><br/>I got to see the film yesterday in Odeon's flagship cinema in Leicester square. Only the best would do for such a story. Since my knowledge of the story rivals your average scholar let me provide you with some (just scratching the surface though), information about it.<br/><br/>The story you get to witness in Troy is not taken by one book. Homer's Iliad takes place in about 40-50 days of the 9-10 year war against the Trojans. The book actually ends with Hector's funeral. NO Trojan horse, or Achilles death etc. The story you get to see on screen is 85% Homer's (huge dispute about that as well, but i am not going to get into it) and the rest comprises by accounts and stories we have from different authors. I would estimate that about 60% of the story is taken from The Iliad, (as the credits rightly inform the story was inspired by the works of Homer, NOT Simpson)<br/><br/>Yes changes have been made, like in other movies, in order to take account of the cinema generation. The script is written so as to give an account of the possible factual happenings thus deferring from all the divine intervention complications as in the original text.<br/><br/>You see this story is not your Mummys or your Lord of the rings or your Harry Potters. The story is about a historical event that actually happened 3200 (?) years ago. You can go to modern day Turkey and visit the ruins of Troy. For years scholars were accusing the stories as fantasy. Heinrich Schliemann shut them up when he discovered the ruins of the historical Troy. That was only about 100 years ago. So do not dismiss anything from the story. King Agamemnon and his brother Menelaus were actual Kings, their palaces exist to this day, ancient Greeks did dressed like that, had ships like that etc etc. The costume designers didn't have to leave their imagination running. They just visited a few archaeological museums.<br/><br/>Nowadays you can visit New Zealand and be taken upon the tourist trail of Lord of the Rings. You`ll be shown the filming locations like they were the factual locations. That's what a nation without heritage does nowadays. They fake it. Whereas, you can visit Greece and stumble upon the birth of civilization, upon stories and legends on a time when humanity was born, a time before modern religions (Christianity, Islam etc), a time before weapons of mass destruction. Well enough with that, you get the picture.<br/><br/>Back on the movie. When I first heard that they were going to make a movie about the story of Troy I was thinking that they were going to create a simple action movie or worse, a tongue in cheek version in the veins of The Mummy. I was relieved to see that Petersen actually managed to put lots of heart into it, people around me were crying all the time, I couldn't cry, I cried many times decades ago when I was first taught the story, (part of the education curriculum in Greece for centuries). <br/><br/>Most of the location filming was done in Malta so you get a fair representation of the actual historic locations. The soundtrack is dipped in ancient Greek music (Pythagorean scale) and costumes/armory/buildings/weapons are highly representative of the period, as I mentioned before a simply visit to a museum would suffice. <br/><br/>I am taking my hat off to the people who did the research for the movie. They really did their homework, especially in the correct representation of the city of Troy and hints regarding actual shenanigans, (according to Herodotus, the father of history, Helen was actually in Egypt during the war, Menelaus collected her upon returning from his victory). Of course I have to forgive them for many false representations, since they had to make a story viable for current (easy going) generations. For instance, at that time there wasn't a collective term for Greeks. In fact, if such a generalization is to be made it has to be said that the Trojans were Greeks as well, (the Thracians, which take their name from the part of modern day Greece where I actually came from, where allies with Troy). I suggest you do your own reading upon that. <br/><br/>The story is about a war, and war you get in the big screen version. Huge battle scenes with bird's eye shots of countless battleships (triiris), battalion formations etc. Achilles was the greatest warrior at that time (immortal apart from his heel, according to legend) and you get to see why. Again, unlike the Matrix let's say, these warriors existed and fought like that a long time ago. Back then it was all about the heroes and their honour. You will see in the movie that Achilles wants his name in history. This testament is not just something taken of the books, these men really did lived and died for that cause alone. Honour and Arete.<br/><br/>Greeks to this day, still name their kids using these names. Just think about the history of your name and then try to compare that with a young kid living in Greece who is called Achilles. <br/><br/>It's the year 2004A.D. and these historic figures, thanks to cinematography, are more famous than ever before. Do you really think they died in vain?<br/><br/>Welcome to the greatest stories ever told."

"jtsimikas","9","10","18","3 February 2007"," Very entertaining movie - highly recommended
","Being of Greek ancestry, I thought the British accents, Peter O'Toole's(Priam) accent for example seemed very out of place. That being said, the scene where King Priam begs Achilles to let him give his son a proper burial was quite powerful and touching. I didn't like the idea of glamour boy Brad Pitt playing the part of Achilles. I also thought that an actor with more classical Greek features should have played the part, but then again Achilles was supposed to have golden hair. <br/><br/>In the end, I thought Pitt did a better than average job of playing that role. His dialogue with Briseies where he talks about how the ""Gods envy us because we are mortal"" was quite good.<br/><br/>Although the Gods did not play a real vital part in the movie as they did in the Iliad, I guess some liberties were taken to make it more palatable to today's audience.<br/><br/>I really like Eric Bana's (Hector) acting in this film. As the son of Priam, he nobly defends Troy and you even find yourself feeling sympathetic towards him. Realizing his impending death, he gives his wife who is holding their newborn, instructions for hiding from the Greek army just before he goes into battle with Achilles outside the walls of Troy. You feeling sorry for Hector, as an infuriated Achilles seeks to avenge the death of Patrocolus who Hector has slayed.<br/><br/>I thought that Orlando Bloom (Paris) acting seemed sub par. I was also expecting Helen to have more scenes and be more central to the movie. <br/><br/>The battle scenes were very cinematic, and the showdown between Hector and Achilles may have been the best scene in the movie.<br/><br/>This was a great epic film. I would also recommend The Gladiator."

","All that needs to be said about this masterpiece of a film is that it is an absolutely awesomely fantastic movie, and is understandably adored my many, myself included! Eric Bana is amazing in this film. The PERFECT Hector; He fits the role as if he were made for it (Reincarnation, anyone?;) Also, Brad Pitt gives the performance of his life as Achilles. He manages to be savage, tender, and fierce at the same time. He should have won an Oscar for his body alone, let alone the great performance. Orlando Bloom does cowardly very well; surprisingly well, actually. He's the ideal Paris, despite his cinematic failings as a monarch. Helen and Hector's wife are played by very talented actresses who obviously did their homework when it comes to these roles. I just can't stress the casting enough. It's one of the best talent line-ups I've ever come across; also, the cinematography is beautiful. All in all, the film is a sheer delight to behold. It's entertaining and informative, and I definitely think they did Homer's 'Illiad' Justice."

Troy was the best movie in 2004. Orlando Bloom was kind playing a fool and I did not like him so much but all in all it was still great. There was some things I found wrong that I think the history could have been more suitable and that is where Achilles and Chryseis where together and where Patroclus were his cousin that just wasn't true. Orlando Bloom kind started to confuse me. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that Menelaus was not killed by Hector and Aegememnon not by Chryseis. Menelaus did not die but returned home with Helen and that Aegememnon was murdered by his own wife and a suitor. <br/><br/>it was still a very good movie and it inspired me a lot."

"ItsCoopss","10","10","18","13 May 2004"," I think there might have been some glue on the screen...
","When I first heard they were making a film based on Homer's The Illiad about a year ago, I was delighted, and as a lover of films and this book my hype was surely too much. As the date drew nearer, my excitement grew, I thought it was going to be the best film ever. Did I overestimate it?<br/><br/>The Illiad is the only book I have ever read, I've attempted to read more books but I just can't sit down and read. I find it boring. But with the Illiad, it was the opposite. A truly great story which you can just sit there and read and let your imagination take control. But now, Wolfgang Peterson has brought this epic tale to life. If you take a look at the end credits, it will say, Inspired by Homer's The Illiad. You have to take this into account because you cannot expect any film to stay true to a book like The Illiad in every aspect, you see, I believe that the 'Inspired by' sets it apart from book-film adaptations such as Lord of the Rings, as this film is called Troy, and not The Illiad. Many people want this film to fail because they believe it shouldn't have been made and will be an insult to The Illiad and others who want it to fail because of its $200million dollar budget. As for the director of Troy, Wolfgang Peterson, I can say that I am not familiar with much of his work, apart from Air Force One, which I quite enjoyed. But despite his critics, we know he can create something special as he did with his powerful war/drama Das Boot (Which I haven't seen but being in the IMDB's top 250 at number 45 says alot.)<br/><br/>When I heard the casting of Troy, I was quite suprised to see so many big names in one film, many people questioned the casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles and at first, so did I. I've always pictured Achilles in the physique of Brad Pitt, but I didn't think he could do it. I read that he put on an English accent for the film and I went in expecting a weak performance from him. At the beginning of the film I still was a little weary of him, but as the film went on, I became quite impressed with his performance. What could you expect? Achilles was very arrogant, egotistical, and a great warrior, and this was indeed how Pitt portrayed him, with a loving side to him, towards Patroclus. If anyone doubts him, they should look at him without all his star-glow and just accept that he IS Achilles and truly does give a great performance. Oscar worthy? I wouldn't think so but honestly, he should be worthy of at least a nomination. As for my favourite character in the book, Hector, was played very well by Eric Bana (The Hulk.) with clearly one of the better performances throughout the film, now, in my opinion, The Hulk was a bad film, but you cannot blame that on Bana, because he wasn't in it enough, the screen was taken up mostly by a big green thing which didn't seem to fit into his surroundings at all. But, in Troy, when Bana was on screen, I was taken by his performance and not thinking, 'When's this guy gonna turn into The Hulk?' Oscar worthy? Hope So. As for the casting of his younger brother, the cowardly, ladies man, Paris, I think Orlando Bloom was perfect for this role. Because, lets face it, the ladies love him and he is the 'big' thing at the moment. After starring in the Lord of the Rings, as a fearless Elvish hero, and being sidelined by an amzing Depp in Pirates of the Carribean as a fearless 'pirate' hero, it came as a nice change to see him play a coward, a character who loves ladies, and ladies love him back. I think he did the job very well but most of the time he was on screen, it was already taken by Bana or O'Toole (King Priam). Oscar Worthy? Not really, his character is too limited but still a great performance. Sean Bean was another good casting as Odysseus whos previous best effort came as the cold hearted human, Borimir in the Lord of the Rings. But, let us not forget the great performances by Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox (Priam and Agamemnon respectively.) As for the film, I think it was very well done and the battle scenes were nothing short of amazing, not one acotr stood out as a poor performance and the script too, hardly seemed to have any flaws. Its exactly how I imagined it. The scenes which stuck out to me were, when we first see Achilles laying amongst two other women and then half-heartetly getting up and going to the battle for a one-on-one which lasted mear seconds, the thousands of ships crossing the sea, the arrival of Achilles on the beach, the storming of the greek camp at day break, the fight between Hector and Achilles as Hector's whole family watched on, and the final scene with the Trojan Horse. In fact, the whole film stood out to me. Especially when Achilles talks to his mother who tells him that going to war will be his ticket to immortality. You know when I film of this length, 160 minutes, is good when you don't get a sore rear sitting down for this long, and you don't look at your watch once or have to think, 'When is this going to end?'<br/><br/>As for the final questions... Is this film worth $200million dollars? Yes. Is it enjoyable from start to finish? Yes. Did I overrate this film going into it thinking it would be the greatest film I ever did see? No. This is a masterpiece and should be up there with the best of them. I know this film has had mixed reviews but who cares? I don't. Critics gave Lost In Translation a great review and it was pretty bad and rather boring, and thats just one example. I could give you many more, I know its opinion, but I honestly can't see what they saw in that movie and haven't seen in this one. And anyone out there, if you are looking to see something extemely entertaining, with a great story (Perhaps the greatest) and some good acting, Don't go and see Van Helsing, this is the movie you want to see. If Homer (If he really did exist as one man) was able to see this movie, he should be honoured that his story was brought to life with such grace. Peterson did a great job and deserves nothing but positive reviews anything other should merely be cast aside with the reviews for Lost In Translation.<br/><br/>Best acted part: Eric Bana.<br/><br/>Best scene: 'Immortality, take it, its yours!' Achilles and his men then storm the beach and the temple, destroying everyone in their path and then his first meeting with Hector outside the Temple, 'It's too early to kill Princes.'.<br/><br/>Oscar Worthy?: Yes! It better be. It's still early in the year mind you, but I have a feeling it will be overlooked.<br/><br/>Verdict: I'm sure there was some sort of glue on the screen which simply stuck my eyes to it... 10/10."
"eddy_currents","9","10","18","17 May 2004"," Better than the original
","Homer's Illiad is a timeless epic adventure, but let's face it, it would never survive as a modern book. The characters make many long winded speeches, there are long stretches of nothing happening, and the gods are constantly (and I mean CONSTANTLY) interfering. It's incredible that the book has survived 3000 years and it's a fascinating snapshot of ancient history, but as a story, it's hard to get into.<br/><br/>This adaptation takes many liberties that enhance the story. Timeframes are necessarily compressed (how do you keep up the tension during a 10 year siege?) and there are a couple of love interests introduced to keep the ladies interested. (The girls are easy on the eyes for the men too.) Hector has been changed to be much more noble (pun intended), and the constant interference from deities is gone (and that's a good thing, although perhaps they went a little too far).<br/><br/>However, the essence of the characters and the tragedy are intact. Achilles is portrayed as a murderous thug seeking glory and missing in purpose, and the Trojans as the honorable heroes doomed to defeat. The theme and underlying feeling of Homer's story is also intact, but with incredible visuals. It's too bad the story centers on vast expanses of boring sand, but the armies and their battles fill the screen to bursting. It was also fascinating to watch ancient fighting styles. The screenplay shows us a precursor to the Roman way of fighting that created an empire.<br/><br/>Overall an excellent movie. Pitt's performance was the standout here. He had just the right mix of arrogance and sadness, and the moves, to be Achilles. Put this with his performance in Snatch and we see a truly good actor, not just another Hollywood hunk."

However, I'm sure I wasn't the only one that noticed (my friend did also), his accent couldn't decide if it was English or American.  By the end of the film I gave up trying to figure it out (luckily Achilles DIES before the end of the film) because I was begging myself to just get up and leave.<br/><br/>However, credit must go to Eric Bana for his role.  Perhaps the only redeeming quality of this tragedy (pun intended).<br/><br/>So, yes, fangirls -- you'll get your share of bare bottoms.  Probably the only hope this film has of being a success.

","One of the most poetic and beautiful sagas ever written and they have ""inspired"" it to death! The siege apparently didn't even last long enough for Brad Pitt's hair to get dirty. Pitt was uninspiring as a hero. Although he was quite effective as a pouting little brat. His great fighting skill consisted mostly of a jumping sucker punch with a sword. The film was apparently a vehicle to showcase his buffed body and lack of acting talent. Peter O'Toole was decent and I am pleased this is not his swan song, it would be a travesty. Orlando Bloom, while he looked the part of pretty Paris, certainly could have used some acting lessons because he was boring as a wooden horse, strike that, the wooden horse was slightly more interesting. It was a complete waste of time, money, and effort to watch it and an unspeakable waste to make it in the first place. All involved should be ashamed."
"benier","7","13","25","28 May 2005"," The reason we tell these tales over and over again is no accident...
","This movie was absolutely perfect. Brad Pitt has arrived as a great actor; and matches the legendary Peter O'Toole (who plays King Priam) as he creates an organic, believable 'Achilles'. The fact that Wolfgang Petersen overlooks the orthodoxy of Homer and amalgamates Virgil's Aenied ( including the Trojan horse) is of no matter to me. Nor does it matter, the absence of the mysticism of Greek mythos. The relevance of the Greek Gods has been suppressed in this film. The terse dialogue still respects the ancient characters and concepts. Ed Bana is just as I would imagine 'Hektor' would be like. Brian Cox plays 'Agamemnon' as he could possible be in reality: selfish, ambitious and yet somehow heroic. 'Odysseus' perfectly balanced humanity is well preserved from the Homeric prose (brilliantly and humbly played by British stage veteran, Sean Bean) Indeed, the personalities of the characters and how they contrast are what make the Iliad the ultimate tale of human morality.<br/><br/>The screenplay by David Benioff is well adjusted to modern times w/o sacrificing the mores of that time. The only other period-film that succeeded in both being ""Hollywood"" and actually convincing, time-wise, was Tombstone (directed by George P. Cosmatos, 1993). Troy highlights the vanities that we no longer analyze within ourselves. Pride and Greed are now interwoven into our culture. That was probably the true motivation that inspired Homer in his day Â– which was a time very similar to our own. The luxury of ancient Greece and Troy easily matched our opulence and privileges. The bourgeois trappings of a comfortable society rend the same beasts: sheep, wolves andÂ… lions. <br/><br/>The reason we tell these tales over and over again is no accident. And we really are no different than those who lived before Christ or Muhammad. Our destiny awaits us."

I'm planning to be a movie director when i'm older and watched the bonuses. The filming and effects were really good. Especially as they filmed the beach scenes in Mexico and the town parts in Malta. They used their cameras well. They didn't give up any scenes due to hurricanes smashing down the wall of Troy either. It really inspires me to be a director even more and i'm learning things just by watching these bonuses. As for the three boys:- Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom, I congratulate them on a good movie. Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did all their own stunts and not have someone else do it for them which I think is really dedicated to acting. Eric Bana hasn't been in many movies that I've absolutely loved, so I never liked him as an actor, but ever since Troy he's shown he can play a loved character. Orlando Bloom is doing really good now ever since hes acting career started from Lord of the Rings. Fighting is an excellent part for him I think. The thing I loved about Brad Pitt and his character was that he was a tough man but he was also a loyal man to those who earn respect. It was a pity Achilles was on the wrong side of war. It would have been great if Troy had won their fight and it was so sad when Hector got killed. All together the three of them did an excellent job of the movie and i also congratulate the director.

"dbborroughs","9","13","25","15 May 2004"," Its not history or the legend, just damn good film making
","Your ""Loath to Love"" quota for this film will depend on two important factors, first what do you think of Brad Pitt? If you hate him stay away. Second you have to throw out the idea that this is anything other than suggested by the historical/legendary event, if you can do that you're golden.<br/><br/>Since I like Brad Pitt and am not bothered by historical accuracy, especially involving one we really know little about I fell in love with this movie. I think this is a grand spectacle of the sort they don't make any more- or didn't until computers made it easier to do so. This is dark brooding heroes and wondrous action. This is why I love movies, you go somewhere else for three hours and just let it wash over you.<br/><br/>The only major flaw seems to be the fact that once the horse shows up it races to the end much much too fast.<br/><br/>I can not argue the purists who want the story as told over the centuries, but allowing that they condense a ten year, very complicated story into just under three hours, its amazing. I will whole heartedly  say that the removal, or at least the questioning of the Gods role in things  makes it even more tragic since we are the ones who made the mistake and as such we have no one to blame but ourselves.<br/><br/>The cast is across the board good to excellent, with Peter O'Toole a certainty for an Oscar nom, if not award next year. I also want to take back some of the terrible things I said about Eric Bana in the Hulk. At last he has a role that explains why he was given the role in that film (even if it doesn't explain why he was so flat there.) Here Bana is a wonderful Hector, a man who's love for his brother brings everything down around him. We feel for his pain.<br/><br/>This is an excellent film, 9 out of 10, for a last twenty minutes in need of lengthening."

Brad Pitt looks like Jayne Mansfield, to say the least. And the rest of the cast? Besides Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie, there wasn't one who could act properly. Eric Bana even brings some sparkles to the movie, but he could do it better, IF we had a REAL director behind the cameras.<br/><br/>Am I overreacting? I don't think so.

It wasn't an Excellent, Star wars, LOTR, kind of film but, it was great.<br/><br/>First, Brad Pitt's performance was excellent he did well. I've never thought much of him until now.

","I am reading Homer's Iliad these days and thought watching the movie will help me visualize the story. I actually lost track of time and had a good amount of adrenaline released in my circulation. <br/><br/>I think, criticizing the movie as too Hollywoodish doesn't make sense too me. If you're interested in more historical facts and less flamboyancy, well there are many documentaries about it. After all it is very likely that Homer's Iliad is a cluster of changed and exaggerated pieces of true history (if any) over half a millennium of oral poetry. <br/><br/>Ohh by the way,in my opinion Eric Bana's performance in this movie is far better than Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom's."
"brad-draper","9","9","16","22 December 2005"," ""Troy"" - The Honest Soul of the Iliad on Film
","Given some cynical reviews based, I think on a lack of knowledge on the subject matter, I had avoided the current 2004 epic movie ""Troy"". But I bought it the other day for only ten dollars in a bargain bin - 2 disc deluxe DVD widescreen edition even. And after viewing the film I can only say it retains the soul of Homer's ""The Iliad"", that fantastic bard of Greek poetry that describes the tragedy of the senseless war between Trojans and Greeks, with the tale of Achilles, King Priam, Hector, Helen, and Paris in tow. It is a great sad story and to see it put to film in such a proper way is a real joy of film making from a fan's point of view.<br/><br/>But why the professional critic's cynicism? Perhaps because of jealousy that Brad Pitt, as the legendary Greek warrior Achilles, can play a successful portrait with his athleticism, male sensitivity, and ultimate male brutishness that is so effective? Or is it that Peter O'Toole's character as Troy's King Priam is a tour-de-force and that critics have always loathed Peter for some reason - is he too good? Perhaps Hector played by Eric Bana is just a bit too human? That Paris' Orlando Bloom is ultimately a coward turned hero but in being so, in irony, kills in tragedy? That love is what sometimes causes wars? And maybe it is because the heroic women in this film, especially Helen, seen as a tragic painting by Diane Kruger, crushes the fragile male soul with her sad and hopeless ultimate beauty? Perhaps this movie is too close to human tragedy to be criticized by jaded movie critics?<br/><br/>In capturing the soul of ""The Iliad's"" theme, this is indeed a film of epic tragedy. Everybody dies. Revenge is the cycle unbound and unending. The warrior kills until he is killed and then his champion's kill the killers. This is the cycle of the ancient world, the cycle that the civilized world seeks to unbind. In watching this film it is quick to analyze that the warrior's soul is not the way of mankind's successful future, and so this film in a way is good history lesson from the past tale of ""The Iliad"" and how not to be as a civilized world. Greek tragedy is an awesome ancient lesson that the modern world must learn from, and movie making as such does justice to popularize, but not glorify this image of tragedy. ""Troy"" directed by Wolfgang Peterson teaches this lesson.<br/><br/>""Troy"" is a long film best viewed across either a lazy afternoon or two nights. The spectacle of ancient Mycenaean Greek battle is as authentic as the unknown of those times are to research from scant historical records. The weapons and tactics of the era in this movie are an attempt at authenticity, albeit a bit too much black leather going on. I think Achilles' armor would have been of the most polished brass of the time, not the dark fair that adorned the ultra fit Brad Pitt's form. But the shields, spears, swords, ships, chariots, and basic form of armor are historically correct as much as can be gleaned from rare records. The one on one battles depicted are violent and brutal, perhaps accurate, and if so, show a hacking time when man pitted upon man in ancient battle, makes the NFL look like a sewing circle.<br/><br/>The sweep of ancient epic battles and walled cities is captured in this movie with a combination of effective digital effects and real life action. The widescreen transference from film to digital DVD is very well done without any noticed pixillation. And the women in this film's tears are heartbreakingly real. The soundtrack conveys a haunting sadness to the ear as if tragedy is always present. <br/><br/>I was surprisingly pleased with ""Troy"" both from a technical, historical, story telling, and acting point of view. Highly recommended for it's type of film fair. Epic cinema at it's highest form. ""Troy"" is not quite ""Spartacus"" or ""Ben Hur"" but it wants to be, and is close to this type of film making. <br/><br/>B. A. Draper<br/><br/>Not for kids, it is rated R for extreme battle violence, tasteful sexual scenes, and disturbing adult themes of tragedy."
"Philip-12","8","9","16","20 August 2005"," Very nice adaptation of the Iliad by Homer
","The Helen of Troy story is still great after 2500 years. Wolfgang Petersen does not disappoint and mixes mythology, myth and legend very nicely. Brad Pitt does a nice job as Achilles. Physically he is a good fit for the near-god. Brian Cox as the imperious Agamemnon is perfect. It is good to see him in more expanding roles. The battle scenes were well put together and believable. The special effects were well done but not overwhelming though it is hard not to do when a flotilla is called for and a cast of thousands; remember, Helen had a face that launched a thousand ships. Overall, a nice film and one to add to the DVD collection. It is too bad it went in and out of theatres too fast to give it justice."

"Su-Chan","8","9","16","10 March 2005"," Character Review: ""IS THERE NO ONE ELSE?!""
","As a former ""Greek geek"" follower of ancient mythology, I was anxious to see this film and ready to pick it apart for inaccuracies. In fact, I did spend the first half of the movie doing this (Where are the gods and goddesses, who were so prominent in the Iliad? Where was Cassandra, one of literature's most fascinating and tragic heroines?) But after awhile, I sat back and accepted some one else's interpretation of the legend. If you do the same, you may enjoy this movie, too. Troy was a pleasant surprise and much better than I expected. Here's my review on the main characters and the actors who portrayed them: <br/><br/>ACHILLES: Brad Pitt was really fun to watch as Achilles, not only because of his famously sculpted bod but because he really put more depth into a character who seemed more like a fighting machine in the Iliad. I also liked how the screenwriter made Achilles a mortal (unlike the legend, where he's 95% immortal) so that his actions seemed even more brash and arrogant. The only problem is that movie viewers like to see their heroes go through personal growth, and Achilles doesn't achieve much of this (the writer's fault?) Other than the highly contrived love-interest in Briseis, Achilles doesn't seem very human at all. Highlight: Achilles' first fight, which lasts all of 10 seconds, and his arrogant exclamation: ""Is there no one else?!"" Final grade: C for character writing, B for acting.<br/><br/>HECTOR: Wow! Eric Bana had far and away the best performance in this film as Hector. Bana gave Hector even more depth and pathos than the character had in the Iliad. Hector is a hero for the ages, a leader whom everyone even today could admire: courageous and strategic, yet compassionate and respectful. Hector actually earns the respect of the audience as the story advances. Highlights: The anguish on his face after he finds out that he killed Patroklus, a boy-warrior too young for battle; the touching moments when he says farewell to everyone he loves to face his inevitable death-fight with Achilles. Final grade: A for character writing, A+ for acting.<br/><br/>Paris: People have complained about Orlando Bloom's Paris as being too much of a wimp. But the fact is, Paris WAS a wimp, and Bloom portrayed him very accurately. My only gripe is the insipid dialogue that he has to carry (""But I LOVE her!"") and his lack of chemistry with Helen. Highlight: After he's wounded by Menelaus, the terror and humiliation he shows as he scampers back to hang onto Hector's leg for protection. Final grade: B for character writing, B for acting.<br/><br/>HELEN: Poor casting. Diane Krueger was pretty enough (no matter who was chosen to be Helen, people would still complain about the lack of beauty), but her inexperience as an actress produced a cardboard character. It would have been better to cast a box-office draw (but then, I suppose Nicole and Julia wouldn't be relegated to secondary role). Highlights: None! Final grade: C for character writing, F for acting.<br/><br/>AGAMEMNON: Brian Cox was marvelous, if a little hammy, in the role of the film's chief villain. Even though he over-acted the role, he was always fun to watch. His dose of humor was welcome in an otherwise brutal and tragic story. Highlight: When Paris and Hector approach Agamemnon and Menelaus for a fight, Agamemnon says wryly, ""I see you're not hiding behind your high walls. Valiant of you. Ill-advised, but valiant."" Final grade: B for character writing, A- for acting.<br/><br/>It's been said that the Iliad (and Aeneid) is utterly unfilmable in today's times, but I believe Wolfgang Peterson did a good job of making this legend appealing for a contemporary audience. The fact is, adding the gods of Mount Olympus would have been silly (imagine a campy 1950's version of this movie!), and it makes the story even more dramatic that the main heroes - namely Achilles and Hector - realize that the gods won't help them and that they are left to their own devices."
"luciani-ryan","10","9","16","5 June 2004"," Very impressed
","A superb movie all around...I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It seems most of the bad reviews on this film are coming from those who either wanted it to be 100% ""historically accurate"", or people who seem to just despise Brad Pitt for some reason (jealousy?). Either way, I myself am not a big Pitt fan, although I was pleasantly surprised to see he pulled off the role of Achilles much better than I had expected. Arrogant, cocky, yet at times sulky and emotional...he hit it imo. As for not sticking totally to 'The Iliad', well, I don't know if I could sit through an 8 hour movie because that's what it would take basically. Sure, Agememnon and Menelaus did not die at Troy, but in this case it made the movie better, which is more important to me. The fact is, most of the major events, battles, and characters were depicted accurately...much closer than say, Gladiator for instance. Paris and Hector in Sparta, Helen to Troy, the battles, Hector killing Petriclus, Achilles rage and then killing Hector, dragging his body in front of the walls of Troy, Priam going to Achilles' tent, etc, etc...bottom line is the main points were covered and I expect a certain amount of stray from the story to begin with. Sticking to Homer's version 100% would have made the movie longer and maybe even boring at times (we do not even know how accurate 'The Iliad' is to begin with!). I went to see this movie hoping for an epic spectacle with a fair amount of historical accuracy and not for The Iliad on screen. I got exactly what I wanted and much, much more."
"ewporter","Null","9","16","17 May 2004"," Will Be One of the ten best movies of 2004
","Troy, the movie, has flaws, but it also many strengths. It is a much better than many of the critics give it credit for.<br/><br/>Yes, Brad Pitt's Achilles is not perfect, but I can not think of any major actor who could do a better job portraying a man who thinks, moves, fights, and looks like he is an equal to the gods. Eric Bana's Hector was fantastic. Contrary to many of the reviews I did not find there were too many characters to allow any to be well developed. Yes, there were many characters, as the Iliad requires, but Achilles, Hector, and Paris were well developed and the story largely revolved around them.<br/><br/>Among the minor characters, Sean Bean's Odysseus shined, as did Saffron Burrows' portrayal of Hector's wife. The costumes and sets did a wonderful job of bringing to life the late Bronze Age, a time more primitive and further removed from our collective consciousness than that of ancient Rome.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were less gratuitous and were easier to follow than in many movies. Several of the one-on-one fight scenes, particularly that between Achilles and Hector, were exceptional.<br/><br/>For me the movie's 2 hour and 40 minutes sped by. The script did have a few dumb lines, but also some good one. It is foolish to criticize the movie for taking substantial liberties with Homer's book. Any high budget movie of the Iliad that was faithful to Homer would have been financial suicide for its investors and much less satisfying to most viewers.<br/><br/>My major complaints were that Diane Kruger, although clearly attractive, was not the rare one-in-a-hundred-thousand beauty (like the young Candice Bergen) that Helen should have been. I personally found Saffron Burrows much more attractive. I also thought that Brain Cox's Agamemnon was a little too much of a cartoon villain. But then many have complained the plot was too full of moral equivalence, so perhaps painting someone as a black hat was needed to make the story more emotionally accessible to the masses.<br/><br/>In summary, I think it is likely that when 2004 ends, Troy will be at least one of my 10 favorite films of the years."
"themarina1","9","9","16","20 May 2004"," Mythical melodrama almost at it's best
","No one did this story better than Homer. We'll leave it at that. However, the movie was great for what it was, a movie. Sure it's based on the great classic and the 1000+ year old story, but no one ever said it was accurate. I do think that had the writers been closer to the original story (as told by Homer), we would have seen a much better movie but, Hollywood being what it is, great is never great enough.<br/><br/>It's all here: romance, deceit, love, hate, revenge, death, tortured lover etc. I went in not expecting much but great costumes, beautiful people, amazing action sequences and mediocre acting. What I walked out with was a little more. O'Toole was amazing. He does deserve an Oscar for his portrayal of Priam. Sean Bean was also a notable supporting character. I never cease to be amazed by his roles. Though I've never seen him in a starring role he is never forgettable but rather a force to be reckoned with. Bana surprised me with his talents (especially after the sad, sad mess that was Hulk) but most of all, I was impressed by Brad Pitt. Though I've always believed him to have some talent, I was a bit concerned with how well he would pull off Achilles, the greatest warrior that ever lived. I wasn't prepared for his excellent portrayal of the doomed warrior.<br/><br/>I did leave happy. I got more for my money than I had expected and this will definitely be a movie I will consider adding to my limited collection. If for nothing else, this is a good, entertaining movie. For me, it was a story of love and, indeed, honor.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Yomper","10","9","16","13 May 2004"," Only one word for this film: Amazing
","I went to see this film mainly because of Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean (I love watching movies with LOTR actors/actresses in them), and also because I've developed an interest for war films all of a sudden, ever since I saw LOTR:ROTK.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting: Everybody did a wonderful job (special mention to Eric Bana and Sean Bean). Yes, Brad Pitt's accent was a little weird at times, but it wasn't as bad as many claim it to be. Orlando Bloom did Paris very well too.<br/><br/>Next is the CGI: Excellent. Nuff' said. :)<br/><br/>Battle scenes: Strangely enough, my favorite battle scene is when Menelaus (sp?) beats up Paris. Wow, that was just... cool. I felt really sad for the prince, and I just wanted to hug him right then and there. BTW, Hector VS Achilles also had me at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Nudity, violence, etc. : In the Philippines, it was rated PG-13 (Haha! jk), thankfully. There are about... three scenes which show *ahem* sexual stuff, all with Achilles in them :P. One scene shows Helen naked,  too. As for the violence, Gladiator was more violent for me. Patroclus' throat getting slit made me wince, and one scene where Achilles cuts the  head off of some guy was so fast I didn't even get the chance to cover my eyes (yes, I'm a coward). I understand why It's rated R in other places, but for me, PG-13 was just fine.<br/><br/>Comedy: There *was* comedy in the film, though not much. Agamemnon served as the comic relief often.<br/><br/>Other stuff: Whoo, Paris gets a bow and arrows sometime in the movie! Near the end he starts shooting his enemies down without being noticed. I know the whole theatre was thinking ""woah, he turned into Legolas all of a sudden"". I know, I couldn't help but think that.<br/><br/>All in all, the film was fun, exciting, and did not contain one boring moment at all. I loved it. :) And I'm gonna see it again!"
"kurt_messick","8","12","23","31 January 2006"," A tale for our times?
","There are several problems with the film 'Troy', if one is trying to fit it too closely with the literature which inspired it, Homer's Illiad. There are too many deviations from the ancient Greek epic poem for this to be other than 'inspired by' - there are characters missing; there are characters whose fates are different from the Illiad (no spoilers, so you'll have to trust me), and the overall situation is cast in a very different light.<br/><br/>In the film, Achilles (Brad Pitt, looking more bulky than usual) is the greatest warrior alive, with a reputation unparalleled in the world. However, he is a loose cannon, as likely to kill his own leaders as the enemy. Achilles is tempted to the battle with Troy, portrayed as one of the greatest battles in history, by the call of everlasting glory. Achilles is persuaded by no less an ironic character than his own mother, who recounts to him the prophecy of an idyllic life at home should he stay, but then to be forgotten after he dies, or the chance at immortality in legend, despite the fact that he'll die at Troy. Achilles sets sail.<br/><br/>The war with Troy is portrayed as having been going on for a decade; at a peace meeting in Sparta, Paris (younger prince of Troy, Orlando Bloom) falls in love with the fair 'was this the face that launched a thousand ships' Helen, wife Sparta's king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). Helen steals away with Paris on the ship returning to Troy; Hector, the elder prince and heir to the throne (Eric Bana) is conflicted as to what to do, but opts to journey on to Troy, and the die is cast.<br/><br/>Agamemnon (Brian Cox) uses the event to band all the Greek city-states together into a final battle with Troy, the greatest rival to his power in the Aegean (and the centre of much of the civilization of the world at that time). This is where the retelling becomes much more modern. The Illiad is not so concerned with economics and hegemonies as with ethics and honour - Agamemnon is portrayed as a Realpolitick power-seeker of the first order, willing to stop at nothing to decimate allies and foes alike for his own power, willing to use honourable pretenses to achieve dishonourable ends. An astonishing armada is amassed and sets sail for the coasts of Troy. Once there, the beachhead is taken, and the first major act is a desecration of the temple of Apollo by Achilles, who nonetheless proves himself the most valuable warrior the Greeks have. At this point, the internal strife becomes as problematic for the Greeks as the front lines, as Achilles disregards the commands of Agamemnon and cares little for the political outcomes of the war.<br/><br/>The intrigues and the plotting of the Greek leaders are cast in high relief against the more pastoral leadership of 'good king' Priam (portrayed by Peter O'Toole with his characteristic panache). Hector is a strong and wise leader under his father; Paris is the foolish and rather cowardly one. (We are missing the back-story of the Illiad of how Paris came to be part of Troy's royal family, and it is assumed that there is no unusual story there.) We rather lose sight of the fact that, indeed, Paris stole the queen of Sparta (again, the modern idea creeps in - in our day, a woman would have the right to choose where she wished to live, but not so in the ancient world; one might question whether the queen of a nation has the right to abandon her role and 'shack-up' with the neighbouring prince at will, but I digress...).<br/><br/>The people of Troy are seen as virtuous despite the fact that they are defending the less-defensible position morally. The Greeks might have right on their side in some respects, but this is lost in their brutality and by the unbridled greed of their leaders, and of course it is the ordinary foot-soldiers, including Achilles, who have to do the fighting and dying for the cause, as their princes exchange gifts of gold, money and priceless art treasures to congratulate themselves on their victories.<br/><br/>The film portrays the battle lasting only a matter of a few weeks; the brutality of the battle scenes is as dramatic as any in modern war films, just as bloody. The single-combat scenes between Achilles and Hector, Hector and Patroclus, and others are extremely well choreographed, introducing various techniques I've not seen before in sword-play films.<br/><br/>I don't think it is a spoiler to give away the major ending here, in that Troy eventually falls, not to military might, but to trickery. The Greek ships have sailed, leaving only an offering to Poseidon behind - a giant horse. The Trojan Horse (if the Greeks built it, why is it always called 'the Trojan Horse?') is carted into the city whose walls cannot be breeched, and the people celebrate their victory. As they rest after the revelry, Greek soldier inside the horse emerge (including in this telling, Achilles), open the gates to the city, and the Greek army swarms in. However, the individual endings of the different characters is still left up in the air - who survives, and who doesn't? This is even more crucial than the pre-ordained destruction of the city.<br/><br/>A nice touch to the film is the hand-off of the great sword of Troy to a young man named Aeneas, with the instruction that so long as a Trojan has the sword, Troy will live on (this connects to the Roman epic poem, the Aeneid, which tells of Aeneas' journey from Troy to Rome, making them the spiritual successors of Troy, particularly meaningful when the Romans then conquer the Greeks)."

","This movie is by far the most impressive war film to date. Yes, that's right, it deserves to be better than Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and Gladiator as well. Brian Cox is absolutely ferocious as Agamemnon and Brad Pitt is as good as he gets playing Achilles. Eric Bana brings amazing honor and devotion to the role of Hector, especially when he delivers the movie's best line, ""Honor the Gods, Love your women, and Defend your country!"" This spectacular production offers battle sequences UNLIKE ANY OTHER, both epic-scale and man-to-man. An amazing retelling of Homer's ""The Illiad."" Thankfully, Orlando Bloom is there to bring his stupidity and selfishness to the role of the callow Trojan Prince Paris. By the way, it got completely robbed at the Oscars of 2005 and it still should have one its only nomination for Best Costume Design over ""The Aviator."""

Of course, some liberties were taken from the original source material, but that is to be expected given the limitations of the medium. No Cassandra. No Gods interfering. No one of any redeeming value on the side of the Greeks whatsoever. But... the antagonism between Achilles and Agammenon, the relationship between Paris and Hector, the depictions of the different reasons why men go to war are all skillfully depicted in the film. And epic battles kick ass. Go see it."
"jd_mystique","Null","12","23","13 May 2004"," Review from a teenage drama queen
","So, to be totally honest one of the main reasons I went to this movie was because of the cast. Brad, Orlando and Eric, what more could you want? But I actually really enjoyed it. I was a little bit wary because I had read several bad reviews, but I didn't think there was anything wrong with it, I thought it was highly enjoyable.<br/><br/>It was a bit squemish at places with a bit of blood and gore, but the best thing about the entire movie was how cleverly they mixed in the romance with the battles. There was 3 romance stories going on, firstly between Paris and Helen of course, then between Hector and his wife, and Archillis and his romantic partner who I won't say cause it gives it away.<br/><br/>
But OMG Brad Pitt! What a wonderful character he played! So masculine, and dangerous and at the same time so adorably sweet! It's interesting I walked in an Orlando fan and walked out a Brad fan. He was fantastic.<br/><br/>Being a Lord of the Rings fan, its funny how much LOTR and Troy are the same. There's similar lines at places for eg ""I would have stayed with you my brother."" And of course with Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean staring in the movie. Wonderful<br/><br/>So yeah, go see this movie. It deserves the recognition its recieved, and will certainly be one of this years big blockbusters."

","I heard that several years ago, Val Kilmer starred as Moses in a musical version of the Ten Commandments. As horribly bad as the prospect of that ""epic"" may seem, there is no feasible way in which it could have surmounted the dizzying heights of badness that this egregious disaster attains. They started with a bad script and simply worked their way down. The writing would actually be quite brilliant as some kind of satire on recent epics of the sword and sandal mode, such as Gladiator. Presented in the absolutely deadpan, robotic performances or Mr Pitt, Mr Bloom and company only accentuates the plain poor quality of the script. Check out the quotes page to experience just a taste of the awesome mediocrity in almost every line. David Benioff shows himself to be a contemporary William McGonogall in taking the eloquence of Homer's verse and converting it into this. He is the worst kind of Hollywood hack. The direction is just terrible. Actors wander around the set aimlessly, striking suitably macho poses, speaking their lines as if, like Bela Lugosi, they have learnt their lines phonetically. It is a bit like watching an amateur production of Shakespeare, but without even a good text. Brad Pitt is laughable as Achilles, far from the mythic, complex character depicted in any proper representation of the myth. His style here channels McCauley Culkin, as he struts around acting like a contemptible brat (showing off his enviable pecs simultaneously). Orlando Bloom presumably intends to portray a classic Paris who is more idealistic lover than warrior, but he comes across as an effeminate fourteen-year-old boy. Eric Bana is fine actor and usually a charismatic presence, but here he serves primarily as muscle-bound eye-candy. The leading ladies are not even worth mentioning. Peter O'Toole is the exception, displaying utmost professionalism, but you can somehow tell that he really did not enjoy making this picture. The special effects are rubbish. There is nothing epic about a battle which appears to be made up of about ten guys and a billion CGI clones. Effects of this nature somehow turn out to be both absurdly grandiose and rather pathetic at the same time. Cecile B DeMille may have had the subtlety of a Soviet diplomat, but at least he didn't cheat his audience, opting to do things the proper way. I'm sure the filmmakers could have paid for tens of thousands of extras using half of Brad Pitt's salary alone, so, for me, these lazily constructed CGI effects just aren't good enough. The score is utterly horrible. I read on the trivia page that the music was composed in 1 1/2 months after Warner Bros. rejected Gabriel Yared's effort. It most certainly shows. The the middle eastern-style vocalisation was reasonably fairly effective in the opening, but very quickly grated with overuse. Other elements of the score included (now) clichéd percussive passages (suspiciously similar to parts of Apocolypto), the likes of which have been done much, much better by Howard Shore and others, and sweeping faux-romantic orchestral music, some hideous bastard-child of early Berlioz and John Williams, alternately sugar coated and (no doubt intended to be) epic. I also noticed a few instances of less-than-subtle plagiarism, shamelessly ripping-off Shostakovich and others. James Horner has produced some respectable work, but this is not in that category. I loathe it almost as much as his deplorably saccharine Titanic theme. To sum up, this film (sorry, movie; film implies artistic merit/intentions) owes absolutely nothing to Homer, besides an apology. It to the Illiad what I, Robot is to the memory of Isaac Asimov. I thought that the sacking of temple of Apollo in the film was an apt unconscious metaphor. I am aware that cinema and epic poetry are two entirely disparate mediums, but this does not even stand up as a movie. It is truly appalling. The only benefits that could possibly be derived from Troy are the hours of fun you and your friends will have bagging it out after you pick it up out the bargain bin in a few years. Epically bad."

","""Troy"" is a very disappointing, predictable, nonsensical spectacle. Two far better movies are ""Zulu"" (for spectacle and other values) and ""Walk in the Sun."" Also ""Apocalypse Now"" is far superior. These three films exemplify aspects of good film making that are missing from ""Troy,"" namely good acting, good plot, penetrating dialogue. ""Troy"" lacks an aesthetic. Peterson has trivialized Homer and ""The Iliad,"" a process expected, perhaps, as that is what movies do to their ""inspirations."" Nonetheless, it is not offensive to combine events from different ancient legends, but when the fundamentals of the story are distorted, the result is dramatic histrionics without substance. This movie is a litany of numerous flaws in such an ""action thriller"": faulty, superficial characterization, wooden or hammy acting, inane or platitudinous dialogue, gratuitous nudity, artificial complications, maudlin meandering, absurd costuming, vacuous facial expressions.

"Agrenish","6","14","28","4 June 2004"," Revolutionary Action Epic Drama Can't Keep The Timer Ticking
","Boy, when I first saw the previews for this movie I was excited to see it. It looked like a winner with the grand sweeping epic camera movements and the Lord Of The Rings-like battles and armor and swords going on... only in Greece! And I've always liked ancient Greece and Greek mythology and I still enjoy watching ""Clash Of The Titans"" for all its 80's cheesiness.<br/><br/>But there was something wrong with this movie, many things in fact. First off, and most glaring to me, is that I could see the special effects and the make-up. Were they on a tight schedule? Was there something overlooked? I don't know... but early in the film when we're being given a close-up of Brian Cox's face, I could see where the wig's fake forehead ended and where Cox's forehead began. Blood squirts that weren't only non-realistic, they were the same. I've watched many movies in my life, so maybe I'm more prone to catch these mistakes, but then again, I didn't even try. And apparently neither did they.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's nitpicky stuff; let us talk about the actors. The main character (Pitt) is neither good nor bad, the bad guy (Cox) is mostly bad, the good guy (Bana) is really good, his brother's (Bloom) a punk, brat lustmord who doesn't deserve any of what he gets, but for some reason I felt like I was always being swayed to care about him. The bad guy's brother (Gleeson) is a bit boarish but I felt for him.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, acting-wise I thought Gleeson was the best. In his time on the screen, (which was less-than deserved, I might add) he showed more sides to one man than I saw of any of the other characters. I especially liked short moment when this strong king, leader of thousands was reduced to a shivering, fragile and vulnerable man. Most of them were flat, two star characters that couldn't get past the screenwriter's flat representation of them.<br/><br/>Pitt tries his best to shed that southern Californian look and act like a killing machine that seeks immortality for the same stupid reasons we people today try to seek fame... but fails, not by much though. O'Toole, who I was most pleased to see in this project failed me more than anyone else. If this was his imitation of a talking carcass, I would have been more pleased. He looked confused and out of place with this hammy dialogue. Cox and Bloom were equally horrible, Bloom perhaps the worst of the lot. Bana however was quite good, as well as Rose Byrne who I liked quite well. Diane Kruger was pretty and all, but then again, she didn't really have to act very much so tell will tell if she has any talent behind her flesh.<br/><br/>The one thing I did like was the fact that I didn't know who to root for. Both side had these terrible flaws that truly represented war in life. Both sides saying they're right when both sides are clearly wrong. There are likable characters on both sides and either despicable or dishonorable on both sides. Every time I was on the verge to root for one I went, ""Oh yeah, but that guy is there and he's doing something I don't like"". I wish they had concentrated on that aspect of the film rather than trying to outdo LOTR on the massive size of the armies.<br/><br/>CGI: Cheap ways to convince the masses that we still have the ability to conj our up enough people to remake Ben-Hur.<br/><br/>Another annoying aspect of this mediocre film is how shiny everything is. The very fact the O'Toole's character is alive at what, eighty, back in 2000 BC or so? Ridicules. One hundred years ago is was rare to see someone at eighty, never mind back when they didn't have medicines for illnesses, aspirin for headaches or anything better than a hot poker to close gushing wounds, unless these Greeks had help from the gods.<br/><br/>Which brings me up to another question... where we the Gods? Bring out Zeus and Aries, Hermes and Hephaestus (who built Achilles armor specifically for the siege of Troy, by the way) and Apollo and Poseidon and Hera and all the other wonderful Greek gods and goddesses? Don't talk about the river of Styx; show it to me! Obviously they didn't make this movie to be realistic; otherwise they would have gone with dirty fingernails, rotten teeth, mud, grime, gore and hair on the women's legs. Excalibur did most of these things well.<br/><br/>In the end, can I suggest that you watch this film?<br/><br/>Sure. As long as you leave you brain at home. This is sort of like an emerald, shiny looking, pretty to look at and a semi good feel about it, yet it's easily flawed, too fragile to drop and in the end, just a rock. In other words, this is just an action movie hiding behind the skin of an epic drama. This has about as much drama as the last time you saw a bomb's timer wind down to three seconds whilst someone was disarming it.<br/><br/>Find yourself a real epic. Braveheart, Excalibur, any of the LOTR's and Lawrence of Arabia come to mind.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>+: Decent to very good fight scenes, some clever camera moves here and there, good acting by Bean, Gleeson, Byrne and Bana. An extra point for the Hector/Ajax fight, that had me going for a while. <br/><br/>-: Bad acting by Cox, Bloom, O'Toole and Burrows (Pitt is in-between), no appearances by the Greek Gods, everything is too shiny, bad special effects and makeup, CGI overuse and countless other flaws too numerous to mention on one single scrap review by a hack writer.<br/><br/>~*~*~  ~*~*~<br/><br/>Interesting note...<br/><br/>There are three actors in Braveheart in this movie: Brian Cox, Brandon Gleeson & James Cosmo. All of them die.<br/><br/>Additionally, there are two actors from LOTR: Sean Bean & Orlando Bloom. Both live."

"bob the moo","Null","13","26","28 May 2004"," If all you want is spectacle then this will just about do you  but it is dull, emotionless spectacle
","King Agamemnon sweeps across the land with his mighty army and his supposedly invincible warrior Achilles at the front. Meanwhile one his subject is brokering peace with the princes of Troy  Hector and Paris. When Paris steals the beautiful Helen from Menelas and takes her to Troy it sparks a battle and gives Agamemnon the chance to seize Troy. Inside the city walls of Troy the defences are build and the walls relied on to withstand the attack as they have so often, while on the beaches the mighty army of Agamemnon land and prepare for a long and bloody battle.<br/><br/>Let us not forget that this film is a summer blockbuster and, as such, the important thing is spectacle and noisy effects rather than anything else  it's a sad fact but it is a fact. If this is what you want from the film then it has plenty of action, plenty of big bronzed men with swords, heroic deaths and big set pieces. If this is all you want then you are very easy to please and I salute you for that  I wanted more than just action and unfortunately I found Troy to be devoid of anything else of value. In terms of action and effects it all looks good and is technically impressive but the problem with the action, nay the whole film, is that it has zero emotional involvement to draw you in. I could barely care less who lives or dies, who wins or loses because these were not people  they were just big, larger than life blocks  the gods may have been removed from the story but they have been replaced by Petersen who views these characters as his playthings instead!<br/><br/>I won't get into petty squabbles over the changes to the source material (I'm reviewing the film in itself) but it did seem to me that the loss of the gods is part of the problem. With the gods' meddling, all the fighting is their fault and we would have felt for the characters  they had no choice. Without the gods the whole war is silly and pointless, based on the silly crush of a boy on a woman who is known for her beauty more than her character (a beauty that will fade). For this reason I never felt for any of them because I wasn't sure who I was rooting for  I was against them all and only wanted it all to be over. But hang on Bob  aren't you missing the point? Well, maybe. I thought that myself  this is a sort of anti-war film after all so maybe the pointlessness of the whole affair is the message the film is delivering? Maybe, but I doubt it. The film tries to be anti-war by having several speeches about the futility of it all and how it never ends but then at the same time it revels in the battle scenes, the heroic deaths, the honour of the men and the roar of battle. It wants to have it's cake and eat it too but in the end all it does is undermine itself in both regards. The situation is silly and pointless and the film knows it  indeed it tries to move way from the battle for Helen as quickly as it can and make it a bigger thing  but it fails, the foundation is weak and never engaged me and attempts to draw me in later were poor. All the story manages to do is to slow the film way down between the battles  it gets the point where I found the film painfully dull and it all was full of it's own self-importance without having anything to actually back up this claim.<br/><br/>The cast is deep in names and faces but very few actually have anything to do  like I said, these are not characters; just blocks to be moved like toy soldiers. Pitt is, well, Brad Pitt. He is very sexy, he looks pretty, he moves well and his body is well sculpted: if that is all you want then that is what he delivers. What he doesn't do is deliver a character or a performance. He plays his hero like an arrogant, petulant child and his woeful attempts to give him a personality or emotion in the final stages of the film are just that  woeful. As a blockbuster star he is OK and does what he normally does, but let us never think for a minute that he is an actor. Bloom shows the same acting ability that he did in LOTR, ie none. He is weedy and needy as a character and it needed a talented actor to deliver this, Bloom can't do it. Bana is a good actor (see Chopper) and he has a good presence here even if his material is weak  for my money he was the star of the film and he outshone Pitt. Kruger is beautiful no doubt but she brings nothing else to the table. Cox is good because he not only seems to be enjoying himself but also is sending the whole film up! He is not a kingly king, he is a modern one and his performance comes close to taking the p*ss. The rest of the cast features a large number of faces that add class even if they have no material to really do anything with  Gleeson, Bean, O'Toole and the ever-reliable James Cosmo.<br/><br/>Overall this film looks great and will provide spectacle if that's all you want  but be warned that it cannot sustain it's running time and it gets very dull between all the noisy effect shots. The story is dull and lacking in any sort of emotional involvement  a fact that makes it duller and takes away from the impact of the action scenes. This is expensive and a big noisy film but it is so deeply flawed and pointless that I found it hard to get through. I'll leave others to debate the issues over the source material, all I cared about was if it was an enjoyable summer film or not  it isn't."
"movito72","9","13","26","17 May 2004"," Brad Pitt proves he is an actor and ""Troy"" kicks off the summer!
","Brad Pitt was much better than expected in this decent effort. It had some great moments, especially the one-on-one battles between Paris/Menelaus and Hector/Achilles. Many parts of the film were a little too over Movie-ized, like right before the Achilles/Hector fight when Hector says goodbye to everyone and shows his wife the secret passage out of the city to protect his son (who actually was thrown off a building during the siege). Eric Bana might as well have turned to the audience and winked, because anyone who did not know he was going to lose to Achilles after all of that must have been asleep. Plus, they condensed the Trojan War into a week! They made this big thing in the film about being remembered for thousands of years, and this was played up as the main reason Achilles went to the war, but all he did in the movie was fight one battle and duel Hector! The rest of the time he moped around in his tent, brooding and staring down Briseis until she slept with him. However, for anyone who was not familiar with the story of Troy, this would have been an excellent film, and there were definitely some great moments. The producers were pushing a little too hard for Oscar nods. They even had a song arranged to the score over the end credits! Plus, it was like ""see Brad Pitt cry! Give him an Oscar!"" Well, was certainly his finest performance to date, and overall a very enjoyable film if not based off of the Iliad."
"ExpendableMan","3","17","36","23 March 2007"," Whoops, it's rubbish
","What with all the anticipation for the macho thunder epic 300's imminent release, fans of bloody historical battles in movies may be tempted as I was to go back and re-watch Wolfgang Peterson's Troy as a warm up. However, I'd strongly advise against it. My first impression of the movie when it came out a few years back was that it was decent enough but ultimately forgettable and a poor runner up to Gladiator's success. A second viewing nowadays reveals the full extent of Troy's weaknesses and it is undeniably a very poor film, trading any worthy story or acting for spectacle and leaving us with a rather shallow interpretation of an epic conflict.<br/><br/>Set a really, really, really long time ago, the film sees the ruthless Agamemnon (Brian Cox), King of the Greek Empire looking for an excuse to invade his equally powerful neighbour, the nation of Troy. When his brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) is humiliated by his wife Helen (Diane Kruger) running off with Paris (Orlando Bloom), prince of Troy, Agamemnon realises his chance and sets sail with a vast armada of warships, crammed to the hilt with Greek warriors in pursuit of conquest. And suckered into this high body-count soap opera come a variety of classical Greek characters, each with his own stamp to leave on the tale.<br/><br/>On the plus side, despite being ""based on"" Homer's 'The Illiad,' Peterson makes clear this is not a direct transcription of the story. As a result, he jettisons the Gods from the proceedings, reduces the length of the war from ten years to a few months and focuses squarely on the fighting and the people involved. Thus, we are saved the sight of celestial super beings interfering in events and are given a rather straightforward war story. The downside of this however is that somehow, Peterson has managed to make what should have been an Earth shattering conflict come across as more of a quiet little skirmish.<br/><br/>Take for example the initial beach landing as the Greek armada lands on Trojan soil. Leading the charge is Brad Pitt's Achilles who has raced ahead of the rest of the fleet in order to show off. Achilles and his men then go on to win the battle almost entirely by themselves in a logic defying leap designed to show just how dangerous the man is meant to be. Unfortunately, it fails to do so and instead makes the Trojan military force come across as a woefully inept bunch of losers who were lucky to survive this long, their response to Pitt and co landing on their shores being a pathetic flight of arrows when in truth, they should have been wiped out almost immediately by a hail of death.<br/><br/>This doesn't bode well but things begin to brighten up when Agamemnon leads an assault on the city itself. The sight of the huge Greek army piling into the equally-huge Trojan force is the most visually spectacular moment of the film, but sadly it's all over too soon. The subsequents reprisals and the eventual climax to the war can only disappoint, the movie whimpering when it should roar.<br/><br/>The acting meanwhile is a game of two halves. On the one hand, there is the likes of Sean Bean as Odysseus and Pete O'Toole's King Priam lending some heavyweight class, plus Eric Bana's fantastic portrayal of the heroic Hector who is easily the best thing about the movie. Then there is Orlando Bloom's nondescript Paris, Brian Cox's spoilt brat Agamemnon and Brad Pitt's Achilles doing their level best to scupper everything. Indeed, a lot of the time it feels as though the film is turning into a Brad Pitt vanity project, the camera lingering all over him as he pouts into the lens. Somewhat worryingly, he also spends the majority of the film stark naked, turning Achilles from an all powerful force of the Gods into a narcissistic nudist.<br/><br/>These gripes aside, what ultimately wrecks Troy's aspirations of greatness comes in another common-sense defying scene in the later half that puts even the beach assault to shame with its crass stupidity. With both sides drained, morale low and stricken with tragedy, King Priam disguises himself and sneaks into the Greek camp to talk with Achilles in a moment of desperation. Yes, you didn't read that incorrectly, THE KING WALTZES INTO THE ENEMY CAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR TO HAVE A CHAT WITH THEIR CHAMPION AND NOBODY THINKS TO MENTION IT. I mean come on, surely someone in the studio system must have noticed this rather glaring piece of idiocy and pointed out to the director how incredibly stupid it was? Needless to say, this is not a good movie. One impressive battle scene and a charismatic Eric Bana are not enough to save it from drowning under it's own flabby excess. It flits between a classical tale, a war story and a Brad Pitt love-in session with a worrying ease and leaves the impression that ancient Greece was nothing but a glorified soap opera. Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven frankly, leave it in the dust. Here's hoping 300 rekindles the Greek pride."
"MinorityReporter","7","10","19","26 November 2005"," Not faithful to the source material but very entertaining!
","Troy was the first of the recent epic film wave (I'm not counting The Lord of the Rings) and it is by far the best. Alexander was too flawed, Kingdom of Heaven's protagonist was far too weak and King Arthur was... well King Arthur was just plain crap. Not only is the main protagonist of Troy very strong but the film seems much more polished than any of the two other films and the overall cast is only a few steps short of brilliant. Troy is as most people know based on The Illiad but only very superficially. Some of the characters from the book are used but overall the film is very different from the book and in my opinion it was probably for the better. Don't get me wrong the book is excellent but the God element would make the film way too complicating as the Gods would need to be introduced for it to make sense at all. Also the siege lasts about 10 years in the book but in the film it only lasts a couple of weeks and that was another thing which was probably necessary for dramatic purposes.<br/><br/>The cast is mainly very good. Brad Pitt is brilliant. He really conveyed the energy of the character, Achilles, very well. His sense of timing and overall presence is undeniable. He does an incredible job in the action sequences he is in and brings the menacing nature of Achilles very well to life. However, he also does a good job in the more intimate scenes where he seems to have great chemistry with Rose Byrne who plays Briseis. Eric Bana was the greatest surprise for me as he did an excellent job in bringing Hector to life. Like Brad Pitt he is brilliant both in the action scenes and emotional scenes. He matches the intensity of Pitt and this makes their final confrontation a true climax. Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson do excellent jobs with their characters as well and especially Cox who acts in a way that makes Agamemnon seem very devious. Two thumbs up. Peter O'Toole is great and does a seemingly impossible feat in stealing a scene from Brad Pitt. Where the casting fails, however is in that of Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger. Orlando was never a good actor but in Troy he doesn't even look the part like he does in The Lord of the Rings. He spends his time with a pathetic apologetic look on his face. Its pretty much the same with Kruger. Their chemistry is heinous. The worst I have ever seen. There is absolutely no spark whatsoever between them. I've seen better chemistry between two rocks. Aside from the two aforementioned the cast is very good. One last actor worth mentioning is Sean Bean who produces a very likable character in Odysseus.<br/><br/>The action is overall very well done and feels very epic. The combat scenes with Pitt and Bana are very well done and you really get a sense of the different combat styles used. Pitt has a very refined way of fighting. It almost looks like a dance whereas Bana's style seems more like he taught himself and thus looks nowhere near as graceful and this kind of difference in style is very appealing to me. There is another character, Ajax, who is all about brute strength just to name another. There are a few epic battles where the computer effects work great. The effects aren't brilliant like in LotR but they are decent and convincing enough. The true climax, however, is in the final battle between Hector and Achilles which is one of the best choreographed fights I have ever seen. Overall the action is very satisfactory and entertaining. Kudos to the director.<br/><br/>The story is well written and much of the dialog is both very sharp and witty and the complete refrain from contemporary expressions was in my opinion a nice touch. Instead the writers came up with other expressions like: ""You sack of wine"". which I found was highly entertaining. The story progresses in a satisfactory manner but after the climactic battle between Hector and Achilles the film does lose some steam. Overall I thought it was a good idea to leave out the whole story with the gods and instead focus on reality was a good thing as the including the gods would have made the film too confusing and far too long.<br/><br/>All in all Troy is a very good film and aside from a few glitches in the casting the film is nothing short of excellent and definitely a must-see.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Achilles was known as the immortal created by the waters of the river Styx. His heroic story reverberates across the centuries and is illuminated by the film entitled TROY. Director Wolfgang Petersen draws well on his extensive talent and has created an enormous masterpiece for audiences for years to come. Combining the enormous talents of such notables as Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana, Brian Cox, and Orlando Bloom the setting awakens with a true panorama of both spectacle and historical value. The few flaws wound within the beautiful tapestry of the film are only apparent to those who have any knowledge of the works of Homer or studied classic antiquity. The most obvious is the absence of the intimate relationship between Achilles and his lover Patroclus. Also noticeable is the Spartan soldiers allowing women at their feast instead of their traditional partners. Other minor flaws consist of squeezing the ten year siege war into the space of two hours and of course, for the more aesthetic among us, the unattractive ""Trojan Horse."" Nonetheless, the spectacular, panoramic fight scenes are impressive and magnificent. A classic film if ever there was one. ****"

","Here we go again.<br/><br/>In viewing TROY I kept getting references to category romance novels. Of course, anyone who reads this is probably going to on scratch his or her head and on this basis alone vote against this review but what the hell -- I can't change my points of view. Certainly not when the results are as weak as this. But I digress: see, the reason I join two genres that couldn't be more far apart has its madness.<br/><br/>See, category romances (for those who are unfamiliar with the term) are short two hundred-page novels that publishing houses churn out month after month and all of them tell the same kind of love story with slight variations. Oliver Stone and Wolfgang Peterson, two very respected directors who have created much better work, have decided to film the same kind of movie -- sword and sandal epics -- with slight variations and coinciding in time of release and with interchangeable actors. Instead of Colin Farrell, we have Brad Pitt who is Fabio with acting power. Instead of Angelina Jolie we have... well, no female who registers, since the actress Diane Kruger doesn't have the oomph to play Helen of Troy. Speaking of Helen and digressing again, when confronted with what must have been the most beautiful woman in history, her beauty rivaling Aphrodite, it wouldn't have killed the makers of this film to leave Helen as a hazy, brightly lit but barely seen figure. Since feminine mystery is what drives the plot, why not leave it as such? Food for thought.<br/><br/>Also adding to the mix we have Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom, both fresh out of blockbuster films, playing Hector and Paris, respectively. And Peter O'Toole, the only actor of the veterans here (which includes Julie Christie) whose part as Priam at least is worthy of something. Overall TROY felt, to me, that I could have seen any one of these movies and not known the difference (much like a romance novel) despite that one of them is a historic epic and the other a mix of history and legend which borrows freely from Homer's ""THE ILIAD"" but keeps the gods at bay. At least one fares secondary characters that I could somehow attach some meaning to, but even then, this is a film which in trying to be ""epic"" sinks under its pretensions, much like its twin Alexander."

All in all a great time at the movies.<br/><br/>Brad's wonderfully aggressive as Achilles and you can see why his opponents would fear him and his men would want to fight along side him. I don't think the departures from Homer noted in other comments are important as there's every reason to believe the myth could have arisen from events as depicted here. And all the women were captivating. I especially liked Helen and Hector's wife. Peter O'Toole almost stole the show though his part is relatively brief. But, really, EVERYONE does a great job. There's a very good grasp of courage here that's missing in most of the movies set in similar time periods.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen's far more insightful about the reality of that time, and of that kind of warfare, than his predecessors, with the possible exception of Gladiator. I found the computer generated armies only slightly disturbing. The important thing was the vision.<br/><br/>And, by the way, though brought up a Catholic: What a relief not to have to endure a lot of Biblical bunk!"

","""Troy"" is the first of many blockbusters in this summer of 2004.  When seeing a summer blockbuster, one must keep in mind several things.  First, don't expect much in the way of acting.  Second, don't expect much in the way of story.  Third, don't really expect much at all. <br/><br/>
There are exceptions to these rules, but sadly these same rules apply to ""Troy,"" which is simply overrated.  The acting, for the most part, seems void of any real emotion, as the actors seem more bored by the war than excited by it.  The story is preposterous, especially when compared to Homer's ""The Iliad.""  The movie, I believe, would have been much more entertaining if it had stuck to the story instead of making up dramatic ""twists"" that add more melodrama than anything else.  The music by James Horner, did not stir up any emotion either, so I was left unaffected by much of anything that happens in the entire movie.<br/><br/>""Troy,"" however, is probably not as dumb as I've led you to believe.  I felt that an excellent performance by Eric Bana as Hector did stand out as better than any of the others.  Also, the cinematography is excellent and the sets look extremely realistic.  The action is also decently choreographed, but still fails to excite because the audience does not care about any of the two-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>All in all, a bit better than average, and many are more tolerant of this garbage than I.<br/><br/>Final Grade: B-."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","5","8","10 January 2009"," Typical Hollywood Epic ie Not Historically Accurate But Visually Enticing and Decent Entertainment
","Petersen's 'Troy' boasts of high quality production values. The sets are lavish. The props, especially the costumes and weapons are interesting. The locations and visuals are spectacular. The cinematography is stunning. The special effects look good. The one-on.one combat scenes are well choreographed and visualized. However, the battle scenes look a bit too decorated.<br/><br/>Most fans of Hollywood epics would love 'Troy'. I stress on the word Hollywood because for me that is also a major flaw of the film. For the sake of convenience, the film isn't exactly accurate to the source and has the usual Hollywood ending. The characters and parts of the story have been slightly altered. Agamemnon who was known to be a wise thinker appears to be rash and silly here. Hector is known to be extremely strong but here he struggles to fight with Patroclis and appears clumsy and a little frightened when fighting Achilles.<br/><br/>The casting of Brad Pitt was definitely intended to pull a larger crowd. Not that Pitt is awful or anything, in fact he does show signs of good acting, but you pretty much see his usual on screen persona rather than him playing Achilles. Eric Bana, though it is questionable whether he fits the part, does a splendid job in the acting department, beating his more famous co-stars Pitt and Bloom. Orlando Bloom is rightfully weak, naive and stubborn as Paris. Brian Cox is brilliantly menacing. Julie Christie has one scene but she shines. Sean Bean is great as Odysseus. Peter O'Toole is excellent as usual. The scene where he displays Priam's despair as he watches Troy fall apart strikes a chord more than any other scene and another scene where he meets Achilles to take back the body of his dead son is incredibly done. This latter scene also has some superb dialogue.<br/><br/>The women do not have much to do. Diane Kruger is drop-dead gorgeous as Helen. She fits the part like a jigsaw puzzle and conveys Helen's guilt, ambivalence and love with grace but the character, who plays such a crucial role in history is given too little screen time here and the viewer does not get to see the depth of her thoughts and feelings. Saffron Burrows needs to eat more but her acting is better than her usual. Rose Byrne is alright.<br/><br/>'Troy' may not be a cinematic masterpiece but it is visually enticing and overall decent entertainment."

"jon.h.ochiai","8","8","15","18 May 2004"," A Tale of Men, not Gods
","Wolfgang Petersen's epic ""Troy"" is great spectacle and classic tragedy that enrolls us, due primarily to the performance of the classic movie star, Brad Pitt, in the role of Achilles. Much has been acknowledged regarding David Benioff's screenplay based on Homer's ""The Iliad"" that the Greek gods' presence has been omitted in this retelling of the fall of Troy. Also the great warrior Achilles (played by Pitt) is mortal-- more or less. This is left ambiguous with the appearance of his mother, Thetis (a brief Julie Christie), who foretells Achilles' fate. In Greek mythology, Thetis was a god who married Achilles' father, Peleus. Petersen's choice for ""Troy"" may be the right one. I did not read Homer's classic poem. Though having Achilles as a great warrior, aware of his mortality, seeking only to serve a noble king makes Achilles' courage and honor poignant. Also given the current state of affairs both ""Troy"" and ""The Iliad"" remind us of the paradox of war. Early on in ""Troy"" Achilles says, ""In war young men die, and old men talk..."" Homer's poem told a story of the fall of Troy and the cost of war. Like Homer, Petersen is also telling a story, and he does it well. <br/><br/>The Prince of Troy, Paris (Orlando Bloom), flees with Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), away from her husband, Menelaus (Bredan Gleeson). Paris's brother Hector (the charismatic Eric Bana) must protect Paris as they return to Troy. Menelaus is the brother of Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who is king of Greece. As Paris and Hector return to their father, King Priam (a wonderful Peter O'Toole), Menelaus joins forces with Agamemnon, and Odysseus (a very good Sean Bean) to invade Troy to reclaim Menelaus's honor. For Agamemnon this is merely an excuse to add Troy to his empire. However, Troy is a formidable kingdom, so Agamemnon's adviser convinces him to enroll the rogue Achilles in his quest-- a man he respects though despises. Achilles also holds no regard for the king. However, the shiny object for Achilles is that this war will serve as his legacy. Surprisingly, it turns out that this is not really vanity on his part. <br/><br/>In an interesting choice, Achilles is introduced as a ""rock star"". He has to be awaken from a drunken orgy, surrounded by gorgeous naked women, to be reminded that a deadly opponent awaits him on the battlefield. He expediently dispatches his hulking adversary, and challenges the other soldiers crying ""Is there no one else?"" Brad Pitt is an awesome and charismatic presence. For ""Troy"" he got in amazing physical condition-- his body looks phenomenal. He fights expertly with the sword and spear-- the training really shows. His fight scenes are precise, elegant, and brutal. The battle between his Achilles and Eric Bana's Hector is awe inspiring. Pitt is a gifted actor. Along with a fierce intensity, and seeming arrogance to the role, Pitt balances the performance with a sense of fatalism, and an understated compassion. He tells his captive priestess, Briseis (an effective Rose Byrne), that the ""gods wish they were us"", because life is invaluable. And there is an moving scene out of ""The Iliad"" where Priam (O'Toole) asks Achilles for the body of his son, Hector. Pitt's commanding performance really personalizes and serves this major epic. <br/><br/>Aside from Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole's outstanding supporting performances, some of the other critical characters' renderings are distinctly uneven. Orlando Bloom plays Paris as love sick, stupid, and void of courage-- probably the way the character was written. Diane Kruger is stunningly beautiful, but as Helen of Troy, ""the face that launched a thousand ships"" something is missing. These two missings are noticeable, because they are critical plot points. Bana as Hector is noble, heroic, and humane-- a great rival and foil to Achilles. O'Toole as Priam brings a touching wisdom and world weariness to the role. He is a great actor. <br/><br/>Petersen's ""Troy"" is visually stunning. The attention to both detail and the immense scale are a remarkable accomplishment. Though as great as the large battles are, it is the individual battles or conflicts that are most compelling. It is the personal quest of the hero Achilles that matters most. For that, one has to acknowledge the talents of Brad Pitt. <br/><br/>""Troy"" is solid storytelling from a great director, Wolfgang Petersen, and has a moving and compelling performance from Brad Pitt."

Now we are waiting for Hannibal and not one, but two Alexander The Great movies, and Troy has came. With such names as Brad Pitt, Peter O'Toole, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, and newly discovered Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana, it must be a spectacle. And it was. 160 minutes went with no sign of boring, the movie is very dynamic with battle scenes exchanging with the collecting of the dead and sad lamentations. The actors were very good in their roles, Pitt as an arrogant Achilles, a man who was born for glory, but who was fighting with his inner demons throughout the movie, and Bloom as a confused, scared and loving youngster, in the centre of the war that his love has started, and also Bana, as a calm and wise prince, who tries to defend his people. The story is known to us all, but i must it was very dramatic, and felt fresh and new, although two thousand years old. The things that bothered me: no sign of gods, which made the movie too realistic, I hoped to see at least Zeus and his lightning, but that's just me... :) And the Soundtrack should have been better. It's very monotone, with no catchy tune or theme, and doesn't fit with the scenes. After all I'd give it a 7.5, and hoping to see more grand epic movies... Maybe Sean Bean as a Odysess wouldn't be bad as sequel?"

","Have always been fascinated by Greek mythology and the Trojan War, and Homer's 'Iliad' is a major example as to why. Also love and appreciate many film epics, of which there are numerous classics, and they were the main reasons in my interest in seeing 'Troy' (another being that it was the film of choice at the friend/family weekly film night). <br/><br/>'Troy' had a lot going for it. A talented cast, it is hard to go wrong with Brian Cox, Sean Bean, James Cosmo, Eric Bana, Brendan Gleeson and Peter O'Toole, a more than capable director in Wolfgang Petersen (though he seemed a curious choice on paper) and a fine composer in James Horner. Will admit to not being completely sure about Brad Pitt, in terms of physicality and whether he had the complexity and presence for a character as complex as Achilles, and Orlando Bloom at first. The reviews for 'Troy' were very mixed and still are, some like and even love it and have been very passionate in their defence and others dislike it intensely and are just as passionate in their criticism. My opinion is somewhere in between, leaning towards moderately liked, there are many strengths that have been mentioned and for me some big weak points, so can see both sides of the debate very clearly.<br/><br/>Starting with the positives, 'Troy' looks great. The setting and production look very handsome, evocative and imposing in scale. All beautifully photographed and the editing flows and is at least coherent. Worried that Petersen would struggle with the bigger and bolder approach his directing would need than the claustrophobic approach impressively brought to 'Das Boot', actually he does well in this regard.<br/><br/>Particularly in the action sequences, which are exciting and tremendously well staged, showing the passion that was missing in some of the drama. James Horner's score is nowhere near one of his best or most inspired, the rushed composition process does show, but it does have its rousing, beautiful and haunting parts. <br/><br/>Most of the cast acquits themselves well. Brad Pitt was better than expected as Achilles, not always comfortable but the charisma and passion is definitely there. Eric Bana excels, providing a noble and sympathetic Hector and have no qualms with Sean Bean who has some of the script's better lines. Brian Cox brings relish and steely intensity, while Brendan Gleeson is a powerful presence in a role that in lesser hands would have been incredibly bland. Likewise with luminous Rose Byrne. James Cosmo is as ever reliable, while Peter O'Toole is perfectly cast, on an emotional level he and Bana are the most believable. <br/><br/>Not all the cast fare well, though only two really didn't do much for me. Orlando Bloom is a very characterless Paris, even for a character written as a coward there was nothing interesting about the character and got nothing out of Bloom on a performance level. Diane Kruger has a non-entity role and some of the script's worst lines, and she made the character even blander by bringing absolutely nothing and looking completely lost and even out of place.<br/><br/>Would have liked more passion and deeper characterisation, did like that the film didn't try to take sides or make the characters too black and white but the complexity of some of the characters is lost. The romantic elements fare the worst, whereas the action was exciting and passionate the romantic elements were pure soap opera with no chemistry let alone emotion. It is here where Petersen's direction became static.<br/><br/>Am not going to go into detail about how many inaccuracies and dumbing down there are in order to be kind to the film, but a lot of the dialogue is more cornball and soapy than thought-provoking or natural. The pace is uneven, there is urgency and purpose when needed but in more intimate moments the film does go dead. Am not going to criticise the film massively for being overlong, there are much longer epics out there on film (many classics), though it did feel at times there wasn't enough content and that the film tended to be too on the surface and not have enough substance so for a two and a half hour film some of it felt on the thin side.<br/><br/>Overall, somewhat of a mixed to moderately liked view here where both sides are understandable. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"star_in_the_zenith_79","8","3","4","16 October 2014"," Appealing interpretation of the myth
","I think many people complain about Troy's departures from the Iliad. But anyone who has ever actually read the Iliad knows that a screen by screen rehash of it probably would not work, it would involve a lot of CGI gods and warriors who seem like little more than chess pieces on the chess board of the gods.<br/><br/>Personally, this is one of the few times changes to a story are actually appealing. In the Iliad the Greeks are portrayed as basically being the good guys, and since it is a Greek story that's understandable. But Troy reflects the differences in our culture and the world today than when the Iliad was written, and in an appealing way. No one in their right mind today would think it just an entire city destroyed and its people enslaved over a royal love triangle. So Troy just sort of brings to the surface the flaws in the Greek cause that are mostly ignored in the Iliad. Not normally a Brad Pitt fan, but he did a fine job as Achilles, added more depth to the character.<br/><br/>****SPOLIERS**** Yes, it could have stuck a little closer to the myth, like the fates of Menelaus and Agamemnon, but it is a well worthwhile watch. Basically many things are the same, the Greeks still win with the wooden horse, Achilles still defeats Hector near the end, Paris still steals Helen. But you may find the changes appealing in surprising ways if you give the movie a chance."

","It would take a cinematic genius to turn one of the greatest epic sagas ever narrated into a worthy two-hours movie. Alas, director Wolfgang Petersen is no such genius, just a competent craftsman.<br/><br/>A passable historical epic in its own right, Troy is a disastrous adaptation - every choice reeks of bad art, from hilarious title cards to dialogues alternating between sub-Whedonesque pithy banter and lofty one-liners a critic astutely described as ""faux legendary"". Individual duels are glossy and energetic, but set-pieces with a wider scale fall disastrously flat, lacking the creativity of, say, Jackson's for the Lord of the Rings saga.<br/><br/>Casting is canny, with Eric Bana, Sean Bean and Peter O'Toole being the highlights. Pitt is decent, but fails to capture the terrifying side of Achilles - among the many miscalculations of the script, the omission of the carnage in the river with its water turning red didn't help. Usually reliable Cox and Gleeson are embarrassing: blame writing and direction, since they've abundantly shown elsewhere they can act. Bloom is a non-entity smartly cast as vapid Paris. Kruger is lovely and that's all the role needs - I have to smile at the ""not THAT beautiful"" comments, as that's exactly what the character gets in the poem too.<br/><br/>The script is visibly uncomfortable with its source material. It's not just that the Achilles-Patroclus relationship is amusingly turned into a more blockbuster-friendly ""cousins"" kinship. The biggest mistake is erasing the mythical element so crucial in the saga, with gods meddling in the war, fighting among mortals, their fates deeply interwoven with the human protagonists' - without this, it becomes the rather mundane history of a siege. I guess they assumed modern audiences wouldn't appreciate battles involving beings with supernatural powers. Oh wait, Star Wars, X-Men, Lord of the Rings... never mind.<br/><br/>A few scenes glimmer in the midst of Troy (like the poignant confrontation between Achilles and Priam), the power of the source material shining through this lackluster execution.<br/><br/>6/10"

Take a closer look and so-called ""mysteries of mortality"" are ripe for taking. This is not a movie about an epic hero. It's all about a choice. Thetis doesn't offer her son a choice between happy life and certain death. I'd say it is a choice between what's important to him and what most people would consider happiness. She doesn't encourage him to take one path or another. Her appearance is just genius mechanism designed to reveal Achilleses own doubts. And if you try and think about it the intensity of the choice grows beyond what I thought it could even be. What choice would you have made? And that is just one of many edges the movie touches. The writers have done their job excellently. The beauty of the words and phases at some point simply mesmerizes you. The make-up, decorations, the directors work... all of that may not be absolutely perfect, but then again, what is? In any event, they are enough to make you love the movie and even more. I also want to notice work of Brad Pitt here. It's the first movie with him I've seen but certainly not the last.

","While I have not read the actual Iliad, I do love mythology as a whole and have read several different versions of the story of the Trojan War. This film captures the essence of the conflict, and the script and cinematography are excellent. I disagree with some changes made (eg. the deaths of Menelaus and Agammemnon, both of whom survived the war) although I realise that it would be a somewhat depressing film if all the deaths in the myths were shown on screen.<br/><br/>The film is mostly very well-cast, although there is not really that much chemistry between Kruger's Helen and Bloom's Paris. Peter O'Toole, Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson all give wonderful performances. Brad Pitt brings the right balance of tortured soul/arrogant warrior to the role of Achilles, but it is Eric Bana, as Hector, who is the real star of the movie in my mind. I always liked the character of Hector in the myths - Troy's answer to Achilles in terms of fighting prowess, but without some of Achilles' flaws. I also have a certain soft spot for Sean Bean as Odysseus, partly because I really like Sean Bean and think he is really good in this film, but also because Odysseus is my favourite character in Greek mythology - brave, highly intelligent, rather cunning, and with a healthy dose of common sense.<br/><br/>One thing I do not like as much is how short this film makes the Trojan War seem. Most of the myths agree that the war lasted longer than the few weeks suggested in the movie - it took them quite some time to make landfall on the Trojan shore to start with. Also, in many of the stories it is suggested that Achilles' son, born before that warrior left Skyros, was able to join in the war after his father's death (which did not take place on the night Troy fell), even though he was only about 10 years old.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the film is very enjoyable, the battle scenes brilliantly filmed, the sense of time, of antiquity, excellently conveyed. Taken overall, this is actually quite a good movie.<br/><br/>(If this film inspires an interest in the Trojan War, try reading Lindsay Clarke's The War at Troy and The Return from Troy. These are very detailed accounts and the second one covers more of the aftermath of the war than the Odyssey.)"

","I cannot get enough of this movie. Eric Bana is incredible as Hector, his acting is superb his emotions real. His speech to Paris when he finds out Helen is on the ship back to Troy is outstanding. I loved Sean Bean and Brian Cox. Orlando Bloom was fine, the look on his face when he hugs Hector as he is about to fight Menalaus is fittingly pathetic.I am sure that the only thought in his head was 'geez, look at my build compared to Brad's'. And Brad Pitt...oh my God....from a woman's point of view.....beautiful, just beautiful. While his acting has always been questionable and people feel his looks drive his career, I have found that he can be very diverse. His acting in Twelve Monkeys was incredible....he played that loon perfectly, ditto Interview With A Vampire, Legends of the Fall....I thinks his looks cause many to criticize his acting.....poor Brad, right!... Loved the movie..I would have preferred a little more diversion from the tale if Briseus would have stayed with him, healed him and lived happily ever after!"

Brad Pitt does not let the ladies down with his buff bod & the tender loves scenes. <br/><br/>Highly recommend viewing the Special Features - so interesting! Informational and eye catching with side by side before/after scene comparisons, production stories, as well as a fun Greek Mytholgy section.<br/><br/>The only thing that bothered me was the digital repetition of the large crowds at war.

","Well...to be honest any film with Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt running around with swords in skirts isn't going to get a low vote from me! I loved Pitt's character Achilles, he was brave, sexy, kind and full of morals and slightly broody. Brad always gives a good acting performance and i definitely wasn't disappointed. I even cried when he died!! Although I am usually a fan of Orlando I really think that he let himself down by choosing this part. He played a wimp and his character kept on changing throughout the film. One minute he could not tell his sword from his foot and the next he was a champion archer!! I just felt that his character was a bit weak. The battle scenes were also fantastic, but the real star of the film was Eric Bana. He was brave and gave a very convincing and compelling performance. I 'almost' (but not quite) started to hate Achilles for killing him! He also bailed out his pathetic coward of a brother.<br/><br/>I love this film and would recommend it to anyone for Brad Pitt's legs alone!"

"zetes","9","7","13","22 May 2004"," Don't listen: It's great! PART 1
","All film buffs spend a good deal of time imagining what movies they would make if they only had a chance. For years, I've been thinking up various cinematic adaptations of The Iliad, which is probably my single favorite work of literature. I would not have come up with the same film Wolfgang Petersen has, but I am satisfied with it. In fact, regarding its reception by critics, both amateur and professional, I would say that my expectations were wildly exceeded. I quite loved the film. Yes, it is far from perfect, but it succeeds beautifully. I was especially pleased and impressed with the impeccable casting. I think I'm the only one who feels this way, but there is not a single character, not one, who is miscast. <br/><br/>Yes, that includes Achilles, played by Brad Pitt. Pitt has received all kinds of flak, but he is as good an Achilles as I could imagine. I don't even like Pitt as an actor generally; the only other performance of his I like is in Twelve Monkeys. That, although it served its purpose well, was a performance of twitches. This performance shows more maturity than the actor has ever demonstrated before, and perhaps suggests that he might someday be a truly formidable actor, instead of the pretty boy star he is always dismissed as. You can just feel the violence oozing off of Achilles' body as he charges into battle after deadly battle. Pitt has the presence to make Achilles the lion that he says he is. But it's not only the presence that Pitt has. He also successfully demonstrates Achilles' existential dilemma throughout the picture. I really do think Pitt gives an Oscar-worthy performance.<br/><br/>Eric Bana plays the film's second lead, Hector, and the film works just as well under his performance. Bana is definitely an actor who will figure prominently in the years to come. He was fine in last year's Hulk, but here he doesn't have to compete with a CGI version of himself for dominance. Orlando Bloom, who is also suffering a lot under the critics, is Paris, and, in my opinion, is perfect. His fight scene with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson, one of my favorite current character actors) is the film's greatest moment. Brian Cox, who never disappoints, is Agamemnon. Peter O'Toole is fine as Priam, and, although I didn't think he was given quite enough to do, his confrontation with Achilles near the end of the film is as powerful as the scene in the Iliad. Rose Byrne plays Briseis, a character who figures more prominently in this film than in the original poem. This works well, and Byrne's scenes with Pitt are excellent. Sean Bean (Boromir from The Lord of the Rings) gave my favorite performance of the film as Odysseus.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only real disappointment is Diane Kruger's Helen. A German, she makes the classic acting blunder of fluctuating in her accent. She seems like an American at first, but then her German accent starts slipping in from time to time. Kruger may have fared better if the screenwriter, David Benioff, had handled Helen's character better. As far as the characters go, Helen is the only one who isn't handled very well in the script. It's easy to see how Helen could get lost in the proceedings; after all, she's a difficult character to figure. Even the Greek authors after Homer had a difficult time dealing with her. They never really understood her role in the story, nor her intentions. Of course, that's not true when you're actually dealing with Homer's two epics; I think Helen comes off as a very strong character in both The Iliad and The Odyssey, and her character is consistent between the two. <br/><br/>*continued below*<br/><br/>(further comments were destroyed by jackass IMDb editors)"
"Magnus-83","7","9","18","28 October 2005"," Well made
","I found the 2-DVD version of ""Troy"" in the bargain bin at a local department store. Since it only cost me the equivalent to a few dollars, I decided to buy it. And I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Troy, as most of us know, depicts the Trojan War described in the Iliad.<br/><br/>First of all, I would like to make one thing clear - Neither the Iliad nor this movie are in any way historical documents. The Iliad is an old fairytale, whereupon this movie is based. To seek rational explanations for this and that is a waste of time. Consider it for what it is and has always been, a great and very entertaining fairy tale, like the Lord of the Rings is of today.<br/><br/>I'll proceed with the review. This movie is a ""slightly"" condensed version of the epic itself. And of course with the necessary touches of hollywoodization added to it. For good or for worse. Being made into a Hollywood movie is usually either the best or the second worst - being made into a Disney cartoon is the worst - thing that could happen to a classic story like the Iliad. But Troy actually manages to end up somewhere in between, which I find rather unusual.<br/><br/>As I wrote earlier, the story depicts the Trojan war, a result of the elopement or kidnapping of Helen of Sparta, by prince Paris of Troy. Troy was according to legends - as well as a few historians - a city located in what is today northwest Turkey. A city that by the standards of that day was considered large and prosperous. As well as damn near impregnable, with walls that couldn't be breached or scaled*. And since this war involved the greatest nations of the known world (at least according to the ancient Greeks), it was important enough to involve the gods themselves, who gladly gave their chosen champions a helping hand here and there, as well as taking every opportunity to back-stab their opponents when possible. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, every divine or arcane intervention was left out of the Hollywood version, that is basically an action movie set in ancient times. The reason for this is that the filmmakers wanted to make an accurate historical movie, and thus they left out the parts that were considered a bit too unreal to fit in. I fail to see the logic in that decision, though, since the Iliad IS in fact simply that, a fairy tale. Not a historical document**. Didn't they realize that? This means that this movie sometimes feel very real, and since the acting is top notch, some might find it disturbing. Especially since most of us knows how it will end. Throw in a lot of blood and gore, and there you go.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, this was a really bad call. I mean, doesn't this movie really cry out for a sequel? No, I'm not thinking about ""Troy II - Paris revenge"" *duh*, I mean the Odyssey. But how could you make a watchable movie out of the Odyssey without the fairy tale part? Remove that, and you end up with a boring and probable box office bomb about some guy getting really, really, really lost on his way home from Troy.<br/><br/>The ""fairy tale"" bits'n parts that were left out aren't the only changes the script writers made. Although many of the characters from the original Iliad are represented in this movie - and by very skilled actors as well - there are some changes that have been made to their personalities, traits and fates. Some, like me, might dislike that, but it's just a movie anyway. And as I wrote, it is a bit condensed, especially the time-frame. In the Iliad, the Greeks spent ten years outside the walls of Troy, until they finally realized that their current tactics weren't working, and that they should try something new. In the movie it is a matter of weeks. <br/><br/>Even though the script writers and filmmakers have made a lot of changes*** to the story, Troy remains quite a watchable movie. Removing the fairy tale part and trying to make a historical movie was a mistake though, for that is what the Iliad and the Odyssey is - Ancient fairy tales that have survived through time, thanks to a literary genius in ancient Greece.<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>* This happened long before siege engines was invented. They didn't even have iron back then. Metal objects were made out of bronze, thus it was called the bronze age. On the other hand, siege engines hadn't been of much use, since in reality it's likely that there never even existed walls and fortifications like those of Troy back then. Buildings were small, city walls were low, ships were short, swords were weak and soft, armor gave little protection, etc.<br/><br/>** We don't know if Troy ever existed. Archaeologists have found remains of at least one ancient city in that area of Turkey, not necessarily the actual city of Troy. Quite a number of fairly large cities existed around the Mediterranean sea during the bronze age, and most of them have been lost. In short, there are no conclusive evidence that support the claims that Troy have been found. <br/><br/>*** There are changes that are necessary to make the movie watchable. And there is always the possibility of improvements. At the same time, you should - as a filmmaker or script writer - ask yourself this question: Will I be remembered as a one of the greatest writers of all time in a couple of thousand years, comparable to Homer or William Shakespeare? If you feel that ""no"" would be the most suitable answer to that question, don't make changes that aren't necessary. And make no improvements."

Sure he thought he was going to hurt his cousin but still she said ""Stop"" ""Don't"" like why wouldn't he listen to her. I like it how Achilles was a kind person. He was supposed to be a mean person but he was a very kind person. I also like it how there was a love story involves with Achilles and Breseis. But I think that Paris should have been killed, instead of living. I do not like that at all. Whenever I watch the movie I always cry at the end because it is the saddest thing ever. And then at the very end of the movie it played the song ""Remember"" and I cry even more because it is a very sad song. I love Troy and it is my favourite movie and it always will be no matter what. I would definitely recommend watching the movie because if you didn't watch it then you would be missing out on something very good.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","9","18","20 June 2004"," The education of Achilles
","Spoilers <br/><br/>The last thing that Troy represents is a scholarly thesis on ancient history. They might have got almost everything (architecture, costume, armory, ships etc) wrong, maybe some by a couple of hundred years, but who cares so long as they don't have the Roman legions attacking Troy. At least they have got the calculation right, 1,000 ships times say 50 soldiers in each comes up to an army of 50,000. That's doing better than some professional accountants!<br/><br/>After all these years of 'war epic' movies, what more can they bring that will excite us? Well, they've tried, and done well at some places. For example, the first scene, when Achilles asserts himself, is good, in fact very good. The leaping attack borrows a little from kung-fu style fighting, but without making it look ridiculous. The originality is in the lethal strike, straight down the shoulder. It took me a little while to recognize that in order for the tip of a sword to reach the opponent's heart, in addition for the strike to come from the front, the back and the side, it can also come from ABOVE, through the shoulder. If that is not originality, I don't know what is. <br/><br/>The other fighting scenes are well designed, and look respectable. The two big battles do remind me a little bit of some play-off games, one in your turf (Troy's city walls) and one in mine (the beach), a daytime game and a night game too, for variety. The showdown between Achilles and Hector however is a bit one-sided but I don't see how that can be changed, and they've made the best of it.<br/><br/>There is some good acting. The obvious one is of course Peter O'Toole, whose 'education of Achilles' scene (that enemies can respect each other too) shines brighter than anything else in this movie. My personal favorite is Sean Bean. If any actor in LOTR should get an Oscar, it's Bean. In Troy, his job is to make it convincing why Odysseus is Achilles' most respected among all the Greek kings, and that he exactly did. <br/><br/>Finally, they seem to have switched the good guys and the bad guys too but that will only upset people who choose to take this movie SERIOUSLY. Anyway, I don't blame Agamemnon for staring the war. Wasn't Troy well known for its rich oil fields?"

","I was so disappointed to see Orlando bloom as Paris in Troy. He looked not only short, physically unattractive(kind of even turning ladies off), he was naive, immature and a coward. He looked like a 15 year old standing beside beautiful Helena which made me wonder what did she find so attractive about this guy! Really, what could she find so alluring about a Bloom look alike Paris !!! I guess that's why she couldn't do her part well either. It seemed that somehow she only wanted to get ride of her husband and finally she found a way out but I am sure that it must have been a different sensation in Iliad.<br/><br/>About the scenes of the city and buildings, they looked so fake and above all it seemed that the whole story took place within two days!!! Brad was a bit disappointing too, he wasn't running around as much naked as I had red about it every where before the movie was released!<br/><br/>Please any one who wants to make a historical movie, ask Mr.Peter Jackson to direct and cut back a little of that Hollywood glamor so that we can feel being in the middle of things.

","The movie is not as bad as some critics had hoped it would be, and I suspect that some reviews were written even before the film was released. Some reviewers' prejudice appears in their selective gripes--attacking Brad Pitt's Midwestern accent as inappropriately Homeric, but saying nothing of Eric Bana's rather more pronounced Australian accent--or overpraising the fine contributions of British actors Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox as backhanded critiques of Pitt's fine physical performance as Achilles. Both Pitt and Bana are terrific in this movie, and, sure, the movie doesn't measure up to Homer's Iliad (someone expected it to?), but it's good entertainment and perhaps Hollywood's best representation of the ancient world since Anthony Mann's ""The Fall of the Roman Empire."" I agree with Roger Ebert that computer-generated visuals add nothing to the movie (already they look as phony and dating as the old rear-screen projections of the 1950s). Also, Garret Hedlund's debut as Patrocles and Julie Christie's cameo as Achilles' mother are fairly unimpressive. Still, the movie depicts heroic and craven behavior on both sides of the war, without taking sides, and depicts the human cost of warfare and the nobility of principled warriors and humane leaders--in this respect, ""Troy"" is a lot like Homer and unlike such constipated, vicious, yet critically praised historical epics as ""Braveheart."""

"iwant","Null","9","18","14 May 2004"," A review of one of the worst movies of the year
","In all of literature, there is only a handful of works that can be considered to be truly great. One of these is Homer's epic poem, The Iliad. This Greek tragedy revolves around the Grecian hero Achilles and his role in the battle for the city of Troy:<br/><br/>'It is the story of Achilles; or more precisely, it is, as has been frequently seen, the tragedy of Achilles, which develops through his quarrel with Agamemnon and withdrawal from battle, the sufferings of the Greeks in his absence, the death of Patroclus who tried to rescue the Greeks from the plight into which Achilles had put them, and the vengeance taken by Achilles on Hector, who killed Patroclus.' (Lattimore, R. 1961. The Iliad of Homer. The University of Chicago Press: Chicago)<br/><br/>The Iliad begins during the tenth year of the siege and ends a few weeks later with the siege still under way.<br/><br/>Oh the pain<br/><br/>Someone forgot to mention this to producer and director Wolfgang Petersen and screenplay writer David Benioff. At least they had some sense in slapping a 'Based on Homer's The Iliad' before the end credits of this mind-numbingly long 165-minute film. <br/><br/>In fact, the end credits are probably the best thing about this movie. I cannot understand this. Homer did all the work for them. They just had to transform it into a film.<br/><br/>The trailers leading up to the release of Troy led us to believe that we would be getting an epic. Instead, all viewers will take with them after watching Troy is a false sense of The Iliad that is as twisted as it is blatantly wrong. <br/><br/>In fact, given Hollywood's penchant for giving movies long titles, they should have called this Troy: How to rape a classic in three hours or less. Homer is probably on his way back from Hades to have a chat with Messieurs Petersen and Benioff.<br/><br/>Money-making machine<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie is going to rake in the money at box offices around the globe. Why is this? Well, there is a (potentially) brilliant cast on offer. Any movie featuring the likes of Peter O'Toole, Brad Pitt, Sean Bean, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom has got something going for it. Alas, even a cast as strong as this has no hope of saving this wretched offering.<br/><br/>For some reason - in all likelihood the screenplay - the acting is as wooden as the Trojan horse. The much-anticipated special effects come across as being bereft of any emotion. Even composer James Horner seems to have been sucked into the black hole that is Troy. <br/><br/>This movie is a soulless example of just how badly Hollywood can waste the resources available to it. Warner Brothers would have gotten more value from the reported budget of $200 million if they had burnt it.<br/><br/>Pitt (Achilles), Bana (Hector) and Bean (Odysseus) make an attempt at saving the movie, but do not quite manage it. While the glaring inaccuracies are too numerous to mention, the characters of Hector and Paris (Bloom) are the best examples of how making 'artistic' changes can succeed in irritating anyone who has ever read The Iliad. Even the one-dimensional Helen (Diane Kruger) cannot contribute anything to the movie other than provide it with a pretty face.<br/><br/>Saving grace<br/><br/>Thankfully, there are two scenes in the movie which are worth watching. Of course, both revolve around two men trying to kill each other. The first instance is where Hector fights Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) thinking that he is Achilles. The second being Achilles' fight with Hector. At least the choreographers did a good job.<br/><br/>Other than cashing in on one of the most popular stories ever, I cannot even begin to understand what the reasons were for making this movie. I have seldom watched a film that has left such a bad taste in the mouth. Perhaps next time, Warner Brothers should get Peter Jackson to help them bring a literary classic to the big screen. God knows, Petersen cannot."
"Quinoa1984","6","9","18","14 May 2004"," A good job by Peterson and his cast and crew, could've been better, could've been worse...
","Wolfgang Peterson and David Benioff's adaptation of Homer's Illiad story, about the battles and people beneath one of the greatest wars in human history, is like a 2nd place science fair project by a kid in middle school. You're impressed, but there's still some things that keep it from the prize.  Troy is loaded with CGI visuals carried over in tradition from Gladiator and LOTR, has wonderful cinematography by Roger Pratt, and certain scenes and performances are near perfect (Peter O'Toole in particular).  But that doesn't mean Peterson's vision doesn't carry with it some flaws.<br/><br/>Some of the visual effects, though intricate and vast, are a little much at times.  In a sense they work well for the production, but I thought the film might've benefited from more extras, much like a big-scale production from the Golden age of Hollywood.  Stars like Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom are more or less capable to hold up the film, with Pitt creating conflict and poise in his Achilles where it sometimes isn't needed, Bana creating a directness with what's around him, and Bloom giving some over-acting (or under-acting) for his Paris.  The female characters aren't of much praise and speculation except that their main part in the film is to discourage the men from fighting.  This, as well as the score by James Horner with a single female singing voice in most battle scenes, gets a little much as well.<br/><br/>It seems as though Peterson is fond of dramatic excess in this film, and it serves as both an asset and a crutch.  For example, in the fight scene between Achilles and Hector, there are repeated cut-aways to close-ups with the royal family looking on.  This would be fine if it wasn't interferring so much with the action going on.  This same focus on the fights and battle sequences also gets diverted with the score and cut-aways.  But the good side to this is that this stylized, glossy, and occasionally brutal action gets pumped up.  That's how I felt overall about this picture- it's exciting, interesting summer fare, but it won't be a big contender against the epics of the past, or even the other action films due this summer and year.  B-"
"penseur","7","12","26","4 June 2004"," A few pluses, a lot of minuses
","Do blue-eyed flaxen-haired bronzed Brad Pritt and Diane Kruger really resemble Greeks, ancient or otherwise?  Can you really thrust a sword or a spear through pieces of armor plate, front and back?  Did Troy really look like this place?  You could go on, and in fairness there are a lot of questions about the historical basis of the Iliad on which this is very loosely based. How possible would it have been in Greece, for example, with its denuded hillsides (munched by goats) to find enough wood to build 1000 ships?  But back to the film. I agree with those who say Brad Pitt was the wrong person to cast as Achilles, while Peter O'Toole puts in a good performance but which in no way compensates. I also had misgivings about Orlando Bloom. Most of the other actors are adequate, nothing more.  The realism of the battle scenes varies a lot, sometimes good, sometimes ridiculous.  Ditto for the accompanying sound effects.  At times the film manages to resurrect fleetingly the feel of historical epics of the past (""Ben Hur"", ""Cleopatra"" etc), and that is one of the pluses.  Another plus is that some people might be inspired to investigate the classics and/or ancient Greek history.   But overall there are just too many faults and too much lacking.  5/10."
"ccthemovieman-1","5","16","37","25 February 2007"," The Good & Bad Of 'Troy'
","GOOD - They didn't just spend this vast amount of money - over $200 million to make this film - on computer special effects. They did that, yes, but also did have a bunch of ""extras"" and those panoramic shots of the warriors, real or not, looked impressive. So did the shots of the vast number of ships, the fleet of Greek invaders to the shores of Troy. Along with that, we get a nice re-creation of the period, that of very ancient times. Eric Bana's role of ""Hector"" was a noble one. The famous ""Helen of Troy"" certainly was an eyeful, played by Diane Kruger.<br/><br/>THE BAD - We are supposed to root for Troy, at least that's the way it was presented. I have a couple of questions, however. How is it we are supposed to root for a guy who steals another man's wife? That's what the scriptwriters here are trying to get us to do. I don't care how despicable Helen's husband is, it's still the wrong thing! Hello? Talk about another example of Hollywood's twisted morals. Also, are we to root for Brad Pitt's ""Achilles"" character? If this guy were alive today, his American hero would probably be Barry Bonds, someone en route to immortal fame by cheating - but who cares? At least someone in this film does tell ""Achilles"" how vain and shallow he is, but Pitt just turned me - and a lot of other viewers - off with this role.<br/><br/>OVERALL - Not a bad film, but for the money, I guess I expected something better, more involving. If I am going to sit through a film this long, I'd like to care more about the lead characters than I did here. ""Hector"" was the only one worth a damn."

","Wow this was bad, I don't know where to start, OK, let's take it category by category: <br/><br/>CAST Brad Pitt - He usually makes good choices about the roles he takes, this was an exception. His face is too well known and modern to be in historical movies, it's like, 'Hey! it's Brad Pitt pretending to be an ancient Greek!' His Achilles has no redeeming characteristics and I was very much looking forward to seeking him take an arrow in the heel.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom - Displays his usual wimpiness, which, surprisingly, is actually a good thing. I wish the script writers would have been even less true to the source material and have Paris remain in Greece during the war.<br/><br/>Eric Bana - I found him to be the only sympathetic character in the entire film, with the exception of Ulysses, and he was little more than a cameo. Bana's Hector has a dignity and reservation about him that was very noble and watchable.<br/><br/>PRODUCTION VALUES Sets - Far too neat and clean, looked like something out of a theme-park; ""The City of Troy - Sponsored by Pepsi"".<br/><br/>Costumes - Same as above, everyone looked like a casino greeter at Caesars Place.<br/><br/>DIRECTION I know for sure now that Wolfgang sold his soul to the devil for ""Das Boot"", lets just leave it at that. Didn't have the guts to even hint at the real nature of Achilles' grief... sellout.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION If you don't know the Iliad from Icarus and enjoy watching Brad Pitt scream and smack everyone in sight while covered with what I can only assume is JP4 jet fuel, it's the flick for you."

","within actual historical events, this movie misses greatly. but seeing as how Achilles was a fictional myth anyway, the storyline moves well. the actors and actresses all play great roles. from common slaves to generals of army's and navy's. battle scenes were realistic and action packed. brad Pitt does a wonderful job in this movie. all the female leads were beautiful and well designated. if your stocking up on movies, then you'll want to have this . the reason why you'll want this is for the view of watching men contemplate right and wrong within the frame of love and battle. a nicely written film with good directing and positive acting! could have been better, but they figured with Pitt in it, any and everyone would want to watch it.

The movie is epic, no doubt, but the potential to be even more epic was there. The possible potential is made up by the acting talent. Peter O'Toole plays Priam with such ease and confidence, it's sickening. Eric Bana IS Hector. He becomes his character. (That's all I have to say about that!) Orlando Bloom always plays the innocent part well and lives up to the wimpy-prince Paris image. Brad Pitt as Achilles, need I say any more about this? The supporting cast: Diane Kruger, Saffron Burrows, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, and Rose Byrne, plus many more, makes the movie even more grand. The film is worth while.

","Oh dear, where do I start with this one? I watched it yesterday and it was so bad, its producers should pay viewers to sit down and fill the theaters.<br/><br/>Let's start with how it measures up to Homer's epic. It doesn't. It portrays events in a totally different manner, unrelated to the Iliad.<br/><br/>Second, let's go to historical accuracy. It is commonly accepted that the Trojan war happened circa 1200 BC, although the archaeological evidence and the astronomical information given by Homer point to about two thousand years earlier.<br/><br/>During those times, Greece's cultural phase was the Minoan/Mycenean. The wall paintings in the Minoan and Mycenean palaces and the archaeological findings show us exactly what armor, shields and weaponry were used back then by Greeks. Instead, in the film we see slightly modified versions of weaponry of the Classical period. The same goes with naval vessels. Myceneans, Spartans, Minoans etc. did NOT have triremes. But I digress... Hollywood isn't about historical accuracy; it's about selling a spectacle, no matter if it's utter trash.<br/><br/>Let's go to acting. The only half-decent acting in this film was done by Peter O' Toole; the rest were abysmal.<br/><br/>Character descriptions and depictions? That's a laugh.<br/><br/>In short, anyone who respects cinema and views it as an ART and not as a shallow pastime for uneducated plebes should avoid this film."
"rmax304823","6","9","19","2 July 2005"," How do you like them Golden Apples?
","The movie is colossal, spectacular, stupendous, gongoristic, monumental, and secular.<br/><br/>What happened to the GODS? I mean the whole thing started with Eris and that damme golden apple and vain Aprhodite -- whom I would not want backing me in a war, I'll tell you. Yes. It's a godless movie, no doubt propagated by some leftist Commies in Hollywood. Oh, sure. Lots of people entreat the gods, or propitiate them, or insult them, but does anything happen as a result? They don't. No, they don't. You may call it secular humanism but I call it hubris.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is Peter O'Toole. He practically gives acting lessons to the leads. Brad Pitt I feel kind of mixed about. He's not bad actually -- humorless, narcissistic, and relentless except when he's in a snit. By the way, didn't Achilles hide in drag among the women in order to avoid being drafted? Maybe not. My memory is a little rusty after all these years. I didn't have a problem with Brad Pitt, the actor, but rather with his role as written and directed. We already know that Achilles is full of love for himself, but must we be too? Pitt is all pumped up and musclebound and the camera gives us more than one shot of his bare behind. That's okay as far as it goes because the Greeks were pretty casual about nudity (""gymnasium"", etc.) but then, well -- why not a bit more of Helen too? Or Briseis? What's the matter with their behinds? <br/><br/>Speaking of Briseis, the erstwhile temple virgin with whom Achilles falls in love, brings up a couple of creaky places in the construction of the story. Alright, they don't have to hew too closely to Homer's original. He probably didn't hew very closely either. After all it was an oral tradition and there wasn't too much to hew to. But the introduction of the romance between Achilles and Briseis, which I don't remember being in The Iliad, almost turns the movie into a Harlequin romance punctuated by scenes of battle and intrigue. In fact all the romances are handled through dialog that is positively an embarrassment. Near the beginning Paris sneaks into Helen's room and she says, ""You shouldn't be here."" Paris: ""That's what you said last night."" Helen: ""Last night was a mistake."" I kept waiting for one of the lovers to turn to the other and say, ""We have to talk."" At least the Helen/Paris romance was required. Her sleek Teutonic beauty is what launched those thousand ships. But Achilles and Briseis is off track. It's the story of a man who ""found himself"" through the love of a good woman. (Ho hum.) <br/><br/>It turns out, according to this version of the story, that Paris didn't shoot Achilles with an arrow before the walls of Troy after all. Instead Achilles is killed because he foolishly rushes around the burning palace searching for Briseis, his missing love. When Briseis yields to him and agrees to leave, he sweeps her up in his brawny arms and Paris, mistaking this for a coerced abduction, plugs him in the heel. There follow the few last words to his lost love, from a man who died tragically just as he found the true meaning of life. The real Achilles must be begging the boatman to take him back across the Styx so he can strangle the writers.<br/><br/>Visually of course the movie is overwhelming. Maybe too much so. We see a horde of about two thousand Greeks in dark armor plodding relentlessly towards Troy, while ominous music throbs in the background. It owes something to the score for Alexander Nevsky, but if you're going to rip somebody off it might as well be Prokoviev. The fact is, there are too many guys. In The Iliad Homer gives us two lines of warriors -- the Greeks and Trojans -- shouting insults and shaking spears at one another until some of them rush out of line to do battle. This puts the spotlight on individual mano a mano combat, like that between Hector and Patroclus. But when you have a myriad of men hacking away at each other, who's to notice, and stop to watch, when two heroes swear off against one another? <br/><br/>It's not a bad movie at all. Rarely does one's mind drift. But why did the writers try to hammer that round peg of a romance into the square hole of the narrative itself? Is Brad Pitt such a bustier-melting hunk that someone thought the audience wanted to see his tender side? And his backside as well? Was he so expensive that somebody figured he ought to be given more lines of dialog? And get that stupid helmet off so we can all see how handsome he is? I was reassured to see that the guys I enjoyed and admired most in the original -- the morally upright Hector and the clever, ironic Odysseus -- receive fair treatment here. I never liked Paris much. I always thought of him as a handsome namby-pamby and an idiot to boot. Happily he doesn't get much better play in the movie."

","Many scenes are dripping with heterosexist imagery (dost we protest too much!); I take it the film-maker was very afraid of the homophobia that ultimately would do-in Stone's ""Alexander"". It is so sad that American film-makers are so afraid of dealing with historical homosexual characters that they are completely obliterated from Homer's story.<br/><br/>The first scene in the film of the great civilization of Sparta is filled with women doing sexy dances and men making toasts to women in their beds!! This is completely laughable considering Sparta was an almost exclusively homosocial society!<br/><br/>Much of the beauty of Homer's poem comes from not only the beauty of Helen and her lover, but also the beauty of male love and comradeship amongst the warriors, which was a very large component of Greek society.<br/><br/>Achilles was, in fact bisexual, and his so-called ""cousin"" Patroclus, was really his male lover! Their relationship is not even hinted in this movie! I only have to add that Brad Pitt is very talented and deserves better material, and of course, he is beautiful to watch!

","There are elements of Troy that work nicely.  The CGI effects are something special indeed.  The fight scene between Hector (Bana) and Achilles (Pitt) is very nicely choreographed.  In the end, though, it's all for naught. Peterson (who has delivered great action films in the past - Das Boot, Air Force One) needed to run to the editing board many times over.  I don't mind lengthy films (I can name several three-hour-plus films that I count among my all-time favorites), but ""Troy"" pushes things to the limit.  Too many sequences feel redundant.  Brad Pitt is nice to look at and little more. He does not have the commande that Achilles should have.  For a warrior that is supposed to inspire the confidence of an entire army, it seems unlikely that he would muster more than a chorus of ""eh"".  Paring down one of the cornerstones of Western literature is certainly necessary to make it watchable on the screen, but seeing ""Troy"" is certainly not necessary for anyone.

","OK, so I guessed that there would be liberties taken to condense the story into some kind of realistic length. But only Hollywood could condense the 10 Year Trojan Wars into a fortnight with 12 days off for a funeral! The Trojan Wars were only the beginning of many of the fabled Greek stories. This version tied up so many loose ends that, according to this, we have nothing. Agamemnon meeting his end in the ruins of Troy? Begad - goodbye to the continuing saga of his wife Clytemnestra......<br/><br/>The whole thing was risible with the exception maybe of the feeling of an epic (ie it looked great on a giant screen). Thus the cinematography was the saving grace. Nothing else held up. The script (if that's the correct use of the word) was a joke, some of the acting so wooden that the Trojan horse itself was more animated (was a copy of the script being held just out of camera shot for Eric Bana to read as he went along?

","come one guys, you have to suspend your disbelief. It's an epic and even more so it's mythology, it is virtually impossible to make a flawless film about something whose history has so many legendary versions. I didn't dive into watching Troy expecting to learn the true history about the Trojan war, heck! I heard Brad Pitt was naked in it and so I rented it (vain as that may sound LOL! it's the doggone truth).<br/><br/>Moving along, I give the director (and perhaps the writer) major credit for keeping it all straight forward (unlike what what's his face did with Alexander --which by the way is a whole other review). Here's the story without any brain science involved (even a cave man could get it right away, LOL! Okay way too many GEICO commercials HAHA!). Paris (a measly looking and way too pretty Orlando Bloom) falls in love with Helen of Sparta (played by Diane Krueger) too bad she is already married. Okay, let me wander off for a second. First things first, off all the men in the film, why does this woman choose the wimpiest looking one to have an affair with??? Therein lays my question. Second of all, while I'm not even going to front, Diane Krueger is pretty but of all the women of the world, how did they zero in on her to play Helen of Troy, a woman whose beauty legend tells us is second only to that of Aphrodite? I just couldn't get over that, much as I tried to suspend my disbelief. I mean, okay if worst came to the worst, they could have made the ethereal Rose Byrne play dual roles (Helen & Breseis). But you know, I'm just saying.<br/><br/>Now back to the plot, one night during a liaison, Paris decides it would be a good idea to save Helen from her woeful marriage by bringing her back to Troy with him. On the boat, he confesses to his brother Hector (played by Eric Bana who turns in one of the finest performances in the film) that he has brought along Helen and immediately, through Hector's dismay and anger we see a foreshadowing of things to come. Since Troy and Sparta have endured a hot and cold relationship for years, it is small wonder that Helen's alleged abduction becomes more of a political issue than a personal one. Nevertheless, Helen is welcomed with open arms upon her arrival in Troy and through this ceremony we get to meet new characters including Breseis(Rose Byrne) the cousin of Paris & Hector, and Andromache(Saffron Burrows) the wife of Hector.<br/><br/>Meanwhile back in Sparta, the king and his brother have begun to assemble the largest team of soldiers to embark on the journey to not only recover Helen but to attack Troy for the insult. They have one problem though, convincing mighty warrior Achilles(Brad Pitt in an Oscarworthy performance) to come along with them. Achilles, while a legendary warrior refuses to bow to the king nor subscribe to his unscrupulous ways but is somehow convinced to come along for the war because he knows that it will be a legendary one. Achilles arrives in Troy first and wreaks his havoc before the Spartan army and in doing so, his men are able to capture a woman priestess named Breseis with whom Achilles falls in love with and ultimately loses his life for.<br/><br/>Look for great performances by Eric Bana, Brad Pitt and Rose Byrne. I'm sorry guys, I love Orly but I just couldn't suspend my disbelief long enough to believe anything he did in this film. Oh! and the nude scenes with Brad were so tastefully done that it was almost a let down that they didn't show us more. It's either that or I got the Walmart version(LOL!). Wolfgang Petersen handled the directing well, kudos to him and the actors did their parts, props to them. If only that script hadn't been a little too shaky for comfort. All in all, it was watchable."

","A quick review:<br/><br/>Blood and more blood. A superficial film.<br/><br/>Its commentary on war is laughable. Most of the characters are one dimensional. There is little character development. Especially for Paris. No subtlety in the performance leaves the character of Paris an idiotic enigma. No real love and/or passion between Helen and Paris also leaves the movie in many ways pointless and heartless. The classical Greek literary conflicts between destiny and choice, and piety and hubris are given superficial consideration. The only memorable characters (and well acted) are Hector and the Trojen king. The Achilles character has no rime or reason. He choices the glory of war over peace but later in the film complains that he had no choice and was born to be a soldier. (I doubt that this character conflict was intentionally created because the last line was read in a middle of what passes as a silly attempt at character development.) In short, virtually nothing pulls you in and makes the viewer symphasize with and truly understand the characters (aside for Hector). A good action flick but little else."

I sincerely think it would be a shame to miss it even for all it's faults. For once, because they strove for some coherence, and did some justice in telling the story - whereas it might have easily degenerated into a succession of mindless battle sequences. And because Brad Pitt was (to my astonishment) NOT as bad as the critics made him out to be. I might complain that he's not really known for a commanding presence, but then everyone in this movie never really seemed to register as much as they should have, despite having significant portions of the film rightly devoted to relationships between the central characters."

So what if the film is not faithful to the Iliad? Makes you wonder if Virgil got a pasting in his day for re-interpreting it. Probably not, the Internet allows even the most ignorant or anal of opinions loud voice (even mine).<br/><br/>I think Petersen made a good call by reducing the role of the gods in the story, it seemed to me that you could see the myths being born, the godly games invented to explain the tragedy by a master storyteller (Homer) living hundreds of years after these alleged events.<br/><br/>I was a little annoyed that the film compressed the siege of Troy to what seemed a month or so, and also the scale of the battles seemed to be intended to inspire the awe of the LOTR, yet the number of combatants would more likely have been on the scale of a big football crowd... Say 50,000 for the Greeks and less than that for the Trojans, but again, does it really matter?<br/><br/>For me, I felt the doom of Hector, and King Priam's loss keenly.

","If a director makes a historical, or legendary, movie and most important, one of the first and most known literally pillars of western civilization, he has a responsibility to stay somewhat true to the story. Particularly if this is the only way of historical/literary information for most people.<br/><br/>In Troy, Petersen deviates so much that he just made an insult not only to the Iliad, but to the Odyssey and to Aeschylus and Euripides tragedies (Trojan Women, Agamemnon, etc.). These works together with the Aeneid of Virgil make up the complete Trojan legend. To mention some, Briseida has a protagonist role which not corresponds to the legend. According to Petersen, she kills Agamemnon; in fact he is murdered by his wife Clytemnestra upon return to Mycenae, along with Andromache (Hector widow). Contrary to the movie, Hector did not kill Menelaus. Menelaus took Helen back to Sparta. Hector did not kill Ajax; they finish their duel with reciprocal respect, interchanging presents. In the movie, the coward Paris lives happily with Helen, while really he is dead by the arrow by Philoctetes. An important and key character like Diomedes is totally missing. Achilles was killed one year before the fall of Troy, not at the war end, etc., etc., etc.<br/><br/>I did not touch the gods intervention, whose role in the Iliad are essential, to avoid further dilemmas and criticisms. Completely absent in the movie, with the exception of Tethis for a short and irrelevant participation. <br/><br/>Even if we concede 'some' deviations from the original work, the characters portrays are so weak and disappointed that they do not reflect the deepness and courage of the heroes and warriors, as explicitly presented in the Homeric Chants. In general, the movie is superficial, lacking driving force, especially from acting. Short dialogs, reduced to minimum expressions. Take as example the romance between Helen (last night was a mistake) and Paris (and the night before?); it is just fine for lousy melodramas. Battles are shot without essence and a notorious difference between Pitt and his stunt is presented along the 'drama'. The only exception may be Peter O'Toole (as king Priam), whose role may be adequate and who by chance, follows a more precise role as per the legend. <br/><br/>Some of my worst 3 hours wasted life-time.

","Based on Homer's The Iliad, Wolfgang Petersen's Troy is an epic in both scope and feel. Not only does this film look big, it feels big. There is a shot shortly into the film as Achilles is on a ship heading towards war with Troy. The camera pulls back and as the shot gets more distant we begin to see a couple of ships until soon the entire screen is filled with a fleet of Greek warships. It is moments like this that help to define Troy. Never before has the viewer been shown just how it may have been at the famous battle. That is part of the appeal of the epic. Petersen is trying to show us that this was a war where hundreds of thousands of men died. While he could have gone the way of some films and made it more fantastical, Petersen wisely decided to keep this grounded in reality and keeps as true to the facts of the story as history allows him to. I like Brad Pitt. He seems like a personable guy and while I have enjoyed his films, I was worried about him being in this. He seems more like a good old boy than a hardened warrior. Thankfully, I was proved wrong. He comes across very well as Achilles and turns in one of his better performances in my opinion. Peter O'Toole is wonderful as always in the role of King Priam. Orlando Bloom does fine as Paris, bringing a sense of class to his courage to stand up for what he believes in despite his being a non warrior. The real standout of the film for me however, was Eric Bana. This guy was a shocker. After Hulk, I figured he was pretty one note, but his Hector proved me wrong. I hope we see more of him soon. At the end of the day, only one thing brought Troy down for me: Diane Kruger as Helen. This is the woman a kingdom was destroyed for? A little more time spent on finding a better Helen would have served the film far better. Also, I did feel the Trojan Horse scene didn't get enough screen time as it deserved. this was an important piece of the story and it almost feels glossed over. Oh well. For now, Troy stands as the best film adaptation of the war to date."

","troy was a great movie it was thrilling fileld with great action and stunning moments such as the collision of two huge armies which was realistic and well done. i like the character of achilles quite a bit in that movie brad pitt did a great job also eric bana played a great hector actually everyone played their part well. i especially liked the beach combat scene where achilles true fighting skill is seen lol best part ever, when the mermedans land on troys shore and achilles just runs into battle while the rest stay back.lol funny stuff. hectors fight against Ajax was amazing as well very well acted out same thing with Paris and menelaus those were powerful scenes in the movie filled with suspense and heart pumping moments. but above all the scenes that really blew me away, were when hector kills patroclus thinking it was achilles i thought it was achilels too, it was weird. and when troy gets rushed into which sets the action for the final scene in the movie. but the best scene for me was achilles vs hector very tough fight and very tense u feel sorry for hector and at the end u feel sorry for achilles very dramatic movie overall but a great flick."
"srobi280","10","6","12","12 April 2006"," Not historically accurate, but a great movie nonetheless
","Troy is not faithful to the Iliad, and is not historically accurate. However, it is a very enjoyable movie with excellent acting, great props and costumes, amazing cgi effects (did you really think they got that many people as extras in the armies?), and well-choreographed fight scenes. They only had 800 extras, and with the help of CGI, they got it to look like thousands of people. Brad Pitt puts in a great performance as Achilles. The casting in this movie couldn't have been better. The actors fit the characters they portray very well. The most stunning perhaps are the fight scenes. They are well choreographed, exciting, and action packed. The duel of Achilles against Hector was incredible. You can tell how angry Achilles is as he tries to slaughter him. You can feel his anger. Amazing performance. If you are a history buff, and it really bothers you if something is historically inaccurate, then by all means avoid this film. But if you are willing to see past that and enjoy this as the entertainment that it was meant to be, then watch it. You won't be disappointed."

","Despite the greatness and entertaining of the film, it leaves me with a very uncomfortable feeling-- the underlying notion of injustice that this film projects!<br/><br/>Two very well looking couple felt for each other, they call it ""love"". It could override everything, things like care for fellow countrymen, devotion to own nation, love for own family members, etc.These can all be sacrificed because of ""love"". Thus the great couple finally made it and everyone else died, and in number of many thousands. They are noble men of highest integrity like Hector and Achilles, while the cowardice Paris got the pretty woman at the end , when they would continue their love affair for God knows how long( Paris had been fooling around before he met Helen, according to Hector)!<br/><br/>This leaves me feel uneasy.<br/><br/>In our own country China, in the old days such a couple would have been condemned to be drowned within a pig's cage for adultery.<br/><br/>I guess the biggest breakthrough on this film is --- the bad guys do not necessarily die at the end, it's sometimes the good guys who did the dying, to the extent that the hero was killed by the coward.<br/><br/>Question is : do people like this sort of ending?<br/><br/>A better ending would be: <br/><br/>Briseis blocked the arrow shot by Paris and saved Achilles' life. Before death, she begged Achilles to spare Paris. He did, and Paris fled to find Helen killed by angry Troyeans, blaming her for Troy's destruction. Both Achilles and Paris left with heart broken, deeply grieved with the hatred of wars."
"DarthAbspie","7","6","12","8 November 2005"," Epic Classic that deserves all due credit.
","I didn't bother to watch this in the cinema or to buy it; I was informed by friends that it was a waste of time, that the acting was wooden, it was jumping on the LOTR bandwagon.<br/><br/>But having watched it last night, well! This is truly an epic and deserves all the awards it got.<br/><br/>The Director Wolfgang Petersen has taken Homer's Iliad and turned it into something the whole family can enjoy. Now, I myself have read and adored both the Odyessy and Iliad, and that is one of the reasons I was so sceptical about watching Troy - I thought it would be one of the Hollywood adaptations in an attempt to cash in - and it probably was! But damn, did they do a good job!<br/><br/>Brad Pitt does an excellent performance as Achilles, showing the emotions and turning the legend into a real person with real emotions. His love scenes are not overplayed, and his battle scenes - well, Mr Pitt, your training certainly paid off this time!<br/><br/>The real performer in this is Eric Bana. I'd not seen him in anything before, but his emotional levels that he brought to the role of Hector had me thinking that I'd follow him to death, damn it! As with Pitt, he does some wonderful acting with Saffron Burrows, who plays Andromache, his wife - perhaps not the perfect appearance, but an excellent performance - and his moments on the battlefield are awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom does a far better job than I'd anticipated. His Paris is not the snivelling coward nor terrible cruelty, but I'd rather hoped to see some more emotion - some of his performance just doesn't quite hit it, though you are left shaking your fist at him when it ends. Perhaps it is the script writer's fault, however, that rather than being guided by the gods - which admittedly would not have fitted with the film - he suddenly becomes a hero.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: Without a doubt the best sequence in this starts when Hector kills Patroclus, and ends when Achilles gives his body back to Priam. The performances from every single actor had me in tears. When Hector and Achilles come face to face, you are torn between who to support - Achilles in his grief, or Hector in his courage? Peter O Toole shows off his talent in this one scene, and as for the scene where Achilles cries over Hector's body - wow! I was gob-smacked by this surprising show of talent from Pitt.<br/><br/>END OF SPOILER.<br/><br/>All the performances are decent and this is a film I would definitely recommend - over and over again."
"davidguay","9","6","12","22 September 2005"," Not the Illiad--Based upon it.
","This is a stand-alone movie with its own theme(s) based upon the story told by the Iliad. It is not the Iliad. Does not try to be nor does it remotely even attempt to pretend to be. It has its own stories. And they are great stories well told with great characters.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was awesome and Pitt and the character of Achilles was that of an incredibly complex man of depth--as was Hector. The very first thing that strikes you about the movie from the beginning and continues throughout is the incredible intelligent dialog with no chitchat. Pitt was extraordinarily believable as the most skilled awesome invincible warrior you would ever want to meet. The guy was buffed in the lean athletic muscular true fighting physique of such a character. Just think of the build of a six foot tall Sugar Ray Leonard in peak fighting condition. Then there was his Terminator mentality. Pitt's Achilles was absolutely the last person in the world you wanted coming at you. Even Hector, the great fearless warrior, and great and honorable man that he was recognized this. (Eric Bana was superb as Hector.) This movie actually is too subtlety intelligent in its dialog and subplots and themes for average filmgoers. I was amazed. It was nothing like what I suspected it would be. It shows even the subtle looks between major characters as they listen to political BS between Kings and princes.<br/><br/>The conversation between Achilles and Priam who comes to Achilles to beg for the body of his son Hector is sufficient to bring a lump in the throat of any mature person. One of the great scenes in the movie! So well written, directed and acted. A very powerful and deep moment about the deepest of emotions without being OT or melodramatic! Men fight for honor, pride, love, country, friends, greed, and power. This film shows all of those motives and the characters behind them. And it shows them IN DEPTH! Yes, everyone you know from the Iliad is there but they don't all meet the same fate as described in the classic. As I said this movie does not pretend to be telling the Iliad. This is ""Based on a true story"" type of movie.<br/><br/>The fight between Achilles and Hector is one of the finest, most original, beautiful and believable choreographed fights I have ever seen--all done without any stunt doubles or tricks. The fight is even more dramatic because of the meaning of the fight and why they fight and how that has been conveyed to the viewer in the telling of the story up to that point. And you don't want either to die.<br/><br/>A very ""adult"" film in the very best sense of the word! The special effects are amazing in the battle scenes and maneuvers of the armies. They put LOTR to shame as far as size COMBINED with authenticity and LOTR was not exactly chopped liver in that arena. There is not a hint of phoniness or ""special effects"" to be detected.<br/><br/>But for me the heart of this excellent movie is the dialog and the depth of the characters complimented by outstanding performances. So many conflicts of human frailties here! The movie is in the best sense of the word a true spectacle--but for adults with a soul! It isn't an action movie. No this is very much a drama with a lot of action."
"orwell2112","8","6","12","2 July 2005"," Moral of the story is the coward wins the girl
","What struck me about this overall solid movie was the unbridled and shameless chutzpah of Paris and its contrast with the real heroes of the film (his brother Hector and, of course, Achilles). Paris' appalling lack of character is defined from the start through his willingness to drag two countries into war over a vaguely defined itch for Helen. This is followed later in the film by his pigeon-hearted exit into the arms of his brother who reluctantly rescues Paris from the duel he himself started with Menelaus in a half-hearted attempt to take some responsibility for the war he created. Even when Paris belatedly takes up arms with his fellow Trojans in the final battle against the Greeks, it is only to take pot shots with his archery set behind the safety and comfort afforded by his infantrymen. Befitting the artlessness of his character, he only manages to fatally wound Achilles after Achilles rescues Briseis - a Trojan - from some manhandling Greeks and as he is in her embrace. <br/><br/>I'm a little rusty on the Illiad, so I'm not sure if Paris is traditionally portrayed in such a gutless manner. As portrayed in this film, he's one of the most cowardly characters I can recall seeing, but the positive side of this is it makes him a good - if frustrating to watch - foil to the true heroes of the film."

","With so much music being scored (and having been scored), there are eventually going to be similarities between scores from time to time. However, the score for this movie was really distracting to both myself and my wife because that one grandiose theme (I think it first appeared when Hector, Paris et al are greeted at Troy) sounds toooooo much like the Sanctus of Britten's War Requiem. There is some saying about imitation and flattery, but this was just too close. If the James Horner has never heard the War Requiem (which I doubt--any serious 20th/21st century composer will know Britten), than I have newfound respect for his creative abilities.<br/><br/>On a different note, I think that the LOTR trilogy has wrecked every other epic genre movie for me because everything falls in their shadows. It's hard to be impressed any more, which is too bad because I typically enjoy Petersen's movies."
"Artemis-Lachanidou","Null","6","12","26 February 2005"," To all would-be critics - think before you yap!
","One thing I find more loathsome than others is people who think that the world cannot do without their criticism. I realise that I, by criticising people who criticise, am placing myself in the same category. Nonetheless, I cannot refrain from doing so anyway, however, my critcism is directed at the critics of “Troy” by Wolfgang Petersen: Are all of you bright, super-intelligent critics who have supplied your comments, grandly supplying a list of the one hundred thousand things that did not correspond to either the “Iliad” or classical Greek mythology really so naive as to believe that the producers of the film were ignorant of the above? Here is logic for you: If I were going to produce a film on any subject, especially a classical one - and Homer's epic is THE literary work of art par excellence - I would spend ample time collecting material. I would also realise that, granted that the world is full of students of classical literature, there would be more scrutiny on the part of the public than in other cases. So why, for pity's sake, would you assume that Wolfgang Petersen would not have researched into the material prior to producing the film? That being the case, then, there must be another reason why the film is the way is and no different. Well - all I can say is that the producer took advantage of that thing known as artistic licence; also, the film is not titled “the Iliad” but “Troy”. Technically, of course, it’s the same subject since “Troia” and “Ilion” are two names for the same city (from Tros and Ilos, two of Priam’s ancestors, respectively), but still, by giving the film the name “Troy” it can be assumed that some amount of artistic licence is going to be taken. Regarding the comment by “Stephen Oestereicher” referring to “Brad Pitt” as being a “pretty boy”: If you read both the Iliad and the classical myths dealing with the pre-history of the War of Troy, you will find that Achilles was, indeed, a “pretty boy”! Due to the oracle stating that Achilles would lose his life in the War of Troy, his mother Thetis hid him on the isle of Skyros with King Lycomedes where he grew up with Lycomedes’ daughters. When, on the eve of the War, Odysseus came to summon Achilles, he had to use a ruse to distinguish Achilles from the girls. Does that tell you anything about the features of Achilles? So really, Brad Pitt gave a rather good rendering of Achilles, who combines in his person a number of opposites: He is both lofty AND emotional; he is both arrogant AND tender-hearted; he is both virile AND youthful - even child-like at times, with distinctly feminine features even (how else could he have been hidden unnoticed amongst girls?) – he is both “loved by the gods” AND a “mother’s boy” who runs to Mummy to be comforted. In short, the character of Achilles is indeed a perplexing one to analyse, but I think that Brad Pitt rendered it rather well. All right, so Brad Pitt’s Achilles was slightly more “golden haired” than is described in the Iliad, where Achilles has brown hair; but that’s really the only thing that did not correspond to the character of Achilles. There were, obviously, elements that were not mentioned in the film altogether, such as Achilles being entreated by a committee to return to battle, or his near drowning in the Scamander river (“Am I to drown like an imbecile?”) or his frequent running to his mother Thetis and crying his heart out to her, which constitutes part of the oddity of Achilles’ character; however, that which was brought across was not bad at all. As to the comparison with ""Helen of Troy"": Granted that Helen of Troy goes more into the pre-history of the Iliad, such as Theseus’ robbing Helen (which, actually, isn’t even elaborated on in the Epic Cycle but simply stated as a fact!) and telling her the truth behind her birth, or the origin of the vow of the Greek kings to support one another in battle if one of them was offended (although, according to the classics, it was Tyndareos himself who chose Menelaos as Helen’s husband), nevertheless, the latter part of the film is very much condensed due to lack of time, obviously because too much went into the beginning of the film. In short, where “Troy”, misrepresents certain items, “Helen of Troy” does the same with others. By the way: Briseis really WAS the lover of Achilles, so why do some of you insist that that shouldn't have been there? Feel free to contact me at Artemis.Lachanidou@gmx.net if you wish to argue more."
"brody76","9","6","12","14 February 2005"," Don't expect the Iliad
","If you are expecting the epic story in the Iliad, you may be disappointed. I enjoyed this film because it was more like a ""what could really have happened"" type of adaptation. To me, that's what made the movie. If you are a big fan of the Iliad, I think you'll enjoy this flick a lot better if you're aware that it's an *adaptation*, not a retelling of the book! It has used the IDEAS from the book; the characters, situations, etc. But this movie is loosely based around those ideas to tell its own tale.<br/><br/>The movie has its own style for the story of the Trojan war, and in my opinion it tells the story as well as the book, just in a very different way. This can at first be very annoying, and to enjoy the film you have to be willing to accept that the story is its own. The characters will not behave quite as expected, and the feel of the story is totally different.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the Iliad, you'll probably like the movie. If you have, you should forget the book for a while and think of the movie as a n unrelated story, then decide afterward whether it was a butchery of the Iliad or a story that can coexist separate from the book."
"escactor","9","6","12","12 November 2004"," Homer would be pleased!
","The film Troy directed by Wolfgang Peterson is not the first film to depict Homer's Iliad; however, it is uniquely fused with an all-star cast and technologically balanced with Computer Engineering. Roger Pratt has captured the texture of the story with his brilliant cinematography and Peter Honess's editing allows the audience to become one with the ultimate power thrusting strength of Achilles. I must say, ""well done Brian Cox on your performance as Agamemnon. You are truly a master when it comes to living the villain."" Brian Cox is both vile and manipulative as well as creative when it comes to conquering the Aegean Sea. Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Priam is sound. I could sense the tension between his loss of a child and his overwhelming display of trust for tradition. I was not impressed with Orlando Blooms performance, although Paris is a sappy lover and fullish youth I felt lost at times with his character. This was probably Eric Bana's best performance, Hector the hero and martyr. Bana's presence on the screen was definitely a plus. Brad Pitt's character seemed detached from reality and perhaps in the celestial realm? Powerful energy. Mythic. Brutal ballistic strength. Sean Bean was a perfect Odysseus. Vibrant, humorous, and supportive. Finally, I must say that the use of computer graphics in the film was not overdone. One of my favorite scenes in this film exists solely on the wonders of technology. (See the movie). The Director's choice of ending the film the way it was done allowed the audience to witness myth in the making. This epic thriller is a must see for those who like being entertained and falling into the sequence of action."
"dr_foreman","9","6","12","22 June 2004"," maltreated - a great movie
","Bad movies come out in droves these days. The majority of critics must be on autopilot, bombing new releases left and right, because they missed this perfectly good movie and gave it the same shoddy treatment as the typical brainless blockbuster. But anybody with sense can see that ""Troy"" is clearly a cut (or ten) above the average summer fare. Beautiful sets, thrilling battles (particularly the one-on-one clashes), and a terrific ensemble cast elevate this film to the status of epic greatness. I wonder if it will be reassessed with kinder eyes in the future, when we're not all so cynical and burnt out from watching too many CGI spectacles.<br/><br/>Common criticisms of this movie just don't hold up. Orlando Bloom makes a fey Paris, yes, but that's the nature of the character. Perhaps his love scenes don't give off enough heat, but they're merely a preamble to the real focus - the war itself. Brad Pitt is better than you've heard as Achilles; once again, the controversial aspect of his performance (he's sulky) is true to the original character. Of course, the real show-stealer is Eric Bana's Hector; after his lackluster and low-key performance as the Hulk, I didn't think much of him, but here Bana infuses Troy's greatest warrior with wisdom, power, and passion. If junk like ""Lord of the Rings"" nets Oscars, then Bana should definitely be up for Best Supporting Actor, but I doubt that'll happen.<br/><br/>True, the movie is not particularly faithful to the original myths in many important respects. But it doesn't pretend to be anything but a modern re-interpretation; the title isn't ""Homer's Iliad,"" after all. It's pretty ridiculous that critics slam the movie for not sticking closely enough to a poetic work that is obviously an exaggerated and embellished account of the war. By eliminating the gods (their actual presence, not their influence), ""Troy"" makes the Trojan War seem more real than it was in ""The Iliad,"" and that's not a bad thing. It was a real war, after all (probably). And I'll bet the gods didn't show up in reality, either...<br/><br/>Perhaps ""Troy"" has too much moral grey area for modern audiences, who have grown accustomed to black-and-white, good-vs-evil conflicts from both the movies (Star Wars, LOTR) and the political rhetoric of the day. But I love the ambiguity in this movie, and every time a character dies - whether he's Greek or Trojan - I feel bad. I never know which side is really right, which side I want to win. That's because the story has genuine complexity; nice to know that Hollywood is still capable of generating something with more than a surface layer of gloss.<br/><br/>""Troy"" is also exceedingly manly, which could be alienating, as it celebrates not only combat and good muscle tone but such outdated concepts as honor, duty, and courage. Watching this, I couldn't help but think we're all complete wimps these days, in terms of our fallen virtues as well as our flabby bodies. But I'm drifting into weird territory now. Suffice to say that ""Troy"" is a beautiful and underrated story of honor, love, and cool battles between cool characters. Try to catch it in the theaters while you still can; epics always look their best on the big screen."

","I enjoyed ""Troy"" immensely. It had a great cast, some awesome fight sequences and wonderful cinematography. It may not be accurate to the original story, but who freakin cares. This film is not supposed to be a history lesson but an interpretation of the story of the Trojan War. I liked the film anyway. I saw the film for the first time on Friday with some of my friends and thought it was pretty darn good. I did have a few problems with the film, especially the score by James Horner. He has written some wonderful scores for such films as Braveheart, Apollo 13 and Titanic but this score did not have one piece of really memorable music in it. The score seemed to be recycled from other films especially Gladiator in a few spots. It wasn't the worst score ever, but I wish it had been better. I saw the film again on Saturday with my mom and I liked it a lot better the second time for some strange reason. Things that bothered me when I first saw it didn't bother me so much anymore and I looked at the film for what it was; a good old fashioned time at the movies. The second time I saw it I payed more attention to the acting in the film. I loved the performances in this movie, especially Eric Bana, Brad Pitt and most of all Peter O'Toole. Eric Bana gives a compelling, believable performance as Hector and really shows his great skills as an actor. I hope to see him in a lot more films in the future. Brad Pitt, one of the most underrated actors in my opinion dominates as Achilles. the critics can say what they want about him being just a pretty face, but I though he was awesome in this film. It really shows that he worked hard for this role and he does a magnificent job of playing the conflicted warrior. Finally, Peter O'Toole, what can be said about him that hasn't already been said a hundred times. He is just GREAT! One of the finest actors to ever grace the screen and he deserves an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. He delivers one of the best scenes, and the most well acted scene, in the entire film which includes his character King Priam begging Achilles for his son back. What a great scene! Anyway, one thing that surprised me about ""Troy"" was the fact that the one on one fight scenes between characters were more exciting and well done than the larger scaled battle sequences containing thousands of soldiers. I guess the reason for that is that it is easier to see who is fighting whom in the smaller fight scenes. The fight between Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) is very good and the fight between Achilles and Hector is movie making at its best. What a terrifically well done scene (this was one of the only parts of the score I liked). In conclusion, this is a really good film with some terrific scenes and acting. It may be three hours, but for me the time flew by. GO SEE IT!"
"markoseugenikos","1","6","12","15 May 2004"," Troy is a very bad movie inspired by a very good story
","Wolfgang Petersen and the creative team behind Troy seem to think that despite changing the beginning, middle and end of the story, despite dropping half the major characters (namely, the Gods), despite changing the motivations and attitudes of the remaining ones, and despite completely altering the ""point"" of the story (the nobility and tragedy of war), they have a right to still call this movie ""Troy"" and claim that it was inspired by Homer's poems.<br/><br/>The Homeric epics, and the entire cycle of myths surrounding the Trojan War have been with us for nearly thirty centuries. One would think that this would make them a ""good story,"" but apparently this is not Mr. Petersen's or his screenwriter's view. Not willing to adapt to the story, to serve a story that is much bigger and nobler than them, they decide to lower the story to their level, to change it completely, to vulgarize it with standard Hollywood elements, hoping that the brand name of ""Troy"" plus a nude Brad Pitt plus blood and sex will give them a big profit.<br/><br/>I don't doubt that they will succeed. But, as the recent success of the Passion has shown, there is also a big market out there for people who aren't dumb and enjoy seeing the ""real thing"". Petersen had a chance to put one of a handful of Great Stories to celluloid, but instead he decided to give us the entirely forgettable mess that is ""Troy"".<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is a good actor and physically impressive, but he is not a king, nor does he have the nobility of Achilles. He plays Achilles like a pumped-up preppie with an attitude problem. Orlando Bloom, a usually good actor succeeds into turning Paris into a ""man"" that no self-respecting woman could ever love, let alone Helen, the most beautiful woman of her time. As for Helen, to say that Diane Kruger's performance is wooden would be an insult to wood. This Helen is no temptress, she is just a runway model pretending to be something which she does not comprehend. Certainly, everyone in this movie admires her beauty, which makes Ms Krueger's insufficiency at the role even more painful to watch.<br/><br/>I will not spoil the ending for you, but let's just say that -if you've read Homer- there's not five minutes in this movie where some distortion is not carried out by the director. But, he saves the best and most audacious changes for last.<br/><br/>Mr. Petersen has also blatantly cast a decidedly northern European group of actors in the role of all Greeks in this movie, including his German compatriot Ms. Krueger in the role of Troy. The unabashed Nordic idealism of his choices is eerily reminiscent of Nazi-era Aryanism, which saw in the Ancient Greeks the racial brethren of the modern Teutons. It appears that Mr. Petersen has internalized the racist ideology of the Nazis, reproducing it faithfully on screen.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent, the stunts are excellent, some action choreography is excellent. With the exception of these, there is nothing of value in ""Troy"". It is not just a bad adaptation, but also a bad movie in itself. Do not endorse the destruction of good stories by supporting the mess that is Troy."

","I took Western Mythology in high school, and I read the Iliad.  If I hadn't read the book, or epic poem, whatever you wish to call it, I probably would give this movie a nine or ten.<br/><br/>As it were, I think this film is worthy of an eight.  The action was excellent, Eric Bana and Brad Pitt were fantastic, and the sets were amazing.<br/><br/>The only thing I was disappointed in were the inconsistencies between the movie and the Iliad.  First off, Menelaus and Agamemnon do not die in Troy. They are both killed in their homes.  Ajax (or Aias, as he was called in the book) also doesn't die until after the war.  He loses a footrace to Odysseus for Achilles' armor and kills himself because he felt like he was cheated. I didn't mind Ajax being killed as much as the others, because it did help in the progression of the movie, and portraying Hector as a great warrior and a hero for his people.<br/><br/>I did not like that there was no indication of how much time passed during the course of the war.  The Trojan War was ten years long, and there was never any mention of that.<br/><br/>Contrary to what people have been saying, Orlando Bloom did an excellent job of portraying Paris.  Paris is by nature a coward, and selfish.  He does not think of others before thinking of himself.  The role was played well, and the part was written accurately.<br/><br/>One thing that was integral to Achilles' return to the battle was left out. When Patroclus wore his armor into battle, and Hector kills him, Hector takes Achilles' armor and wears it on the field.  Achilles is brought new armor, made by the gods, by his mother Thetis, a goddess, who played too small a role (you only see her picking up seashells before he leaves for war), I felt.<br/><br/>Aeneas' involvement was also something I felt was missed.  You only meet him in the movie when Paris gives him the Sword of Troy and tells him to take the people through the tunnel.  Aeneas was Troy's best soldier after Hector, the son of a goddess.  He is wounded by Diomedes (a character I was disappointed didn't make an appearance) and is taken off of the field of battle, which leads to his journeys in Virgil's Aeneid.<br/><br/>One thing I loved, Sean Bean as Odysseus.  I loved him in this role.  I would very much like to see him play the same character in an adaptation of The Odyssey.<br/><br/>Achilles also lived far too long in the movie.  He did not live long enough to see the inside of Troy,  he dies on the battlefield, and never sees the Trojan Horse.<br/><br/>One simple thing the peeved me, the pronunciation of Brendan Gleeson's character's name.  They pronounce it ""Men-uh-louse"" when the recognized pronunciation of it has always been ""Men-uh-lay-us.""<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, overall, it was a good film, well acted, well shot, well edited.  I just would have enjoyed it so much more if I hadn't read Homer's Iliad, or if they had been more true to the story.  This is the best film I've seen based on the Trojan War, though.<br/><br/>Eight out of ten."

The one on one fights scenes are extraordinary, they are the best fight scenes that i have seen ever.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom simply is not up for the his role as Prince Paris, actually he is laughable. The screenplay wasn't very good, it should have been better, but the real disappointment was The score composed by James Horner. The music in the trailer was composed by Gabriel Yared (The English Patient,The Talented Mr.Ripley, and Cold Mountain)and it was simply great, but the makers decided to get James Horner instead for unknown reasons, and they payed the price now because the music is simply very bad. Overall the movie was grand and spectacular Grade:A-"

","Just returned from the Cinema and I must say that TROY is wonderfull!!!! Not only the film, but also Horner´s score. There is a lot of voices which reminds Gladiator but the rest of the music based on the large orchestra, 5 pianos is great and works excellent in the film. Start to searching for the CD immediatelly and if there will be tracks that ought to be on the CD, it would be one of the best Horner´s scores of last years!!! Keeping fingers crossed for Petersen, Horner, director of Photography Roger Prat, costume designers and others at the academy award ceremony next year :-) Also Eric Bana, Brian Cox and Peter O´Toole would deserve at least nominations for their parts but unfortunately this is not a genre for actor to win an award... I am sorry for my extremely positive mind but this film really got me!!!!!!!!!!!!!! uaaaaaaaaaaaa :-)"

","""If they ever tell my story, let them say I walked with giants. Men rise & fall like the winter weeds, but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector, tamer of forces. Let them say I Lived, In The Time Of Achilles""<br/><br/>King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) of Mycenae wants to rule over the world. He has already conquered most of Greece, forming them into a fragile alliance and the only kingdom powerful enough to rival the Greek nation is the kingdom of Troy, with whom they have made a peace pact. Achilles (Brad Pitt), considered the greatest warrior ever born on the face of the planet fights for the Greek army. But his disdain for Agamemnon's rule threatens to break apart the fragile alliance. In Thessaly, Greece, Agememnon challenges the King of the land to fight the war in the old fashioned way, the best fighter of each side fighting one another and deciding the result. Of course, Agamemnon calls forth Achilles, whom he hates from the bottom of his heart. Achilles finishes the fight in one move and both the armies are confounded by his superior battle skills. He has many myths surrounding him; his mother being an eternal Goddess, his immortality even in the toughest and fiercest of battles, to name a few. His only aim in life is to immortalize and etch his name into the minds of men and history books for ages to come. When his bones will be dust , he wants to be remembered as being the greatest warrior in the the time of Achilles. Paris (Orlando Bloom) is smitten by Helen (Diane Kruger) who happens to be Agamemnon's brother's young wife. They both run away from Sparta along with his brother, Hector (Eric Bana), the Prince of Troy. Having got his reason for a war with Troy, Agamemnon gets his troops and marches his massive fleet across the great seas in hopes of bringing down Troy's unbreachable walls and defeating Troy to become the greatest Emperor. <br/><br/>The greatest of fights are always fought because of or over a woman, look at Mahabharatha and Ramayana from our Indian mythos (cannot say its completely a myth, proof is being uncovered that it all happened). Brad Pitt has probably immortalized Achilles much more than the real Achilles had ever anticipated or hoped for. Brad Pitt is like an incarnate of Achilles' ferocity, beauty, love, strength, agility, prowess, his defiance, his supreme confidence. I was left in awe of this man's performance, he is such a good actor. And everybody in the film complement him with some wonderful, fine method performances. Achilles gives a short speech when approaching the beach of Troy, saying immortality awaits beyond the horizon. He takes the beach of Troy with only 50 men, defying Agamemnon's orders! I had read the story of Troy and knew how it ended, most would also guess given the ending involves a certain 'Trojan Horse'. Well, here is how the name 'trojan' stuck to a virus. Agamemnon is really a back-stabbing, lying, cheating bastard whom I hated from the bottom of my heart. In that respect, Brian Cox was awesome as Agamemnon. <br/><br/>Wolfgang Peterson has brought the story of Troy to life in this superb movie. Everything about this movie screams of a tale of epic proportions; love, betrayal, valour, justice, evil; and the movie is filled with testosterone filled six pack hunks to satisfy the viewer. Orlando Bloom plays the role of the scared younger brother of the heroic Hector to perfection. Other than Achilles, I loved Hector. He is like a Trojan (A man of Troy) version of our own Yudhishtira, the brave, kind and righteous king. I loved Bana's performance, I was hoping against hope he would win his fight against Achilles. The women in the movie, though having very less screen time, give amazing performances. The fight scenes are amazing even with the cgi effects, which you will rarely notice. The story is pretty authentic and the director has made a good effort to stay true to the story and make it entertaining. Give this movie a try if you haven't seen it yet and I promise you, you will be glad you saw it. <br/><br/>10/10"
"KKernodle","9","4","7","3 September 2009"," Quality blockbuster based the epic story of the Trojan War
","First of all, viewers need to keep in mind that this is a big-budget Hollywood portrayal of the historically ambiguous tale of the Trojan War, stories passed down by word-of-mouth and first written by Homer in ""The Illiad/Odyssey"" poems. The screenwriters *need* to condense and modify the story to make it a watchable length. Writer David Banoiff sticks with the core plot of the story but makes a bold, sensible decision not to incorporate the gods. <br/><br/>BRAD PITT portrays the one and only Achilles. If anyone were to be cast as a beautiful Greek hero, it would be Pitt. He physically plays the part of Achilles but brings such complex emotions to the character that you sympathize with a born killer. Out of all the characters, Achilles develops the most, and Pitt plays him exceptionally.<br/><br/>PETER O'TOOLE gives a beautifully heartbreaking performance as King Priam, the aged ruler of Troy. His regal manner makes his vulnerable moments all the more tragic. <br/><br/>ERIC BANA plays Hector, the older son of King Priam and first prince of Troy. He is a wise warrior forced to make difficult decisions. Bana understands these complexities of his character, torn between loyalty to his family, his duty to protect Troy, and his honor as a soldier. I might also add that Bana's muscular, 6'3"" frame, makes for a physically realistic Greek hero and some awesome fight scenes. <br/><br/>ORLANDO BLOOM gives a spot-on performance as Paris, the callow young brother of Hector whose selfish actions cause a chain reaction. Bloom has often been criticized for his portrayal of Paris being lacking in depth. One must realize, however, that the character is a naive young prince with not enough life experience to understand love, death, or war. Bloom does an excellent job as the young boy who, beguiled by the beauty of Helen, believes he is in love and acts impulsively, leading to the downfall of his city and family. Paris begins to understand that he caused all the chaos and the guilt is felt.<br/><br/>DIANE KRUGER plays Helen, the woman ""whose face launched a thousand ships"". Kruger creates an excellent dynamic between her an Paris. As the older of the pair, she is more wise and understanding of consequences, but so miserable in Sparta that she runs away with an infatuated Paris. My only complaint is that she physically lacks the look of a beautiful Greek woman. Yes, she is beautiful with amazing blue eyes, but as someone of the Mediterranean, I prefer dark hair, dark eyes, and an olive complexion to realistically represent someone of the area.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were done with the perfect balance of moderate gore to understand the brutality, wide view shots to recognize the massive scale, and close views to stay connected with the action of particular characters. Pitt and Bana do excellent jobs with their fight scenes and for the most part you stay completely attached to the fighting, a difficult task to pull off in an action film, especially one of this historical grandeur. <br/><br/>To sum it up, an amazing cast with complex performances make this film quality, while the massive and impeccably choreographed fight scenes make it a big-budget blockbuster. There is something for everyone in this film, and can be appreciated by hard-to-please film critics, action junkies, mindless blockbuster movie goers, and Greek mythology lovers (if they can get past the lack of gods and enjoy a more human take on a story)."
"wildamike","9","4","7","16 August 2009"," Great work of art and faithful to the spirit of the original works
","This movie had mediocre success in the USA, but did much better in the rest of the world. Anyone brought up exclusively on a diet of Hollywood will have difficulty in fully appreciating its artistry – my advice is, throw away your Hollywood lenses, and accept that this is something different. A superb work of art, with excellent battle scenes and special effects, and acting that varies from reasonable to very good indeed. <br/><br/>I have read many of the ancient sources about the Trojan War, and this film is faithful to them. Not entirely to the text (it re-works the Iliad considerably) but to the spirit of the ancient sources and of their characters. Also, many critics who so confidently denounce the ""inaccuracies"" of this film clearly haven't read the original stories. For example, Brad Pitt's retort: ""If I was invulnerable, why would I bother carrying a shield?!"" is correct (in the Iliad, Achilles is wounded in the arm during battle).<br/><br/>""Troy"" can only be understood in light of the very-Greek concept of tragedy – of mortal men and women doomed by fate. The harsh truth, which many cannot accept, is that they cannot avoid their fate, indeed their only choice is the manner in which they will face it. When viewed in this light, Brad Pitt's performance particularly shines: Achilles understands this fundamental truth – he has seen the world for what it is, and accepted his place in it.<br/><br/>Sets, props and make-up are first class. The director has made a real effort to be faithful to how these men actually fought – horrible wounds are inflicted, armour is heavy, and the most important defence that any man carries is a shield. The duel between Achilles and Hector is very well done: These men duel with spears (many viewers will not be used to this, but sorry, in this era swords were only a last resort). And when Hector cops a spear in the shoulder, the fight is over – there is no ""Its only a flesh wound"" here. <br/><br/>Some critics complain that the Gods are written out of this story. I beg to differ: The Gods are present throughout, although we mostly only see the results of their actions, rather than get the direct view that Homer gave in the Iliad. Of all characters, Achilles is most aware of this: ""I know more about the gods than your priests. I've seen them"". Achilles, himself the son of a goddess (played in an excellent cameo by Julie Christie) sees behind the ritual, idols and temples to the reality: ""The gods envy us because we are mortal. Everything we do is more beautiful because we are doomed"". Hector, Briseis, Odysseus and Priam also show their acute awareness of the gods' control of mankind. The characters that least acknowledge the Gods' role in human life (Agamemnon, Paris and Helen) are also the most contemptible. <br/><br/>I cannot understand the inane critics who complain about this or that character from the Iliad being written out of the story, or having their parts shortened – the Iliad has a huge cast of characters and it is *not* possible to include more than a fraction of them in a 3-hour film. And, it is necessary that some characters be changed in order to fit a film of this size. Of the seven main characters:<br/><br/>Hector (Eric Bana) – Superbly acted. The true noble warrior. Briseis (Rose Byrne) – Remarkable stage presence. Byrne's only ""problem"" is that she is more alluring and attractive than Helen of Troy (Dianne Krueger) in all ways except sheer physicality. Priam (Peter O'Toole) – sound performance from an old stager. Conveys Priam's combination of moral ambivalence and tragic glory. Achilles (Brad Pitt) – I hate to admit it, but he's pretty good. His performance is boosted by working opposite three exceptional actors – Brian Cox, Rose Byrne and Peter O'Toole. Odysseus (Sean Bean) – most of the examples of Odysseus' cunning from the Iliad never get into the movie, so it is remarkable how ""Mr Bean"" still manages to convey his cunning and cleverness. Agamemnon (Brian Cox) – somewhat one-dimensional compared to the Iliad, but Cox as always does an excellent job. Paris (Orlando Bloom) – A shallow, snivelling, self-centred, rich boy who dodges his responsibilities; perfect character for Bloom! Helen (Dianne Krueger) – Most disappointing of all the main characters, Krueger is physically beautiful but lacks empathy and stage presence. She is easily overshadowed by Andromache (Saffron Burrows) and Briseis (Byrne). <br/><br/>One of the greats, 9 out of 10."

"axismladen","10","4","7","22 August 2008"," I just had to write a comment on this film after i read some other comments!
","I watched this movie the first day it came to cinema.I expected it will be great...and i got what i expected.I just cant listen people who say that this is a bad movie only because its not made correctly by the Iliad and because its not epic enough.I mean come on people!What did you expect.Its not Ben hour or the gladiator but its a great half action half epic movie.I think that we should see more of this kind of movies.Its epic on its own personal way,not like Ben hour,gladiator,brave-heart,Spartacus,el Cid...Its epic like Troy.There is a lot of epic in this movie the only problem is that people think that what makes epic movie is that you have to cry enough tears to make an ocean at the end of the film.Well i gotta a news for those people...its not.An the fact that this film is not made correctly by the Iliad don't makes him worse.It only shows the vision of how would it be if it was of a person who wrote it.And by the way Braveheart had some historically inaccurately things in it but he turned out to be a great film.Troy has a million elements of what makes a good movie.Like for examples:<br/><br/>1.Brad Pitt was great as Achilees. <br/><br/>2.Eric Bana was as good as it gets. <br/><br/>3.Peter O'Toole was great. <br/><br/>4.Direction was pretty good. <br/><br/>5.Production was perfect. <br/><br/>6.Visual effects were great. <br/><br/>7.Sound effects were great. <br/><br/>8.Battle choreography was one of the best in history of film making. <br/><br/>9.Dialog was magnificent. <br/><br/>10.Relationship between a king who needs a warrior which he hates and opposite is great.<br/><br/>There are so many things in this film that are great which some people refuse to see only because they read Iliad or god knows what.This movie is a great filled with action,epic romance that you must see. I just have to give him ten because it don't has to be Ben-Hur to be a great epic movie. If you haven't watched it,watch it an if you have watched it,watch it again."
"ditsiiluvsu637","10","4","7","18 August 2008"," here's what i think :)
","Troy is such an excellent action-packed movie!!! I enjoyed watching it with my sister and cousin. Brad Pitt is super hot! Yes, I understand that the movie was almost completely off from the original story, but look at Homer's version of it. He wasn't totally one hundred percent correct either. So stop trying to say it was dumb and not correct, and just watch and enjoy the gosh darn movie. <br/><br/>As for the characters, I too think that they could have found a much more beautiful woman than the girl who played Helen. Everyone dying for her? Come on now. As for Achilles' character Brad Pitt couldn't have played a better role. Eric Bana was the bomb in Troy. I cried when he died! Paris is the hugest coward i have ever seen, and I have never hated Orlando Bloom so much. He's such a good actor. Saffron Burrows played a good and concerning wife. <br/><br/>I give this movie a ten because of the wars and bloodshed. I loved all of it. The part when Patroclus got killed was so surprising! Achilles got so mad and started killing everyone, it was so fun to watch. It was so sad when he died. It's cute that he was all in love with the Trojan girl. Right after he got out of the horse, he went straight to her. Too bad he died. <br/><br/>***THIS MOVIE ROCKS***"

","Troy is a great movie which is entertaining all the way, has great action parts and great sets. And also this movie is really underrated i think. I don't get why people don't like it so much. It was an excellent movie and I don't understand why it got a 6.9/10. I gave it a 10/10 because it was a great movie. The acting wasn't that great neither was it that bad. But over all the Movie was fantastic. It had an awesome climax and had great visual effects and I think Troy should even be on the top 250. All I'm saying is this if you didn't watch this movie watch it because it is a great war and historic movie and has great visual effects. So if you didn't watch this movie watch it!!<br/><br/>TROY ROCKS!!!"

","just a little thing to add, in the ""history""/""legend""/""poem"" of Achilles, Ajax did not die by Hector. In fact he didn't die at all. He and Hector fought until sundown, and he wounded hector. They decided to finish the next day, but thats when Achilles cousin was killed. Some also say Patroclous was just a friend of Achilles. Who knows though. But anyway, after Achilles fall, Ajax and Odysseus both made speeches on why they should have his armor. Ajax, being a thick headed warrior, his speech sucked, and Odysseus, being high charismatic, won Achilles armor.<br/><br/>Greek/roman/mid-evil times<33"
"stevewest-1","Null","4","7","10 March 2005"," A different subject matter.
","I only became aware after doing some research on the internet that Troy was based on Homer's Illiad (which is on my ""to read"" list). My initial impression was that Troy was in the vein of Gladiator, although covering a different subject (which it is).<br/><br/>The performances seemed a bit stilted initially, I was worried that Eric Bana might be falling short on the acting skills. I noticed all the other actors including Brad Pitt gave the same delivery which left me conclude that perhaps they'd done too many takes in a row. I got used to that anyway or it wasn't a problem, the events of the film were interesting enough that it fell by the wayside. The casting was good, I always think Brad Pitt does well in non-pretty boy roles, even Orlando Bloom who's still riding the post-Lord of the Rings wave suits his character overall. It's reassuring that Eric Bana had the presence to pull off his role convincingly, and this film will surely look good on his resume.<br/><br/>Troy doesn't have much in common with Gladiator except it involves war and is set in ancient times, it covers different themes and is more philosophical, thanks to Homer no doubt.<br/><br/>Troy was a pleasant surprise for me, the film was better than I thought it was going to be. I can understand how small things can affect how big a film is in the high pressure environment of the US box office, but with its worldwide presence it'll still be remembered in years to come."
"loveyl_lioness","5","4","7","19 May 2004"," When will Hollywood read a book?
","As a theatre student I was excited to see the epic Trojan War on the big screen. I have taken classes referring to Greek tragedy and read parts of the Iliad and could not wait to see these ancient heroes and villains all placed together. Now if you are one who has not read anything in regards to Greek history you would have found this movie enjoyable; great battle scenes, partial nudity, and just the right amount of a love story. But if you are like myself and have some knowledge of what really happened you would be outraged. In the first place lets start out with Menelaus does not die, in fact he takes Helen back home with him to Sparta. Ajax does not die until after the war when he is humiliated and commits suicide. And as and actress who has played Clytemnestra in a production of Electra I was almost outraged when Polydora killed Agamemnon. In actuality he returns home and then his wife and her new love murder him. While I could go on and on about the historical inaccuracies I will leave it at that. If Hollywood writers can mess up an epic like this... what else are they capable of? David Benioff should have done a little more homework.... I give him a D."

","Wow! I greatly enjoyed Troy. Being a fourteen year old girl the muscles and short skirts of Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana were an obvious highlight for me, but I was surprised at how much I actually enjoyed the movie. The scenery was spectacular, although I noticed there was nothing about the gods tricking Paris into taking Helen back to Troy. There was a fair bit of gore, but I found myself not minding so much, as the battle scenes were wonderfully filmed, and balanced out with the romance and plot.<br/><br/>Eric Bana gave the best performance,( as Prince Hector,) and I found myself feeling his emotions, his anger at killing Achilles' cousin by accident, his worry for Troy, and a wave of sadness overcame me when he was defeated. I felt, however, no such empathy for Achilles, as Brad Pitt did not make it easy for the audience to relate to him. All up, I loved the movie and I was very impressed with the digital effects and the way the directors kept to the story."
"plevako2002","Null","4","7","16 May 2004"," As Hollywood epics go, not a bad try
","We saw Troy last night.<br/><br/>Frankly, I was expecting the worse, and I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, this is an enjoyable movie (though not one you would watch over and over again).<br/><br/>Naturally, the movie is a very rough approximation of Homer. But Hollywood was never known for sticking to the text or carrying about historical details. But on the plus side, you see Petersen taking the text, and putting his own original imprint on it. Homer's Trojan War was essentially a war of gods using men (or should I say, goddesses) to wage battles on Mount Olympus. But the movie chucks all gods and talks about war as it really is - a product of human greed and hunger for power. At times, the movie really felt like an anti-war movie in some respects.<br/><br/>As for the actors, I was really impressed with Eric Bana (Hector) - he really came off as genuine human and humble hero. I also really liked Peter O'Toole as Priam - a man with honor most kings would not and did not have. Ditto for the actor who played Odysseus. Even Brad Pit (Achilles) did a decent job portraying a man who views military prowess as the only way to secure his place in history, but eventually realizes the insanity of killing others for the sake of glory.<br/><br/>The movie did have a few rough spots. Selection of Diana Kruger as Helen of Troy was probably a mistake - she just does not seem the type over which men would spend decades fighting about. But may be Petersen had a point - the war was not really about Helen at all. For my money, she was not even the best-looking woman in the movie - that honor goes to Hector's wife. In any event, I would have preferred to see Gabrielle Anwar or Keira Knightley as Helen. Hey, I am biased:)<br/><br/>Also, the bit about Helen running away with Paris to ""grow old with him"" was just silly - Paris, as portrayed by Orlando Blum, is young and weak and runs from bed to bed. He just is not likely to inspire that kind of sentiment in a woman.<br/><br/>The movie also could have used some better background information. Achilles' military prowess and his eventual death do not make sense unless you know that Achilles has divine power on his side and has only one vulnerable spot - the one that would lead to his demise.<br/><br/>But overall - a good experience. I recommend it."
"lou-lou","9","4","7","14 May 2004"," a positive review with some criticism thrown in for interest
","I just came back from the movies- WOW! Troy was the type of movie where you sit in the cinema afterwards for half of the credits, just absorbing what happened! I loved it! I've been looking forward to it soooo much and wasn't disappointed at all.<br/><br/>To be honest, at first I wanted to see Troy because of Orlando Bloom. But his part is really over-hyped-up. He comes across as a kid who doesn't care about consequences, and has a fair share up brattyness thrown in for good measure. I suppose that could be called good acting- after all, that's what Paris was, I spose. But Orlando didn't even convince me that he was being driven by love- that the whole movie was an epic based on, and fought for, love. He was kinda stale with Helen(when you consider that his passion for her was Paris's only redeeming character trait) and he didn't register much emotion at all.<br/><br/>Helen may have had a part in this- she was a real casting disappointment. I hoped to see a woman who was so beautiful it would convince me that yes, she could provoke a war.<br/><br/>(In the original story, Helen is courted by all the princes of Greece, and they all sign a pact to say that if harm ever befalls her, they will go to her rescue. Then, when she is stolen? something like ten years later, they are all obliged to rescue her, although by then none of them really care about her any more, and most are happily married. )<br/><br/>So Helen was really pretty boring in the movie. Her character was wishy-washy, she couldn't ever decide on anything, and to top it off she was cast next to Hectors wife(don't know this actresses name either).<br/><br/>Hector's wife, I thought was brilliant. She had personality, showed compassion and convinced me of her position. She was the type of person I imagined as Helen.<br/><br/>I think Helen would have been better portrayed as either cold, hard and incredibly, impossibly beautiful, or as a strong, courageous and influential leader of women, who used beauty to her advantage.<br/><br/>Anyway, moving on. The first third of the movie seemed really removed to me. There was all this fighting, and battle, before we even knew the characters. I suppose it introduced them in a way, especially Achilles- but it dragged the audience through a fair bit of unnecessary gore.<br/><br/>Throughout all this, the score really wasn't helping. It was so obvious in parts. The characters are trying to portray emotion, and then the blatant music goes and trumpets the exaggerated emotion in our ears, instead of subtly helping the actor's performance.<br/><br/>Now I suppose I'm giving the wrong impression-  I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!! IT WAS UTTERLY BRILLIANT! It's just I can't write a whole review going ""wonderful, fantastic, genius, masterpiece, superb, stupefying, amazing, brilliant, thrilling, engaging, great, terrific.. you get the point."" BUT HONESTLY, THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT! AND REALLY WORTH SEEING!<br/><br/>And yes- I'm coming to the hotness factor! Coz quite frankly, I didn't know which way to look! (I'm a 15 y/o girl) AS I said- I love Orlando- sooooooo utterly hot!!! But in this movie he was upstaged by Brad Pitt. I've never really known about Brad Pitt- he seemed a normal Hollywood pretentious movie-star with a big bank account- and I suppose my opinion hasn't really changed- except now he's a Hollywood pretentious movie-star with a big bank account whose also really incredibly hot! (Plus he is a good actor, I've decided, and contrary to someone else's review, I think he was a great casting choice!)<br/><br/>When Achilles was going to fight Hector, it was impossible to chose who I wanted to win. On one hand there was Hector, who is this doting father, a perfect crown-prince with an awesome personality (and on the side not bad-looking), but on the other hand this bad-boy Achilles who, if he dies, will lower the earth's temperature by 6 degrees!! I have to admit that in the end I went for Achilles.<br/><br/>Some bits almost got me crying (along with half the rest of the cinema)! and to the film's credit it also, amazingly, managed to keep the huge fight scenes (mostly)enthralling.<br/><br/>ALL in ALL, it was the type of movie that makes us forget The Return of the King, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc, and that has got to be some of the highest praise I can think of!"

This film is a great example of what happens when Hollywood money men make the decisions. Why Brad Pitt chose to star in this debacle is beyond me, not that he's ever been a particularly great actor. It's amazing that Wolfgang Peterson (who directed ""Das Boot"" so brilliantly) was involved with this piece of garbage.

He really did a great job in showing us the many dimensions to this heroic character. Orlando Bloom wasn't too bad in this movie. His character seemed to change constantly.

","Finally, porn for women. Amidst the the art directors' carefree attitude towards history, the unfortunate script writing, and the fact that we're numb to the special effects used in epic films these days, this was a great movie to watch over a glass of wine! Gals, we've been waiting for this. Men in little leathery skirts with hemlines that barely reach the outward curve of their thighs - and these guys keep falling down, legs akimbo. I have not seen so many tanned and taught legs since the time I sneaked into the gay dance party one summer long ago. I have now stolen Brad Pitt's hairdo, and looking frantically about for those wonderful little golden hair accessories the princes of Troy were so fond of. Anyway, all joking aside, it's an action movie people! It wasn't all that bad, just not what one would hope. But what it did turn out to be was a visual feast for the eyes with men who speak in complete sentences, look great even with blood on them, and remind us of the time we gals ogled the hunter gatherers. Besides, there are so many gorgeous and talented actors in one place - Brad Pitt, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, Vincent Regan, et al. One for every weeknight after a long day's work.

","OK, I can skip the-striking nonetheless-absence of gods.Let's just accept that the director had a more ""human""v version in mind. But the most well known war of mankind just couldn't have lasted 2 weeks! Mercy, please! According to the Iliad-which along with the Odyssey have been for thousands of years the bedtime story as well as an essential part of every Greek child's education,so please excuse my anger-it lasted 10 years. Of course the epic covers a period of some days,as far as action is concerned,but couldn't the film have started in a more explanatory way rather than this completely fictional and ridiculous battle?For instance there could have been the dramatic sacrifice of Ifigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, ata the port of Avlida, so that the wind would blow and allow the Greek ships to leave.Personalities who have inspired the greatest Greek tragedies such as Klitemnistra,Agamemnon's wife who along with her lover killed Agamemnon on his return to Greece,not being able to forgive him the sacrifice of her child, and Electra and Orestes,their other two kids-the former killed his mother and her lover to avenge his father's death-are nowhere in the film. Just for your information, Achilles was no cold-blooded warrior,he was also a king and his Mirmidons were his army, not a bunch of stupid warriors. Another point where I was on the verge of breaking the screen was that of Achilles's death.The man died before the Greeks entered Troy, which is why the Greeks resorted to the solution of the Trojan horse. And of course he didn't fall in love with the slave,because no Greek man gave a damn about women,especially a foreigner and especially in times of war.Achilles was in love only with himself and glory.Paris did kill him- but he was killed immediately after-by hitting his only mortal part,his left heel. Menalaus went back home WITH Helen-we meet them later in the Odyssey. Another detail that could have added emotion to the film but was not seen,was the moment when Laokoon, a Trojan priest of Apollo, warned the king Priam ""fear the Greeks when they offer gifts"" when the latter decided to accept the horse.That very moment two large snakes came from the sea and drowned him and his two sons-sent from Poseidon,the god of the sea who was on the side of the Greeks. There are countless details and many important things that have been left out or distorted-such as the apple of Discord and the three godesses Athena, Venus and Hera who claimed it ,with Venus winning it by promising Paris the most beautiful woman on earth, or the numerous Greek kings that are seen nowhere in the film though thoroughly described in the epic poem. All in all, I must say I can't be objective on commenting on the film ,as for anyone who has seen it after having read Homer's masterpiece it is a complete disappointment."
"benbrae76","8","8","18","28 August 2006"," Excellent movie, but with glaring mistakes
","I have seen both the recently made movies ""Troy"" and ""Helen of Troy"" and consider that the former is by far the superior movie of the two.<br/><br/>""Helen of Troy"" was simply romantic twaddle from start to finish, but ""Troy"" was a pretty decent effort at bringing the historical siege to life, but even in this film there were some rather glaring mistakes, that is if Homer is the source. Therefore (although there was perhaps a deliberate usage of artistic licence) I can understand if the purists are somewhat shocked.<br/><br/>1. Menelaus did not die at Troy. After the Trojan Wars he and Helen spent seven years in Egypt before returning to an everyday family life in Sparta as if nothing had happened.<br/><br/>2. Agamemnon also did not die at Troy, but returned home after the war, then was murdered by his wife and her lover.<br/><br/>3. Achilles was not in the Wooden Horse. He had already been slain by that time.<br/><br/>4. Ajax was not hacked down by Hector. With Achilles dead, the prize of that great warrior's armour was to be awarded to the one deemed to have been the most heroic, and Ajax thought that he should have been chosen. Instead, the prize was awarded to Ulysees (aka Odysseus). Ajax was furious and in an insane moment tried to kill Ulysees and other Greeks. Then mortified by what he had tried to do, and still smarting from the insult he committed suicide.<br/><br/>5. One of the major heroines of the story was missing. Where on earth was the daughter of King Priam, i.e. the all-seeing Cassandra? <br/><br/>6. The siege of Troy was not over in weeks (or even months), but lasted for ten long years. And the Trojans enlisted help from their allies the Hittites (not the Biblical Hittites, but those of the Empire, although there has been recent archaeological controversy over this difference), and even the Greeks had to call on reinforcements.<br/><br/>The performance of Brad Pitt as Achilles has been vilified to some extent by various reviewers, but I really think this is unjustified. If they read ""The Iliad"" they might discover that Brad had the characterisation just about right (although at times he did remind me of the lonely gunman in a western). Most of the other well-chosen actors also played their parts with realistic gusto and distinction, and with comprehension as to whom they were portraying. Two that stood out were Sean Bean as Ulysees, and Peter O'Toole as King Priam.<br/><br/>The intricate choreography of battle scenes and duels was out of this world, and superbly performed, and the use of computer imagery equally as good, as were the sets and music.<br/><br/>Overall, apart from the above-mentioned mistakes, I can recommend this as an extremely watchable movie, and it puts it's rival ""Helen of Troy (2003)"" somewhat to shame."

","*Contains spoilers*<br/><br/>As a Classics student, I knew that there were going to be aspects of this film that weren't accurate. I had noted that it was not called 'The Iliad' so neither was I expecting a faithful rendering of that myth. What I did not see coming, was for Hollywood to alter the story beyond recognition. It seems as if they've taken the most popular names from Greek mythology and invented their own story.<br/><br/>Now, before you start - I've seen Disney's Hercules many times and really enjoyed it, so I'm not the kind of guy who sits through films, pulls them apart and comments on how many different things are wrong. But this was a joke. Killing Menelaus and Agamemnon? It effects so many other myths.<br/><br/>Even putting all that aside - the film is absolutely appalling. I have never heard such terrible dialogue. Appalling acting from Brad Pitt (who I am normally a fan of) but a very impressive show from Eric Bana. Brian Cox also gave a solid performance.<br/><br/>I have never wanted to walk out of a film before in my life. With Troy I wanted to walk out within the first twenty minutes.

In my opinion this did a good job, the battles where good and sure some of the acting is cheesy such as Aschilles being portrayed as a womanizer sleeping with woman rather then being up in the battle when needed. And sure there was no god influence but this is in many ways a more humanistic portrayal for it is just humans fighting it out. And yes the Helen thing was inaccurate but I liked once again who cares, and I didn't pay attention to the accents, They were dressed Greek enough for me. Besides do you really want to see peoples fannies being flashed. And yes Achillies was straight and not a pedophile (yes that is right look up history and that is how he was in history if you do not believe me) So I am glad we did not see that even if it was more ""open""back then.

","""Troy"" is an excellent historical epic. Simply tossing out ""The Iliad"" altogether the film plays like the watered-down greatest hits compilation. It eliminates many characters (mainly the Greek Gods) and deliberately changes the status of many others from Homer's original story. Thats fine with me because ""Troy"" is happy to toss out the old and shake it up a little. The result is an entertaining summer epic worthy of its Golden Glory and Brad Pitt's Godlike physique (he modeled his body after that of statues of Greek gods and heroes). The battle scenes are breathtaking and exhilarating. The fall of Troy is done masterfully and is haunting and lyrical. Brad Pitt is in top shape as is Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, and everyone else. Peter O'Toole hits all the right notes as King Priam making his performance live in the mind. The best scene in the movie is the great one that will go down in history as one of the most moving ever filmed. Priam sneaks into the Greek camp and begs Achilles back for the body of Hector, Achilles opponent, whom he has defeated. Just stop right now and go check it out. Don't look for an accurate depiction of Homer's great story, but if you are looking for a big summer blockbuster with beautiful women, great fight scenes and just plain looks great, get ""Troy"" now."
"general-melchett","10","5","10","17 October 2006"," A great epic - what they all should be like!
","Troy used to be my favourite film, but Saving Private Ryan has beaten it out for the title. (This is quite a coincidence - if you look on IMDb's top grossing worldwide films chart - you will see that SPR is the film below Troy - which just goes to show that this film was no epic disaster.) This film is what all epics should be - enjoyable, with characters that you can remember, epic battle sequences and settings and set in a historical background. This film was better than Gladiator in my opinion - and I strongly feel that it should have won the Oscar for Best Costume Design. Anyway, enough of this banter...<br/><br/>Troy is without a doubt splendid to look at - the settings certainly cost a few bob, and recapture the age of the Ancient Greeks with honor and pride. The film is stunningly directed - another plus to Wolfgang Petersen's career - and with a famous cast and great cinematography. The costumes are well and truly great, and thoroughly deserving of the Oscar nomination. Though Brad Pitt's acting is a bit wooden, everything else about the acting is good. There is really lots of chemistry between the characters who love each other. The screenplay is also a spiffing job well done. So what exactly did make me go off this film, I hear you ask. Well, I'll tell you the truth.<br/><br/>To be honest, I hate romance films/films about love, and whichever way you look at Troy, it's still a film about love. Before the beautifully done battle sequences, some of the soppiest one liners of the past decade are delivered by Orlando Bloom and Helen of Troy, and the film starts to get a bit boring. The fact that this film is not meant to be fully based on the Iliad (it was only inspired by it) is no problem to me, but at the very start of the film, Wolfgang Petersen and co. had the two armies marching towards each other, and could have given us a huge battle to kick the film off with, instead of one rather disappointing death by Achilles. But there is nothing badly done about this film, and to be honest, it is a film that all epics should aspire to. Despite the disappointing one-disc release (which I bought), the two-disc release is full of great features - I suggest you buy that instead.<br/><br/>Troy is a great film - watch it if you get the chance! A stunning job! 10/10"

Orlando Bloom does not really play a huge part in the movie as I thought but he would but he was alright. Not a real action hero. But watch Helan of Troy if you want a more accurate story. The weapons of the time were very accurate. Spear and shield were the main weapon of choice due to the reach it had on your opponent. The walls of Troy in this movie were spectacular. I cannot believe that they actually built that. The movie was accurate for the most part and was greatly played by the actors."

","""Troy"" is as faithful to its literary inspiration as any movie made on this subject matter can be.<br/><br/>Divine influences are eliminated, by necessity, but political themes are left intact. It would be a mistake to think those issues were inserted by movie-makers; they were an integral part of the epic novel in its original form.<br/><br/>Achilles is given an expanded role, one which might bother purists, but probably makes the movie more interesting to most viewers.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox as the opposing kings are superb. Eric Bana provides an excellent performance as the true hero of the story, Hector. And Brad Pitt does very well as the central character, Achilles, in one of his finest works. <br/><br/>Beautifully filmed, superbly acted, ""Troy"" is one of the greatest epic movies ever filmed.

"akshay-misra","10","5","10","29 May 2006"," One of the best films: HECTOR IS THE REAL HERO.
","One must not expect the film to mirror Homer's Troy. Still many elements of the film reflect the actual message that Homer was trying to put across. One of these elements was the distinction in character between the Achilles and the Trojan hero, Hector. Achilles was depicted as ruthless, someone who had undeniable thirst for glory and immortality. Glory for him was achieved through war and the blood of other men. Conversely, Hector was a good son, brother, husband, father, general, leaderall in all someone who stood for all things just and right. Hector represents the pure aspects of honour that should be present in leaders, a driving force for the people on Troy. In the film Hector was the real 'wall' that defended Troy.<br/><br/>Emotionally strong, Eric Bana depicted the character of Hector very well. His expressions were of top quality. Even the pain and fear in his eyes were relevant. He and the honourable character of Hector are the reasons my rating for this film are a perfect '10'."
"jon2005","7","5","10","22 May 2006"," Troy
","The arrival of Troy heralded slightly unfair expectations  all the critics expected it to be just like Gladiator. But why? They are not the same. Let's get this cleared up right now  they're not set in the same period, the same country, nor are they about a similar topic. One is about a war, the other a personal vendetta. One is made up, the other is based on stories told over 3,000 years ago. In fact, one could almost say that the only things they have in common are sandals and swords. Oh, and remarkably everyone speaks English. Which is helpful.<br/><br/>Troy is a much more epic film than Gladiator, and this clearly shows in its impressive production values, whether it's the awesome sight of the 1,000 ships sailing across the Aegean Sea, or the brutal battle scenes  everything looks right. However, whilst this is all well and good, the problems stem from the source material itself.<br/><br/>The credits claim the film was ""inspired by The Iliad"", and here is the first problem. The film is historically inaccurate, and this is most obvious towards the end. The Iliad is the story of Achilles, and does not involve the infamous Wooden Horse, or even the sack of Troy. These are covered in later epics The Odyssey and Virgil's The Aeneid. It's as if the director never read these works, and made up the rest of the story as he went along. Not that it makes too much difference to the story, but those familiar with the epics will feel cheated. Also the motives for the war, whilst they made absolute sense in the society in which the stories were first told, don't hold true anymore. In the epics the stories were concerned with heroes, honour and love. That this war was started because Paris stole someone else's girl just doesn't sit well with a modern audience, and so they cannot relate to these heroes. It doesn't help with the fact that the audience doesn't know which side they should be rooting for  there are in the epics no real ""goodies"" and ""baddies"", merely two nations each with their own heroes. The director has to take time every now and again to reiterate the reasons for the war, that of Paris' love for Helen, but tries to give a more believable reason by giving Brian Cox's character of Agamemnon a more imperialistic bent, deviating further from his source.<br/><br/>I've managed to make Troy seem like a disaster, but it is in fact far from it. If the audience can just accept the reasons for the war, then there is little problem in enjoying the rest of the film. The beginning is slow to get going, but once Achilles (Brad Pitt) and Hector (Eric Bana) have their one-on-one clash, the film reaches a momentum it does not lose. The battle scenes easily rival any seen on the big screen to date, and most of the cast do an impressive job in portraying their heroes in varying degrees of suffering. Honours should be given to Eric Bana for his role as the suitably regal heir to Troy, who suffers the wrath of Achilles in a simply choreographed yet remarkably compelling clash, and to Peter O'Toole who plays Hector's father and king of Troy, Priam. Also, contrary to most critical response, Brad Pitt plays the character of Achilles with a suitable display of bravery, power and shows one hell of a temper, even though after his fight with Hector his motivation for staying is lost. Orlando Bloom's Paris is a little weak, turning into Legolas-without-the-wig towards the end, and Diane Kruger's Helen lacks interest, but otherwise the cast are fine. Aside from a few niggles - including a fairly clunky script which does the film no favours - and an extensive running time, Troy is an enjoyable film, which deserves to sit high up in the ranks of sword-and-sandal epics.<br/><br/>Rated: 7.5/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","Perhaps my comment won't mean much to some folks due to the fact that I'm not as into the ""Iliad"" or Homer or Greek mythology as a lot of other people on IMDb. I knew the basics of the Trojan War. I knew the main characters,Achilles, Patroclus, Hector, Paris, Helen, and Menelaus. But other than that, I was totally ignorant to the details. Having said that, I thought the film was great. I loved it. And no, it wasn't because Brad Pitt is hot and sexy. He's really not all that attractive. But I thought ""Troy"" had a really good story line. I can't say anything about the so-called ""inaccuracies"" of the film, since I'm not very familiar with the ""Iliad"" anyway. But I do have a new found respect for Eric Bana. After seeing him in ""The Hulk"", I thought he was horrible.It never occurred to me that the ""The Hulk"" would have been bad no matter who starred in it. But I absolutely loved Hector in ""Troy"". I thought Bana was really convincing and he appealed to my emotions. To me, one of the most powerful scenes was when Paris fought Menelaus and he crawled to Hector to defend him. And Hector, being the loving brother that he was, saved him. I don't know why but that scene just touched me. I don't mean to ramble, but I absolutely HATED Helen. As I've heard the story told, she was kidnapped by the Trojans. But in the film, the fact that she willingly left with Paris (and I thought he was an idiot too) knowing that Menelaus would send an army for her, made me mad. But my overall impression is that this was an awesome movie. Like I said, I'm ignorant about the ""Iliad"" for the most part so I really don't have much to compare it to, but I thought the movie was good."

","I went to the cinema in anticipation of watching a bind-blowing action epic, I came out having watched a good film with excellent elements, but weak spots that sorely let it down. The battle scenes were, admittedly, stunning, and didn't make the mistake of running on for far too long as many films have in the past. The one on one between Achilles & Hector was spectacular, as well as being a technically brilliant fight, it created a story & tension. I also loved the build up to the fight, Hector's struggle with himself & his final goodbyes, so heart wrenching. There were some great performances, & I must particularly single out Eric Bana as Hector. I hadn't really heard of him before this film, but wow! He portrayed Hector as a tortured soul, torn between duty to his land and devotion to his family. A truly brilliant performance, I'm still astonished at how he was snubbed in the awards season. Others turning in credible performances were Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Saffron Burrows (played the loving wife in absolute terror to perfection) & Rose Byrne. However, THE major weakness was the central love story between Helen & Paris. I just didn't believe it! I've always been a big fan of Orlando, loved him in LOTR & POTC, but was undeniably weak here. Diane Kruger was breathtakingly beautiful but regrettably wooden. The other two love stories had far more believability, especially Hector & his wife. Overall, A solid film with flashes of excellence."

Who wants to see Apollo and Zeus in a movie or Jupiter and Mars as TV program characters? The maximum TV/Cinema presence that God has got in western media is probably in The Simpsons of all things. God is acceptable only in comic movies like Bruce almighty. No heroic, or for that matter mischievous and deceiving or scheming Gods are acceptable in Cinema. Troy is not a stage production, it is a movie (Greek stage productions regularly had God magically appear save the day).<br/><br/>Great mythological stories do not translate into great movies. Troy is made more like a fictional account of a mythological story and not a historical event (all historical research on Troy is disputed.) I have never read Homer's Iliad and do not intend to. But I have read abridged versions of the story, even in Hindi (my mother tongue.) I knew about Achilles' heels, about the decision of Paris (not in movie), about Helen of Troy, and about the Wooden Horse. I knew almost enough to know most of the movie. The movie changed the story quite a bit and it must have offended those who wanted to see Homer's Iliad, this on the other hand was Wolfgang Petersen's Troy. If you have the ability to differentiate between the two you will love this movie.<br/><br/>Some complained about the way the movies made everything grandiose. About the lack of tension and the emphasis on heroics. About the lack of a feeling of a war, about computer generated soldiers. In many ways Troy was like Lord of the Rings in those respects. Ebert wanted this movie to be more like ""The Alamo"" a movie that has a rating of 5.9 on IMDb. If critics understand what fictionalised accounts of a mythological story are supposed to be like they would understand that we are not expected to look for reality in such a movie. Characters of such a movie are not supposed to be afraid of war, they are not realists they are romantics. Romanticism allows for married women to fall in love with a stranger, for Greek heroes to act like action figures, for men to go to war over women, for heroes to not kill princes early in the day. If you want to see a true war movie see Das Boot or Platoon, nothing to see here, move on. Troy is supposed to be about misplaced heroics like every mythological story. We love and accept mythological stories in there own universe due in part to their absurdities. This is a screen version of one such great story, minus (thankfully) the Gods.<br/><br/>So does this mean a mega budget movie like Troy can do no wrong. Yes it can, but this movie did not. Especially by not doing what critics wanted from it - exploration of human psychology inside a war zone. This was just an epic re-telling of beautiful story, and it succeeded in that."

"redfearnb","8","5","10","18 March 2006"," Nice interpretation of the poem by Homer.
","I mostly was interested in watching this movie because I am supposed to be reading the Odyssey right now in English. Troy is all about two things: Achilles (Brady Pitt) and war. Which also means two other things are featured in this movie: gore and sex. Now first off, there isn't any sex going on in the movie. You get plenty of shots of Pitt's butt and of the girls he sleeps with wrapped in sheets, but there isn't anything that bad. However, the gore is definitely there. I'd say it isn't as intense as a movie like Saving Private Ryan, but there are plenty of dead bodies. What would you expect from a ten year long war?<br/><br/>The movie had some interesting artistic interpretations involved with it. Some things the screenwriters portrayed were completely different from anything that I had previously conceived in my mind, which still did not detract from the story. I would love to see these folks do a continuation of this story connecting with the Odyssey. The effects are great, especially in the rendering of the massive armies as they fight. I wasn't completely thrilled to have nothing but Pitt featured in the movie, but he is the hero who falls at the end of the movie, so I can understand why it is that way.<br/><br/>All in all, its a good movie, even at the almost four hour length. You might need a short break in the middle of the movie to survive it, but if you are watching it on TiVo, then you don't have to worry about pausing the movie. Since it runs along the lines of Gladiator, I don't see how the TV version could differ much from the DVD."
"ebiros2","7","5","10","5 October 2005"," First movie better seen in full screen
","I know that there're debates about artistic purity in seeing a wide screen movie edited for full screen, but I truly believe that Troy is the first movie that's actually better seen in full screen format.<br/><br/>The focus is much clearer on full screen edition, and you won't lose any information seeing it in this format.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is great in this movie. His moves, and his acting are all spot on as Achilles. I also didn't know that Eric Bana was such a good physical actor until I saw this movie. The only cast I wish was more convincing was Helen. She actually looked like a girl next door and not the exotic beauty that we imagine Helen to be. So it's not totally convincing to say that she had the power to launch 1000 ships. If only they were able to dig deeper into casting of this role, the movie would have been better.<br/><br/>Production is of epic proportion and captures the atmosphere of the city and the battle well. Purist might complain that the story is not accurate to history, but if Achilles actually chased Hector couple of times around the walls of Troy in this movie, that would take up all the show time.<br/><br/>If you're planning to see this movie, try the full screen version. You won't be disappointed. I just wish that DVDs produced stuck to the standard encoding format. My DVD of this movie when played in continuous play mode shows only the intro, FBI warnings and skips the entire content of the movie all together."

"pgeo2286","8","5","10","10 February 2005"," The Wrath of Achilles
","It's very easy to pick apart Troy. Not only does the film kill off major characters from Homer's epic ""The Illiad"", but it presents a Helen that makes Achilles' concubine, Briseus, more attractive than the face that launched a thousand ships. Despite its shortcomings, however, Troy is actually an excellent movie. Instead of focusing on the Trojan Horse or the kidnapping of Helen (both of which is NOT in the Illiad) the film focuses on the rocky relationship between the brilliant, bright-eyed warrior Achilles, and the Agammemnon, commander of the Greek forces.<br/><br/>While Achilles is doing all the work destroying the Trojans on the battlefield, King Agammemnon is getting all the credit. Achilles is not at all thrilled with serving for Agammemnon, and the hate both have for each other is displayed very well by the actors. The greedy and land hungry Agammemnon hates Achilles' insolence, but needs him to capture Troy. When Agammemnon takes away Achilles' ""prize"", the Trojan priestess Briseus for himself, Achilles sulks in his tent and refuses to fight. This is the central theme in Troy, and is also the main focus of Homer's ""The Illiad"".<br/><br/>With the notable exception of Helen, everyone is cast well for their roles. The brave and cerebral Hector, the idealistic but cowardly Paris, and the regal and proud King Priam all portray their characters well. The action is top-rate, with the opening scene and the one-on-one battle between Achilles and Hector highlighting the war scenes. The scene with King Priam asking Achilles for the body of his son is extremely touching and passionate and by far the best non-action scene in the film.<br/><br/>While the film is hardly the Illiad on film, you can't fault Troy for trying to take the focus off the love of Helen and Paris, the Trojan Horse, and the Greek gods for the Illiad's true plot, the wrath of Achilles."

","This is a truly contemporary view of these ancient events, complete with religious ""fundamentalist"" priests guiding political leaders into erroneous directions with tragic results, and warrior heroes seeing the folly of war but helpless to redirect their own actions. The spectacle is beyond the old films of the 40's and 50's and strives to be as authentic as possible in detail, without reaching so far as to create an artistic fantasy like ""Amadeus"". Archaology and travel buffs can revel in the realistic beauty of the sites while history buffs are discomforted only minimally by the most minor and inconsequential diversions away from Homer's narrative. Bloom plays true to the historical profile of Paris-- no hero, but a real person from our own times-- perhaps someone we know personally: vain, impulsive, irresponsible, and noble too late. Pitt is, surprisingly enough, a convincing Achilles, one of whom Homer himself would probably have approved. For all its length, it was over too soon for me."

","Being a fan of historical epics, I was naturally looking forward to Troy. However, having seen Gladiator a dozen times, I knew it would be hard work to surpass that masterpiece, and with respect, it doesn't. However, it is still a great epic, with strong performances and a flowing storyline. Eric Bana puts in a good performance as ever benevolent Hector, Prince of Troy; Brian Cox as the evil and over ambitious king Agamemnon; Orlando Bloom as Hector's foolish younger brother, Paris; and of course, Brad Pitt as the Adonis warlord Archilles. With so many characters, it's understandable that audiences might get lost unless they are familiar with Homer's Illiad. But the film still manages to provide a smooth storyline to Homer's account of the Trojan war, all be it, a Hollywood version, where the Gods are not involved at all. Added to that, the battle scenes are breathtaking and the fight scenes Eric and Brad provide deserve admiration for their athletic prowess. On the whole, it's hard to fault the film except, it's not as gritty as Gladiator, doesn't give the audience a feeling of being there, and unless audiences are familiar with the Trojan War, many may not see what a good effort it has been."

Brad Pitt is not bad either, but he's been a lot better and in some places he seems a bit lost in the middle of this movie.<br/><br/>What comes to Orlando Bloom, well, he still doesn't convince me with his acting skills. Legolas still seems to haunt his career.

","The performance of the film is absolutely fantastic. If it was a newly invented story, this film would have deserved 10 points without any doubt. But that's the problem about it: Homer's Ilias is a thick book, the story is full of complex and not less important sidelines and all in all it describes 10 years of war. A film simply can't do this in 3 hours; so all elements of the original story are missing which have no special interest to the main storyline, for example the Greek gods, kassandra and most of the previous life of the heroes. What is left is the main story about the war against Troja and the surface of the Greek tragedy - and I was astonished that it still works perfectly, even there are little changes to parts of the story (Agamemmnon was killed by his wife Klytemnaestra when back in Sparta again for example). Putting the Ilias in just one film might be comparable to if they had made only one film out of the Lord of the Rings."

","OK I've read a number of the comments written about this movie - many tearing it down because of inaccuracies (not just inaccuracies but GLARING ones) - and in general I agree. While film makers need to have some license with the material in order to squeeze a 1000 page plus book into two hours, I agree with one of the other opinions that they changed SO much the writers would have been better off doing their own story in that time period. Peter Jackson did an infinitely better job with the Lord of the Rings because he gave the larger-than-life story the screen time it deserved.<br/><br/>Let me just add a couple of observations that I haven't seen listed in any of the other comments as of yet. I've heard a bit of Greek music in my day and the music in the background during the battle scenes (a lady singing ""ah-ee-ay"" etc.) does NOT sound Greek - sounded much more like an Indian chant. But my biggest beef with TROY is this: The reason that Achilles was SO bummed about the death of Patroclus and treated Hector the way he did was not because he felt guilty for sending his ""cousin"" into war but because they were LOVERS! The two men were inseparable and ""closer than brothers"" as referred to in both the Iliad and Odyssey. Granted, I didn't expect to see Brad Pitt in any make out scenes with another guy - the producers in Hollywood (and America audiences in general) are still a bit too homophobic for that. There are ways they could have hinted at the relationship however and made the connection between the two men much stronger without ever resorting to a physical moment. Instead, they portrayed Patroclus as a young pup that hung on Achilles every word while leaving no question in anyone's mind that Achilles was a straight, womanizer (albeit reformed at the end). Look at our first glimpse of Brad in the movie- he's sandwiched between two wenches!! Is it so hard for people to believe that the best fighter in the Trojan war was capable of an intimate relationship with another man? The admitted gay heroes in myth and history are so few and far between  does Hollywood really think it necessary to make this famous couple straight too?"

Brad Pitt rises to an amazing level of brilliance inspired no doubt by Peter O'Toole's contribution of some of the most stellar acting I have ever seen him offer!

There is nothing wrong with emphasizing his perfection. However, i cannot but say that Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole and Rose Byrne stole the show. Eric Bana portrayed a character so deep that one cannot but get enthralled in the movie. Peter O'Toole is excellent as a proud and forlorn father and Rose Byrne was magnificent as a woman torn.

","Troy (2004) War Epic Reviewed 5/16/04 Starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Brian Cox, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Peter O'Toole, Brian Gleeson<br/><br/>Plot: 2.3/2.5: This is the story of the fall of Troy, adapted from the epic poem 'The Iliad' by Homer. Achilles (Pitt) is the greatest soldier Greece has ever seen, and has one them many battles. Greece has finally made peace with Troy, much to the chagrin of Agamemnon (Cox), war pig and brother of Greece's king Menelaus (Gleeson). Unfortunately for peace, Menelaus' wife Helen (Kruger) has been having an affair Prince Paris of Troy (Bloom). When it is time for the Trojans to leave, Helen goes with Paris, and a war starts over love. The Greeks, led by Achilles, and the Trojans, led by Prince Hector (Bana) are now faced with one of the most memorable tales in Greece's history. The only reason I didn't give full points is because it apparently takes a few too many liberties. I have never read 'The Iliad', but apparently the war is supposed to last ten years, not three weeks. Achilles was also supposed to love his best friend Patrolocus, who is turned into his cousin in the movie, and Achilles falls for Trojan Breseis. These inaccuracies don't bother me since I never read 'The Iliad', but I couldn't bring myself to give full points.<br/><br/>Action: 2.5/2.5: The action is great. While the war scenes aren't on par with Braveheart, many of the fights are brilliant. The fight between Hector and Achilles is one of the best I have ever seen. Very entertaining.<br/><br/>Acting: 2.5/2.5: This is the category that may trouble some. While I never thought Bloom was great (he was terrible in Pirates of the Caribbean), his normal crappy approach works for the cowardly but determined Paris. Pitt is a pretty boy, and doesn't work wonders for me, but gets the job done as Achilles. Bean is a good Odysseus and Kruger is a decent Helen. I would have given a 2/2.5 for these alone, but Bana, Cox and O'Toole do such a great job, it is worth more than full marks. Bana did so good it almost made me feel bad he had anything to do with HULK (he should feel bad too). Cox has always struck me as great, and this proves it. O'Toole is a great Priam, and manages to keep his accent very much in check. I want to see all three get award noms for this.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 2.5/2.5: If you can sit through a 2 hour 45 minute movie, this is for you, no matter what.<br/><br/>Bonus -.2 for Pitt's almost nudity: Self explanatory.<br/><br/>Total: 96%: Now this is a movie. It is without a doubt the best of the year so far and it has a chance of doing well at the Oscars (but what do I know). While it is not as good as Braveheart, it is a great movie that anyone with any attention span should see.<br/><br/>Also See: Gladiator, Braveheart"
"RobertHI","8","5","10","17 May 2004"," Some points of information
","In Greek myth Briseus was Achilles' favorite slave girl. Chryseis, a priestess of Apollo, was a prize of war for Agamemnon. Achilles forced Agamemnon to return Chryseis to her father, a priest, to appease Apollo, who had caused a pestilence to descend on the Greek troops as punishment for her capture. In retaliation, Agamemnon deprived Achilles of Briseus. In the movie, the two characters are nicely combined in a way which strengthens Achilles' connection to Priam.<br/><br/>The story of the killing of Achilles by Paris shooting Achilles through the heel with an arrow is not found in Homer, but in a later poem called Aethiopis by Arctinus.<br/><br/>According to legend Achilles' mother was a sea nymph named Thetis. In the movie, Julie Christie definitely plays a mortal, not a goddess, although one of the characters mentions his lineage from the gods. According to Homer he was raised by his mother with his inseparable companion and cousin Patroclus. One of the non-Homeric tales of his childhood tells of Thetis dipping him in the River Styx by which he became invulnerable, except for the part of the heel by which she held him.<br/><br/>The character of Aeneas is in the Iliad and he survives the Trojan war, but the handing off of the Trojan sword for the future founding of Rome is pure Virgil.<br/><br/>I hope you get to see the movie. It's not perfect, but there's lots to recommend it."

It's funny to see this behaviour in a man when one is used to this coming from Hollywood actresses.<br/><br/>The other actors are mostly decent although the script blocks any attempts of serious acting. There are some good lines, though. Hector has some of them talking about the war and I considered Helena's remark that she doesn't want a hero anyway to be really good. Not the usual Hollywood macho talk! The acting of Krüger (Helena) is possibly the worst of the movie, though. She delivers each of her lines as if she acts in a cheap soap opera. But I guess they could get her cheap. Patroclus comes across as an annoying beardless brat. Julie Christie appears in the credits, I wonder what she is doing in a movie like this and why I didn't spot her. Was she Achilles' mother? The actress playing Hector's wife is great, she should have played Helena. She possesses an unusual beauty (something rare in Hollywood) and an unique appearance. The actor playing Lysander was very interesting. It's a really small part but his looks were interesting and he seems to be talented.<br/><br/>The direction is rather uneven. Some scenes are shot in a really good, classical way and some are done in that atrocious MTV style. The great score by Yared has also been replaced by a more or less mediocre score by Horner - I guess Horner's score was just louder and they wanted really loud music. This post production meddling really hurt the movie.<br/><br/>The way they changed Homer's poem is rather questionable, too. Why did they change Patroclus from being the hero's lover to his cousin? That's even more strange considering that Achilles and Patroclus act like to (ideal) male lovers in the movie, anyway. During the movie you start to wonder whether ""cousin"" is a code word for ""gay male lover"". In connection with the amount of remarks in the movie that every man has a wife and has to have a wife and so on coming from the Greeks I think this movie is unreasonably heterosexistic.<br/><br/>The ending is rather funny. Brad Pitt/Achilles, the king of romance, may of course not die covered with blood or dirt. No, he has to be kept clean and the ending worships his character as the best hero and so on. I think this overdone hero worshipping came across as childish. Besides, who would know about him if Homer didn't write that poem? Why does the script not include Homer? They could have included him at the ending writing the poem or something like that. But the script has some good tendencies, too. It *is* war-critical and that's really great considering this movie is from Hollywood, USA. So, this movie has some good aspects but a lot of bad aspects, too. Wait for it coming out as rental video."

","Allow me to say that when I first heard director Wolfgang Peterson was attempting to recreate the Trojan war I was pleased. When I heard Brad Pitt would be staring in the lead role of the famous warrior Achilles, I was overjoyed. This film met every single expectation of mine, twice over! It was absolutely wonderful from start to finish and though the original story underwent minor changes, it was still accurate and beautifully rendered. The acting was superb and the complex and round characters were played perfectly by a fine group of actors. Given the chance to see it again, I would. This film will be sure to revive Eric Bana's career after that mistake we like to call ""The Hulk"" Both he and Brad Pitt did amazing jobs making their characters real and allowing the audience to feel connected. And for all of you Orlando Bloom fans out there, he did a fine job playing Paris! Do I recommend seeing Troy? Ohh Ya!"
"spelunker","1","5","10","15 May 2004"," Really, Really Bad
","This movie sucked. No other way to put it. I walked in not expecting an Academy Award winner, but I was hoping to be entertained by a rousing epic nonetheless. After the first thirty minutes, however, I realized that this movie was going nowhere. The battle scenes are cheesy, grainy, and often incoherent ripoffs of those in Braveheart and LOTR. Perhaps it's no coincidence that five actors from those films are featured in Troy. As for the story, well most of the time it's like the director is saying ""well, screw the movie i'm just going to show you shots of Brad Pitt and Eric Bana because the audience won't be able to get over how hot they are."" If that's your bag, fine...you'll love this movie. But if you are actually hoping to see a good rendition of The Iliad you will be severely disappointed. Not to be a spoiler for those who haven't seen it, but the original story and characters are changed so much that Homer must be rolling in his grave right now. Achilles isn't even close to how he is depicted in The Iliad (and neither is his death), and somehow miraculously the Trojan War is reduced from 10 years in the poem to a matter of days in the movie. Moreover, the Greek gods, who play an extremely large role in the poem, aren't even featured in the movie and are actually belittled by the script's idiocy. In short, this movie is far from being anything special, and even though it will be a sure blockbuster and most people will be tempted to at least see it, it's a waste of 2 1/2 hours. If you want to watch a good epic go rent the Last Samurai, Gladiator, LOTR, or Braveheart. Those movies are all 10 times better than the Brad Pitt ego trip and dumbed down story presented by Troy."

","Note: There are some vague spoilers here, but nothing new if you've read any Homer, or even the Cliff Notes of the Illiad.<br/><br/>Anyone who has read Homer should know the plot of Troy. But you don't, and perhaps that's a good thing. The costuming, hair, and fighting are correct for the time period, but the plot definitely isn't Homer. This movie is ""inspired by"" the Illiad, not based on it. People die that are supposed to live and those that are supposed to die rarely die at the right time or at all. But what are timelines in the face of modern cinema? You cannot tell that the war lasted ten years in Wolfgang Peterson's version, but, frankly, you probably won't care. Peterson has given us characters to cheer for, wince at, and question.<br/><br/>The questioning is probably the most attractive part. Achilles is by no means perfect, and although Paris is more appealing than he seems in the Illiad, he is still a coward. But we forgive him, and not just because he is Orlando Bloom. We forgive Paris because he tries to be a hero, and he fails. He is human in that sense.<br/><br/>I'm actually incredibly surprised by Orlando Bloom's performance in this movie. His scenes with Hector are incredibly well done. His Paris is much more forgivable then I like to think of him as, but Paris is in love. Ohhhhhhh love, not lust, love. What a change.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Eric Bana are great as two incredible forces on the battlefield who are fated to bump into one another. Bana has the perfect face and stance for a Mediterranean in Troy's time period, and I couldn't help comparing him to pre-classical statues. Pitt is not the Achilles I imagined, but few men are. He is brooding and philosophical, and has as much a sense of fate as Hector does.<br/><br/>Troy shows all the stupid reasons we go to war and all the stupid reasons we stay at war. It shows senseless killing, huge egoes, and pointless death. It is war as it has always been and always will be.<br/><br/>Many will see Troy's political aims, especially those who heard Wolfgang Peterson's comments on the films, but please don't let that make up your mind for you. Troy shows war as it truly is: chaos that can cause a kind-hearted, peaceful man to kill a defenseless kid in his cousin's armor."
"clorby","9","5","10","16 May 2004"," Now one of my favorite movies
","I can not begin to describe how good this movie was.  It had everything almost perfectly blended into one movie.  There was a little humor, there was sadness, mourning, war, love, action, suspense, drama, there was a little of everything in one story.  And what's better, this all seems like it could be true.  The battle tactics were pure genius. 	The cast was perfect, and not just because the 3 main guys are total hunks. (Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom) But they all fit in together great and Peter O'Toole as the father was wonderful.  All the actors just fed off each others energy it seamed, which is what they need to do. 	I just think that this is a movie that will stand the test of time.  You sit in the theater and watch it, but you also feel like you are in the movie.  There were real people doing the battling, making it feel all the more realistic.  It makes you want to grab your spear and shield and get in there and fight for whatever side you're rooting for.  Because of these graphic battles though, and the love scenes, it is rated R.  So it is not for children, but it is still a great movie."
"Barky44","8","5","10","16 May 2004"," An excellent retelling
","Troy is a retelling of the ancient Iliad by Homer. The story is familiar: Paris of Troy abducts Helen, wife of Menelaus of Sparta, brother of King Agamemnon. Agammemnon gathers all the armies of the city-states of Greece and sets sail in a thousand ships to sack Troy.<br/><br/>Director Wolfgang Peterson has crafted an excellent retelling of this story. Not only does he get the look and feel of the epic poem (including the arms and armor and even the nudity), not only does he craft horribly wicked battle sequences, but he actually tells the stories of the characters.<br/><br/>
In so many movies today the characters and plots take a back seat to the action sequences. Peterson has done a great job balancing all of this. The filmmakers also give good screen time to the stories of Achilles vs. Agamemnon over Briseis; the fondness Achilles has for his cousin Patroclus; the loyalty between Hector and Paris; Paris' love for Helen; Agamemnon's general greed. You can actually feel Priam's pain as he begs Achilles for the body of his dead son. Sure, he left out the rivalries between the gods, but their absence does not detract from the film at all (IMHO it enhances it).<br/><br/>The only issues I have with this film were a few implausible elements here and there, and a performance by Brad Pitt that stumble for the first 30 minutes. It takes that long to get used to him in the role of the great warrior.<br/><br/>I am very pleased with this movie. 8 out of 10."
"Li-1","Null","5","10","15 May 2004"," An often rousing and emotionally engaging epic, but could clearly have benefited from a stronger and more equal emphasis on its many themes, subplots, and characters.
","*** out of ****<br/><br/>The die-hard Iliad fans who won't appreciate or condone the many changes and liberties Wolfgang Petersen's adaptation takes with the original literature should probably stay away from Troy, but I think they're missing the point entirely.  Having read The Iliad myself and having just seen Troy, I am convinced this is probably as good an adaptation as one can get.<br/><br/>
To atually maintain rigid levels of faithfulness would require the story to be divided into at least two fairly lengthy films, but believe me, there's only so much interest this particularly small-scale war can hold for so long (for crying out loud, despite boasting armies in the dozens of thousands, it's fought over a relatively small stretch of unappealing land).  What director Petersen and writer David Benioff have merely done is condense the tale, tossed out almost all elements of the supernatural, and focus mostly on Achilles' desire for glory, giving him an even further human emphasis than the Homeric tale.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with the famous tale, Troy is set over three thousand years ago, an ancient time when the many nations of Greece have been all but conquered by King Agamemnon (Brian Cox).  With only one kingdom remaining, Thessaly, Agamamenon calls upon his greatest but most rebellious warrior, Achilles (Brad Pitt), lord of the Myrmidons, to fight for him yet again.  In swift combat, Achilles kills Thessaly's reigning champion in a matter of seconds, and all of Greece is united under the power-hungry Agamemnon's rule.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Sparta, the King's brother, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), has just made peace with the leaders of Troy, who are represented by the princes Hektor (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom).  But the peace lasts no more than a day when Helen, who has fallen in love with Paris, is smuggled aboard the Trojan ship on its return home. Upon this discovery, Menelaus wages war, asking his brother to join him.  This being the perfect opportunity to either crush or rule Greece's rival nation, Agamemnon accepts the offer.<br/><br/>The Greeks plan to launch a thousand ships, but to ensure victory, Agamemnon uses Odysseus (Sean Bean) to enlist the aid of Achilles, who reluctantly agrees to join the expedition so that his name and glory may be remembered for all time.  Upon arrival at the beaches of Troy, the Myrmidons push back Hektor and his men, and take prisoner the priestess and Trojan King's (Peter O'Toole) niece, Briseis (Rose Byrne).  Achilles develops a sexual and romantic relationship with Briseis, which makes him question his outlook of the war and his reasons for fighting, but an act of violence against one of his men will propel him back into the war and against the Trojans' honorable and reigining hero, Hektor.<br/><br/>At the heart of Troy is the story of Achilles, but the film tries to cover considerably more plots and themes than just his battle for reputation and immortality and his consequent romance with Briseis.  There's the love of Paris and Helen, the honor and strength of Hektor, the brotherly love of Hektor and Paris, the fatherly love of Priam, the greed and debauchery of Agamemnon and Menelaus, and an assortment of many characters who are given the short shrift compared to Achilles and the leaders of Troy. <br/><br/>
Therein lies the film's major flaw; with so many character, so many converging storylines, there's only so much one can accomplish with a running time of 163 minutes.  The storytelling is occasionally somewhat choppy, especially in the opening, in which Paris and Helen are shown as already being in love without actually showing how this relationship developed beyond the fact that each is considered exceedingly attractive for his and her respective genders.<br/><br/>The uninitiated will probably find themselves slightly disoriented and bombarded with the many characters that are awkwardly introduced, each new addition inserted at the most opportune moment simply because he or she has to play an important role to the outcome of the story later in the film (i.e. Odysseus, Patroclus, Andromache, etc.).  <br/><br/>But as distracting as these flaws are, there's no questioning that the core subplots the film does choose to focus on are the most compelling ones. There are many interesting relationships in the film, none more so than Achilles' burgeoning love for Briseis, which brings out a conflicting sense of duty, if not necessarily loyalty, among both.  Brad Pitt and Rose Byrne have such good chemistry that their moments together work, especially their final, poignant scene together.  Despite many reports to the contrary, Pitt is actually quite good as Achilles, supporting his character well through his many internal (and external) conflicts.<br/><br/>As Hektor, Eric Bana excellently portrays the film's most effortlessly likeable character, a hero whose every move is torn between love for his soldiers and his brother, and deciding what's best for Troy.  Orlando Bloom also impresses as the semi-cowardly Paris who discovers the backbone and drive to fight.  Peter O'Toole delivers perhaps the film's best performance as King Priam of Troy; an emotional scene between him and Achilles might just be enough to land O'Toole a supporting Oscar nod, though it's a bit too early to tell.<br/><br/>The film's numerous action sequences are rousing and keep the film moving at a surprisingly fast pace; while most of the massive-scale battles are a little too short to truly satisfy (the exception being the terrific siege sequence goes badly for the Greeks), it's the one-on-one fights that deliver genuine thrills and even suspense.  Three such showdowns are very impressive, Paris vs. Menelaus, Hektor vs. Ajax, and the best of them all, the battle between Hektor and Achilles, the most exciting and freshest take on ancient combat I've seen since Gladiator.  <br/><br/>This fight between each kingdom's best warrior is representative of what works so well in Troy, it develops its main characters as genuine humans and doesn't choose sides over whom is hero and whom is villain (clearly, the Greek kings are meant to be the film's ""boo-hiss"" bad guys, and not the warriors they command).  For that, this film is leagues more complex and complicated than any summer blockbuster I've seen this decade. <br/><br/>
Visually, the film is spectacular without being totally engulfing, which is a bit of a pity.  For all the money spent on the production, I didn't quite find myself drawn into this ancient world as much as I would have liked (probably because, as I said earlier, it's almost exclusively set on a small stretch of land).  It is, in fact, only in the climax that one can totally immerse himself in the film's reality, because of the imminent and wide-scale destruction, frantic behavior, and overwhelming emotions that are displayed.<br/><br/>Also working as visuals, Troy boasts the most attractive cast in recent memory, with Pitt, Bana, and Bloom appealing to the female audience and Rose Byrne, Saffron Burrows, and Diane Krueger displaying the literal beauty of the time period.  I am particularly smitten with Byrne, whom I hope to see in future works.  Watch Troy for its cast and its great action, which combine for a highly entertaining if heavily flawed picture."

","First of all, Wolfgang Petersen did not set out to film ""The Iliad"". ""Troy"" is another account of the story BASED on ""The Iliad"". I get so tired of the critical remarks on this site. People go to a sneak preview and rush home to IMDB, rarely with anything positive to say about this or ANY picture. The talent assembled in this cast and crew was enough to sell me a ticket and the film DOES deliver! Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom showed off their talents well in the given roles. I didn't expect to see a Laurence Olivier performance. I got what I paid to see. The crowd and action scenes are spectacular and did NOT disappoint. This movie ranks extremely high above the shlock of ninety minute teen pix which open every weekend and make millions and are found to be inane and unfunny. But ""Troy"" is a true epic in the truest sense of the word. Because we now have access to CGI, it is better than ""Ben Hur"", ""Spartacus"", or ""The Ten Commandments"". Don't be misled by early criticism. Go expecting what you want the film to be and you won't be disappointed. I wasn't!"
"Critical Eye UK","1","9","22","5 January 2005"," Beach Babes Rock On!
","Inspired by the work of Troy Donahue, Petersen's movie not only pays eponymous homage to the late American actor but rightly sets itself in the cinematic environment Donahue made his own: the beach.<br/><br/>Although there's an unexpected shortage of actual beach blankets, and the music isn't quite as catchy as the transistor-driven harmonies I remember, everything else is pretty much there: semi-clad bodies, bronzed skin, waves, surf, sunshine and sand. Oh, and even: sandals.<br/><br/>What's especially gratifying is the production quality, echoing as it does the primitive processing of Troy's own movies, where so many beach-side shots were obviously studio back-clothed. Less satisfying is the absence of any celebration of Sandra Dee, but that oversight is more than compensated for by the script's utter absence of interest -- again, a truly authentic touch.<br/><br/>As before, the older generation clashes with the younger, there are fights aplenty between bad dudes and good dudes, and Petersen even takes time out from the one-set staging to actually go into town, albeit his recreation of Malibu isn't quite the way I'd've done it.<br/><br/>But all is redeemed by the performances, every one of which is epically awful and thus in keeping with the standards set in the Donahue movies.<br/><br/>And yes!

Troy is so poorly designed as an 'ancient city', you can't help wondering if humans would have been better off staying in caves - this can't be a 'civilization', it's so plastic. The battle sequences are hilarious. The dialog is repetitious and just plain dumb. Brad Pitt - that's the punchline to a joke - ""Satan took bad acid and cast who for the role of Achilles? - Brad Pitt! Hahahahahahaha!"" This is not simply an over-simplification and it is in no way an 'update'.

"The_Void","8","6","13","21 September 2005"," Surpassed all expectations
","I went into Troy expecting not to like it, due to the fact that I don't like historical epics generally, and Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"" is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. While Troy certainly isn't a masterpiece, and it has it's fair share of flaws; I was surprised to find that this is actually a very good film. Based on Homer's poem, ""The Iliad"", Troy is the multi-layered story of romance, heroics, war, betrayal and the importance of having a legacy. The story is absolutely brilliant, and the way that the various characters interact with each other the situations that they have been forced into is really well done and ensures that the film is always at least interesting. The plot follows the war between Greece and Troy, which is started when a young price by the name of Paris steals Helen, the wife of one of Greece's Kings and takes her back to Troy. The King of Kings doesn't take this sort of thing lying down, and it isn't long before he's gathered up the greatest warrior to ever live; Achilles, and the rest of his expansive army to the shores of Troy in order to gain revenge and take the walled city of Troy for himself.<br/><br/>One thing that did annoy me about this film was the handling. The story is brilliant, but screenplay writer David Benioff, for some reason, has seen fit to make the themes surrounding the story more the forefront. Ideas such as the glory of having your name go down in history, as well as love and war are good; but I would prefer less of the melodramatics, and more focus on the relationships between the characters themselves. Troy benefits from a lovely cast, which includes the likes of Peter O'Toole, Diane Kruger, Julie Christie, Sean Bean and Brian Cox in support to the main players. Brad Pitt takes the lead role as Achilles, and it's amazing how well he's stepped into it. He looks the part, and obviously enjoys playing it. It can be annoying when the camera constantly moves in for a close up, or when he has to deliver some of his more corny dialogue; but his physical presence makes up for this. Eric Bana co-stars, and does what Pitt does expect better. Bana doesn't make many films, which is a shame because I'd like to see more of him. Orlando Bloom is the third-lead, in the role of Paris. This guy is talentless and annoying, but at least he doesn't have to do much; and his weedy role suits him.<br/><br/>Like most blockbusters these days, there is some CGI present; but it's never gratuitous, and for a change; it's been used well, so I don't mind seeing it. The battles are well staged, particularly all the ones involving Brad Pitt. His antics on the battlefield help to create the illusion that the Hollywood megastar is a great Greek warrior, and unlike many battle sequences in many epics; the ones here never get boring. The locations are great and help to cement the action in Troy, which is helped by the way that all the cast have been made up excellently to represent their characters. Overall, this is surprisingly good stuff, which shouldn't be dismissed because of it's summer blockbuster status. I would definitely see this one again."

","*Before I begin I do not know if I'll end up writing a spoiler or not...so beware* I repeat THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>I would like to begin by saying that Eric Bana's performance was absolutely wonderful and I'm not even a fan of his. The script definitely wasn't the greatest, but he made the best of it and when he died i even cried. It was so noble and beautiful.<br/><br/>The movie in itself was not too bad at all....some of the war scenes seemed to look the same, but was good none the less. There are definitely some historical mistakes, but it's a movie. There were parts where all the people would stop fighting and watch two people face off against each other. It just seemed weird to me, you don't see that kind of thing in most war movies no matter what century it's in.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was definitely NoT for this movie, he could of been so easily recast better. He took the Achillies character and somehow made me really dislike his character. For me, I was easily able to hate him and I'm not a Brad Pitt basher....he's just definitely done better movies. This role wasn't for him and the accent he was trying to pull off wasn't well done. I must say that I was disappointed by this performance. Though, I must say that Brad's battle scenes were very well done and you could very easily believe he was the best fighter in the world and he took the text from the Illiad ""fought with God like grace and strength"" and brought that alive to the screen, so for that I must give a thumbs up.<br/><br/>Now Orlando Bloom's character of Prince Paris, I can say right now I''m a big Orlando fan, BUT this was not his best movie that is for sure!!! He was a totally wuss and had no honor. He caused the war with his girlfriend and the war was his and Helen's fault and he played THAT well. Some people....or I should say MANY people have said he SuCkEd in this movie, but those are harsh words. He played what he was supposed to be. A whiny little brat who wants what he wants and the script wasn't much to work with. SO I think all in all Orlando did a job well done, but definitely not one of his best films. It was funny how the wimp kills the best fighter. Some bad parts on Orlando's case is that he seemed to have no facial expression and in the bedroom scene with Helen(Diane Kruger), he tries to do 20 facial expressions in 20 seconds! *laugh*! Hilarious! But, at least you get to see him naked from the hips up. =)<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole's performance deserves an applause in my book and Í'm sure it wasn't easy for him since the word ""gods"" was in about 95% of all his lines, he still pulled it off well even though some have criticized his performance in this movie. He was the King of Troy and was able to be the father figure for the his two sons, be king of Troy and still be so compassionate. He held such a warm presence in this film and I loved it. He loved his sons, people, and country.<br/><br/>The man who played Agamemnon (name has slipped my mind right now) did a fabulous job, even though slightly annoying, was somewhat funny to watch. He was the ""evil or bad guy"" in this movie for sure...or it seems that way and he was a jerk most of the time, but I can't say much more than he played his character extremely well! <br/><br/>The three main women in this movie all did well since they had to hold themselves up to the many many many men characters in this movie. Diane Kruger however could of brought a little more to screen. Her and Paris(Orlando Bloom) were supposed to be lovers that brought war. I didn't really feel the passion and the emotion on screen at all and was disappointed. There was more love and emotion poured into Achillie's(Brad Pitt) and his love interest Briseis and I really didn't like that romance at all. I found it very unnecessary in so many ways. It was just not needed and I think the only reason it was added was to make Brad's character seem like more of a good guy since he killed of HEctor{Eric Bana). Hector and his wife Andromache even had more of a romance and emotion on screen that Helen and Paris and I just all in all found it a real shame. I mean, they DID start the war.<br/><br/>Sean Bean's character Odysess(name might be spelled wrong)was also well played and I loved how he was witty and strong. He just brought some kind of ""lightness to the screen and a little humor"" which I loved! The same can not be said for Achillie's cousin who was just an annoying little brat who wanted to fight and was glad he was finally killed in the movie. I found his even more annoying that some of Paris's(Orlando Bloom) scenes! Uhh! <br/><br/>But, all that said, I really enjoyed the movie, so much I bought the DVD *and I must add that I wish there were some better special features*. Anyway, I rate this movie 8/10 stars!"

","I still can not believe how many people continue to actually praise this movie as one of the best of 2004 and an instant classic. Let me tell you the truth, Troy was a God-awful experience. The film follows many like to call what really happened during the Trojan War. Achilles and Odysseus traveling to Troy to help regain Menelaus' wife Helen. <br/><br/>The first few minutes of the film are enjoyable with Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson prancing around in the company of Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom. Suddenly it takes a nose dive of epic proportions. Hector and Paris are on a boat, then they're in Troy, then suddenly we're confronted with Brad Pitt again. <br/><br/>Eventually they all get to Troy and somehow, Achilles and his 50 men are able to overtake a beach of near 1000 men. Hmmmmmmm. That sounds real accurate. The whole time the battle is going on, Achilles is smacking around play toys that we are suppose to believe are soldiers trying to kill him. <br/><br/>Eventually the story becomes more boring when a love interest enters into Achilles life so some of the women watching the film can be excited . From the first battle at Troy to the Trojan Horse scene, there is about an hour in between where only one thing that anyone cared about happened, the fight between Hector and Achilles.<br/><br/>The battle scenes with the large, CGI armies are well done but the up close up battles with real human characters and the corny music are bad. Achilles and Hector's battle is quite bland, just two guys jumping in circles and occasionally swinging their spears. The beahc battle was hilarious watching Achilles kill about 50 soldiers one at a time. Hmmmmm . Wouldn't soldiers attack maybe three or four at a time?<br/><br/>The main problem with Troy is almost nothing looks believable. The city walls, the Trojan Horse, and the army sizes for that matter are all way to big. The first battle outside the gates of Troy, the amount of soldiers present probably couldn't even fit into the city itself. Along with realistic is how nothing is ever dirty. We are made to believe that four thousand years ago that everything was kept clean and nice looking. I'm pretty sure there wasn't a Martha Stewart present in the Trojan War to do the cleaning.<br/><br/>There is something seriously wrong with Brad Pitt in the film. All he does is talk in a wannabe- tough guy voice that brings more laughs to the audience then fear. I;m not saying Pitt can't act, because he can, he's just seriously miss-cast. <br/><br/>I'm beginning to like Bana more and more every time I watch him. He has a sternness around him that helped to bring out the character of Hector, the only character in the film that really was developed at all. Sean Bean is completely wasted as Odysseus who only appears for short periods of time.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is a decent actor but trying to play a Paris like character had disastrous results. The film is suppose to be about his love for Helen. If love is just having you know what then well I guess they pin-pointed that.<br/><br/>Troy fails tremendously. The acting (minus Bana) is awful, the battles are totally unbelievable, and the adaptation of the poem is wretched. Try to avoid Troy at all costs and I do mean at all costs.<br/><br/>1/5 Stars"

Brad Pitt bulks up and parades around looking hard and sensitive all at the same time. Orlando Bloom looks - well, like Orlando Bloom. Diane Kruger's boring, one-dimensional Helen wouldn't have launched one ship let alone a thousand. The best acting was by the Trojan horse; everyone else would have benefited from a different director and a better script. The viewers in our house found the film benefited from a bottle of wine and some crackers and cheese. All in all, eye candy yes, great cinema -- not by a long shot!"

","Well, I guess I don't have to repeat how shallow the movie is - others have done that here before. But what really made me angry was the way the script manipulated the poem, especially how it erased the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus and transferred Achilles' erotic/romantic interest to Briseis. What made this manipulation stranger was that actually in the movie Patroclus and Achilles behaved as male lovers would behave - yeah, OK, they were shown to be great friends but there isn't much of a difference between love and a very close friendship, is there? And I don't mean this in a homosexistic way (meaning that close friendship between men isn't possible without being sexual). But that's the way it is in the poem. This heterosexistic manipulation really robbed the movie of being a great chance in erasing 'gay' stereotypes or encouraging gay youth. Anyway, if you want to find out how it really was check out the chapter ""Achilles and Patroclus"" of Andrew Calimach's great collection of Greek myths (Andrew Calimach: Lovers' Legends. The Gay Greek Myths. Restored and Retold by Andrew Calimach. New Rochelle: Haiduk Press 2002). The book helped me a lot."

The sets are beautiful, the ships and the real armies too. But that is not enough; the development of the characters is poor, and: Even if the actors would have given 200%, it can't be enough to fill a story that fits into 45 minutes of 'He-Man'.<br/><br/>
First half: The Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) seduces the Spartan queen Helen (Diane Kruger) and the Spartan army uses this as an invitation to conquer Troy. Chief among their leaders is the secret weapon Achilles (Brad Pitt), acting like a cynical and sexy, modern-day 'Mad-Max'. First he can't decide to fight against the Trojans, but after his cousin Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) is killed, he can (after some 80 minutes the movie must go on).<br/><br/>Second half: A really and truly excellent Peter O'Toole gives his best as King Priam of Troy, before, during and after Achilles defeats Priam's son Hector (Eric Bana).<br/><br/>Anything forgotten? ...Troy is conquered and Achilles killed.<br/><br/>

The acting is forced and I'm not sure if the editing team were using the right takes half the time. Brad Pitt should never be allowed to do accents in movies... unless of course we can't understand what he's saying. (Yeh leck DEHGS?) I did think Pitt did a wonderful job in Oceans 11, as well as Fight Club and of course Snatch... and would encourage him to pursue similar roles in the future.

","A sad sad attempt to capitalise on ""action-hero"" potential in Homer's classic. The writer should be tied to somebody's chariot and dragged until he promised never to write a screenplay again. Brad, Orlando, Peter et al did their level best but were fighting a losing battle against a poor script. Brad certainly enlivened the landscape with his skirmishings. Shots of the aristocracy of Troy peeping over the battlements at warring heroes were positively Monty Pythonesque. And why, in an age when audiences are exhibiting a ravenous hunger for fantasy material, did they choose to leave out the gods?

","This film has nothing to do with the original story of Iliad, written by Homer. Actually about the battle of Troy can be made more than 20 different films, each lasting about 8 hours. The whole battle of Troy according to the legend lasted for more than 20 years, which is hard to depict in a single movie, but definitely not impossible. Instead of recreating legendary events, they created some cheap romantic Hollywood soup. Achilles didn't participate in the battle of Troy because he wanted to become famous. He wasn't that stupid. Another detail was that his mother actually tried to hide him in a temple, dressed like a woman. He took part in the battle only because he has sworn to Menelaus to help him in a time of need. That's the reason why all other Greek kings including Odysseus and Diomedes went to fight for Menelaus in first place. Odysseus actually played mad and was very angry when his attempt to avoid the war was revealed. Menelaus of course wasn't killed from Hector (as is shown in the movie), but managed to retrieve his wife and return to Sparta. Ajax wasn't killed in a battle. And Achilles never actually succeeded to enter Troy. He was shot by Paris from the city walls (and not from 5-meter distance as it is shown in the film). The Greeks considered Troy as the most impregnable fortress at that time and so it was. The battle of Troy continued long after Hector was killed. There were other strong defenders of the city, some nearly defeating the besieging army. If you want to know the truth about Troy, read Iliad. That's my advice. This film is utterly weak and doesn't deserve high rating. Kingdom of Heaven is much closer to the true story than is Troy. I hope some day someone does a really good movie about this great ancient city."

I almost fell out of my chair when he said ""you sac of wine"". It was more of a comedy than an epic war film...This movie had all the symptoms of a poorly executed film: bad acting, bad directing, atrocious camera work, under-developed story, no character build-up, the script was probably intolerable...It was sad this was the best they could do after all that money and all the effort...I mean, it had 3 directors for god's sake! oh and I've never seen a movie with so many funeral scenes! And each one of them looked exactly the same! It was almost as if they just inserted these scenes into the script wherever they ran out of ideas...I finally had to press ""stop"" on my remote after the 4th time someone's body was burning on my TV screen, and screamed ""enough is enough""! ""Troy"" is hands-down THE worst movie I've ever wasted time on. I should have stopped watching when ""sac of wine"" came on but I was hoping it'd get better. Of course it never did and at the end I felt completely sodomized. You sac of wine!"
"scarlettpower","10","3","5","20 November 2008"," Troy
","Troy- Troy the movie is a retelling of the Iliad. The main character is Achilles (Brad Pitt), the tormented warrior. He cares of nothing but war in the beginning of the movie, all he wants to do is fight, and have his name go down in history. He hates Agamemnon, the king of Greece, who thinks of nothing but himself. Agamemnon thinks it is a great opportunity to conquer Troy when Helen leaves his brother with Paris (Orlando Bloom) one of the princes of Troy. The movie was exceptional and I highly recommend it to all (except those that are squeamish and/or prudes). <br/><br/>The movie took some serious artistic license because they changed a lot of facts from history. For one the thing the actual Troy was smaller, and Menelaus wasn't killed by Hector to name a few. In some stories Helen went willingly with Paris to Troy (like in the movie) but in others she was abducted. Achilles relationship with Brisies might upset fans of the Iliad. For example Brisies is a priestess of Apollo in the movie, therefore a virgin. In the Iliad she is widowed. I give the accuracies of the movie B plus. I personally loved the story line but I know some people who were upset with how much they changed. <br/><br/>One thing the movie did get right was the costumes, amazing set design, and not to mention the special effects. The men wore what looked to be primitive soldier outfits, including skirts. The woman wore dresses that fits what you expect a women in that time and place to wear (no corsets). Helen wears the typical Helen white dress, and Achilles in his world famous armor. When you first see Troy on the screen it looks like an actual place with big buildings, houses, and lots and lots of extras. The thousand ships that sail to Troy look real not like computer images and then of course there is the army. Not all of those people could have been real, they must have had some digitally animated. I give the effects an A plus, the costumes an A plus, and the set design a B plus, Troy was actually much smaller in reality. The last thing is the acting. With a movie featuring so many well known faces you know that it will be great, and it was. Brad seemed to bring Achilles to life on screen. He portrayed the strong warrior perfectly so that you liked him even when he wasn't being so nice. Paris was very likable, unlike in the Iliad (although I kind of hated him in the end of the movie when he killed Achilles), and Orlando bring a certain something to his character. Briseis, played by Rose Byrne, is one of my favorite characters. She's self riotous, strong, independent, and kind all at the same time. She's so wrong for Achilles, she's perfect for him. The chemistry between the two is amazing and you see sparks from the very beginning. Eric Bana plays Hector. Hector is smart and likable. Unlike Achilles he doesn't kill because he wants to but because he has to. He is the one that shows his wife the secret passage way out of Troy which saves many Trojans. Helen is played by Diane Kruger. While she does not have many scenes she is obviously important. After all if she hadn't left their would be no war, something she feels very guilty about. I did not find her acting very good to be honest. She just wasn't right for the role. I give the acting an A plus, excusing the miss casting of Helen. <br/><br/>Overall I really liked the movies. Historians will want to see it for the facts, movie goers will want to see it for the great plot line, and romantics will want to see it for the love scene which are manly between Briseis and Achilles, and Helen and Paris. The whole entire move deserves an A plus but I have to make it an A minus because of some messing with historical facts, and the horrible casting of Helen. I highly recommend the movie."
"drystyx","10","3","5","8 March 2008"," this is good and fresh, a true remake
","In fact, while I initially rate it an 8 overall, I may raise the rating. i rarely rate a movie with a 10 immediately. It has to sink in.<br/><br/>That said, this story is the Iliad, with little amendments here and there, and yet, it is still the most faithful to Homer's original. Yet, the clever rewrite makes it superior.<br/><br/>The Iliad was originally about the disagreement between Agammemon and Achilles. The former is portrayed true to form. He is supposed to be a cruel, stubborn character. So is Achilles. This movie is actually the truest to the book, of all the movies.<br/><br/>The clever rewriting gives a good look at the war, and gives a credible account, even more credible than the poem of old. And who really knows what the original story was, since it was changed so many times before being put to print. And various generations would fit in their own versions to suit the rulers of the time. After all, it was to rulers that bards sang.<br/><br/>For those who don't know, Troy is ruled by Priam, whose oldest son, Hector, is a valiant fighter, and his younger son, Paris, a lady's man. Paris absconds with the wife of Meneleus, Helen of Troy, which sends the Greeks to Ilium (Troy), which most people assume to be Turkey.<br/><br/>Now this is a romanticized reason. And the real reasons for war were supposed to be for monetary trade reasons (probably spices). At any rate, other more realistic reasons are given in the movie.<br/><br/>But the movie is more than just the war. It explores the characters much better than Homer ever did. We think of Homer as a great poet, but in truth, he (or they, since Homer is considered to be more than one poet) is overrated. The characters are quite identifiable, and they draw us into this world of war.<br/><br/>The acting and directing is stellar. Pitt actually reminds a viewer of Crowe, and he gives a subtle, but unmistakeably great acting job. In fact, this is made possible because the entire cast is superb. And in such a case, one must credit the director and editors, too. An all around top job by the entire crew.<br/><br/>The movie is long, but not boring. It quickly flows from action to action, from consequence to consequence.<br/><br/>I didn't think I would like this movie. This was an excellent movie. It is a true remake, because it adds elements of its own to make a story we can accept, believe, and watch.<br/><br/>Big thumbs up."

","I had doubts about this movie, but I loved it. The reasons are: -This movie follows the Iliad pretty closely. If you disagree, read the Iliad by Homer again. But opposite to the fairy tale of Homer, the world in the movie looks realistic. Which is also good, I think.<br/><br/>-The movie does not try to exaggerate the scene elements (the city, weapons, Trojan Horse, other things). For example, in traditional Hollywood movie, the warriors from Trojan horse would just kill everybody in the city at night, but in this movie they only do what they could do - open the gates.<br/><br/>-The behavior of the Iliad characters is natural. The Odysseys looks and acts like Odysseus. Hector, Priam, all others follow their historical characters. You may disagree, but that's my opinion.<br/><br/>-The landscape is beautiful, sunny and shiny. Opposite to 300.<br/><br/>-Brad Pitt is very convincing as Achilles. He acts great, he looks great and fights great. Apparently, he is the main character of the movie.<br/><br/>Sure, some Hollywood-ish things do present in the plot (like love story of Achilles), but I personally have no complains about it.<br/><br/>I would suggest to watch the movie in HD, it looks really spectacular. I really enjoyed it!"

","Like the Trogan horse itself, this movie sort of sneaks into your psyche and helps you suspend your belief and enjoy. Oh, I feel for the outraged scholars out there who want a literal performance of the Iliad. But this is the 21st century and folks neither understand nor will tolerate the rather boring and incomprehensible devotion the ancients felt toward their deities. The film makers made the right choice and concentrated on human (sort of) characters, and human themes: love, war, grief, honor, cowardice, greed, etc.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning. For those who say good CGI is now routine, please look at the messes of the new King Kong, and the totally idiotic remake of Godzilla. These battle scenes may be inaccurate in costume or tactic, but they are visually well done.<br/><br/>And then there is the acting. Well, Brad Pitt does a wonderful job playing THIS Achilles. The camera loves him and he has clearly worked very hard on conditioning and his movements. I thought him terrific, and I am not a big fan. The camera also loves Eric Bana; who dominates almost every scene he is in. Orlando Bloom is despicable as Paris, the seeming cause of all the trouble (although there are political shadings far beyond his silly abduction). Bloom is despicable in every role he is in, so the film makers cast well here. Kruger is quite the astonishing looking Helen, one does not notice if she acts. Peter O'Toole is the consummate professional as always, here in the role of the sympathetic yet ultimately foolish Priam. No one really does poorly in this picture.<br/><br/>So, folks, get a grip!

Paris saw himself as somewhat of a so-called ""player"" who saw opportunity with Helen as his new love. Helen was unhappy with her marriage to Spartan king, Menelaus. They should have seen this coming. Menelaus becomes enraged and goes to his powerful brother, Agamemnon. Agamemnon calls all armies together to conquer Troy and get Helen back. With that, he summons Achilles, the world's greatest warrior known to man. Achilles does not like to serve under anyone but himself. Standing in the way is the Trojan King Priam.

First off the cinematography is just amazing along with the art direction (the Trojan horse thakes care of that.) Second off the acting was just phenomenal! I had no idea that Eric Bana could actually be such a good actor (The only thing I had seen him in first was the Hulk so you can see why). And Brad Pitt was just outstanding.

"jsnauwaert","10","3","5","4 August 2004"," Excellent movie
","It's undoubtedly true that Troy is a movie with in the first place a huge budget (I heard something like 180 million dollars) and that it owes a lot to the tradition of big spectacle C. C. DeMille. Nevertheless, I think it is an excellent movie, with an intrinsic depth that is comparable to ""Gladiator"". I don't care if the story follows Homeros' illiad faithfully or not. Without doubt, Homeros ""invented"" a lot of things in his Troy story too (it even can't be proven that there is some historical truth to it; except for the fact that Troy has really existed as an ancient city), so it's surely good enough that the movie is only inspired on the Illiad. The scenes are impressive, the costumes are adequate, the overall acting performances are very good to excellent. Only Diana Kruger as Helen really disappointed me: she plays without any inner conviction, her performance was terribly insipid. Achilles and Hector convinced me both as true heroes; both heroes of the sword for sure, but with totally different personalities. Some battle scenes, especially the ""main"" one between Achilles and Hector, are breath taking and all the more impressive in that they are ""real"" (well, almost completely real that is). There is a lot to be discovered beyond the surface of this movie (was also the case with ""Gladiator""). Despite what some critics said (where are the good movie critics nowadays?), the performance of Brad Pitt as Achilles was not one dimensional at all. Achilles surely appears as an egotist (which he also is in Homeros' Illiad itself), but at the same time as a fairly complex person, with a couple of very good brains. Moreover, his personality evolves during the movie, with two encounters as driving force behind his evolution: the one with Briseïs (another good acting performance of Troy, realized by Rose Byrne) and the one with Priam (an excellent Peter O'Toole). I surely also loved the character of Hector, but didn't we all? As to Paris, well, he surely acted foolishly and irresponsible, but at the same time, his love for Helen seems to have been genuine (although this aspect isn't rendered convincingly in the movie, also due to the weak performance by Diane Kruger). There is a lot more to be said about this movie, but for now, I conclude with the statement I started with: this is an excellent movie, the best I saw this year until now."

It appears once more that in the altar of entertainment (shock and awe rings a bell?) nearly all vital characteristics that made this legend unique throughout centuries where sacrificed. For example...Achilles was already dead when greeks invaded troy (but when Brad Pitt is the main actor you can't kill him whenever Hommer-author of Iliad- wanted him dead. Or what can we say about the Total Absence of Gods?? Achilles was semi-god himself and Gods such as Athens or Zeus played a vital role more than once. But with the elimination of gods all this war (that lasted 10 years not 10 days) becomes naive and meaningless. And last but not least Troy was established at the shores of Minor Asia in what is Now Turkey.

This was his best acting so far.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt as Achilles was perfect,unmerciful,strong, and courteous(except of course to the ""sack of wine"")in his commanding role. <br/><br/>Orlando Bloom as Paris was quite pitiful but he played it well even if he was a coward.He seemed to really love Helen. <br/><br/>Diane Kruger as Helen lit up the screen. She really seemed to care about how her decision to leave with Paris would take and change many lives. She was very emotional. <br/><br/>All in all this movie was strong in acting, guys, and blood but don't let that stop you . The special effects were great and the acting was even better. I definitely recommend this movie!"

","As a college student of the arts, I critique movies as a pastime. I heard mixed reviews about this movie and was somewhat hesitant to see it even though the previews looked really good. I went with my friends and was awed by the war scenes, stopped breathing at the beautiful fighting form (Mainly between Hector and Achillies), and drooled at the eye candy. (Why can't camera men learn to drop the camera a little lower!!) Granted, it did make the Trojan War seem like at lasted about 2 weeks, and some parts of it were different than the original story, but on the whole, I enjoyed it. I think that Brad Pitt did a fantastic job, and this is the only movie where you will hear me say that. Eric Bana was a terrific Hector, and it seems that Orlando Bloom remembers how to use a bow. His portrayal of Paris was convincible. I would recommend it to any friend."

","Wolfgang Peterson really shortened this epic, yet missed on on what I believed to be very important moments in the poem/novel. He did not include Diomedes, son of Tydeus, which is IMHO the best characters of the story. Peterson missed many epic battles, like when Ajax fights Hector, or the amount of archers is the novel. But Peterson did do some good things, such as not including the Funeral Games for Patroclus which would have been awkward and very boring to most audiences, and the long chase between Achilles and Hector. The only thing that I think improved the movie was the acting and the conflicting characters. Rose Byrne acted very well, stealing the show from Diane Kruger who played Helen. I thought it was quite humorous as well, such as the facial expressions on Brad Pitt when Peter O Toole gets a little to close to him. Overall, it was a good epic, but will soon be overshadowed by the others that are to come (maybe Alexander the Great)."

I almost did not notice the time goes by, The action scenes were very well directed, the fight scenes were Amazing. This movie is about the known story of Helen of troy, but it chooses to depict what really happens to the characters in a war, The senseless violence and unhappiness is very well portrayed. There are three relationships that are the real subject of the film and each one deals with different aspect of war. The dialogue was Fantastic, especially the lines of rose Byrne she stole the movie. If you are looking for Huge battle scenes and action sequences its for you.

","3200 years ago, the powerful king Agamemnon (Brian Cox) dominates all the Greek kingdoms except Troy. While visiting Sparta, the Prince of Troy Paris (Orlando Bloom) and the wife of the king of Sparta Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), Helen (Diane Kruger), fall in love with each other, and Paris convinces her to leave her husband. This pretext was exactly what Agamemnon need to invade Troy, but he is not supported by the great warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt). An incident between Achilles' cousin and the Prince of Troy Hector (Eric Bana) makes Achilles fight side by side with Agamemnon's army. Yesterday I saw 'Troy', an adaptation of Homer's Iliad, expecting to watch a great epic movie. I found only a slightly above average movie with a huge budget. There are many parts that do not work in this film. The first one are the very silly and imbecile dialogs. I do not know how many time I heard words like 'never forget' and 'honor' along 163 minutes. The next weak point is the selection of the cast: Brad Pitt keeps the same doll face in dramatic, funny, painful or what ever situation. It is amazing how this guy is not able to act, just expose his silicone face to the feminine audiences. The histrionic Brian Cox is another bad choice, horrible in the role of Agamemnon. Even Peter O' Toole has an affected performance, looking like a gay instead of a powerful king. Last but not the least, with the advent of the use of computer for battle scenes, the exaggeration rules most of the present high budget films. I need to see 'Ben-Hur' again to recall how an excellent epic movie must be. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): 'Tróia' ('Troy')"
"WanaxOdysseus","1","4","8","6 July 2012"," American failure
","This film fails on just about every level imaginable. It's supposedly ""inspired by"" the Iliad (and the Aeneiad) but the end result has absolutely nothing to do with Greek myth. Indeed, it's easier to make a list of the plot points that follow the Iliad myth, because it's going to be much shorter than the list of points when the movie deviates from it for no reason.<br/><br/>For those who claim that it is a realist take on the story, no - it's not, because not only does it have nothing to do with Greek myth, it also has nothing to do with Greek culture or Greek history. What we actually get is a bunch of Americans prancing about it what is supposed to pass as ancient Greek clothes, but would only fool Americans with no insight into Ancient civilizations. There is no sense of the Greek culture worked, and thus character actions that are supposed to understood in the light of that culture lack substantially in the emotional impact they should have. Achilles' treatment of Hector's body is a case in point. Likewise the complete lack of displaying Greek warrior culture - there is just the one token challenge to setup Achilles as a kick-ass fighter, and no phalanxes, the warriors just rush each other in big, disorganized rabbles, Hollywood style.<br/><br/>The social context is mutilated, too. Agamemnon, for instance, is reduced to a simple, powerhungry king who supposedly has conquered all of Greece? Really? Ever heard of the era of city states? Only those who have no knowledge of Greek myth, history or culture might be able to enjoy this, and then only because it keeps spoonfeeding them with American storytelling tropes. Shame on Hollywood for treating one of the most culturally significant myths in the history of storytelling in this trite fashion."

","Trojan prince Paris is not only having an affair with Spartan Menelaus' woman, Helen. He also lures her away to live with him in Troy. Thus giving the global domination obsessed King Agamenon the launch pad to war with Troy. Which in turn brings into conflict Spartan hero Achilles and Hector of Troy, two of the greatest warriors that ever lived.<br/><br/>Troy, budgeted at $175 million, and given to director Wolfgang Petersen with orders to craft a swordplay epic based on Homer's Illiad, is not the truly great picture it really should have been. It is, however, a spectacle of sorts, that by way of the extended directors cut, becomes a fine enough addition to the genre it so clearly wanted to crown.<br/><br/>The problems are evident from the off. The casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles always looked to have been based purely on looks. Nicely toned body and brooding close ups do not a warrior make, and thus, as good an actor as Pitt definitely is, this is a role (and genre) too far. Diane Kruger as Helen is under written, which since at the time was a poor actress yet to bloom turns out to be a bonus here, and Orlando Bloom playing the wimp like Lothario Paris the way he should do - still gets out acted and swamped by all around him. The other main problem is how uneven the story telling is. Petersen looks confused as how to condense the Trojan war in the running time, whilst also juggling the emphasis of the two great warriors at its core. That Eric Bana's excellent portrayal of Hector comes through the jumble is a testament to Bana's ability and nothing else.<br/><br/>The good is, well, rather good though. Agamemnon, courtesy of a nasty turn from Brian Cox, is well formed. It gives the picture a reason for being outside of it being a war about some bloke stealing a woman from another bloke. Imperial cravings and a genuine thirst for blood helps lift Troy out of the rocky waters it had found itself in. Peter O'Toole, Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean do fine work with what little they have got, and the production values on offer are hugely impressive. The fight sequences impact and are full of gusto. The fight off between Hector and Achilles is superbly choreographed (fought out to a score that James Horner has lifted from the one Danny Elfman used for Planet Of The Apes three years earlier) and the battle between the armies outside the walls of troy sits with the best in the genre. CGI is often called the bane of cinema, but when used so well as it is here (see the ships approaching Troy for instance) it proves to be an effective and entertaining tool.<br/><br/>Troy has problems, of that there is no doubt. But come the end one knows that it has been entertained, one knows that this was a time of heroes. So with that, and the knowledge that the film made a profit of just over £320 million worldwide, Petersen can smugly sit in his chair musing it was job done. 7/10"

","What could I possibly say about this movie that hasn't been said already by the millions of others who also loved the film. This movie was absolutely mind blowing from the acting all the way down to James Horner's fantastic musical score. I can honestly say I probably never wouldve even seen the movie if I hadnt read about the legend of the Trojan War, I found it fascinating. I even managed to read the Iliad and I will admit that even though the film does not stay true to the iliad it is still an awesome movie. It really makes me mad when Homer fanatics bash the movie simply because it wasn't made the way Homer depicted in his story, but if you pay attention closely the movie says ""inspired"" by Homer's the Iliad meaning the story motivated its director to do a film about Troy it doesn't say ""based"" on Homer's the Iliad, then it wouldve been considered inaccurate. So its unfair to say that Wolfgang did a terrible job with this movie simply because it was ""inaccurate"" The character I felt attached to the most was Achilles, not because it was Brad Pitt but because I kinda felt sorry for the guy. I will admit he is an arrogant self-centered a**hole but throughout the movie you begin to see another side of him. One of his lines that stuck with me was when Briseis asked Achilles why he chose the life of a great warrior and he simply replies I chose nothing I was born and this is what I am. A guy that spends his entire life fighting and doesn't really know what it truly means to live.Even after he killed Hector, as angry as I was, I could not help but pity him. I think Achilles was searching for something far more than just glory in battle and by the end of the film I think he found it. I think Achilles had the most character growth in the entire film"

More so, the most memorable anecdote I personally took from the film was the careful and balanced point of view Peterson took when showing both sides of the story.

","The movie follows Homer's Illiad and then Hollywood puts in its own ending. I heard that they had to re-teach the kids in Greece their own literature over and over in order to correct errors depicted in the motion picture. Agammemnon does come to a tragic end but not how it was depicted in the motion picture. His story continues in Electra and that's a real tragic story of revenge. On the other hand however, I thought it was very well done. The movie makers did a great job. The cinematography was terrific, the acting was okay but I did not feel anything for the characters. I couldn't find them believable. We should have been crying and carrying on during the last love scene between Achilles and Mysenaeus but it didn't do much to heighten any emotions.

And the dialogue quite effectively walks the line between the heroic and comments that normal people would probably make in similar circumstances. The actors are all very good, especially Brian Cox.

"Captainzoupy","8","4","8","14 July 2006"," Only one word.....Awesome!!!
","The film Troy is an action epic that shows the epic Trojan war in a new light. Troy contains many very well done battle scenes that unlike most done today has an old school feel to them. There was only one thing that did bother me about the film and that was the disorder of the Greek army. In the move the Greek soldiers are portrayed as the type that would only fight for themselves which as history shows is a large inaccuracy. As far as the one on one fighting goes between Brad Pitt and Eric Bana i haven't seen a better performance since Gladiator. Brad Pitt and Eric Bana's performance almost won them the MTV's best fight scene. All in all even though it did have some historical inaccuracies if you are looking to be entertained and want to watch Achilles beat the crap out of Hector this is for you."
"mehta-nishank","9","4","8","5 June 2006"," A true classic.
","I won't be exaggerating if I say that Troy is one of the best films made is the past 10 years. The film is destined to go down in history of Hollywood as a classic and I don;t see any reason why it shouldn't do so.<br/><br/>Firstly, for all 'Gladiator' admirers, Troy holds even more. While Gladiator was a one-man story, Troy is an inter-woven story of the lives of several heroes - Achilles (the main, Brad Pitt), Hector (next, Eric Bana), Paris (Orlando Bloom), Agamemmon, Priam and many more. The script, story and screenplay are near flawless and the film has the makings of a true epic. The battle scenes have been picturised at a grand scale and give the feel of an ancient war. What appeals even more is the skillful cinematography of the Greek landscape which provides a suitable canvas for the action to happen. The makers are indeed to be commended.<br/><br/>ACTING: Troy is quite superior as far as acting is concerned. Brad Pitt essays the role of Achilles to perfection and except for the fact that he looks way too sexy for a Greek warrior, Pitt's acting is great. Women will surely love him in the film. Eric Bana puts in an even more commendable performance. As Hector, he does justice to the role and indeed captures the viewer's imagination. Bloom, as Paris, is ordinary, nothing much to write home about. The only mismatch is perhaps Diane Kruger (Helen). I fail to understand why two great kingdoms will wage a war for a woman whose looks are mediocre to the least degree (atleast in the film). The makers should have taken care to sign up someone really breath-taking in beauty (like Penelope Cruz - I would have loved her as Helen) to essay the role of Helen. Lastly, Sean Bean and Brian Cox deserve special mention for their impressive acting and near-perfect dialogue delivery. Some dialogues of the film are great enough to go down in the Hollywood Hall of Fame. <br/><br/>Go and watch it at the first possible instant."
"gvnanil","8","4","8","27 April 2006"," Good One
","If you have read Homer's Illiad, then you probably may not be totally convinced by the plot of the movie Troy. It was not even near to any convincing adaptation of the novel. One big deviation in the plot includes warriors like Ajax, Menalaus getting killed by Hector which drastically differs from the original story in which they survive the whole war.<br/><br/>But as a movie, if considered, I would say this is definitely one of those very good movies that stands out as nice epic entertainer. Particularly, fights were pretty well choreographed, especially the one between Hector & Achilles. I would say that is one of the best one on one fights ever choreographed. Casting was done very well with Achilles & Hector, the easy picks.<br/><br/>One big flaw in the movie was music. From the beginning till end, you will hear a female voice crying amidst some scenes which I would say is horribly annoying. Had the music been like in Gladiator or LOTR, I am sure, Troy would have been much much better as a movie and surely would have been liked by many more people. If you can bear with that, I am sure you will be very well entertained by this movie."

","One of those that I missed at the cinema, but caught at home. The big screen probably would have helped, but in all honesty I struggled to really fault it. I'm sure that students of Greek mythology would have had a field day picking holes in it, but it held my interest all the way through. Thought that the acting was OK but as I never really knew all aspects of the story then I was more into picking up the plot than being over focused on individual performances. Thinking back now, Paris was certainly ""pretty"" enough & Hector was certainly heroic...maybe Brad Pitt as Achilles was a bit of opportunistic casting, but I thought he was believable enough. The action scenes were good, and the violence was just about right without being gratuitous. I grew up loving big ""sword & sandals"" films, and now technology has jumped ahead in many aspects I'll look forward to introducing my boys to it when they're a little older.<br/><br/>Haven't seen Alexander yet - how do they compare?"

We actually did the Odyssey, probably because the staff thought the story of this brutal genocide was too much for us 14 year olds. I find myself saying ""but Homer was Greek so how come he didn't make them morally superior to the Trojans?"" I have to admit, I'm no Classical scholar, but it has lead me to research the times further. Why did not the Greeks have a hero similar to Hektor, who fought for his country bravely yet, he knew, futilely. Okay, this is not really a spoiler right? I mean everybody knows who ""won"". What comes to mind as a modern parallel is Dee Brown's ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"". The compassionate telling of the vanquished's tale is a rare skill. Also, there's no money in it, and it gets you ostracized politically. Funny thing, you see, I'm in the NRA, and I once asked the people at the Civilian Marksmanship Program to create a ""Crazy Horse Medal"". Right now, one of their top medals is named after, you guessed it, Custer. They never responded, but a few weeks later I get a letter from Ollie North. Coincidence? Maybe. OK, enough rambling.

Nobody claimed after all this to be Iliad. And you know what, if you stop playing ""spot the inaccuracy"", this movie is actually enjoyable! It felt great to have all these war time heroes of my childhood on the silver screen! Spare the cheesy dialogues and love stories (both Hollywood compulsory), the characters were pretty accurate in their behaviours. This was what I had in mind for most of them. What I didn't like was the active effort to capitalise on the Lord Of the Rings success (by means of same graphics, same battle sounds, same battle choreography, even same actors).

Diane Kruger doesn't really have much to work with to give Helen some character. A dull character in this film, Kruger does her best.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom's performance is good.

","This film is underrated. It deserves at least 7.5 but unfortunately that is not up to me. There are both good things and bad things in this film. Some of the good things are Brad Pitt and Eric Bana who are by far the best actors in the film whereas Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger produce the worst acting I've seen in a film in 2004. When I first saw the film I thought that Eric Bana was the best actor in the film. However, when I saw it the second time I thought Brad Pitt was the best actor and the third time I thought they were about equally good. I think the reason I like Eric Bana is more because of his character than because of the actual acting. Eric Bana is a very decent actor but he is not brilliant. Brad Pitt on the other hand is a brilliant actor but his part wasn't as well written as it could have been. Orlando Bloom, however, is probably the worst actor to come out of Hollywood the last century. He exaggerates every emotion and the way he delivers his lines make him seem ignorant rather than sweet. Also the chemistry between him and Diane Kruger is dreadful. There is more romantic spark between Hector and Achilles than Paris and Helen. Brian Cox is also a very fine addition to the cast as well as Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean. The effects in the film are good but they are not masterful like Lord of the Rings. All in all a good all round experience though not nearly as good as other in the genre."
"didi-5","5","4","8","26 June 2004"," could have been a lot worse
","'Troy', directed by Wolfgang Petersen, best known for 'Das Boot', suffers a bit from the casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles and having him show off his buffed and toned body frequently. But it isn't chronic miscasting - not my idea of the famed Spartan warrior, but surprisingly convincing at key points in the story.<br/><br/>The story of 'Troy', of course, really starts when Paris, a Trojan prince (a disappointing Orlando Bloom), steals away with Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger, whose chief acting talent lies in lowering her kohled eyes and looking sad), and in doing so, raises the hackles of her husband, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) and his brother Agamemnon, a power hungry king (played very well by Brian Cox). And so the thousand ships are launched and all the kingdoms of Greece go to war against Troy, a city ruled by the god-fearing King Priam (Peter O'Toole), father of both Paris and the great warrior Hector (Eric Bana).<br/><br/>In a nutshell, that's it. Those of you who know the Iliad will find few surprises here, although the final act contains a few liberties with history. There are many well-known faces amongst the ageing lords and warriors of Greece and Troy (Julian Glover, Trevor Eve, Nigel Terry, John Shrapnel, and Sean Bean) so there's some fun to be had from spotting who plays who. Julie Christie also has a brief appearance as Achilles' mother, Thetis, and despite having aged considerably has retained her mysterious beauty from her peak in the 1960s. To my mind, though, the best person in the cast is O'Toole, in a tour-de-force performance as the doomed king - probably a role he could do in his sleep, but nevertheless engaging.<br/><br/>As for Pitt, there's a touch too much posing in his performance as Achilles, but it could have been a lot worse. It is also significant that even with the removal of direct intervention from the Gods, they still figure heavily within the fears and beliefs of the men at war. 'Troy' is ultimately an action flick with dialogue to pad it out, but it could have been much, much worse."

Now it's as if the public is being kept ignorant about his background. It would have given the story some extra depth and make everything more historically correct! Major elements are being left out as the Gods had an immensely big part in the life of the Romans.<br/><br/>2. Awful soundtrack. Nothing more to add here. They just didn't make their homework.<br/><br/>I rate this movie a mere 5/10 and I'm being generous."

","This film was not bad, but could have been much better. 1. It needed a stronger lead actor, Brad Pitt is pretty, but his performance fell way short! An audience will forgive almost anything if the lead is a strong actor. Bravo to Peter O'Toole! A supporting actor nomination for sure! 2. I feel the film didn't build up Helen's character enough. After all, she was the supposed reason for everything in the first place. They touch on it in the beginning but it would have been interesting to see how she got involved in the first place. 3. Costumes were sometimes terrible, not very convincing, I hated those blue lounging robes! They looked like something for Return of the Jedi! 4. Some of the dialog was weak, too modern for an ancient setting. 5. The second half of the movie was better than the first half. I finally started feeling some emotion. I give this film 2 stars."
"nickbassett1981","7","4","8","5 June 2004"," Disappointing
","This film is not actually poor. However, with the huge publicity surrounding it, i really wanted it to be better than it was. <br/><br/>The cinematography was awesome, the score was subtle, the story itself is compelling but the problem was that it lost something in its delivery. In actual fact, it got a little bit boring about an hour and a half in to the film which is neve good when you are only half way through!! There were moments of excellence, for example the results of Achille's cousin's battle, the revealing of the Trojan Horse (breathtakingly accurate) and the battle scenes..well though they seemed to be all very similar, they were stunningly choreographed. <br/><br/>Petter O'Toole proved that he is one of the greatest actors around as the King of Troy and Eric Bana was a revelation in his post-Hulk role as his son, Prince Hector. Saffron Burrows, usually not the best actress of her generation, pulled off a smaller role with adeptness and Brad Pitt was of course..well..Brad Pitt (average acting-wise yet physically commanding when on screen). <br/><br/>BUt then you get to Orlando Bloom and Diane Krueger...Neither of the pair is a bad actor but the chemistry between them is so lacking that it almost had me shouting at the screen. I also found it hard to come to grips with the relationship between Hector and PAris's cousin and Achilles, her captor. I know that in such circumstances, hostages can become attracted to their keeper, yet the fact that he was an arch enemy who was killing her family and friends off with one blow of his mighty sword just seemed a little off the mark..However, i suppose this is all based on teh story that has existed for years so it cannot be changed. And if i caught a glimpse of Pitt's body sweaty and naked, i would hardly turn him away - women will get a glimpse through the eyes of Jennifer ANiston!<br/><br/>SO, yes - a remarkable story. Nicely executed with some bravura performances but on the negative side a little bit slow and poor casting of two of the pivotal central roles leads to a disappointment if you were expecting 100% excellence throughout."
"The_Orenda","7","4","8","1 June 2004"," Two Thumbs Up
","In my eyes, the action in Troy works. The one-on-one fights in the movie are well-filmed and nicely choreographed. The casting is perfect. Troy rocks and, if not for some lengthy moments, could have found its own place among other epics, such as Spartacus or Braveheart.<br/><br/>Prince of Troy runs off with Greek ruler's wife. This is just the sort of excuse Greece needs to send its entire army, with brooding champion hero Achilles in tow, to wipe out the Trojans.<br/><br/>The best moment in Troy is when the King, played by Peter O' Toole pleads to Achilles to return his son. Our screenwriter has made the heroes as human as possible, and lets the audience decide whom to pass judgment on. Aside from the unnecessary armies expected in a movie such as the Rings' Return of the King, Troy is a very deep movie, that creates its own myth, or tragedy, if you will."

"Mrs_Greenleaf","Null","4","8","27 May 2004"," A visual Spectacular - Thats all I wanted
","I loved this movie so much! because all i wanted was action-packed visual spectacle not because I wanted and intelligent plot or thought provoking dialogue, Hell no!. I went to see my favorite actors all in one place, Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean all together,fighting each other, Great! and Eric Bana is fast becoming a fav of mine, very good looking and his acting really stood out and made the film a little more 'real' for me. I wasn't interested in getting a history lesson either, i gave that up after GCSE because i didn't enjoy it, who wants to learn when Brad Pitt is right there in front of you 12ft high?! And butt naked I might add. :P<br/><br/>I go to the movies to be entertained and Troy certainly did that. The fighting scenes were amazing especially the one-on-one between Achillies and Hector (I was routing for both unfortunately, so there were tears welling in my eyes) The costumes were beautiful and so were the actors involved (mostly). <br/><br/>After leaving the cinema, my brother, who is a classics student told me the whole story (as written by Homer) from beginning to end and yes there were differences, major differences but i still did learn a little something about classics that i had never known before. If you want to get the untouched version of the Illiad READ it don't go to the cinema expecting to get the visual version what you make up in your head is far more vivid anyway. I think that teenagers my age will leave this film and want to read the actual thing afterwards, i know i do and GOOD it gave them a kick up the butt to get a little culture.<br/><br/>People going to see Troy for a intellectual experience will be very disappointed but if you love Brad Pitt and want to see him running around in a skirt this is for you!"
"HeartbreakerAnt","Null","4","8","26 May 2004"," Amazing film, despite early criticism..
","Troy can be summed up in one word...GREAT! Everything about it was great. >From the scenery, to the actors/actresses, to the battles and the drama...it has it all.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, who I admit I am a fan of, really steps it up in this role, playing the rugged part of the legendary warrior, Achilles. Brad does a great job of portraying this warrior, who has but 2 loves: battle and women. Brad's chizzled bod will give the ladies all they need to sit through the almost 3 hour movie. I have to admit the one on one battle between Hector and Achilles is probably the films most climatic moment, followed by, in my opinion, one of the greatest facial stares ever. Its one of those looks that that screams ""You just messed with the wrong guy!!"" I love it!<br/><br/>Also in this film is Eric Bana, who does a great job of playing Hector, the hero, and heir to the throne of Troy. He delivers a strong and leading performance. On the otherhand, Hector's brother, Paris, is a weakling and not worthy of the gorgeous Helen. Paris, played by Orlando Bloom, is a coward always hiding behind his valiant brother. Although, I must give him credit for the ripped abs. Definitely will win favor with the ladies. Helen of Troy is played by a little known actress by the name of Diane Kruger. I will venture to say, she will only be little known for a while....guys, this is your treat in this movie. She is strikingly beautiful and well worth tolerating the countless male bod shots to get to her. My only complaint is it did not show enough of her.<br/><br/>I was very surprised, after seeing this film, of the early reviews. Everyone seemed to be slamming the movie. This movie is great. The battle scenes are enormous, as well as the characters that play in them. From the time I sat down in this one, until the time I left, I was thoroughly entertained. What's not to like?? You've got it all, great men, gorgeous women, sword fights, wars, and the struggle for a great nation. It's a timeless tale that still lives on. I give it a 9/10."
"Fraser-8","6","4","8","25 May 2004"," So average it hurts
","This film is so average it makes me want to dislike it more than is strictly fair. <br/><br/>The actors were almost universally below par, even the likes of Peter O'Toole which is a great shame. For the duration of the film I was hoping that someone would give the ever-infuriating Orlando Bloom the kicking that he so clearly deserved (how on earth has he convinced Hollywood that he can act!?!?!?), Brad Pitt was given some fairly shocking dialogue to deliver and ended up competing with Brian Cox for the most overly-grand performance award. Only Eric Bana and Sean Bean did themselves justice, though surely the woeful script writing team should take most of the blame.<br/><br/>The character development was minimal and with such a rich original to work from this is unforgivable. In the first half of the film we are reminded about half a dozen times in the most unsubtle manner that Achilles is in it for the glory. That is his motivation taken care of. Then we learn that Agammemnon is something of a megalomaniac. That takes care of his character.<br/><br/>Hector is the all round good guy fighting someone else's war (cut to cute shots of him with his wife and kid). Paris and Helen spend a good five minutes wrestling with the guilt and then figure what the hell, we are young and pretty and can't possibly get our come-uppance in this piece of Hollywood schamltz.<br/><br/>Finally there is the dialogue, the biggest weakness of this film. Almost every speech is delivered as if it was the climax of the greatest epic ever made. Imagine every conversation conducted as if it was Russell Crowe in Gladiator revealing himself to the upstart emperor (Pheonix). It is beyond over the top and grates from start to finish.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are impressive, especially the showdown between Hector and Achilles, but it is not as if the result is ever in the balance. As for the scale, I only appreciated when watching Troy just how high Lord of the Rings had raised the bar. A valiant effort was found wanting in almost every department as it could just not match the tension, the balance between the individual characters and the overall sweep nor the detail of the Rings films.<br/><br/>Perhaps a lesson reveals itself in all this: Tolkien and Homer essentially wrote similar stories involving strong and memorable characters, long time-scales, detailed mythologies and themes of sacrifice and greed etc etc.<br/><br/>The LOTR scriptwriters tried to stay a lot more faithful to the strengths of their source while one gets the feeling that with Troy the makers just wanted a summer blockbuster and Homer provided a must on which to hang their budget. What a pity, they have squandered a magnificent opportunity.<br/><br/>Still, Helen looked nice...<br/><br/>PS A different reviewer seemed to think that a better option would be to see Van Helsing. I could not disagree more, for all its faults Troy is a whole universe better than Van Helsing, which is among the worst pieces of cinema I have ever had the displeasure to endure."
"aquazini","Null","4","8","25 May 2004"," Great entertainment
","As an ancient history student I was quite excited about finally seeing the greatest story in antiquity finally coming to life. But having read the Iliad I knew that there was no way that Hollywood would make this movie based on the book verbatim, given some of the difficulties and intricacies in plot and the sheer detail involved. Yet I feel that the filmmakers have done the best possible job that could be done in bringing this tale to life. The movie isn't called the Iliad, it's called Troy, and it is only inspired by the Iliad, not based strictly on it. So all those people out there poo-hooing the movie cause it isn't historically accurate grow up a little. By presenting a modern audience, many of whom have little prior knowledge of the actual storyline, with a movie based stringently on the Iliad they would have alienated the masses, and it is the masses who pay to see the movie and make it successful, not just all the scholars and students of history. I actually think they've done really well to make this story appeal to all audiences. They've gotten rid of a lot of the bulky story lines, like the long siege and the involvement of the gods. All they have done is kept to the very basic storyline, and it works.<br/><br/>Some spoilers here! (I guess)<br/><br/>The deaths of Agamemmnon, Menelaus and Ajax are all necessary to the telling of the story and the enjoyment the ordinary person gets out of it. Agamemmnon and Menelaus are the villains, and for them to survive the conflict and return to Greece would leave most audiences unsatisfied. Also, I thought having Hector killing Ajax was a good idea, as it allows the extent of Hector's prowess as a warrior to be evident before his battle with Achilles - it equates their abilities better before the fight.<br/><br/>As for the features of the film, they certainly make it spectacular. The sets, costumes and props are fantastic, and so is the acting for the most part. Everyone has been bagging Brad Pitt but I thought he did an adequate job, especially in the fight scenes (which is what Achilles is all about anyway). As an Australian it was great to finally see Eric Bana show the world what a truly great actor he is. He was incredible and played the part perfectly. Peter O'Toole was also great as Priam, and the guys who played Menelaus and Agamemmnon were also good. Very sinister at times. Orlando Bloom was alright, but I think Paris would be the hardest part to play of all, and he handles it quite well. But for me the standout was Sean Bean as Odysseus - he was perfect! Definitely the highlight of the film. I hope the make The Odyssey next!<br/><br/>So even though it's not historically accurate, it still is wonderfully entertaining. I can understand why the filmmakers made the adjustments that they did for a wider audience, as it certainly very appealing and the fight scenes, in particular, are outstanding. Great entertainment for a couple of bucks. 8.5/10"
"calico_demon","8","4","8","30 May 2004"," Much Better Thank Expected
","I really enjoyed this film.  It's not the kind of thing I normally go for, but I enjoyed it from start to finish.  It stays pretty close to Homer's 'Iliad', although they made Patroclus into Achilles' cousin instead of lover (can't have a big, tough movie hero thats gay now can we!).<br/><br/>Hector is a great character, and Eric Bana plays him pretty well. <br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is as to be expected.... he looks good, but his acting is pretty appalling.  This doesn't detract from the film though. The only negative about this film is the soundtrack.  It's like a constant wailing throughout the whole movie. Really annoying."
"luvcolinfarrell","8","4","8","24 May 2004"," Historically Disappointing But Great!
","Even though Homer is probably cursing in Hades due to extravagant ""theatrical license"" the writers took when penning the script, I thought Troy was a phenomenal movie. Hopefully, it will not be ignored come Oscar time. Visually it was stunning. The battle scenes were some of the best I have seen in any movie. Also, as a historian to see such things as the city of Troy, the thousand triremes encroaching upon the city and the Trojan horse immortalized on screen was amazing. Kudos to the special effects wizards! <br/><br/>Most of the casting was unbelievably brilliant. Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom each embodied their roles perfectly by embracing their characters' weaknesses and strengths. After seeing this movie, no one can doubt the acting ability of any of these immensely talented (and gorgeous) actors. However, the casting agents must have been asleep when they casted Diane Krueger as Helen. While she is beautiful, she does not fit the well quoted Homeric description of having a face that launched a thousand ships. One hundred ships maybe, but not one thousand."

Well, they mingle the story so that it can be made as a movie, well that is OK because everyone knows that it is necessary. Then they change the focus from the Trojan war to Achille's war... not that perfect, but hey, it is Brad Pitt hence I can live with that.<br/><br/>In all it is a great movie, with some really great acting from the actors, I was actually kind of thrilled of it. One thing I'm missing is the language.. after seeing Passion of Christ and what them speaking the native language does to a movie, I'm really missing it here. If they spoke the real language this movie would have been nearly perfect."
"ladymetsjm","Null","4","8","22 May 2004"," Simple, yet Large
","Fine, so it has been discussed in massive detail how much the movie varies from the book. Suddenly everyone has become literary. But as they said it is ""inspired by"" not ""based on"" or ""adapted from"". <br/><br/>Orlando Blooms performance is also bashed. But by the same book lovers. Recall in Homers tale, Paris is a quivering little weakling who was polishing his armour in his bedroom while everyone else was dying outside. Mission accomplished, because by the end I think we all realized just how worthless Paris really was.<br/><br/>Eric Bana's performance was fabulous. I didn't really see him as much of an actor in Hulk, but it seems as if he was made for this kind of roll (insert comments from Randy, Simon and ... we can forget Paula here). The strength of Hector was definitely seen (if not his arrogance, but I think that's more in the writing than in his actual acting).<br/><br/>Other than that I think the movie was beautifully done. May not have had as much action as the action lovers wanted, nor did it have full romantic developments that the romancers wanted, but I think it was quite fine for people who just love movies and don't need one overwhelming theme. (Do we always need to put movies in a class)<br/><br/>(of course a female could not end her review without commenting on the physiques of Bana, Bloom and Pitt ... WOW)<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars"
"GJBStar","8","4","8","25 May 2004"," Slightly unsatisfying but big on spectacle
","This is a film that I had been anticipating for some time.  The story of Achilles and the Trojan Wars is steeped in legend and had a great deal of potential.  Unfortunately, not all of that potential has been fulfilled by director Petersen.<br/><br/>As for the basic plot, Agamemnon is a Greek King with a lust for power and control of Greece and the Aegean who is forced to rely upon a tempremental, unpredictable warrior, Achilles.  Meanwhile, his brother Meneleaus, is the King of Sparta who is trying to foster peace with Troy.  However, his wife Helen, is tempted away from him by the Trojan prince, Paris, and as a result, Troy and Greece are forced into war.  Whilst this plot is suitably epic and the battle scenes are impressive.  In particular, the scenes at night both on the beach and in Troy are spectacular.  However, whilst the politics and romantic subplots should be equally interesting and keep you enthralled during the downtime away from the battles.  Unfortunately, this is not the case and instead, I felt somewhat disinterested and uninspired by some of the less up-tempo scenes.  In short, the film lacked rhythm and was too staccato in its pacing.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the casting in this film, however I believe that most of the main players was well cast.  Brad Pitt does not give his best performance and I was left wanting a performance with more gravitas (compare his performance to that of Russell Crowe in Gladiator).  However, he embodies the spirit of Achilles well and certainly looks the part.  It is also hard to think of another actor who could play that role. <br/><br/>
Of the lead warriors, in my opinion, it is Eric Bana who puts in the best performance.  A devoted husband, son and father and slightly more measured in his enthuiasm for the fight that Achilles, he is a more complicated and multi-dimensional character as a result.  Equally, Orlando Bloom gives the best performance of his that I have seen (but then there has been little good to compare it with).  However, his delivery still feels a little stunted and as his character, Paris, he is no match for Pitt or Bana.  Kudos should also be given to Peter O'Toole as King of Troy, Priam.  His scenes with Brad Pitt show him to be a masterful actor and he gives a really human performance which impressed me.  However, some of the actors are criminally underused.  This particularly applies to Diane Kruger as Helen, who is hardly given any screentime, despite her role in what ultimately plays out and Sean Bean, who is good but essentially a filler character forgotten about too often.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this film is fun and spectacular but it doesn't reach the highs that you ultimately wish it would.  Also, at almost 3 hours in length, the downtime and sometimes silly romantic sub-plots do not keep us particularly enthralled for the full running time.  In short, good but not GREAT, and this is a film that to succeed needs to be great."

"DarthBill","6","4","8","20 May 2004"," The ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" of sword and sandal films?
","When I first saw the trailer for ""Troy"" and heard that Brad Pitt was playing Achilles, I thought to myself ""This is going to end up being like 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves', a film that looks great and has some good actors but it's all offset by a crucial casting error - Brad Pitt as Achilles."" To my surprise, I actually enjoyed ""Troy"" but I still couldn't get my head around the casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles, except that director Wolfgang Petersen admired Pitt's work in ""Fight Club"" and used ""Troy"" as an excuse to work with him. Had this film been made 15 years ago, Brad Pitt probably would have played Paris of Troy. <br/><br/>Let me get something straight first though: I don't hate Brad Pitt. I'm not a fan of Brad Pitt but I don't hate him either. I understand that women think Brad Pitt is sex on legs and that has been the big factor in his success, but he's also worked hard over the years to prove that he's more than just a pretty face with odd-ball characterizations including ""Snatch"" and ""Fight Club"". While I commend Pitt for his efforts, I must also acknowledge that being able to play psychopaths doesn't automatically qualify him to play a mythological character, least of all Achilles. I always pictured Achilles as a man who looks like a force of nature, rough and rugged. Pitt clearly hit the weight room, but even at age 40 his face is still too boyish and pretty to really compliment his character. Pitt's performance isn't terrible but it's a mixed bag at best; Pitt gives his all most of the time, but some scenes he's just not trying, like when he refuses to fight the second day of the war after King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) takes Briseis (Rose Byrne) from him. Brad Pitt drives a chariot as though he were Charlton Heston in ""Ben-Hur"", but Pitt is no Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>Well, in this loose adaptation of Homer's ""The Iliad"", the aforementioned Agamemnon of Mycenae has gotten pretty much everyone in Greece to join him, with the foreign country Troy being the only rival left. His little brother, however, King Meneleaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) is tired of battle and wants peace with Troy, which he thinks he's established with Princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom). What Meneleaus doesn't know is that Paris has been having a week long fling with his wife Helen (Diane Kruger). Paris, being as stupid as he is, smuggles Helen back to Troy to be his wife, which pisses off Meneleaus and prompts the Trojan War, led by Meneleaus and Agamemnon. In addition to King Odysseus of Ithica, AKA: Ulysses (Sean Bean), Achilles is also joining the fray, even though he and Agamemnon don't like each other. Agamemnon hates Achilles because he's kind of a jerk who fights only for himself and Achilles hates Agamemnon because he thinks the king is a power mad coward who won't fight his own battles (in other words, he has no honor as Achilles would define it). Achilles joins the fray only for the glory of his own name and as a favor to his pal Odysseus, the only man he'll listen to. Achilles wins Agamemnon the beach on their first day, but he gets mad when Agamemnon seizes his girl, the spunky Briseis for no apparent reason except that he's a dirty old man and perhaps to annoy Achilles (in ""The Iliad"", it was compensation). <br/><br/>Helen thinks of giving herself back to the Spartans in order to protect Paris and Troy, but she is denied that. <br/><br/>The lovable family man warrior Hector doesn't want a war and begs his dad King Priam of Troy (Peter O'Toole) to give Helen back to the Greeks, but Priam believes that they can win because of their walls and the fact that they've got Apollo God of the Sun on their side. Hell Hector's first impulse was to sail back to Sparta and give Helen back and beg Meneleaus for forgiveness and then take Paris home and beat some sense into him, but Paris stubbornly refused to let her go unless he went with her and he didn't want his little idiot brother to get killed. Paris tries take responsibility for his actions by challenging Meneleaus to a duel, but despite being younger and quicker Paris is no match for Meneleaus and just as he is about to be killed he turns and scampers away, shaming himself and the family. A further enraged Meneleaus tries to kill Paris but Hector, on familial reflex, whips out his sword and stabs Meneleaus. That pisses off Agamemnon and a big battle is waged without Achilles and his forces, and Hector and the Trojans beat the Greeks back and even kill the power-house Ajax (Tyler Mane) in the process. <br/><br/>Paris is ashamed of himself for being a hypocrite and a coward and shaming the family, and despite Helen's attempts to console him, he resolves that he must reclaim at least some of his dignity and pride by getting in touch with his inner elf (sorry, couldn't resist) and starts boning up on his archery. Achilles eventually gets Briseis back in return for his services and steps in just as she's about to be gang raped by some Greeks. Well, Achilles infatuation with Briseis has softened him up and he decides to take his men back home, which annoys his cousin Patroclus (originally just a friend and ally), who feels like they're turning their back on their countrymen.<br/><br/>Given Achilles refusal to fight Agamemnon, Patroclus takes it upon himself to fight in Achilles place and leads their men into battle, wearing Achilles armor, as the cavalry against the advancing Trojans, but he is killed by Hector. No one is exactly happy about this except Agamemnon, who counts on using Achilles rage to get rid of one of their biggest obstacles: Hector. Predictably, Achilles goes after Hector, thirsting for revenge despite Briseis begging him not to fight Hector because he's her cousin and the two men fight each other before Troy. Hector fights valiantly but in the end he is killed by Achilles and then dragged away tied to Achilles chariot. Priam later comes before Achilles and begs for his son's body and Achilles eventually agrees, promising him 12 days of peace as well as returning Briseis and complimenting Priam - ""You're a far better king than the one leading this war."" Agamemnon is annoyed with the peace but Odysseus uses it as the chance to plan - by building the Trojan horse that they will hide in and offer up as a kind of gift of surrender to Troy. Achilles tells his first officer to take the men home while he fights a personal battle.<br/><br/>The Trojan Horse is built and left for the Trojans to find. Paris has a bad feeling and suggests burning it, but Priam is convinced by his Irish priest (Nigel Terry, King Arthur in ""Excalibur"") to take the thing home. After the celebration, Odysseus and his men open the gates and the Greeks attack, while Achilles searches the city for Briseis. Priam is stabbed in the back by Agamemnon, and Agamemnon is killed by Briseis. Paris gives the sword of Troy to Aeneas and tells him to lead the others out, including Helen, while he searches for his father and happens upon Achilles as he is about to take Briseis and shoots him down with his arrows, thus avenging Hector. Paris and Briseis disappear into the night but we do not know if they escape or not. The film ends with Achilles being burned and Odysseus being philosophical.<br/><br/>Like ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" the film is epically mounted and features some great actors, but Brad Pitt kind of offsets things (though he's not as bad as Achilles as Kevin Costner was as Robin Hood). The film works hard at first to keep from having a specific villain, but Brian Cox's campy Agamemnon comes very close to being ""the bad guy"". The best of the lot is Eric Bana as the heroic everyman Prince Hector (though he might have made a better Achilles than Brad Pitt) and Peter O'Toole as King Priam, who has one of the film's most touching scenes: begging for his son's corpse. Let's face it, to the world, Orlando Bloom will ALWAYS be Legalos, and he certainly is so when he picks up the bow and arrow for the climax, but his performance is passable, as there are hints of an actor trying to escape his boyish appearance. He doesn't look quite angry enough when he watches Hector die, but he sounds pretty mad when people dance around the Trojan Horse (""Look at them... you'd think their prince had never died."") Diane Kruger is a decent Helen and she and Bloom work hard to make their characters sympathetic despite their actions. Sean Bean is good but under-used as Odysseus, as is Brendan Gleeson as Meneleaus. Saffron Burrows makes the most of her role as Hector's wife, as does Rose Byrne as Briseis.<br/><br/>Some good music by James Horner (who scored the Star Trek films) and well mounted battle scenes similar to if not on par with ""Lord of the Rings""."
"rphamilton","9","4","8","21 May 2004"," A excellent epic that has its flaws, but will earn its place on my DVD shelf
","**(Some Spoilers)**<br/><br/>Troy was a very well made movie. Wolfgang Petersen did a good job at giving each of the characters life and creating excellent epic movie<br/><br/>Here is a quick run down of a few of the actors:<br/><br/>Brad Pitt (Achilles) (C+) - His best performance i have seen from him, but when i looked at achilles i couldn't see achilles all i saw was Brad Pitt in long blonde hair. Decent but needs work.<br/><br/>Brian Cox (Agamennon) (A-) - Portrays Agamennon extremely well, not Oscar worthy but and excellent performance non the less<br/><br/>Sean Bean (Odysesus) (B+) - The perfect Odysesus in my mind really nothing wrong with his performance<br/><br/>Brenden Gleeson (Menalaus) (B) - Very good as Menalaus, portrays the disciplined and tough, King of Sparta very well<br/><br/>Eric Bana (Hector) (A) - An extremely accurate depiction of Hector very Oscar worthy<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole (Priam) (A+) - Wow is all i have to say. Such a perfect performance, definitely Oscar worthy<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom (Paris) (C) - He did better in LOTR as Legolas, but he did better as Paris then he did as Will Turner from Pariates of the Carrabien. Never been a great actor, but did a decent job<br/><br/>Diane Kruger (Helen) (B-) - Don't really see a lot of her but when you do she does a very good job. She did excellent for a newcomer.<br/><br/>Tyler Mane (Ajax) (B) - He did a very good job portraying, Ajax. The guy who can fall a tree with one swing and clober dozens of men into submission, very good performance. To bad he dies so early.<br/><br/>The rest of Troy, such as the fighting scenes and the CGI effects, are exciting and extremely fun to watch. When compared to LOTR effects, the CGI effects in Troy stay original and thankfully don't look like copycats from other movies.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen knows how to direct action. These sword fight scenes are so awesome to watch from 100,000 soldiers hacking each other up. To Achilles and Hector dueling at the walls of Troy. The sword battles are breathtaking.<br/><br/>What the movie did wrong was change the story so much. I don't mind the changes that much, but in my opinion when making a movie based on one of the greatest works of literature of all time u don't want to change the story. I think that is what hurt this movie the most. For the most part the changes can be over looked.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was when Achilles and his Myrmidoms (sry if the spelling is wrong) storm the beach. When they jump off the ship and get wailed with arrows and people are falling into the water and dropping to the sand. Then the Myrmidoms make a shield wall and move up the beach, throwing spears and flinging arrows, until they are right in the Trojans faces. Then when the get like 5 feet from the Trojan blockade the break ranks and charge. Such and amazing scene!!<br/><br/>All in all Troy was great and i would definitely see it again and buy the DVD.<br/><br/>Unfortunately with the story changes, some mediocre lines, and being over shadowed by the LOTR trilogy and Galdiator Troy does not win over the media. Fortunatly the fight scenes, CGI effects, actors, and graphic violence keep people glued to their seat and can overshadow Troy's flaws.<br/><br/>I feel if Troy came out before LOTR and Gladiator people might have welcomed it more, but Troy is still an excellent film. 8.8/10"
"Ahsirakh","Null","4","8","21 May 2004"," (SPOILER) ""Troy"" is a courageous attempt at developing Homer's epic tale into the richly human story that it rightfully deserves to be.
","""The Iliad"" is undisputedly the greatest epic of classical Greece; the poem, which runs twenty-four books in length, centers on the mythic hero Achilles and the wrath that consumes him in the final days of the siege of Troy.<br/><br/>Popular misconception of Homer's epic embroils it with the deeper conflict between the Olympian gods which sparked the entire ten-year war, and screenwriter David Benioff could have easily bent to mainstream pressure and created a contemporary ""Clash of the Titans""-esque film where gods and mortals meet in the mother of all ancient battles.<br/><br/>Instead, he wrote ""Troy"".<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it -- ""Troy"" is no ""Iliad"". While Homer made allusions to the existence of gods in what was meant to be a timeless epic, director Wolfgang Petersen's latest screen offering discards any palpable suggestion of divine intervention. Rather, Benioff opts to tell the story closer to what the historical war actually would have been, in order to better flesh out the vivid human elements resonant in Homer's original that were made dimmer by the presence of over-dramatic embellishments.<br/><br/>Achilles, for instance, never once has his heel accentuated as his one fatal weakness, and the notion of his immortality is portrayed simply as a rumor spreading through the Greek army; at one point, he asserts that he would not be clad in armor were he indeed an immortal. His mother, the sea nymph Thetis, is also but an elderly woman who seems to have an affinity for the sea and prophesizes his future commemoration and doom from his participation in the Trojan War.<br/><br/>Playing the film's fearless hero is thespian Brad Pitt, who takes on the intense challenge of showing Achilles' transformation from stony-faced warrior to one who learns to understand love and sympathy, pulling it off with impeccable grace. His solid performance, however, is hampered greatly by the deficient script; a number of the lines given to him are hackneyed and awkward-sounding. Thankfully, as the movie progresses, these lines gradually decrease in time for Achilles' human emotions to surface.<br/><br/>Heading the army on the opposite side of the towering Trojan walls is prince Hector, in an equally stellar performance by Australian actor Eric Bana. The epitome of honor and responsibility, Hector spends much of his time in the film juggling the positions of prince, eldest son, elder brother, husband and commander. Bana manages a man conflicted by his various duties with remarkable adroitness.<br/><br/>Even Hollywood's ""It"" boy Orlando Bloom, whose acting in blockbusters such as ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was considerably lackluster, handles the naïve and timid Paris convincingly, and is especially so in a scene where he cowers, scared and humiliated, at his brother's feet, whimpering for security against rival Menelaus, with whom he is dueling and losing. This streak of theatrical expertise seems to infect the rest of the cast, who portray their characters with as much enthusiasm and skill.<br/><br/>Out of all the elements which pepper the otherwise flawless movie, such as the now-infamous ""Lord of the Rings"" wide-angle zooming shot of armies clashing, the film's greatest downfall would indubitably have to be its soundtrack. The music, especially in the battle scenes, is repetitive and jarring, serving as a distraction to the audience from fully enjoying the wonder that is ""Troy"" -- nothing short of a courageous attempt at developing Homer's epic tale into the richly human story that it rightfully deserves to be."
"Kaiya","Null","4","8","23 May 2004"," Great Film. BANA was FANTASTIC!
","I was one of those people who had been eagerly anticipating the release of Troy for many many months and I thought that I would thoroughly enjoy it, and for the most I did. To be honest, the screenplay wasn't totally true to the original tale but hey, how many people are really gonna have read the Iliad? It was a very good adaption, very 'edge-of-the-seat' stuff there. The war, though long, was extremely exciting, though not for the faint hearted. I had never seen anyone get their throat sliced so graphically before I saw it, but some very good choreography there. The fight between Hector and Achilles is probably writing itself into cinematic history. It was superb and very emotional. Bana's performance gave me a huge lump in my throat. The costuming is very good, Bob Ringwood did a top job with that. The music was a bit disappointing though. It was quite monotonous and not exciting enough. <br/><br/>Now the more important aspects, however, it wasn't, surprisingly, the main cast members that did the most fantastic jobs. Brad Pitt made a good Achilles and I think the arrogance made a very nice touch to the character. Brian Cox was a superbly evil Agamemnon, I was sitting through most of the film wanting to spear the guy! I was though, very disappointed with Orlando Bloom. He doesn't seem to be getting any roles in which he doesn't play a softly spoken, lovelorn wimp and it really would be great if someone could give him a role which doesn't give him this stereotype and doesn't focus solely on his ability to fire arrows.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were absolutely fantastic. Peter O'Toole as Priam, Sean Bean as Odysseus, Rose Byrne as Briseis (who I actually think is the more beautiful) and Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus. Great acting there from them all. Now I come to my last few points. Although her role was very small Saffron Burrows was super. She played Andromache, wife of Hector and she really showed off her ability to totally capture the audiences attention.<br/><br/>And of course Eric Bana as Hector. He absolutely made the film for me. He was nothing less that totally fantastic. You could tell that he put his all into his role and he created such emotion within it. I can do nothing else but rave about his performance. Definitely the star of the show and if he continues to act like that, even with his policy of 'one movie a year' then he's going to get himself written down as one of the greats."
"Zack1981","Null","4","8","17 May 2004"," A bit different Homer
","Well, first of all I must say it's a GREAT movie. Still, it has so many changes to the original script (Homer's Illiad), that I had honestly hoped till the end of the movie the Troy might actually win the war. I guess I was partially inclined to the Troy because its people and royal family were simply better and had a better cause. It had been also like that every time I had read the Illiad back in high school, but this time I got even more touched by wonderful, excellent interpretation of Hector, Prince of Troy, by Erik Bana(dinovich). He played the just and stoical Prince of Troy with an amazing passion. If I had to grade all the cast, I would probably give an A to most of them, but only Eric Bana (maybe Brad Pitt and Peter O'Toole also) would get an A+(++). As for cast, I also found a bit strange there had been blond Greeks 3200 years ago... It is a bit different, but excellent Homer."
"firestorm1200","Null","4","8","17 May 2004"," Troyreffic :)
","This movie is an epic, quite simply one of the best history films of the last 50 years. The story is clearly presented by some solid performances notably good from eric banner. Its a love pact that enthralls literally thousands of greeks into a bloody bitter battle telling the story of Troy. Whilst initially it seems a bit hollow the film does hold a lot of emotion that spills into each sequence. A few more fights would have good but alround winner, building tension and excitement in every scene.<br/><br/>A lot of people have said that Bradd Pitt was miscast but his natural confidence and screen play is comfortably adapted. Another note about the film is that each shot magically directed to give a realistic impression of the action. Well worth seeing whatever you like."

"FreeLoki","9","4","8","14 May 2004"," Great film. Sean Bean is memorable over all!
","I really did enjoy this movie.  Great epic battle scenes and the CGI effects are virtually seamless.  Plus, I really liked how the plot focused more on the individuals participating in the war (and what the war was really about) than on the stale love story between Paris and Helen.  I think the movie leaned a little heavily on fight choreography and seemed somewhat in a rush to finish after the first 2 hours, but what really did it for me were certain performances by a very talented cast.<br/><br/>Sean Bean.  In my opinion, his role and performance of it was probably the most influential and strongest of anyone.  Sort of a hidden strength within the movie which has placed a lot of its mystique on the shoulders of Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom.  Sean is the unforeseen jewel in this picture.  His performance was flawless and left you wanting more.  Just when you thought he couldn't do better than Boromir in ""LOTR"" he blows it away with Odysseus.<br/><br/>Hollywood better take notice.  Sean is an actor to be reckoned with and Warner Bros. would have done well to publicize him more than they did. Every role he's performed has hit the mark and this is absolutely no exception.<br/><br/>A sequel (""The Odyssey"") starring Sean Bean should be done.  I can't say it more simply than that.  WE WANT ""THE ODYSSEY!""  And we want it with Sean Bean.<br/><br/>Impressive performances were also turned in by Pitt and Bana.  I've been a Pitt fan for years and this role really showed a diverse talent we didn't know was there.  I haven't loved him this much in a movie since ""Fight Club.""  And Bana was nothing short of fantastic.  He has a new fan right here.  It's a toss-up between Hector and Achilles as to who the true protagonist of the movie was.  They made it very hard to choose sides.  I don't think I ever did!<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom.  For all the publicity he got, he wasn't in it half as much as I expected.  They painted Paris as neither heroic nor honorable (and he really wasn't, if you think about it) and I think Orlando pulled this depiction off wonderfully.  It's nice to see him as something other than a valiant, invincible hero.  ""Troy"" lets you see that there is likely a massive range in his acting abilities and I can't wait to see him in more roles that differ from his norm.<br/><br/>I can't give ""Troy"" four stars with a clear conscience.  One movie can only ever have four stars from me from now on and that's ""Return of the King."" And a ""Return of the King"" this was not.  But it's definitely a ""must-see"" for any movie-goer."
"libroschica","10","4","8","15 May 2004"," Excellent, but should say ""Loosely based on The Iliad""
","I am a Greek mythology enthusiast, and while this movie was absolutely fantastic, it was not the story of Homer's Iliad, which is set in the 9th year of the war.  Despite this, the film was wonderful, and the story they told was excellent.  The visual elements of the film were also good, the masses of soldiers were very realistic.  All of the actors gave solid performances, from Brian Cox's greedy Agammemnon to Orlando Bloom's wimpy Paris, all the actors made their characters come to life.  The film was also very good because it doesn't portray the men on either side as the bad side. You want to root for both Achilles and Hector at once.  I will definitely see this film again!"
"myworld1013-1","8","4","8","14 May 2004"," Interesting at least...
","Troy was not a wonderfully magnificent, blow you out of your seat film. But it wasn't horrible either. The battles, whether the special effects or the hand to hand combat was excellent and riveting. Yes, cgi armies are getting rather old, but how else to you convey a hundred thousand soldier army? Considering the mammoth epic that this film was trying to display, the battle sequences and soldiering was brilliant.<br/><br/>I know the biggest complaint will be the changing of Homer's Iliad. That story is monstrous, full of characters, heroes, gods, battles, and a very complex plot. Most certainly not fit for even a two and a half hour movie for an audience who loves heroes. I give the writers props for at least attempting to convey portions of the story. I enjoyed this cut down version, it was easier to understand and easier to love the characters.<br/><br/>Finally, the acting. This film relies entirely on its supporting actors. Eric Bana (Hector) and Sean Bean (Odysseus) are absolutely brilliant and should be credited with holding this film together, along with Peter O' Toole's role as Priam. The acting started off rocky, Brad Pitt acted like a 21st century actor who had just been plucked off a Hollywood lot and told to pretend he was really really brave, not like he was trying to portray a legendary man. However, his acting got better, much of it due to an excellent supporting cast. Orlando Bloom was a bit of a disappointment and I found him more irritating and a wuss then the Trojan prince he becomes in the end. The final battle between Hector and Achilles was heart wrenching because you didn't know who to root for, I enjoyed both of the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, there are flaws, but this film is entertaining and interesting at least..."
"maricora","Null","4","8","14 May 2004"," Loved it (possible SPOILERS)
","For one who has read the Iliad in its original Ancient Greek form, there are of course many things to criticize about this movie. But I don't plan on writing down every historical mistake. A Hollywood movie just cannot stand up to a 2800 year old epic. And about the movie there is one thing to say: This is great great great - or in German: ganz großes Kino! So apart from errors in the content - people die in the wrong order or at the wrong point in time, for example, and I wonder where the writers took all their information about Briseis from who in the Iliad has a tiny minor role - this was an overall enjoyable movie experience. The fighting scenes are amazing, cruel, but amazing, the costumes are wonderful to look at and so are the actors. Marvellous performances are shown by Brad, Eric and Orlando the same - what bothered me was Diane Kruger. She is a beautiful beautiful woman and you totally can believe her to be the most beautiful woman alive resembling Aphrodite herself, but what was with the talking? Again I learned: Watching movies in a language different from the original language is not good. She sounded as though she were drunk. Still her character, just as all other characters, was incredibly neatly drawn. To me, Achilles is one of the most amazing characters literature ever created, and I loved Brad Pitt personifying him. Not only the muscles - ladies, the muscles! - but also the voice, the look in his eyes, the things he said and the values he brought across. It was what I enjoyed most of the movie: Watching these ancient archaic characters come to life. And there was a great job done - even though I never knew Achilles had been so much in love and even though I know for sure that Agamemnon was not killed in Troy but In Mycenae in his very own bath tub. Go watch this movie. If you are like me, it's gonna make you laugh and cry - and crying about things that are not to do with your own problems is the most relieving thing I know."
"willrams","8","4","8","17 May 2004"," A Big Fat Eight!
","If you want a rousing Big Fat 8, go see this exciting and eventful film based upon Homer's great epic.  The siege of Troy by all the Greek forces. After ten bloody years, the Greeks are not going to leave without taking Troy.  Even though the CGI is recognizable in big huge battle scenes, there is much to be said for the fast pace and fine acting in this epic.  The film is 162 minutes long, but your interest will be held by the fast pacing and fine acting.  Laurels go to Brad Pitt as an audacious arrogant personality unforgiving until the end.  I understand the location locales were made in Mexico, Malta and London.  Directed by Wolfgang Perersen, the only criticism I can give is that the musical background rarely fits the action.  Too bad; somebody like John Williams would do much better directing the music.  It was good to see Peter O'Toole back again; he plays the part of Priam.  In fact he did so well and was so disguised with beard that I hardly recognized him at all.  8/10"
"a_sailor_girl","9","4","8","11 May 2004"," Entertaining movie, worth seeing at least once
","I saw a screening of Troy just a few hours ago (this was written May 5th), so the details are still pretty fresh in my mind. [Minor spoilers]<br/><br/>Acting: The characters of Hector (Eric Bana), Achilles (Brad Pitt), Briseis (Rose Byrne), and Priam (Peter O'Toole) were all very well-acted. Unfortunately, Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger) were poorly constructed characters. Paris is supposed a callow boy, but came across as just awkward with Orlando Bloom's acting. Of course, the dialogue was stilted to begin with. There were attempts to develop Helen from the characterization that Paris suffered, but in the end, it failed. The scenes and characters felt cheesy, rather than naive and irrationally passionate. We're supposed to hate or at least dislike these characters but I found myself more annoyed than anything else. Odysseus (Sean Bean, of LOTR fame) and Andromache (Saffron Burrows) were well-done, but they were definitely secondary (or tertiary?) characters.<br/><br/>Accuracy (to the Illiad): Glaringly, the movie is set over the course of about 14 days, when the Trojan War in the Illiad lasts for over 10 years. There are other artistic licenses that were taken that didn't detract too much from the story, in the sense that the audience cracked up when we realized that their war ran for only 14 days.<br/><br/>Battle scenes: Pretty spectacular. Lots of blood (sometimes, I had trouble distinguishing the blood spray from what I think were cap codes), insane pyrotechnics (you'll see what I mean after you see the movie), fantastic swordplay, and of course archery (Orlando Bloom's first and best claim to fame to date), death, destruction, mayhem at its finest. They were spaced apart pretty well and so were not overwhelming.<br/><br/>Love scenes: As long as they weren't between Helen and Paris, they were believable and well-done. Briseis and Achilles was a stretch considering the circumstances and the speed, but the emotions still felt genuine. Don't get me started on Helen and Paris.<br/><br/>Summary: Fun war movie, with lots of battle scenes and eye-candy males (sometimes, the director get over-enthusiastic when filming Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom). I'll see it again when it hits theatres, if only because Eric Bana (as a relative unknown for those of us who hadn't seen The Hulk) is really fantastic -- both in terms of acting and physically. Worked well for both males and females."
"emuir-1","8","4","8","17 May 2004"," Battles, sword fights, and more.
","A film always reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was made, and in which it is viewed.  Troy is no exception.  Whether or not the Trojan war really happened does not matter: given man's  need for  periodic bloodletting it is more than likely.  One cannot help but draw parallels and comparisons with the current times - a war fought on a flimsy pretext to cover the real reason - extending power and a show of force.  Agamemnon, having consolidated the Greek states into a coalition with himself as King, is determined to grab rich Troy and show them who is the boss.  It is more interesting to watch a tale of times when Kings were warriors who had to fight for their kingdoms and lead their armies into battle, rather than the war being fought from comfortable offices thousands of miles away by men who have never seen action.  The saber rattling is the same.  <br/><br/>
The story is taken from Homer's epic poem of the Greek armada sailing across the Aegean Sea to attack the city state of Troy, on the pretext of avenging the abduction of Helen, Queen of Sparta by the young Prince Paris of Troy. At the end of a long 10-year siege, the Greeks gained entry into Troy by means of the wooden horse and sacked the City.  <br/><br/>In the film version, the siege lasts about 2 weeks.  Combatants agree to call it a day and go home at sundown, Achilles is a conceited  bisexual thug, Paris needs to be sent off to his room (after a cold shower), and Agamemnon needs to take Pepto Bismol.  Helen, the older woman, tries the ""my husband doesn't understand me"" on young Paris, who falls for it with disastrous consequences, he certainly wasn't thinking with his head, and decent doomed  Hector gets stuck with the damage control.   They don't call it Greek tragedy for nothing!<br/><br/>The film is an enjoyable way to spend a hot afternoon in an air-conditioned cinema.  There are lots of sword fights and combat scenes .  The films has a very nice `look'.  Interiors are dark and candlelit, exteriors are lit with the brilliant light of the Mediterranean.   The colors are lovely, especially the use of the various blue/green shades of the sea in clothes and jewelry.    Why they had to depict Troy as being in a sandy desert was puzzling, as the excavations of Troy show it to be located in a green and pleasant pastureland.<br/><br/>Accepting the fact that the 10-year siege had to be was compressed into 2 1/2 hours, my only problem was with  the some of the casting.   Ms. Kruger, as Helen of Troy was totally wooden; notwithstanding that  she wasnt given much to do, any one of a thousand actresses could have made something out of the role.  They could have substituted a mannequin for free.   Eric Bama who was outstanding as the noble Hector, would have been more interesting had the roles of Achilles and Hector been switched, with Eric Bama playing Achilles.  I feel that it is a mistake to combine venerable British actors with American `film stars' as the two have different and not always compatible acting styles.   This was obvious in the scene where Peter O'Toole, playing the old King Priam, comes to the tent of Achilles to plead for the return of Hector's body after it has been dragged to the Greek camp behind Achilles chariot.  Brad Pitt handled the scene very well, but was completely upstaged by Peter O'Tooles more theatrical style.   Troy is an epic film which demands the more grandiose theatrical style of the British actors, as was very evident in Brian Cox's stealing every scene as Agamemnon."
"pauld2b","8","4","8","16 May 2004"," Why Don't You Stop
","1. If you didn't read The Iliad you're not qualified to comment regarding the story because you don't ""know"" the story. So stop. Much of the accuracy was lost but enough is here to get the basic storyline across. The inaccurate deaths of Ajax, Menelaus and Agamemnon-and the lack of the Gods and the presence of Aeneas is annoying  I am qualified because I read the book. When exactly was it that Hollywood got a book right?<br/><br/>2. Those of you who just hate anything that Brad Pitt does please stop that too. He's not a bad actor, far from it. He's good looking which makes many people jealous and blind. I'm not good looking but I'm not jealous that he is . But that doesn't mean he can't act. He wasn't bad at all. He showed range and the appropriate amount of confusion which a being who is half God and half man must surely experience. <br/><br/>3. I read where some people thought the sets were great and others thought they were cheesy. Some people thought the cinematography was terrible - others thought it was great My question is how many of you even know what the word means? It can't be ""epic"" because there weren't enough locations? Well there's some sound reasoning.<br/><br/>I must tell you I went to this movie prepared to dislike it and have recommended that people see this movie after viewing it. Could it have been better? Well yes- but it could have been A LOT worse. It did go by awfully fast for 163 minutes. I thought that LOTR 3 would never end and if I saw one more touching Hobbits say goodbye moment I would have vomited - but LOTR in total was a better film. This was a solid 7.5. Will we watch it on Easter for the next 50 years? No. Will I watch it again on DVD? Sure. Did you like the movie? It needs the big screen but that's the glory of movies. If you want to watch a play on film see 12 Angry Men or Glengarry Glenross or Of Mice and Men. All are great filmed plays and take place over a short time period but still use the medium of film to great effect."
"MicktheGreat","7","4","8","15 May 2004"," Good epic movie but NOT the best epic ever...
","Like most people, I've read The Iliad, The Odyssey, and various other mini-plays about the Trojan War. For the most part, I enjoyed these great Greek dramas. So, when I heard that Troy was coming out, I was both anxious to see it and worried that Hollywood would mess it up. Fortunately, Troy succeeds on most levels...not all, but most.<br/><br/>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, there are a few great performances. Brian Cox is absolutely sinister as Agamemnon and I was genuinely glad to see him die (although it's completely different here than in the traditional Greek stories). Sean Bean (Boromir in Lord of the Rings)was very convincing as the great tactician Odysseus, who has the consummate politician's charisma and leadership skills.<br/><br/>However, Eric Bana as Hector and Peter O'Toole as Priam steal the show. Bana makes Hector the most sympathetic character in Troy as he is fighting for his family despite the fact that he disagrees with what Paris and Helen have done. O'Toole as Priam perfectly pulls off the long-time leader who is seeing his city burn around him. I wouldn't be surprised if Bana and O'Toole both got nods for Academy Awards.<br/><br/>The rest of the performances were only OK or terrible. Brad Pitt as Achilles and Rose Byrne as Briseis were good but nothing special. Orlando Bloom is OK as Paris (an average performance from Bloom is a big deal following his terrible acting in Pirates of the Caribbean). Diane Kruger as Helen, Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus, and Saffron Burrows as Andromache were pretty annoying. Brendan Gleeson was under-used as Menelaus.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were good (Hector's death, Achilles' death, and Patroclus' death were all great). However, there were some deaths that bothered me. I don't remember Menelaus dying in the Iliad which happens early on in the film. Priam's death was way too sudden. Agamemnon's death was necessary but I like the classic telling of his death more (where his wife kills him upon his return). The death that bothered me the most was Ajax's death. Not because it wasn't cool but because the mini-play, ""Ajax"", is one of my favorites (in it, Ajax goes crazy and kills himself).<br/><br/>Overall, I think Troy should be considered a success. The fight scenes, death scenes, and acting are all generally good. The setting is great and it definitely has the ""epic"" feel to it. A good epic but certainly not the epic film to end all epic films.<br/><br/>8/10 (due to performances by Bana, Bean, O'Toole, and Cox)"
"turannos","1","6","14","21 March 2005"," Perhaps the worst retelling of the Trojan War, ever.
","OK. The times have changed. This writer has not seen the need to discuss the trials of Achilles, except in passing, and he turns Menelaus into the evil henchman of Agamemnon. He represses all the emotions of a child who has grown up during wartime, knowing that he has a choice to make between being a legend, or living a long life. This fact is touched upon, in a 3 minute montage, that's it. No, Achilles is not a child, but a 40 year old man. The War upon the Trojans was new, and lasts for 4 days. Of course the Homeric version tells us of a 16 year old Achilles and a War that started when he was just 6 years old. The fact that half of the participants of the War on the Athenian side were Kings, suitors of Helen, and there was no mention whatsoever of a pact between the suitors, that brought all these kings to Troy. Otherwise, the story is ridiculous, Brad Pitt is stoically flat, and the direction is choppy at best. But it was beautifully photographed."

","Well, were to start? This is by far one of the worst films I've ever paid good money to see. I won't comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. To start with, the acting, except for Eric Bana, is soap opera quality. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor on The Bold and the Beautiful puts him to shame. The camera action doesn't help, either. How it lingers on him when he's thinking, it just takes me back to Brooke Forrester's days in the lab! Peter O'Toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery, or he is desperately in need of one. Either way, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to end my comments, Diane Kruger is a cute girl, but she sure is no Helen of Troy. Peterson should rather have chosen Saffron Burrows for the role, since Elizabeth Taylor would be rather miscast by now."

","What a terrible movie. A little bit about myself so you understand why I disliked it (and walked out of after 1 hour):<br/><br/>1. I have read the Greek mythology in some detail and know the book version of the Trojan story relatively well. 2. I like action movies of this kind (Spartacus, the original 'Helen of Troy', and Lord of the Rings etc).<br/><br/>*** very minor spoilers *** If you have read the book, this movie will be extremely disappointing. I won't put any big spoilers here, but you will see the equivalent of 'Gandalf killing Saruman' during the first hour of The Fellowship of the Ring. And thank god Peter Jackson didn't do that mistake. The director of Troy has one of the main characters of the book plot killed in the first hour.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book, there is still lots to despair. The battle scenes (at least while I stayed) are terrible. No feelings at all. Brad Pitt's worst performance (I like Brad Pitt in general and enjoy films like Fight Club with him). How did he even agree to sign up for this movie? The plot is somewhat OK (considering you haven't read the book), but everything happens too quickly and seems cut.<br/><br/>The director of this movie is terrible. Please let Peter Jackson or Steven Spielberg or James Cameron do an epic like Troy. You ruined what I was hoping to be a nice movie I was looking fwd to."
"nikolasbelmont","1","6","14","14 May 2004"," Troy - only Wolfgang Pettersen could ruin this...
","I'll make this short (okay, not that short): this movie should've been three movies instead of just one; there is simply no way to include even the most crucial of the events portrayed in Ilias in two and a half hours of screen time. With 160 million $ and the greatest story ever told as a script there's no way you can go wrong, right? Wrong; with Wolfgang Pettersen (remember Air Force One, one of the worst movies of all time) controlling the flow, you can! There were only two truly positive things in this movie (I'll list a few less important, but still positive aspects at the end of this review) - Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, who fit their roles exceptionally well (only Pettersen doesn't give them anything to work on so they are unable to reach their full potential).<br/><br/>Since the guidelines of this site prevent me from spoiling anything for you folks (and rightfully so, though it is my firm belief that everyone living in a western society should read Ilias; it is an essential part of our cultural heritage!) I won't. I will, however, tell you that this movie has very little to do with the actual story by Homer - only a few key points are maintained by Pettersen. Many key characters are missing, (Diomedes, Ajax [Ajax, son of Oileu; son of Telamon is in the movie], Sarpedon, Memnon, Penthesilea and Cassandra, to name a few) or portrayed in horrendous contrast to the actual characters in Ilias. Also, the casting of the movie is terrible, barring the exceptions of Brad Pitt (Achilles), the actor for Patroklus (whoever he was), Eric Bana (Hector), Peter O' Toole (Priam), Sean Bean (Odysseus) and, arguably, Orlando Bloom (Paris).<br/><br/>Setting all of these horrific shortcomings aside (and many, many, many others which I have not the room to state here), one might ask: A) does this movie entertain someone who hasn't read the book and who isn't chained by the original story? B) Does the movie survive more than one viewing? The answers to these questions are as follows: A) probably not, and B) hell no!<br/><br/>Finally, I'll leave you with some of the very few positive things to be found in Troy: 1) Troy is as it should be. 2) The fleet is as it should be. 3) The masses are as they should be. And finally, 4) the setting is accurately portrayed.<br/><br/>Thank you for your patience, I hope you'll find this review helpful in making your decision to go and see (or not) this...piece of work.<br/><br/>-Nikolas Belmont"
"kircdekk","2","5","11","24 September 2007"," An insult to western civilization!
","I had high hopes for this movie. But this was one of the biggest letdowns of the first decade of film in the 21 century. The plot should be well known to any high-school educated person it the western civilization. The Iliad is one of the pillars, along with the Bible, of that same civilization. Hollywood is well known to trivialize and take from the original works for dramatization and wider audience appeal, but a work such as the Iliad should get no such treatment. <br/><br/>The main problem is that every age views the world thru its own lens, and it is even for the most informed person from the 21 century almost impossible to understand Achilles and all the heroes of Troy. Hollywood also has a lens, unfortunately, and I don't mean the camera lens. It is the lens of major Hollywood producers and studios and that lens is what it lead to this insulting movie that claims is inspiration comes from Homer. There are many other errors in this production, but first I would give some pros to it too. <br/><br/>The movie was made by a director whose movie ""Das Boot"" I consider one of the best I have seen in my life. A man who proved that does have vision and knows how to tell a story. The cast was exceptional. Brad Pitt a man known too choose his roles well, Fight Club is enough said, the talented Eric Bana, Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson who are one of the most reliable actors when it comes to period pieces. Sean Bean a men who, in my mind, was more Bond the James Bond himself. And two young talented, and above that beautiful people Orland Bloom and Diane Kruger. It also had screen legends like Julie Christie and Peter O'Toole in it. Millions of dollars, beautiful sets, modern technology that could create the most epic battles of history and myth and, in my mind, the best story ever written. <br/><br/>What could possible get into the way of making this one of the best movies ever made? The Hollywood lens is the answer. The lens that can't see the difference between Homer and Homer Simpson. And the difference between a person that is called a movie goer, and a cactus (apologies to the cactus).<br/><br/>When you take a story like the Iliad, which doesn't cover the entire Trojan War, just its tenth year, it is necessary to provide more content. The Greek myths, scholarship, even discovery channel documentaries can provide that. Here are the biggest failures of the production. The Trojan War lasted for ten years; the movie depicts it in ten days. This is a major error but a far more fatal is the absence of gods. <br/><br/>Gods are the center of Greek myths; it is their decisions and their battles what moves the action. That is what drives the war between men. The heroes of the movie are not action men like Rambo or John McClane, they are not self dependent, they are influenced and torn apart by the gods. It is not possible to understand the story if it doesn't have gods. Why doesn't it have gods? There are no gods in the in the movie because today the movie going audience is not polytheistic. Most of them are monotheistic; some of them are even agnostics and atheists. The Hollywood lens doesn't show us the Greek gods because it figures the audience just doesn't care for them. <br/><br/>There are four more big weaknesses in the movie. One concerns the characters overall and three concern only Achilles. The problem is that the movie randomly kills Greek heroes as its goes along. Menelaus and Agamemnon for example. Why not, they are bad guys? True for the movie, but their lives are involved in a bigger story, in a bigger history that is totally neglected if they are killed off.<br/><br/>As for Achilles. The first is the unnecessary relationship with him and Briseis. Why is it not necessary, not because it didn't exist, but because you have the greatest love story at the core of the movie, the love story of Paris and Helen. <br/><br/>The second is the relationship that should be in it but it isn't the, relationship between Achilles and Patroclus. They were not cousins they were best friends, and they were lovers. The movie depicts the rise of Achilles anger and rage because the death of a family member. His wrath comes from the loss of, what is today seen as family values. The truth is he couldn't care less about family, at least in the Iliad (the Odyssey is a different case). His wrath comes from the loss of the love of his life, the lust and love that is gone leads him to anger and vengeance, and ultimately to his doom. <br/><br/>The third is his doom. The point is that Achilles must not witness the fall of Troy, it was not his fate, the absent gods have decided so. He dies before the end of the war and his place it not in the horse. In the movie it is the direct opposite. <br/><br/>People would say ""It's just an action flick, think gladiator."" The problem is that the story that is the basis of Gladiator is just a smaller and in part historical episode, that had a smaller impact on the western civilization, and the Iliad is one of the pillars of the same civilization, that is why this movie is so insulting. The film should have give more respect to it, and with that it would get more respect for itself. <br/><br/>Why the two stars then. First goes to the powerful score by James Horner. And the second to Paris and Helen, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger, what are for me the only redeeming qualities of this disaster."
"bs3dc","Null","5","11","5 February 2007"," Not Just The Horse That Is Wooden...
","It is hard to know where to begin when reviewing this movie.<br/><br/>-The historical and literary accuracy is way off, which is defended by saying the story is only based on the Iliad. I should say that I learnt the classics at school and read the original Greek and English translations so perhaps I viewed the film with certain preconceptions. I did expect some changes, but not this many.<br/><br/>-I can understand the removal of the gods themselves from the film, this is forgivable to increase realism. However removing the beliefs of the characters is not since it plays a significant role in their actions.<br/><br/>-Some of the acting is atrocious, with Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom among the worst offenders. Both have yet to convince me of both their acting and action credentials. The amount of cuts in the editing of their fights shows that neither can really fight believably. The script is often weak and doesn't help, but there is no genuine excuse. Brad Pitt plays Achilles as a spoilt child and I found myself wishing his character would just die instead of lasting longer than he does in the Iliad. Worst acting accolade of the film is easily won by Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus who is supposed to be a promising warrior yet acts like a whiny 5 year old who is not allowed to go to the park. In the cinema where I watched it everybody burst out laughing at his every word, which I don't think was the intention.<br/><br/>-Eric Bana is really the main star as he portrays the difficult role of Hector effectively and with dignity. Diane Kruger also manages to rise above being simply eye candy and is surprisingly good considering the character was only in the film due the insistence of the producers.<br/><br/><ul><li>Apart from that the better actors are virtually all sidelined, Peter O'Toole, Brian Cox, Sean Bean, John Shrapnel, Julie Christie, Julian Glover - the list goes on. This is unforgivable considering the amount of time focused on Brad Pitt's body in the film - presumably to distract from his wooden acting. They definitely bring a sense of gravitas to ""Troy"" which it lacks in abundance otherwise. In particular Peter O'Toole acts his co-stars off the screen and steals every scene he is in.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I found it very difficult to sympathise with many of the most of the main characters since they all seemed incredibly egocentric in their actions. There was a good deal of criticism of Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" (2002)over seemingly promoting communist values and teaching that the state is much more important than any individual. Well this is comparatively tame in relation to Troy, where after a brief debate it appears to quickly support wholeheartedly the idea that just because Paris and Helen are in love with each other that easily justifies the destruction of a whole city and all its inhabitants. It didn't work for me especially since Paris and runaway Helen didn't seem any more worthy than the supposed villains and boredom is hardly a convincing argument for genocide. I have to admit that this is part of the original story, but this can be explained by the gods using the characters as pawns and the effects of ten years of campaigning - both elements are missing from the film adaption.</li></ul><br/><br/>-The battle scenes are okay but are far from the saving grace they are made out to be and sometimes just descend into unconvincing CGI with very little logic. At one point the Greeks charge at some Trojans outside the 200ft stone walls despite having no siege equipment and the walls being thick with archers. Hmmm... I have heard of stupidity from generals but this is unrealistic in the extreme. The Greeks do not even surround the city or raid nearby settlements to cut off supplies so they hardly even seem a credible threat to the Trojans. The siege battles are nowhere near as good as the ones in the Two Towers, Return of the King or even Kingdom of Heaven put it that way.<br/><br/>-The soundtrack was adequate even if it was in a different league from the likely benchmark - Gladiator. At least it made the attempt to be different instead of the obvious carbon copy that could have been done.<br/><br/>It was always going to be difficult to film such an epic story in a single film and in some respects Wolfgang Peterson manages to do this with some success as the major facets of the tale are covered even if sometimes inaccurately. The focus on Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom to appeal to the female audience who might otherwise not go and see a 'swords and sandals epic' removes much of the credibility and it is only the other portrayals that save the film from being a total loss. Being a heterosexual male I had no interest in drooling over either nude/partly clad and I felt the whole time I was not among the target audience. A wasted opportunity."
"pixelpusher2001","8","5","11","5 January 2007"," Classical Greek and Roman Mythology
","As a teacher of Classical Greek and Roman Mythology I was looking forward to ""Troy."" In the past I have put together a unit on the Trojan War that included not only Homer's epic poem the ""Iliad,"" but also the plays of Euripides and Aeschylus and other ancient works on the stories of these characters. In other words I am familiar with this story to the extent that when Briseis showed up wearing a garment with long sleeves I was upset that we did not get to see the lovely arms that were part of her usual epithet. So, suffice it to say, that when characters who survived the Trojan War started dying in this film, I was not exactly happy. Consequently, the truth is that the less you know about the Trojan War of classical mythology, the more you will enjoy Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy."" I have no problem with the idea that Homer and the other ancients have to be adapted in making a modern motion picture about the Trojan War. The decision to eliminate the gods is appropriate, getting away from the idea that this was a ten year war makes sense, and if the alliance of the Greeks is now political rather than as part of an oath sworn by the princes who were suitors for Helen's hand, I consider that to be legitimate. I do not understand why Iphigenia, Cassandra, and Hecuba are all eliminated but there are not fatal omissions. But when you start rewriting who gets killed that is going a bit too far, especially when one premature death starts a chain effect that means Athens will never develop the jury system, which means we probably lose out on it too. David Benioff's screenplay was ""inspired"" by Homer's ""Iliad,"" which at least is an honest way to characterize what he did in this script, but I still do not have to like it or endorse it."
"paintbrush_2003","4","5","11","1 June 2004"," zzzzzzzzzzzz...well, at least Brad is Buff

There were only 2 things that kept me from falling asleep during this movie -- the most important was trying not to embarrass my friends who dragged me to see this and the other was a few shots of a nearly naked, buff Brad Pitt.  Really.  That's it.  I know the purpose of these movies are the big, spectacular battle scenes, but come on -- the acting was TERRIBLE. There were WAY too many soap opera moments. The deliveries were positively wooden. And if someone said to Achilles ""You do this so your name with live forever"" ONE MORE TIME, I was going to throw my bucket o' popcorn at the screen.

"NancingPony","1","5","11","27 May 2004"," Troy: They did WHAT to the Classics?!
","Troy was an offensively bad film; even TNT's atrocious Helen of Troy miniseries was better and more accurate.<br/><br/>First, the script. The screenwriter (David Benhioff) was trying very hard to not imitate Gladiator, but the 2000 Best Picture winner must have been a little too prominent in his mind. Some of the lines were extraordinarily similar to ones from Gladiator, extremely silly, or clichéd. Most laughable was when Paris and Helen fantasize about running away and living a quiet life together on a farm. <br/><br/>And there were some incredibly gratuitous moments: when we first meet Achilles, he's naked and sleeping in his tent with two nude women. And every time he entered his tent, he took off his armor and started walking around naked. Really, why?<br/><br/>Furthermore, nearly every single character was extremely flat, a weakness that was amplified by poor acting. <br/><br/>Taking creative liberties is understandable, but holy Hera, there's a limit when it comes to using the story that is the basis of Western literature for your inspiration. For example, the war does not last ten years-more like three weeks. Hector and Andromache's son is a baby at the beginning of the film, and a baby at the end! Among the offensively glaring canon changes are that some characters are killed who shouldn't be: Menelaus is killed by Hector, eliminating Book IV of the Odyssey. Other characters are killed by the wrong people: Agamemnon kills Priam. Oops, there goes Pyrrhus! Without him, Books II and III of the Aeneid don't make sense, nor do several lines in Hamlet. Briseis kills Agamemnon; So much for the King of Kings going home and getting axed by his wife, eliminating the Oresteia! Also unpleasantly astounding is the great number of missing important characters: such prominent Trojan royals such as Hecuba, Cassandra, Deiphobus, and Polyxena aren't even mentioned. Other disgraceful changes: Andromache flees to Mt. Ida with baby Astyanax, and is not led off into slavery by Pyrrhus. Bah, we don't need no stinkin' Trojan Women. In addition, neither Cassandra nor Laocoon warns about the wooden horse; Paris actually quietly suggests burning it. Achilles survives up to the fall of Troy, and is actually one of the men coming out of the horse! Finally, with Menelaus dead, Paris and Helen are free to flee to Mt. Ida during the fall of Troy to presumably build the previously mentioned farm.<br/><br/>The really bizarre thing about the script was that despite the listed inaccuracies, there were several things that only those well-read in the Classics would understand: at the end of the film, when several Trojans are fleeing to Mt. Ida, Paris stops a teenage boy who is helping a limping old man to flee. Paris asks the boy what his name is, and he says 'Aeneas.' Paris then hands him the made-one has read the Aeneid, this reference would be lost. Never mind the actor playing Aeneas is too young to be married to the eldest daughter of Priam and have a son. After all, do you really need Ascanius to rule Alba Longa for thirty years? Nah.<br/><br/>There is a rumor that Gladiator's Ridley Scott was the first choice to direct this film, and Wolfgang Peterson was third string. Just comparing the two directors' fight sequences, it's easy to see why: there was a little too much panorama; the armies looked small and scattered. One really didn't get the feeling of how down-and-dirty Bronze Age war was; men would be so close to each other, they could barely move.<br/><br/>Random irritating fact number #96: Menelaus was pronounced 'Meneh-louse.'<br/><br/>The celebration around the wooden horse is nothing short of hysterical. Of course, the Trojan women are doing a grapevine step, which was also in the Crayola Kids Adventures: The Trojan Horse. Enough said. And of course, there was a random guy doing back flips-and the mob even made space for him. Ah, movie cliché #987. The film's score was abysmal. Apparently, Peterson rejected the score that Cold Mountain's Gabriel Yared took a year to compose, and instead asked James Horner to write him one in three months. One could often recognize half the scene-inappropriate music as being from other films. There were some good things about this movie. It was somewhat well-cut together-it didn't feel like a long three-hour film. Furthermore, the fall of Troy was generally well done; one felt close to the realistic action.<br/><br/>The casting director for this film should be blacklisted. It was an awful idea to cast Brad Pitt as Achilles. He was handed the only character that was scripted to possibly have any depth, but his performance was entirely wooden, and he poor delivered the already-awful lines. Newcomer Diane Kruger as Helen was a boring, uninspired performance. She's pretty, but not beautiful to be the Face that Launched a Thousand Ships, and was easily outshone by Saffron Burrows and Rose Byrne. Although Orlando Bloom is generally a bad actor, he was perfectly cast for the role of Paris: he didn't act, he was simply playing himself. Peter O'Toole as Priam was amazing. His reaction to seeing his first-born son being slain and then his body defiledhis futilely running through burning Troy with a sword in hand, gazing upon all the things he's built being destroyed, and his bargaining with Achilles for Hector's body was incredibly powerful. The film was sprinkled with other great performances, such as Eric Bana as Hector, Brian Cox as Agamemnon, Saffron Burrows as Andromache, and Julie Christie in her two-minute stint as Achilles' mother Thetis, and Sean Bean who was Odysseus.<br/><br/>The sets were especially spectacular, and the biggest-and one of the only-problem with the costumes was the use of IRON armor in the BRONZE AGE, and some overzealous tie-dyeing of other costumes.<br/><br/>There are films that are enjoyable to watch, films that are insanely boring, and films that are so bad that they're fun to watch. In general, on an absolute value scale of -10 to 10, this film gets a -7. It's like watching a train wreck: you stare in fascinated revulsion. There are elements of the film that could be better in every department, and improvement in any of these categories would have grossly improved the film. It is truly depressing to realize that those who are not read in the Classics will take this movie as fact."
"chatfan","1","5","11","16 May 2004"," Troy: The Sufer dude and the Sun god
","For sure dude this Troy movie is radical!<br/><br/>They say nobody made a movie about Troy because it was too expensive, they also claim it is the computer technology that made it possible. Shame, they could have claimed it's the perfect script or divine inspiration they where really waiting for. But like most blockbusters it's the technology that made it happen, not any artistic point of view.<br/><br/>Homers epic has a thousand echoes in our culture and understanding of people but this movie doesn't capture any of its hidden magic or mystery. Sadly I blame this on one person: Wolfgang Peterson the director, now I have always liked WP's work, Das Boot is a masterpiece, but Troy is nothing more then ""the Bold and the Beautiful to sword and sandals"". A cheap excuse to let surfer dude Brad Pitt pose in cheap skin scenes and have another run of computer fight scenes. Hey it worked for Lord of the Rings man!<br/><br/>The story is very complex and would needs a 6 hours movie to really tell the tale, but they put it into some soapathon format with a lot of cheesy and pretentious scenes which are suppose to give you all the excuses.. sorry I mean clues to fight each other.<br/><br/>The success of gladiator was probably the reason people thought it was a good idea to make a movie like this. But they forget that movie was a success because it had a whole story to tell and a brilliant director who stuck to what he knew and used effects to compliment the story. Troy is just another series of massive fighting scenes where effects are supposed to substitute content.<br/><br/>The first two hours are boring and used to put a series of uninteresting passion-less scenes on top of each other. It feels like the screenplay was written by some kid with no real life experience because it's missing a heart and soul. It's sad to see such a great epic being turned into nothing more then a soapathon. If anything this movie pretty much destroys the legend of Troy and turns it from mythical into a cheap load of clichés.<br/><br/>So how are the actors?<br/><br/>Brad Pitt as Achilles doesn't have the intensity or the looks to be a believable son of the gods. The obvious mannerisms he uses to look broody and complex only make his face look like a trained chimp with no real direction. Considering the fact I have always liked his performances ever since Thelma and Louise, this is a real disappointment.<br/><br/>Eric Bana is pretty good as Hector, he plays an interesting character and makes you believe in him as a prince and man of honor. I'm glad to see the movie industry didn't give up on him after the pretty cool Hulk flop. But even his performance can't really save this movie.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom as Paris is just a nightmare and should have been tarred and feathered for this role. The poor guy was completely out of his depth in this one. You do not believe for one second that two superpowers will go to war over the stupidity of this teenager. There is no life or passion coming out of him, no real desire for Helen. It's just a cheap fling with another mans wife, he is pretty much to scared to strut his stuff, like the character he is playing.<br/><br/>Sean Bean as Odysseus is pretty good but then again he is a proper real actor :P<br/><br/>Peter O'Tool is a bad joke in this movie which is a shame and once again I blame the director. Having the master play it down just so he doesn't run of with the entire movie, which is what he usually does.<br/><br/>Diane Kruger as Helen of troy just looks and acts like just another pinup and not a woman of such beauty and desire she would lead you into battle and the destruction of an entire people.<br/><br/>Brian Cox as Agamemnon is as evil and nasty as always and in his own way perfect. But it does make you wonder, where the Greeks nothing more then a bunch of brute barbarians who looked like they are right out of braveheart?<br/><br/>Rose Byrne is pretty good as Briseis and makes her falling in love with Achilles one of the few believable parts of the movie. Its funny but her scenes with Brad Pitt are the only thing that makes this movie sort of interesting even thought its only for 10 minutes out of 3 hours or so."

","As unbiased I want to be here. It is almost impossible. So I will start with the 3 positives that I got out of this movie and they are:
<ul><li>Brad Pitt is an amazing Achilles.</li><li>Eric Bana is an amazing Hector.</li><li>The Death of Achilles was an amazing way to show how a legend is born (the way he pulled out the arrows and the soldiers found just the one in his heel).</li></ul><br/><br/>And this is it. All the rest is insulting to the Iliad (and not only).One will say that directors are not obliged to stick to the Iliad in order to do a Trojan war movie and they will be right. However, this does not give them right to make out absurd facts and disregard entire trilogy of Greek tragedies. I am sorry but:
<ul><li>Hector does not kill them all.</li><li>Menelaus does not die during the Trojan War</li><li>Agamemnon is not killed by Briseis (This was a total disgrace to Oresteia. Unacceptable!)</li><li>Agamemnon is NOT a villain (Please do not try to judge him using the current modern value system. Agamemnon is the king of kings. He is the mighty king who is proud , selfish and unwilling to compromise and this makes him a bearer of the traits of the mighty kings at THAT time. It doesn't mean that he is a villain. Seriously if you think that - try to judge Achilles through current moral value system. He cries to his mother over a slave, gets unfair armor crafted by a God and then kills a mortal man in an unfair fight being helped by a God only to gloat over it and drag his body in front of his wife and family? How come he can ever be a positive character? Ridiculous, right?)</li><li>Aeneas was simply LOL. What did they want to show? He was the second strongest Trojan out there. He wasn't some unknown kid who just retreated from the burning city.</li></ul><br/><br/>So this will be my review. Bottom line is that:
1/ If you haven't read the Iliad you might be satisfied but you are risking to be BADLY misinformed on what and how has happened. This aside, the movie will be entertaining. I give it that fully.
2/ In case you have read the Iliad and you actually like it - PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM."

","I think people really trash this movie because it doesn't follow the source material to a T. The movie treats the gods in a more realistic sense: maybe they are out there manipulating behind the forces...maybe they aren't. Who knows? All the movie does know is that this is a tale of war and greed and reverence. It isn't about Helen or true love. Aggamanmeon only wants Troy to join under his kingdom and using his brother's unfaithful wife is a good enough excuse for him to declare war and finally get them to bend, Achilles wants fame and recogition but gets side trapped by a woman which ends up being his ""Achille's heel"", Hector just wants to have his family and be a good king to his people but ends up losing his life to war instead, and Paris just wanted a beautiful woman but ended up causing a war and finally growing a pair instead. <br/><br/>I don't know if I'm crazy for writing that this film has some of the best dialogue, but it does. So many quotable moments. And it is so well acted.<br/><br/>Most notably by Brad Pitt as Achilles, Eric Bana as Hector, Peter O'Toole as Priam, Brian Cox as Aggamanmeon, and Sean Bean as Odyessus.<br/><br/>This film may not be 100% accurate, but it is a great film and a great take on the Troy story.<br/><br/>I definitely think as years go on that this film will hold up, ans maybe even be considered a great by either the masses or just by those who realize what a gem it is."

","I just love epic historical films, and after Gladiator reinvigorated the genre, there was a surge in this kind of films, which made me really happy.<br/><br/>I had doubts about Wolfgang Petersen's ability to bring such a grand-scale story to the screen, but he utterly surpassed himself here. Strangely, when I first saw Troy in the movie theatre, I wasn't really blown away. I liked the de-deified, 'this is how it really could have happened' human angle, as well as the great performances (Brad Pitt and Eric Bana really shine here, and Peter O'Toole is outstanding, as always), and the top-notch visuals, but it was only after repeated viewings that I realised: I really love this movie.<br/><br/>It is deeply moving and meaningful, tackling questions like 'What is our purpose in life?', 'Where does true dignity come from?' or 'What makes one truly immortal?'. It is very well-paced, visually gorgeous and exciting from start to finish. It has a haunting, very memorable score by James Horner. And most of all, it is endlessly rewatchable. For me, that's the sign of a true classic."
"thedriver829","8","2","3","2 December 2014"," A Flawed But Entertaining Epic
","I've never really understood the immense hatred that Troy received. Even in a year where we had failed epics like King Arthur and the atrocious ""Alexander,"" people still considered this to be a terrible attempt at adapting Homer's The Iliad. While I certainly agree that the movie could have fixed a few things, I can't help but have a lot of fun every time I watch this.<br/><br/>The biggest thing I loved about this movie was that it felt like a tribute to the epic sword and sandals movies of the 50s and 60s. Everything from the sets, costume design, and even the running time of the movie screams epic. There are incredible battle sequences that never seize to amaze, and Brad Pitt does a good job playing the almost invincible hero Achilles. Even when the movie was at its downtime, I was still invested in its characters and story.<br/><br/>The actors all do an excellent job. As I mentioned, Brad Pitt does a very good job, and definitely fills the presence of an unstoppable fighter. Eric Bana does a great job as Hector, and Peter O'Toole almost steals the show as King Priam, for the little bit that he is in the movie. I also really liked the performances of Rose Byrne as Bruseis and Sean Bean as Odysseus.<br/><br/>And like I said, everything technical about this movie is stunning. The sets, particular those set in Troy, are beautiful to look at, and you can definitely see the attention to detail there as well as in the costume and weapon design. The musical score by James Horner is pretty good, though it can feel a little too bombastic at times (there is a loud female shout every once and a while). And the action sequences are perfectly choreographed and entertaining on many levels.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we do have to touch on where the movie gets it wrong, and largely it seems to stumble when it comes to its dialogue. A lot of the dialogue here does come off a little clichéd and cheesy, and some of the actors aren't able to live up to their co-stars. Orlando Bloom, for example, seems like he is struggling to show himself as intimate and a boy in love, which may be because of how he's gain this persona as a elf warrior badass from Lord Of The Rings. Diane Kruger is a little stale as Helen, and sometimes Brian Cox feels a little over the top in his acting. Some of the death scenes also come off a little awkward, particularly the aftermath of Paris and Menelaus' one on one battle.<br/><br/>Still, while these flaws are prevalent, Troy still is able to succeed due to its attention to artistic detail, entertaining action sequences, and solid actors whose characters we can connect with and enjoy watching. As far as epics go, this one isn't among the Bravehearts and Ben-Hurs of the world, but it still is better than a lot of the more recent epic action films we've seen as of late. I recommend checking this one out."

","One of the greatest movies I've seen made over history. The violence is much like Gladiator but it should have a rating of at least 8.0 or at least 7.5 or above. This movie contains almost everything - conspiracies, blasphemy, romance, violence, sex and everything that a movie should have. Hector (Eric Bana) displayed awesome acting while Brad Pitt, named Achilles, whose character is shown to be selfish but he is indeed a majestic soldier, having the ability to win battles for his side.

He has self-esteem and that's the reason why the King of Greek Brian Cox hates him. <br/><br/>Greek and Sparta have made peace - Hector the prince and his father, who are from the side of Sparta, aka Troy, have made peace with Menelaus, the brother of King of Greek Agamemnon (Brian Cox). But Hector's brother, who is known to be bedding wives of merchants loves Menelaus' wife, Helen and takes her home with him to Troy without the knowledge of Menelaus. Menelaus becomes infuriated and determines to avenge this loss of dignity as for him. He concerns his brother Agamemnon and they both take a 1000 ships to battle with Troy, which looked to be the greatest ever war in the history. They go on and battle with Troy with 50,000 of Greek soldiers and a 10-year siege continues just because of the romance of prince Paris, the brother of Hector."
"saytosandeep","9","2","3","18 April 2014"," MY REVIEW: War of All Times!!
","Troy. If once I do not delve into how correct was the movie, this is one of my favourite war movie. Troy scores by a distance on visuals of ruthless and massive war and over the portrayal of great warriors like Achilles and Hector played by almost equal charisma of Brad Pitt and Eric Bana respectively. I can watch the combat scene between Achilles and Hector a hundred times without blinking my eyes. The mutual respect that great warriors show to each other forms the soul of the movie. Orlando Bloom depicting the weakest character in the movie falls flat and is the only weak spot in otherwise strong casting. Even after being more than three hours long, movie never seems to be running out of steam. It gets better in second half before shattering your hearts in the climax. Troy is one of those massive film making done without use of CGI. The cinematography, photography, costume design, set design, everything is first rate. I am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for Troy. Despite its flaws, it is one of the finest war drama shown on celluloid."
"Prometheus4096","4","2","3","1 February 2014"," The movie Troy fails to capture the essential theme of Homer's Iliad
","Why tell this story? To have Brat Pitt look cool as one of the most famous heroes? To show off that now we do have the CGI technology to depict large scale battles? Or can there be some other reason to tell this story?<br/><br/>For the last 3000 years every educated man in the western world learned the Iliad. This may be the first generation that does not know and understand the Iliad and it's themes. The movie 'Troy' does not in the slightest try to make up for this.<br/><br/>The most blatant omission are the gods. It seems the writers of the script made the fatal mistake into thinking that the gods in the Iliad are merely allegorical. But the story of the Iliad is about how mortals are at the whim of the immortals. The paradox in the Iliad, where a skilled fighter is skilled because the gods help him and the gods help fighters that are skilled, is ignored. <br/><br/>The biggest problem this creates is in the scene were Paris fights Menelaus. In the movie Hector interferes in the duel and kills a defenseless Menelaus, who did not expect Hector to cheat (the gods punish cheaters, but hey they don't exist in the movie, remember). In the Iliad, Hector is held up as a paragon of virtue and depicted as a honourable man. This move by Hector explains how Paris survives the duel and how the fighting starts again without Aphrodite teleporting Paris to Helen's bedchamber. <br/><br/>The only scene out of place here is Achilles with his mother. His mother is a mere mortal, but she can tell him of his fate?<br/><br/>The most important part of the Iliad is Achilles and his anger, his mortality, and his decision. This is actually depicted in the movie. But it is done so in a way that doesn't work.<br/><br/>The book has a lot of dialogue and a lot of scenes that do not appear in the movie. Usually when Hollywood puts a book into a movie, it is different. Lots of scenes are ignored and lots of filler fighting scenes are added; to speed up the story. But this movie slows down the plot by adding meaningless filler dialogue scenes. Often they are very bad and make no sense. Where is the scene where Achilles is offered everything Agamemnon has, but refuses.<br/><br/>The whole thing with Briseis makes no sense. She is taken, then given to men to rape, and Achilles gets her back for free. Why? To be able to inject a romance scene for the girls, and an erotic scene for the boys? But then Achilles wants to go home anyway (because Menelaus is dead so getting Helen makes no sense?, so no reason to fight on?). Really? They decided to kill of Menelaus, filmed the scene, then figured out only much later that with Menelaus dead, there is no point in fighting onward? I can't believe they had to have Menelaus killed to give Achilles a new reason not to fight.<br/><br/>Hector is made a foil to the Greeks because he killed Menelaus, not because he singlehandedly wins the war (because that is what Zeus wills). Takes away a lot.<br/><br/>Then, Patroclus sneaks out in secret. Why? They are leaving anyway. He is not send out by Achilles. So Patroclus defies and betrays Achilles. This takes away from Achilles decision to be angry with himself. In the Iliad he blames himself and that is partly why he wants to fight Hector.<br/><br/>There are two characters in the Iliad the narrator wants you to feel connected with; Menelaus and Patroclus. One is killed off, the other is portrayed like a silly boy with no sense that betrays Achilles. Patroclus was older than Achilles. But in the movie he is portrayed backwards. Younger and even more foolish.<br/><br/>After the death of Patroclus, there is no scene of Achilles rejecting life. In the Iliad before he fights his final battles (and he doesn't die in the Iliad), he is reminded several times of his fate. Homer even has his horse gain the ability to speak, a silly scene in the Iliad, just to remind the reader once more and hammer down this point. A silly scene but put in to have a stronger thematic effect. And Achilles repeats it himself several times and unlike others like Lycaon, who cannot accept death and begs Achilles, who has already accepted his own death, for his life. No such scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>In fact, there is no scene where a dying person speaks his last words. No Hector mocking Patroclus with Patroclus responding. No Hector final words. Even the scene before Hector and Achilles fight has no dialogue from the actual story. Why? Is what they made up better? No scene of Achilles on his immortal rampage at all, routing the Troyan army all on his own. Why? They wanted an anticlimax instead of a climax for this movie? <br/><br/>In the book Hector is given a reason to fight Achilles. He knows he is the lesser fighter. But he is dishounored because he did not follow Polydamas's advice and he has a tiny bit of a hope Zeus, who favoured him for a long time, still favours him. In the movie he just fights. No reason given. Only the pact over the body that is not made is there.<br/><br/>They take off helmets, because you need to see faces, and then the silly Hollywood battle, with all those moves that make no sense. But for what it is, this movie does it pretty good. <br/><br/>So all thematic effect is lost. What is this movie about? All good dialogue ignored and replaced with silly Hollywood stuff. Makes no sense. The people who created this believe their audience to be idiots or were idiots themselves. No other way for me to explain it."

Couldn't hate Helen though, because she's just too beautiful. Even though I hate how our society values physically attractive men & women more... Loved that it was mostly accurate. Enjoyed learning that Trojans got beat by the Greeks/Spartans through a wise ruse with the wooden horse(take that USC). And it's always great to see people you just found out about in older movies, like Patroclus is the Sam Flynn from Tron: Legacy. Now that I think about it, I didn't know Orlando Bloom until I saw Lord of the Rings. Really great story, great characters and acting. Got me all riled up emotionally and there's very few movies these days (2013) that can do that to an audience.

"ariaarash58","10","2","3","17 November 2013"," best epic movie ever
","This is a film based on the epic poem The Iliad by Homer. It is in modern styles. And the director has wisely removed the gods and immortality in the film. The most important reason that made me to give this film 10 is the wonderful acting by brad pitt and great writing by David Benioff. The movie start with a great battle between Nestor and Agamemnon that the tow of them agree to a single combat. and Achilles of course wins and Nestor becomes one of Agamemnon's allies. Agamemnon's brother is always trying to make peace with troy till Paris younger son of Priam fall in love with Helen and stole her. And then he goes to his brother and ask him to attack to troy. Agamemnon gather all his force and attacks to troy. Achilles and his men take the beach easily. And then he meets Hector, and he won't fight him in that time. Achilles falls in love with Briseis a captive from troy. Agamemnon take her from Achilles.so Achilles won't fight for Agamemnon anymore and plan to return home Agamemnon fails to conquer troy. and his brother and thousand of his men dies. The Trojans invade the Greek army in the night and there is battle between Hector and Patroclus. And Hector thought that he is Achilles. And he kills Patroclus. After Achilles knew about this he goes to take his revenge. And there is a great battle between them. In pas 10 years I have watched this movie more than 20 times and every time I enjoy it more. especially after seen some terrible movie in this genre in few past years. Such as percy jacson. Everything in this movie is great most of it the acting.  Wolfgang Petersen has made one of his best movie. and brad pitt has showed that he can play in any role and any genres.

"stephanieh7977","Null","2","3","31 August 2011"," Great movie that mixes ancient story line with modern touches
","The movie Troy, directed by Wolfgang Peterson, presents the history of the Trojan War in a unique way that it captured a modern audience and still remained true to many facts laid out in Homer's tale of The Iliad. The vast majority of the characters were the same and they held the same characterization depicted by Homer: Achilles was is arrogant, Agamemnon is a cruel leader, Helen is passive, Hector is a great warrior, etc. The movie follows the same ancient time lime of events. It began with Paris and Helen falling in love and sneaking Helen off to Troy. The Greek army, led by Agamemnon, went to war with Troy in order to over throw the city and claim Helen. There were many hand to hand combat battles on the outsides of Troy's walls similar to The Iliad. Agamemnon and Achilles fought over a captured woman, resulting in Achilles refusing to fight in these battles and Patroclaus taking his place, leading to Patroclaus' death at the hands of Hector. It ended with the Greek army building a Trojan horse, tricking the Trojans, and over throwing their entire civilization and burning it to the ground. <br/><br/>Despite all of these similarities to the framework of the story, the film also took many liberties with the story in order to relate modern viewers. In ancient times, gods and goddesses were a huge part of society and believed to be very real and very influencing. The Iliad is full of godly intervention, action, dialogue, and purpose. However, Troy almost completely ignores this aspect of the story. These ancient gods and goddesses are not relevant in our time period; most viewers cannot relate to them or even know much about them. The only real mention of any gods in Troy is with Apollo. The city of Troy is shown as worshipping Apollo in a significant way with temples, statues, priests and priestesses. Breisis is captured from Apollo's temple after it was damaged by the Greek soldiers and speaks of how the wrath of Apollo with surely soon be upon them and that they gods are something to be feared and not mocked. This is the only significant portion of the film that deals with the gods. There are other vague references to ""the wrath of the gods"", fear of them, or about Achilles' mother being a goddess; however, these portions of the film are given no importance. The film makers also added extra scenes for dramatic effect. For instance, the very beginning of the movie is a scene where Achilles is to fight the biggest warrior of all, Boagrius, and he wins. This scene is mostly for dramatic effect to initially capture the attention of the audience. It also helps with Achilles' characterization of an amazing and skilled warrior. This scene is similar to the scene where Hector slays Menelaus after Paris refuses to fight him. This isn't the correct version relating to The Iliad, but it was also done for dramatic effect and characterization of Hector as a loyal and loving man to his family, as well as a great warrior for Troy. Overall, the movie Troy did a great job at keeping to a correct framework for the events of the Trojan War. Most of the changes in the story were done for ideal purposes that helped further along Homer's view of the characters or to capitalize on modern viewers' need for dramatic action."
"pw9990","2","2","3","17 July 2011"," Troy - The Hollywood fable
","Once again Hollywood has made a fairly entertaining movie but deviates so far from the real story it can hardly be called Troy. First Helen was more than likely abducted from Sparta and she left a 9 year old daughter there. She considered Paris a total coward and had relations with Paris' brother. After Paris's death, his brother Deiphobus married Helen until he was killed mercilessly by Menelaus when he invaded Troy to take back Helen. King Menelaus of Sparta was not killed by Hector and survived the war and returned to Sparta. There are many more deviations from the real story but I guess you can interpret as you see fit to sell more DVD's.<br/><br/>The scenery shots and battle scenes were very well done, as was the rest of the movie for that matter.

"splizzat","10","2","3","26 May 2004"," A Fun Way to Kick Off the Summer -- SOME SPOILERS!
","When I first saw the trailer, I was skeptical at best. All I knew was that it was based on Homer's The Illiad, and that the trailer gave the impression that it was going to take a butcher knife to that beautiful epic, leaving it deformed and a far cry from its former self. As time went on, there were posters and trailers for this movie everywhere I went, seeing as it was going to be THE movie to kick off the summer blockbuster season. I relented and did a little research on it. <br/><br/>It came to my attention that the team behind Troy was openly saying that this wasn't going to be a film version of The Illiad, and was in fact going to be ""inspired"" by the epic, in addition to drawing on other sources for plot. It was a roundabout way of saying that it was going to take the characters and Hollywood-ize the storyline to make Troy. I gave them snaps for saying that, and was more open to the idea of seeing it. I ended up seeing it opening weekend.<br/><br/>I liked it.<br/><br/>The film is centered around Helen fleeing to Troy to be with her love, Paris (a prince of Troy). Her husband Menelaus, King of Sparta then decides to wage war against Troy. He calls upon his brother, Agammemnon, commander of all the armies of Greece, to stand beside him in this war. Seeing this as an opportunity to expand his power, in addition to defending his brother's honor, he agrees. Much bloodshed and crying ensues. Throw in a subplot with Achilles, whose disdain for Agammemnon's power-lust and lack of honor, and an honorable Hector trying to do the right thing, and you have the makings of Troy. <br/><br/>A key choice that was made in this film was not to include the gods as characters, and to make everyone 100% mortal. I think it was a wise choice for two reasons. First, there are enough characters in the story already. There is no way you could have introduced anyone else and have it add anything to the story. Secondly, I think by humanizing the story it made it more accessible. One line in the movie (said by Achilles) says something along the lines of the gods envy mortals, because we are mortal. Everything we do is all the more beautiful ""because we are doomed"". Indirectly, it is very true for this story. The lack of the divine in this movie makes the movie more emotional and beautiful.<br/><br/>The casting (albeit containing a few flaws) was rather impressive. Peter O'Toole, onboard as Priam, lent a weight to the film that reminded of you in some scenes of the old classics like Cleopatra and Spartacus. Eric Bana (Hector, Prince of Troy) was definitely the shocker of the film for me. I was very impressed with his performance, and I thought he was a definite standout. Orlando Bloom was not bad in any sense, but not fantastic. He might have been more of a victim of the cheeseball writing, because he did have quite a few moments. He seems like an actor who has the potential to really go somewhere and ""bloom"", as it were. Diane Kruger (Helen) didn't really bother me. She wasn't particularly impressive. While she was ""the face that launched a thousand ships"" this was a movie focusing on the males.<br/><br/>The women weren't completely in the background, but they were most definitely not in the foreground either, so it didn't really bother me that she struck me as rather vapid at times. I will get to Brad Pitt in a moment.<br/><br/>The movie definitely lived up to the blockbuster standard of sweeping cinematography, lavish sets, ridiculously intricate costumes and the like. No complaints there.<br/><br/>Here are my few gripes with the movie. First, I think Brad Pitt was miscast. He definitely looks like an Achilles. For some reason, he just didn't.. fit. It wasn't a lack of talent, considering he's been in a number of movies where he really does shine. It seemed like every time he opened his mouth, I cringed. It didn't work. It could have been the writing, but not totally. It was an ensemble piece and he was out of place. In the end he was ""Brad Pitt as Achilles"", he was not Achilles, whereas everyone else WAS their character through and through. There was no way I could suspend my disbelief to accept him as just Achilles. <br/><br/>I have touched on this a few times already, but the writing in some places was extremely.. lacking. I found myself rolling my eyes and chuckling at a couple points throughout the movie, when comedy was not the desired effect. The writers tried to make the characters a lot more ""grand"" and well-spoken.<br/><br/>I understand it's an epic, dealing with legends that have spanned the ages, but they were trying to make a human story, and normal people do not spew forth poetry every time they open their mouths. <br/><br/>Lastly, the character development was lacking in places, but unless the movie was ten hours long, there is no way they could have done each character justice.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this movie? Yes, I would. I thought it was a great way to kick off the summer. It had its downfalls, but whatever. If you look at the movie for what they wanted it to be--a larger than life Hollywood epic blockbuster--it was wonderful. It was fun. It was action-packed. It had a dash of romance, a teaspoon of betrayal, and pinch of everything else. It isn't a Ben Hur, or a Spartacus, or a Gladiator, but it isn't trying to be. If you go into the movie understanding that, you will enjoy it. <br/><br/>3 1/2 STARS out of a possible FIVE STARS."
"clydestuff","5","2","3","16 May 2004"," Silly script proves to be Troy's Achilles Heel
","There was one particular school year some time ago, that I distinctly remember that I was supposed to study Homer's Iliad. I may or may not have read through no more than a couple of paragraphs before putting it down probably to watch some Television show which held infinitely more interest for me than a story on why the Greeks and Trojans were at each other's throats over a thousand years ago. As I write this review, I can almost hear Dan Ackroyd telling me as he did Bill Murry in Ghostbuster's that I never studied. Shameful as it is, I didn't. If I had I doubted it would have added or taken away from how I view Wolfgang Petersen's and Warner Brother's $185 million dollar extravaganza.<br/><br/>What I do know about the story, I probably remember from watching Jeopardy one too many times, and what I have now learned from Director Petersen and Writer David Benioff. There's this chick Helen (Diane Kruger), who is supposed to be the Queen of Sparta. While visiting Sparta to talk peace, a young Trojan Prince named Paris (Orlando Bloom)let's his libido get the better of him and decides to get it on with the Queen. Deciding that Helen would be better off being a fixture in his bedroom than that of her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), Paris decides to give Helen a one way Love Boat trip back to Troy and although Paris's brother Hector (Eric Bana) sees the folly in stealing another man's wife, he goes along with his brother because well, he's his brother. This doesn't sit too kindly with Menelaus, so he makes an alliance with King Agamemnon (Brian Cox)to go to battle with Troy so he can reclaim his beloved with the sole purpose of removing Helen's head from the rest of her body parts. Then there's Achilles (Brad Pitt) who is supposed to be the greatest warrior around, sort of a Superman in armor carrying a sword. Trouble is, Achilles likes killing, but not for Agamemnon. He decides eventually to go along anyway because he has this vision that one day he will be remembered for the great warrior he was so that people like Petersen will make a multi-million dollar epic and people like me and other IMDB critics with visions of grandeur will be sitting here writing a review that nobody will read.<br/><br/>For those of who have studied The Iliad, I'm sure that my simplistic synopsis of the story will offend them, but this is the story Petersen gives us. He spends little time explaining the intricacies of why Hector and Paris are talking peace with Sparta, but gives us a silly scene in Helen's bedroom between her and Paris before whisking us away to Troy. We have no clue as to how the relationship developed, and Helen comes off as nothing more than being a pin-up girl for the city of Troy and Paris's infatuation with her plays like a high school freshman's crush on the Senior prom queen.<br/><br/>Of course, when you're in a hurry to get to the blood and guts glory of the historic battles, punctuated by numerous sweeping CGI shots of thousands of Greek ships and soldiers lining the gates of Troy, one can almost forgive the early part of the film since it's the battle scenes that will be counted on to put fannies into the theater seats. It may have helped if Bloom's Paris had the least bit of personality or passion, but it seems his goody two shoes pirate act last summer was no act at all. This may be the best he has to offer and one can only hope for better things. Bana's Hector is much better and far more interesting. One can sense the loyalty he feels toward his country, his father King Priam (Peter O'Toole), and even his insipid little brother. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt's Achilles is almost as bad as Bloom's Paris. For a great warrior, Pitt plays him as nothing more than a gladiator with deep psychological torments. I almost expected Benioff to write a scene in here for Tony Soprano's psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi. And there lies most of the problem with Troy, especially during the first half of the film. Much of it plays like the dialog was written from an old Cecil B. DeMille crib sheet stolen from his biblical epics. I don't think I've heard dialog this silly since Ross Hunter gave us Lana Turner in Madame X. At least twice I almost chuckled out loud, but had to stifle it as the rest of the audience I viewed the film with seemed to be highly engrossed in what was going on. Fortunately, once the battles do begin, they elevate the film to a certain degree. I would go so far as to call the last hour engrossing-well almost.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are terrific when they are focusing on the close ups of man to man sword play. The long sweeping CGI scenes of huge fleets of ships and thousands of warriors aren't nearly as impressive. There are way too many of these special effects showboating scenes, and if you look toward the back of the shots, the effects are quite obvious. Even the battle scenes are not beyond being marred by one or two goofy moments. During one scene in particular after Hector has dispatched a certain soldier he has fought with and everyone is standing around as if it was Rocky vs. Apollo Creed, instead of the soldiers continuing the battle Hector says something to the effect, ""That's enough fighting for today, see you in the morning."" If only modern warfare was so diplomatic.<br/><br/>There are two actors who shine above all others in the film. Peter O'Toole has a couple of great scenes, and in one so overshadows Brad Pitt that it only punctuates Pitt's limited abilities. The other is an actress named Rose Byrne as temple virgin Briseis. She is remarkable, and brings much needed spark to the movie in every scene she plays and since many of those scenes are with Pitt's tormented Achilles, one can see how welcome that might be. She could certainly have taught Helen a thing or two. <br/><br/>If you manage to make it through the first half of Troy, you'll probably get at least some of your money's worth in the second half even as flawed as it is. And if it takes the second half of a film for me to get anything close to my money's worth I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Troy is a C-. And Dan, next time I will study."
"oshram-3","10","2","3","15 May 2004"," A masterful telling of an epic story
","Troy (2004)<br/><br/>I had been keenly anticipating this movie since I saw the trailer last fall and watched the fleet of a thousand ships sailing over the Aegean. In all fairness, The Iliad is my favorite book (well, that and Paradise Lost, depending upon when you ask me), so I would have been interested in any decent-looking attempt to film it. Seeing that Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot) would be helming it and liking what I saw of the cast, I went into Troy with high hopes.<br/><br/>Troy is an epic and makes no bones about it. While there is effort and detail put into the characters, the scope's the thing, and retelling the greatest war story ever told demands no less. There really are a thousand ships in Agamemnon's fleet; the Greek army stretches to the horizon; Troy herself is a splendid ancient metropolis; and there is much talk of immortality, of the motivations of mankind, nobility, and honor. Troy takes itself seriously, but that's not always a bad thing, and necessary when you're trying to make a real movie as opposed to a mindless action piece.<br/><br/>The only thing I'll say about the plot (one of the most well-known in the world) is that Petersen and screenplay writer David Benioff stick fairly close to the spirit of the book, even if they vary in some of the details (all appearances of the gods - and there are many in Homer's work - have been excised, as have any references to homosexuality). Some character details have been changed and some characters who survived the war in the book die here and vice versa, but much like John Boorman's Excalibur, this film succeeds marvelously at capturing the essence of its source material.<br/><br/>Most of the casting is excellent. Peter O'Toole's Priam is very effective; his nobility and regal bearing win us over at once. Likewise, Eric Bana's Hector is more appealing than in the book; Hector is the real hero of the Trojan side here, but he has been humanized, and he comes off as almost regretting that he such a skilled warrior. Orlando Bloom does a capable job as Paris; personally I have always intensely detested Paris as a character, because he's such a pathetic weakling, but Bloom does his best in trying to imbue Paris with some sort of backbone (he's still weak next to Hector, though). And Diane Kruger's Helen, while she has only limited screen time, is suitably regretful and beautiful; she resembles a prettier, younger Sharon Stone, so you can understand why Menelaus is so ticked off when she leaves.<br/><br/>Benioff took more liberties with the Greeks; Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson, probably best known for being William Wallace's best pal in Braveheart), comes off as kind of a clod, and Agamemnon has been transformed from the proud king of kings into a megalomaniacal George W. Bush, a leader hell-bent on war at any cost who wants to transform the world in his image. Odysseus, another Homeric character I've always loathed, is actually excellent here; Sean Bean plays him as an intelligent, clever warrior rather than as the trickster/rascal he is in the book. And of course, the lion's share of the Greek story is given over to Achilles (Brad Pitt). I was very pleasantly surprised that Achilles' selfish ego was carried over into the movie, and his angry edge is retained. Though he is given a little bit of nobility toward the end, Achilles is not all that far from his literary counterpart, save that he is a little deeper of a thinker.<br/><br/>But how Pitt brings him to life elevates this film. Everyone turns in strong performances, and with exceptional costuming and settings, the story really comes to life. But watching Pitt's Achilles here is like watching Michael Jordan play basketball in his prime; no matter how good the other actor is, Pitt is just better. Pitt shines in the quieter moments as well as in the action sequences. The fighting style they give him is so unique and so flowing that watching him butcher the Trojans is like watching a well-choreographed dance number; in an extraordinary sequence somewhat inspired by the Normandy landing in Private Ryan, Achilles and his Myrmidons storm the Trojan beach and capture the temple of Apollo. It's violent, but also masterfully shot and realized. Likewise the duel between Achilles and Hector is brilliant, well played, showcasing not only some sharp fighting but managing to reflect the emotions of the combatants. And that goes for the rest of the film - the various ways in which the characters do battle are representative of their motivations and attitudes. Agamemnon pushes his troops to take everything at once; Hector balances offense and defense; Odysseus plots his strategy carefully; and Achilles' attacks are quick, clean, and deadly.<br/><br/>It's hard to label a movie a masterpiece a day after it's been released, having only seen it once, but I wouldn't call that a stretch here. Never has this epic story been brought to life so vividly, with such strong characterization. The events spring from character, like any great plot (and even more so here than in Homer), and the eventual fate of almost every character is completely fitting with that individual's outlook on the world. Objectively, I had no qualms with the film at all; it's almost a perfectly realized version of The Iliad. Subjectively I differed with a few of the twists on the novel, but then I'm vehemently anti-Trojan, and I always have been. Most people familiar with The Iliad won't have any problems with the alterations, unless they are uber-purists. Unlike another recent film based upon an epic work, the changes here do not affect the spirit of the story at all.<br/><br/>Troy is a terrific film, one that demands to be experienced on a large screen. It is magnificent from beginning to end, and even though it clocks in at a little over two and a half hours, it just flies by. This movie could have been four hours and I wouldn't have minded. The only downside I can see to Troy is that now the bar has been raised very high for every film coming out the rest of the year. Certainly the other blockbusters this summer now have a lot to live up to. But I would certainly urge anyone with even the slightest interest to catch this one on the big screen, so it can really be appreciated."
"kejwilson","10","2","3","15 May 2004"," Editing Flaws
","I think the movie was entertaining and I'll leave it at that storywise. Editing wise I felt that some of the shots and editing decisions were a little rough. The slow motion scenes were choppy as if they extended a shot digitally, and the horrible horrible zooms shots (few and far between) like when Sean Bean comes to convince Brad to fight for the Greeks during a lesson w his cousin. The camera zooms into Sean Bean. I mean come on just cut and leave those shots in the 70's where they belong."
"claudelalande","1","8","21","10 July 2005"," Homophobic Trash
","The acting is awful, especially Brad Pitt who just postures around. The special effects do not save this movie. The worst insult, though, in this day and age, the beginning of the 21st century, is the perversion of facts through sheer homophobia. Achilles is drawn back into fighting because Hector killed Patroclus. Patroclus was his lover, not his ""cousin"", as it is repeated every time the character is mentioned. I could understand that a 1950's epic would somewhat obscure the fact that Achilles was gay or bisexual. Nowadays, it is unacceptable. It is not glossed over, but the lie is reinforced at every opportunity, which makes me believe it is not puritanism, but open homophobia. There are other historical inaccuracies, as in many movies, introduced for dramatic purposes. This doesn't hold water here: wouldn't it be more dramatic if Achilles returned to fighting to avenge his lover, not his ""cousin""?"
"alesmadro","1","10","28","30 May 2005"," unbearable meatloaf
","Troy is a meatloaf: you take some rests of cold beef, etc., you mixed everything and voilá: an unbearable stuff you scarcely can swallow - surely not enjoy. Even if we let beside the fact that the movie has only slightly to do with Homer (and I do not refer just to the plot: it's the epic which is missing, and no special effects or computerized armies could make this even), the movie is highly implausible. It makes ancient Greeks thinking, speaking and acting as if they were contemporary Americans. You could think of it as a SciFi-movie and imagine they are all on some planet far far away, instead of in ancient Troy, and it will still work (or better: NOT work). It is really a sort of Hi-Tech Hercules: the same ignorance (did they even think of making some serious research on the topic, or did they only watched some bad Italian Maciste movie from the 60s?), the same dull dialogs, the same bad acting (with some exceptions: Sean Bean, Peter O'Toole and few others). It is just one of those awful movies, in which the bad guys are really bad, the good guys are really good, and there is a bad guy who eventually becomes a good guy because of the love of a pure girl but has to die. I wasted 2:40 hours of my life - except for the few seconds in which you may enjoy Brad Pitt's naked bottom. May Zeus strike Pedersen with His lighting! (This is not meant to be a blasphemy, dear IMDb friends: I indeed worship Zeus)"

Anyway, I guess I'm not that familiar with the Illiad and I'm not even sure how factual it is. Then again, this didn't have any supernatural stuff, so it seemed pretty realistic to me. I admit that a flaw of this was that it was a bit too long.<br/><br/>It seemed to take way too long for the famous Trojan horse to appear. It's still a good movie. It's odd how a fair number of critics didn't like it even though Leonard Maltin gave it three and a half stars. Good for you, Leonard! What I love about this movie is how epic it is.

As far as the film goes, it pretty good. I look at it as Hollywood cinema and that is all; no differently than in the way I view Clash of the Titans - Hollywood telling us their version of a Greek Myth.<br/><br/>The action of the battles, costumes and sets are what grabbed my attention and not so much the story itself. There are a couple more versions of this tale in film form that tells us the tale a little differently. This particular version of the story is fine but I really like the eye-candy of the costumes (no matter who are wearing them, I like them).

","""Troy"" is a historical adventure movie written by David Benioff based on the famous tale by Homer. The director is Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot""). It seems Petersen has a preference for overlong films as this one here (director's cut) also makes it past the 180-minute mark. I don't mind Brad Pitt and I quite like Eric Bana (mostly because of ""Munich""), but still the genre is not really among my favorites. Apart from that, the film has Orlando Bloom in a crucial role (this was made shortly after the LotR trilogy when he was a huge star) and I cannot see any acting talent in him. This is also why I was cheering for Brendan Gleeson in their fight and all my love for Bana and his character left with that absolutely ridiculous ending. It's a 1 vs 1 and he simply gets in and kills the ""bad guy"". What a joke. And don't even get me started on Bloom's character killing Pitt's at the end. Complete nonsense. Achilles was shown to us as basically invincible and then this weakling comes and simply kills him.<br/><br/>Apart from this, the females in here were pretty insignificant as well. Kruger is entirely forgettable. Byrne does an okay job with what she is given and she looks amazing too. The best thing were maybe the 1 vs 1 fights here, the one I mentioned earlier (despite the stupid outcome) and also the one between Pitt's and Bana's character. However, I must say that this was quite a drag at times and should have been kept much more essential, perhaps around the 100-minute mark. There was a lot in this film that could have been left out. The way it turned out I cannot recommend it and it is also among the worst Brad Pitt performances and movies. Thumbs down."
"filipemanuelneto","6","1","1","11 September 2015"," A great epic with a confused script.
","This film is an adaptation of Greek myths and legends surrounding the war between Greeks and Trojans. According to legend, Troy was besieged for ten years and only fell when the Greeks deceived them with a wooden horse. The film also tells the mith of Achilles. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, this epic film has screenplay by David Beniof based on Homer's Iliad, and a good cast with the participation of Brad Pitt (as Achilles), Eric Bana (as Hector), Orlando Bloom (as Paris), Diane Kruger ( as Helen), Brian Cox (as Agamemnon, the Greek king), Brendan Gleeson (as Menelaus, the Spartan king) and Peter O'Toole (as Priam, the Trojan king).<br/><br/>This type of epics, whether mythological or biblical, has an important feature: the whole script, scenery and costumes must be carefully written and planned because the audience knows the story beforehand and is waiting for something consistent with what she know. And this film managed to comply with this feature, although its too far from Homer at various moments. Visually, the film is excellent, with great costumes, scenery, photography, sound and visual effects. Some of the performances also surprised by the depth and drama, like Peter O'Toole in the role of Priam. Brad Pitt also performed very well, although his character doesn't leave room for him to show all his talent.<br/><br/>The big problem of this movie is the script, which tries to mix various Greek myths with the story of Homer's Iliad, ending up lost and confused by too much information. Consequently, there are characters in the film that have great relevance but hardly appear in the myth (Briseis and Patroclus for example), whereas other characters that mythology values ​​will end up virtually disappeared in the film (Cassandra and Ulysses are obvious examples). Another ""victim"" of this poorly thought out script was Achilles, a central character in the film, beautifully played by Pitt but a shadow of mythological Achilles, which has a much greater depth and psychological wealth, something that the script didn't know or didn't want to explore. I'm sure that Brad Pitt would have been up to the challenge if writer had followed that path. Unfortunately, he chose to value other things, almost creating sub-plots that then kills at birth by not giving them continuity. There are also characters and situations that arise and only those who know the Greek mythology understand why, because the film doesn't give them any explanation or follow-up. For example, the sudden and momentary appearance of Aeneas at the end of the movie... only who knows the mythology will know that Aeneas is one of the names associated with the founding of Rome.<br/><br/>This movie is a good movie, with good actors and a good story. It would be an even better movie if script was better but, nevertheless, worth seeing it."

It's not bad; it's just boring and banal. It's all super heroes and super strength.<br/><br/>This myth is not just strong for the story, it's because it was treated by really great writers in a number of plays and poems. Homer, Aeschylus and Euripides were really great writers.<br/><br/>Take Euripides's ""The Trojan Women"" which was made into a movie in 1971. That retains the tragic destruction of war and the obsession with pride amongst other themes.<br/><br/>This movie has epic fights egos from the warriors but the other themes are all absent. The other characters, the women in particular are non existent.<br/><br/>For a young audience that lack of depth is probably fine enough but it's like so many film versions of classic works, its not even close to being the real thing."

The acting was really good and the film had a brilliant cast list. Starring in this film with Brad is Sean Bean, Julian Glover, Nathan Jones, Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana & Orlando Bloom Everyone does a great job.<br/><br/>The story was quite good, but I felt it dragged on for too long. I was hoping it was going to be gripping throughout the movie, but there were times where I was getting a little bored. But just as I was getting bored, another fighting sequence came along.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes were absolutely amazing. They were violent, gory and very well shot. I don't know how much of this film was computer effects and how many extras were used, but there were so many people during the fighting scenes that you didn't know where to look. It was action and excitement every time. Sometimes you could see that when the people were stabbing each other, they were missing by miles, but it was not very often and it didn't ruin the scene.<br/><br/>My favourite scene in the whole film was when the king played by Peter O'Toole went into the enemy camp to get his sons body back. The conversation he had with Brad Pitt in his hut was very tense. I could sense the respect and tension between both characters, and even though they were only talking it was a very captivating scene and the best scene of the film.

"Desertman84","9","1","1","27 September 2012"," Troy Is An Epic War Film
","Troy is an epic war film that was loosely based on Homer's Iliad. It features an ensemble cast that includes Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger together with Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Rose Byrne, Garrett Hedlund, Tyler Mane, and Peter O'Toole. It was written by David Benioff and directed by Wolfgang Petersen.<br/><br/>In 1193 B.C., Paris, Prince of Troy, has fallen in love; however, the beautiful woman who has beguiled him is Helen, Queen of Sparta,who is wed to King Menelaus. While Helen is hardly immune to Paris' charms, this doesn't blunt Menelaus' fury when Paris steals her away from him. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon,the power-hungry king of the Mycenaeans, is eager to expand his empire through Troy to the lands of the Aegean Sea, and he uses Paris' romantic slight against Menelaus as an excuse to wage an all-out war against the great walled city. Priam, King of Troy, summons his armies, led by Prince Hector, to meet the onslaught of Agamemnon's forces, but while the great city has yet to yield in a battle, Agamemnon has a formidable ally in Achilles,a mighty and seemingly unstoppable warrior whose presence could tip the scales in Agamemnon's favor. <br/><br/>The movie is visually stunning regardless of the its overblown and historically inaccurate depiction as a gigantic city of massive columns and statuary. Character dynamics are intense.The epic-scale narrative is now easy to follow, with greater emphasis on the inner turmoil of Achilles,which was well played by Brad Pitt; and his rivalry with Hector.Also,viewers will feel a more satisfying escalation of tension and suspense from battle to battle. The good parts are better, and the not-so-good parts are more easily forgiven. And no matter how you cut it,the film is a lavish feast for the eyes."

","All in all, this movie was just barely average and here's why.  My first complaint is the color tones it was filmed in, this bugged me from the first few seconds of the film, it made it look old, like an old bible movie.  If they gave it more of a gold tint or a sharp clear image then the battle sequences would have been much more enjoyable to watch.  The next and biggest problem for me was the character development, and it's problem was, there wasn't any.  Things we just very rushed and weren't given the time to let you care for the characters.  They took a ten year epic and crunched it down into a three week dissapointment.  For example we have Helen and Paris, after three days or so of sleeping together they decide they are in love and decide to risk not only their lives, but the lives of everyone in Troy for it.  Then we have this huge army sailing over after them only a few days later, we are talking one thousand ships, suddenly packed up, including soldiers, set sailing for Troy.  And that scene wasn't near as grand as they made it look in trailors, it didn't have me excited at all.  And that was what really killed this movie, no excitement, you never got that, ""feeling"". And the fault in that lies in the hands of our director.  What I dont understand is why they give these huge budgets and trust these movies with people like Peterson and Zwick (last samurai), both of these films, with all the money they had and such great actors could have done so much better. When making these movies you need the likes of Speiberg and Zemeckis involved.  Actually, for handling this movie, I think Peter Jackson would have been perfect.  In the end I think the movie came out too soon and I give it 2/5 stars."
"dima_frenkel","6","1","1","15 May 2004"," An OK movie if you don't have your hopes too high
","The movie was not great by any stretch of imagination. Both Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom seemed like they did not belong there, they seemed kind of ""out of context"". Especially Orlando Bloom, but maybe it was just because of his role in Lord Of The Rings - who knows. Sets were excellent and cinematography/special effects were very very good, however...dialogs were much too simplistic and a bit not natural, even though every attempt was made to breathe some meaning into them. So, it's no more then OK movie with very good special effects and battle scenes. If you expect something epic and meaningful, like ""Gladiator"" or ""Master And Commander"" or ""The Last Samurai"" - most likely, you will be disappointed."

","I have been reading the comments posted here about Troy, and because of the overwhelming negative feeling, I was compelled to share my own feelings about the movie. I loved Troy. I thought it was entertaining, exciting and fun. Most of the commenters have been bemoaning the disregard for Homer's original masterpiece. To this I must say: ""If you love books so much, go read books!"" Seriously, no movie is ever completely true to the book. It's fine that you love the original story and enjoy it much more than the movie. But it's not the filmmaker's problem that you nitpick. Yes, I agree, the acting could have been better at parts. Sometimes it got corny. But would you look at that beautiful set? Honestly, the city of Troy was gorgeous. Not to mention the men who seem to populate it. Now, I love violence and mayhem as much as the next moviegoer, but when you give me Brad Pitt, Sean Bean, Orly, AND Eric Bana running around, sweating and wearing little leather skirts...I'm gonna be a bit distracted. Troy was by no stretch of even my imagination a piece of great theatre, or even great film. But it was fun. And that, for me, is what really counts in a movie."
"QueenMakeda84","Null","6","15","16 December 2004"," Des-Troyed the myth
","We all know QueenMakeda84 loves Greek myth. Big fan. That's why I watched Troy. I wanted to see how they mussed up a great theme and story like the Trojan War. Naturally, they blamed Helen and removed the influence of the gods. The characters might have mentioned them once or twice, but there were no gods to be found. The Greek gods were real to the ancient Greeks, so to remove them is to remove the culture and livelihood of the Greeks. They present a major point in the story of the Trojan War, but no. Hollywood thinks it's more interesting to show the ""human side"" of this story. You can't show the humanity without the gods, as ironic as it sounds.<br/><br/>Brad did a great job, but seemed a little macho mannish, but then again, Achilles was a single-minded warrior. Ah, I take it back. I can appreciate the way he acted the character, but I think his line delivery was a little to be desired. Orlando really did a great job of showing how much of a coward Paris was. He should the p**** nature of the character dead on. Eric Banas was a wonderful Hector. Hector was a warrior, but definitely had loyalties in other places and you see that conflict. <br/><br/>The story's all wrong, because Achilles didn't die that way, Briseis didn't like being his captive, Paris was killed, and Helen was promptly returned to her husband. It was really a moronic and romantic ending for such a war-like story. This story became the catalyst for so many Greek plays, and it ended like the resolution of a TV sitcom. I loved the action scenes and the simple way Brad fought. His fighting style was realistic and impressive. I got goosebumps watching that little leap he did to stab someone, it was great. The sound effects here were also well done as you felt the fight through your ears and how tired someone could get. I mean, all in all, good film, but it definitely didn't measure up as a good Greek revival."
"wfeng","1","6","15","16 May 2004"," Worst scripts ever seen
","Based on Greek Myth, but try to wipe out the Myth from the story, thats why this movie sucks, with myth, you can forgive the stupid behavior of all these people by god, without god, these stupid behaviors can only be attributed to one reason: these are all stupid person, playing stupid games. For 90% of the movie, it just test your ability of toleration, and the rest 10% of the movie make you feel better simply because all these stupid person are dead.<br/><br/>This is the worst scripts I have ever seen, can't believe they spent 200 million on it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who want to enjoy a film. Maybe they have the good actors, good director, good money, but the stupid script has ruined everything."
"JChild","10","5","12","15 January 2005"," How could anybody not like this movie.
","I loved it. I read the Illiad years ago and although I don't quite recall all the events that transpired in the writing I did love the movie and thought it to be as equally dramatic and inspiring without the over-bloated romanticism. I would suggest this movie to anyone. Brad Pitt gives a stellar performance and although I was just somewhat particular to Eric Bana he exceeded my expectations in this movie and became what I am prepared to defend as one the most believable heroes I've ever seen dedicated to film. Orlando Bloom, although I've always been a big LotR fan, I grow tired of seeing him in period and fantasy pieces. We all know he can swing a sword and is a master with the bow but I would like to see him in a role that isn't typecast for him. Agammenon, wow I didn't have any idea who Brian Cox was until X-men 2 then Super Troopers and I loved him in both but I've now put him in my a-list actors grouping because he just wowed me. So evil. All in all the acting in this movie was superb. The story almost Shakespearian level to me. The fight scenes and visuals were for the most part astounding. I can watch the fight between Hector and Achilles over and over it was so magnificent. Enough prattle go watch it."

","I've watched Troy more than 20 times... And I still in love with this movie. Even though plenty of people use to say that this is an example of a terrible plot, I still insist that this a great movie, based on something that really existed thousands of years ago. It's a memorable performance, and I wish a lot of people could enjoy it in the same way that I did (and still doing...). I hope people can also like this epic film, whose characters are so well-performed and so full of emotions. Due to all those critics I think the cast/crew need more incentive to keep going on that amazing project called Troy. Not only movies should be launched for spectators like you and me, but also should be adapted into plays of theaters... It would be wonderful for us all!<br/><br/>By, <br/><br/>Black_Lottus"

The acting was horrible, the cinematography reminded me Starship Troopers and the digital CGI was cheesy, fake and way too noticeable.  Horrible film.  Brad Pitt poses throughout the movie like he's still in Meet Joe Black.  Ugh!  Save your money."

","""Troy"" is a big time epic such as used to turned out regularly in the 50's and early 60's. Of course, the old epics were made without the advantage, or curse, of CGI. A top flight international cast really get into the ancient characters and armor. Brad Pitt might be a little to pretty for Achilles, but he's better than I expected. Orlando Bloom is very good as Paris, the cause of it all. Eric Bana is a heroic Hector and Peter O'Toole is perfect as the tragic and noble King Priam. Helen Kruger is super-desirable as Helen, ""the face that launched a thousand ships"". Brian Cox is the aggressive and arrogant Agamemnon, Brendan Gleeson is great as his blustering brother, Menelaus, Helen's cuckolded husband. Possibly the best performance is by Sean Bean as the crafty Odysseus, who finally comes up with the idea for the Trojan Horse that finally ends the siege. ""Beware of Greeks bearing gifts, or in this case, gifts bearing Greeks"". The battle scenes are exciting and well staged, they're based on historical data and are accurately executed. The only quibble is that the film doesn't follow ""The Illiad"" completely, several major characters are killed before their time.All in all a very lavish, exciting and well done spectacle."
"MaxBorg89","7","4","9","4 October 2005"," Not exactly Ben-Hur or Spartacus, but still enjoyable
","No gods (with the exception of Julie Christie's cameo as Achilles'mother).Delayed or anticipated deaths.Mr ""Nice Guy"" Brad Pitt(with a British accent)playing brutal warrior Achilles.These are some of the reasons Troy was hated by Greek mythology purists, and I have to admit, being something of a purist myself, that the absence of the various gods annoyed me(I think Michael Douglas would have been good as Zeus,while Hugh Jackman could have been a decent Ares,god of war). As for the other things, since a few characters are more boring or rotten than in the Iliad, changing their demise time isn't that shocking.And Brad Pitt?Well, accent aside, he's actually enjoyable as the half-divine killer.The same can't be said for Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom, whose forbidden love fuels the Trojan war in the first place.They're a handsome couple, that's true, but their acting makes the romance so insipid.But who cares?We're here to watch the bloody battles.Well, not that bloody, actually:the final duel between Achilles and Hector, which was the most graphic part of the Iliad, is reduced to five bloodless minutes.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, the only ones who are really satisfying turn out to be two Trojans(weird, considering we're supposed to hate them),Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole,playing Hector and his father Priam, as well as one Greek, Odysseus, portrayed by Sean Bean(for once he's a good guy).<br/><br/>It may not be entirely faithful to the source material(the audience will prefer the Trojans), but if you ignore the flaws, you can enjoy Troy for what it is: a visually impressive, decently acted, Hollywood-style epic."
"niall-14","7","4","9","20 May 2005"," Enjoyable even if inaccurate
","At the risk of running against what I've read in most of the critics reviews, I liked this film.<br/><br/>This movie was anything but historically or archaeologically accurate. Still, it's about what one can expect from a Hollywood epic in this day and age, and an epic it most surely is. From the special effects of the 1,000 ships stretching from horizon to horizon, to the massed fight scenes encompassing hundreds of suitably garbed warriors, this flick rivals Ben Hur and then some. Surprise, surprise, the acting isn't half bad either. Forget about historical accuracy for 160 minutes of thereabouts and immerse yourself into an age of humanity when barbarism and honour stood side by side, ankle deep in fresh gore. When the ability to fight and die for your city-state overrode any other considerations, even unto the death of your nearest and dearest. An age when every man could be, and probably was, a king for a day, or at least a few years, over his own patch of the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>I think I enjoyed 'Troy' primarily because of the character portrayals, which were - different. Achilles, played by Brad Pitt, and extremely well played I thought, wasn't the overall ruthless fighter he's been made out to be by Homer. Oh, sure, he could fight, and until he was killed, he always won, but in Pitt's portrayal Achilles he was something less than the ultimate killing machine. Achilles was a troubled individual, seeking an end he knew was coming, and seemingly demanding it to show itself as he expected any other enemy to do. Son of a Goddess and a mortal man, I gathered he was more than a little angry that he turned out to be not quite immortal after all. Arrogance, seething anger, troubled psyche, tenderness and a searching desire were encompassed in Pitt's character and artfully so.<br/><br/>Helen of Troy, nee Sparta, played by Diane Kruger, was a fairly meaningless part for the young lady, but she does have the primary attribute for the character, that of a flawless complexion and a stunningly illustrated beauty, no doubt enhanced for the cameras, but stunning just the same. Her few real 'meaty' parts of the script were well carried, and I congratulate her for what must have been a deceptively difficult role.<br/><br/>Eric Bana, that son of an Aussie soddy, performed brilliantly as Hektor of Troy. His bearing and demeanour as Crown Prince of Troy was the most convincing I've seen him play yet, even down to his death at the hands of Brad Pitt. Every centimetre Trojan royalty, every centimetre the honourable human being. Good guys usually finish last, but he was dead well before the two hour mark.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom as Paris, younger brother of Hektor presented the love-struck sibling to a tee. His youthful innocence and fresh-faced looks completed the picture extremely well. His incompetence and fear on the field of single combat before Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), the cuckolded husband of Helen, King Of Sparta and brother of the movie's villain, Agamemnon (Brian Cox) was well done, giving me the feelings of both disgust and disappointment at his failing and fear for his ultimate death. Of course, it doesn't happen there, with the story taking a twist which leads into the over-sized wooden equine saga, and from there into the eventual sacking of Troy by the massed Greek forces of Agamemnon and Odessyus (Sean Bean - most recently as Boromir of LOTR fame), with Achilles blundering through the death and destruction, seeking his own love and ultimately, the end he knew he was seeking but couldn't pin down.<br/><br/>The only part of the movie I can honestly say I didn't like was the death of Achilles, ironically at the hands of Paris. I won't spoil the surprise for those of you who haven't seen the flick, but when the demise of Achilles comes, you'll know what I mean as the camera draws back from the supine form of Pitt, lying in death. I've been told of the reasons behind the term, 'Achilles Heel' but if you follow the 'Iliad' and the legends surrounding the death of Achilles, you'll understand just how banal the scene is. All said and done, the film is a portrayal of the human factor at its most base, running off the twin elements which encompass both the soaring future and ultimate degradation of the species - Love and Honour.<br/><br/>The detriments aside and no movie is perfect, I'm still going to recommend this film as a solid 7 out of 10. It's an epic, it's a spectacle and above all, it's a story and a damn good one."

A total waste of an afternoon. What was Wolfgang Peterson trying to achieve? Certainly not cinematic success......Brad Pitt was certainly buffed up but his lines were spoken with little sincerity. The script writers certainly took liberties with Homer's Iliad and manufactured a misleading tale. We sat through the credits, to numb to move, and figured they must have paid all of Malta, half of Mexico and some of England when all the named personnel was credited. Poor Josh Groban only got credit for his some,""Remember Me"", at the very end. Pitiful excuse for a movie"
"DustinOD","8","4","9","28 May 2004"," Pitt was excellent, Wolfgang was not
","This movie was not about the acting, because they all did a remarkable job in delivering lines of dialogue that were laughable. But it was Wolfgang Peterson's direction that almost made this movie a flop. Plus his choice of music, until the end, was wrong and made the movie seem like it was rivaling 'The Hulk' (probably the last thing Eric Bana wants). Most of the shots were nicely executed and the action sequences were very well done. It was only a few elements that were questionable, but they weren't necessarily dominant in the movie and they were decisions made by people other than the actors. So if you want to see them in this film, do so, but don't expect it to be a brilliant film."
"rbverhoef","7","4","9","30 May 2004"," May be not that good, but very entertaining
","'Troy' is based on Homer's 'The Illiad' but has changed the story from a Greek myth to a Hollywood epic tale. That is not a good thing, but it definitely gives us entertaining results. This Hollywood version shows us the Trojan War a little simplified. The reason of this war between the Greek king Agamemnon (Brian Cox) and the Trojan king Priam (Peter O'Toole) is Helen (Diane Kruger). Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) has taken her from Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) and Agamemnon sees this as the perfect opportunity to conquer Troy. The Greek have Achilles (Brad Pitt) and the only man Achilles is able to respect, Odysseus (Sean Bean). The Trojans have prince Hector (Eric Bana). Both Achilles and Hector belong to the greatest heroes from the Greek stories.<br/><br/>How the story unfolds I will not reveal although the trick with the Trojan Horse is probably familiar with most people. Like I said the movie is not that good, especially on certain levels, and for some that makes sure they will not like the movie. It is true that computer generated armies are not that impressive anymore, it is true that people here talk as they are in a Hollywood romantic comedy, it is true that Brad Pitt, a fine actor, is very miscast as Achilles, it is true that the war doesn't seem to take ten years, it is true that Diane Kruger doesn't make her Helen worth fighting for and it is true that the movie sometimes has its focus on the wrong things.<br/><br/>That said, let me focus on the good things. May be the great battles are not that good, although they are entertaining enough, but I have to admit that the inevitable fight between Achilles and Hector is one of the best I have seen. The movie knows that we are not supposed to have a favorite and therefore the sequence is even more exciting. Other action sequences are at least spectacular. There is a fight between Paris and Menelaos who wants his vengeance and the movie makes the right choices in how to shows this sequence.<br/><br/>Pitt, Bloom and Kruger are not very good, or at least miscast. True, but Bana and especially Gleeson, Cox and O'Toole are terrific in their roles. O'Toole is mentioned as very positive not for the first time for his performance in 'Troy', his scenes are the best on the emotional level. Most other things are not very good on the emotional level. The cinematography is not bad although it uses the same trick over and over again. The camera starts with a low shot and then it lifts to show how grand and great it all looks. Admittedly, it looks great. Its production design, costumes, visual effects and score from James Horner are close to flawless.<br/><br/>Considering all the above you can understand that 'Troy' is a movie with many flaws, some on pretty important levels. I realize that, but if the flaws are not that distracting and the entertainment is as good as in 'Troy' I don't want to complain too much."
"smash016","Null","4","9","23 May 2004"," Good with the right frame of mind
","Okay, we know that Brad Pitt isn't the one to play Achilles (if only for his blond hair) and that the overall acting is pretty weak, and that the dialogue is so unintentionally funny now and then, but what do you expect from a 200 million blockbuster? Epic action, and that's what you get. So in that perspective, I think Troy was pretty good.<br/><br/>Troy's action scenes make up for its lack of originality. It's nothing new since Braveheart and/or LOTR, but Braveheart's action was good, so what's the big deal.<br/><br/>Also, the actresses were great. Not in terms of acting, of course, but when a woman has got like ten lines dialogue I don't really care whether she can act or not. Diane Kruger was great looking, and so was Saffron Burrows, the latter being one of the most beautiful women I've seen in Hollywood for years. For a moment I thought it was Veronica Zemanova (minus the breasts).<br/><br/>Sean Bean is always terrific, despite the short time he's given in this flick. Eric Bana was not-so-good, but acceptable. Orlando Bloom was terrible as always, and by saying 'terrible' I actually mean 'annoying', but I guess Paris was, like Legolas, meant to be annoying anyway, so great job, Orlando. All other characters were so superficial I will not mention them. And Brad Pitt is one of the greatest actors of his time, but this just wasn't the right role for him. He's at his best when playing slightly f*cked up guys like in Snatch or 12 Monkeys. But that aside, I think he did relatively well in Troy anyway.<br/><br/>Well, what more can I say - terribly bad in every possible way but so epic, so so enjoyable. Switch off your intelligence and any other artsy-fartsy vehicle you have and have a great time. The 163 minutes will be over like 1, 2, 3..."

"chadlund","1","3","6","3 April 2017"," An insult to the Iliad
","What the hell is this ? I could not believe Peterson would actually take the public, the admires and the legacy of the greatest poem ever told for idiots. This movie is based on the iIliad ? Since when are movies based on fictional stories ??????? Usually a movie is based on real events, but a fictional story ? That is a mind-blowing, and not just any story, the most iconic story that has lasted throughout humanity to the present day. Basically a few funny characters just stole names and rewrote one of the biggest defections displayed on cinema.<br/><br/>This poem was turned into a portrayal of real events- that's actually what is presented to you, as factual events, as if retracing Alexander the Great's expeditions. How ? The Iliad is a story within a mythology, how can it be factual ?<br/><br/>A lot of high paid and awarded actors participated in this movie, which was essentially the lone motivation for it: bringing up a team of ""big names"" except none of them are well casted and consequently cannot act.<br/><br/>Here's the story of the Iliad: it opens on a chant, the wrath of Achilles, who threatens to leave the Greeks because Agamemnon stole his captive Briseis. Agamemnon the leader of the Greeks who was awarded this expedition decided not to give up his own captive Cryseis, responsible for the pest Appolo sentenced on the Greeks. The siege has already been going for nine years and it took the Greeks ten years to prepare for it.<br/><br/>The entire Iliad leans towards Hector's death - he is Achilles' pendant, his choices, his greed all lead him to his final confrontation with Achilles. In reality Hector is a coward, he is marginal in his family, he disregards his wife Andromache and he believes Apolo will hit Achilles and offer him the victory. But Hector folds and flees away from away Achilles, embarrassing himself and Ilion by going around the city three times! The poem ends with Hector's funerals. Not Achilles'!<br/><br/>In this movie there aren't even any gods: where are Athena, Aphrodite and Apolo ? Where is Diomedes, Antenor, Stheneleus, Cassandra ? where are Patroclos' funeral games ? Why is Patroclos so young when he is much older ? Why is there the roman turtle formation ? Why is the landscape inaccurate ? What are Lamas doing in ancien persia ? There are so many characters missing and those who are present die when they don't.<br/><br/>The worst part is: where are the dialogs ? How can you possibly write bad dialogs if you base it on the Iliad ???? Where's the dramatic dimension, the tragic conjoncture, the struggle between destiny and fatality, excellence and cowardice ? In return we have Peter O'Toole and his 'will of the Gods' who sounds like he's making fish noise with his mouth - the lowliness of the dialogs ""love your wife and defend your country"", it is just unbearable. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt: drink cool aid, eat a pimento and stop looking at yourself in the mirror. Clearly, he tried to reach into a viril grave voice, but failed. Instead he sounds constipated much like Keanu Reeves in the Matrix ""Trinity, I love you, but I really need to go to the can!"" <br/><br/>Last but not least, the CGI aren't even that good, the fighting terribly disorganized, lead warriors would fight on chars and many historical inaccuracies regarding military equipment. <br/><br/>A very shallow movie."

Which story/film of Robin Hood is accurate? Or King Arthur? Rasputin? A lot of talent, hard work, and yes research, was put into this film and it shows on the screen. The director's cut adds even more detail and character development to this excellent film. The cinematography is stunning, the art direction, sets, props, costuming and makeup effects dazzle the viewer and the music score adds emotion to the proceedings. I especially liked the idea of building the Trojan Horse out of destroyed ship parts. It actually makes sense; where else would they find the materials. The director's cut shows more of the carnage than the theatrical print and not gratuitously, but to depict the ugliness of war. Other details included the preparations in Troy for oncoming war, the care of the wounded, the burial of the dead and the unusual style of fighting using leaps, dives and backhanded sword slashing of the greatest warrior, Achilles. The direction is well paced, the dialog perfection, the acting by the entire cast superb, top-notch. The prologue explains that the film is ""based"" on the Odyssey. What more does one want? I expect that some reviewers here would be bored by the creation of the Universe or the Apocalypse."

","I think that this was a great movie. It was one of the best epic battle movies that I've seen yet second only to Lord of the Rings. The actors who played the roles in this movie were all great and experienced actors. I thought that the best actor in this movie was Brad Pitt. He played the role of a warrior very well and made it seem so real. In this movie he played the role of the almighty Achilles. Another great actor was Brian Cox as Agamemnon. He does so well playing the role of the bad guy. Another movie he was great in was ""The Bourne Supremacy"". Hector was also played very well in this movie. He had that brotherly feeling about him and protected his little brother Paris when he coward behind him. Hector was played by Eric Bana and Paris by Orlando Bloom. Hector was a great warrior like Achilles and a great adversary. Paris was a coward and could only shoot arrows at people. But I guess it makes sense since Troy was meant to have the greatest archers in the land. Hector was a great hand to hand warrior while Paris was a weakling. He was not just a weakling, but also a idiot. He caused this huge war which ended up killing his entire city just because he wanted a girl. If he were smart he would have sent Helen back to Sparta when Hector told him to. But he was selfish and thought only of himself."

","4 years after directing 'The Perfect Storm', German director Wolfgang Petersen is back with this epic/war flick that is 'an adaptation of Homer's great epic, the film follows the assault on Troy by the united Greek forces and chronicles the fates of the men involved.', quoting IMDb. For start, I really enjoyed this movie, and I also liked the way Petersen achieved to direct the war and battles scenes, specially the fight between Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. Having a 'luxury' cast, I it is obvious that many good performances, were one of the positives in this movie, following the visual and sound effects, plus the costume designs (worth the nomination for the Academy Award by the way). But, what I really didn't enjoy that much, was the screenplay. OK, maybe I'm wrong, but me knowing the Homer version, I found the screenplay very different from the poet's version, and that disappointed me a little. Still, it is a good epic/war movie and is worth the viewing, specially for the lovers in this genre. 8/10."

","As I am Greek (and in Greece we study Iliad to Greek class from the age of 12) I have to say I loughed so many times with the comments of some ""experts"" (professors etc). First of all I LOVED the movies (gave 9/10). One ""professor"" wrote ""First of all, decide what you want: if you want history, you need to throw the Iliad out of the window, because Homer was definitely NOT historically accurate"". Da...For God shake, Homer was a poet...Iliad is full of mentions to Gods (and they decide how the war will end).For certain the events that he describes are not historically accurate because he doesn't care...He cares about things like friendship, heroism and everything a POET should care. You don't have to be a professor with PhD to say that... Later I read ""As a matter of fact, the post-Homeric epics describe Achilles as a thug and the Myrmidons as a band of robbers, spoiling temples and abducting daughters of priests""...MERCY...Achilles was son of goddess Thetis (Θέτις)...he had a great sense of right and wrong, and he also despited the gods for being cruel to men... Anyway, stop playing that you know everything and just enjoy the movie..."
"charchuk","7","3","6","23 September 2006"," Flawed, but memorable, epic
","Though an unfaithful adaptation of The Iliad, this is a great movie and a wondrous epic. The differences between the poem and this film didn't bother me, as the credits even admit that the film was inspired by Homer's epic, not based on it. That aside, this is a grand film in both scope and execution, as it recounts the battle of Troy from both sides and has a fair amount of action and drama. There are a few flaws, most noticeably the acting by Orlando Bloom, but they are overcome by the rest of the film, especially the performances by Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole. Both of them stand out with genuine, memorable turns. And the action scenes are both exhilarating and believable. A true epic.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the removal of the gods from the storyline (aside from Achilles' mother), as it made the film more historical than mythological, nor the deaths of characters who didn't die in Homer's version, as it made the drama better. I mean, it's not as if Homer's version is an accurate retelling either, as he wrote it several hundred years after the war. Nor did I mind the shortening of the overall war, as liberties must be taken since it's a film, not a documentary. The overall story was very well-told and compelling, and while Homer's poem is a classic, it is not necessarily well-suited for a film. So, I think the film did as good a job as it could have with the story.<br/><br/>Though it clocks in at two and a half hours, the tale never drags or feels boring, mostly due to the action scenes and the interesting characters. By showing both sides of the war, none of the characters are reduced to one-dimensional, stock villains (except maybe Agamemnon) but instead are believable, intriguing human beings. The fight between Achilles and Hector is probably the best part of the movie, as both characters have been developed nicely up until that point, and you don't want to see either one lose. The climax, with the Trojan Horse, is perfectly realized and ends the film well. And the bookending narration by Odysseus makes a nice lead-in to The Odyssey, if they ever decide to adapt that one. All in all, a flawed epic with some great performances and fantastic action - just classic movie-making."
"ajb7876","8","3","6","2 September 2006"," nice to see
","I know that some people have slammed this movie but i really enjoyed it,the leaving out of the Gods was a smart move i think,the characters are doing what they do of their own free will,and it was nice to see the moral ambiguities of the situation,Helen shouldn't have run off with Paris(not once in the film is she made to face the reality that her and Paris""s selfish actions have doomed an entire city to destruction),but the way that Agamemnon jumps on the situation as a pretext for attacking Troy reveals that its probably the best thing he could wish for.Brad Pitt as Achilles was very good,on the surface he is an unstoppable warrior,afraid of nothing and convinced of his own greatness but the scenes with Briseis show him in a more human light as if he is suddenly regretting that he will never have a family or a normal home life,people might fear and respect him but nobody will ever really love him,his world is and always will be a cold and blood soaked place and he is less a human being and more a human weapon.The only character that comes across as having any real honour or decency is Hector,Eric Bana played him perfectly, a reluctant hero forced into a situation that he really doesn't want to be in but totally committed to the defence of his city and family,the final duel between him and Achilles is a heart breaker,when that spear point is driven home you know its all over,not just for Hector but Troy as well.On a minor note it was good to see that at the start of the fight they begin with spears which you don't often see in movies,usually it goes straight to swords.I know that this film plays fast and loose with the original story but its not a problem unless you are a total stickler for such things and it proves that human nature is much the same now as it was 3000 years ago."

"schnippel-1","8","3","6","21 October 2005"," A modern adaptation
","When I first went out of the cinema after watching Troy, I was disappointed by yet another mainstream Hollywood action movie. The girl with whom I went to see the movie was also disappointed because her favourite epic was violated in such a way (and she also doesn't like Brad Pitt too much, who was portraying her favourite Greek hero ;). But whenever I was talking about the film afterwards, I started to like it more and more. The movie is solidly crafted, but does not add a whole lot to the techniques of film-making, admittedly. But what is so interesting about it, is the point which many movie-goers criticised so hard: the (almost) complete absence of the Greek gods. The only personification we get to see in the film is Achilles mother, and we don't even get a clear statement on whether she is a goddess or not. Whenever the gods appear in the movie, they appear in flowery phrases like when Menelaos spills some of his wine to the ground ""for the gods"". Also, the gods are portrayed as uncontrollable entities (like Hector tells Paris on the ship) who cannot be completely soothed by gifts or sacrifices. In my opinion, this is a very modern (atheistic) notion, which also puts the blame for the war (and the ensuing casualties) on men, and not supernatural beings. In a time of ""Holy War"" and ""God's Own Country"" going to war, this should remind us that it is no higher destiny which makes us do war, but rather leaders of men who do so. Maybe watch it under this aspect the next time."
"moogie59","8","3","6","17 October 2005"," Overall more than just eye candy
","Do not view this film in order to find mistakes between it and The Iliad. The director states this is 'inspired' by Homer's work which is far more honest than Coppola's 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' which wasn't. The plot is basic but with enough content to keep you interested and although the complexity and balance is weak and will not test your allegiances there are moments when you doubt your heroes. Troy is enjoyable and exciting all the way through. The fight scenes are athletic, sweaty and believable. The gore is representative not gratuitous. The acting is really very good and the cast are so pleasing to the eye! James Horner's haunting theme 'Remember me' makes staying for the credits, worthwhile."

","Most critics here seem to dissect every second of a movie. Just take all the fun out of it. If its a crappy movie thats fine. This is not. Just tell us plainly why you think a movie is not good, without all the hype. Troy is an action packed epic tale complete with kings, their warrior sons and of course, Achilles, played as a brooding and mostly unwilling soldier by Brad Pitt. For the most part the film excels at locations and scenery, rumbles with some of the best battle scenes ever made but struggles some with historical accuracy. Achilles, son of Peleus, and Patroclus, son of Menoetius (Peleus'brother) were cousins. Other ancient sources confirm these data. Just watch Troy, enjoy it. I loved it! You will LOVE it!"
"lonestarangel007","8","3","6","18 March 2005"," A Fantastic Movie!
","Of course, if you're going to nitpick about all the differences between ""Troy"" and the original version of the story, you probably won't like it. IMO I thought this was a great movie. Taking out the Greek gods was a very good move on the crew's part. What did they really add to the story except to make it more complicated? Plus, taking out the gods gave the movie a better sense of historical authenticity and, if the Trojan War truly did happen, the movie's version could very well be closer to the actual Trojan War than ""The Iliad"".<br/><br/>I was very happy that they showed Helen in the movie. It just wouldn't have worked if Helen was not there or if she was present but never spoke a word. From the way the story is told, most viewers are expected to sympathise with the Trojans, so the audience must see the love between Paris and Helen in order not to completely hate Paris for bringing this war to Troy, which would lead to Hector's death and the destruction of the city. At least seeing Paris and Helen together could help the audience understand better their motives for doing what they did. However, I would have liked to see a bit more remorse coming from Paris, especially at the end, especially since his relationship to Helen led to his older brother being killed. Before they showed Achilles' funeral, they should have had some sort of better resolution between Paris and Helen over what their little love triangle caused.<br/><br/>All the characters were very likable in the story. Except I did not really see the point of Briseis. If she wasn't in ""The Iliad"", the directors shouldn't have added her in, and if she was, she should have been left out. The relationship added nothing to the story, but the writers seemed to try to make the Briseis and Achilles storyline a big deal in the end, and it didn't work for me.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a wonderful movie if you are into history, or you like action movies."
"sargJaeger","8","3","6","15 March 2005"," a great, enjoyable film
","i've waited quite a while, before I decided to watch this movie. this was due to some bad reviews, which kept me hesitating. today, I really was in the mood to give it a try, and me being a fan of epics such as ""braveheart"" , I thought I at least couldn't do too much wrong. I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. <br/><br/>Yes, it may not be too close to the material it was INSPIRED by, but that's what's being inspired is all about, isn't it? It didn't claim to be historical accurate. Speaking of that, there could never be a historical correct movie about troy, as we rely on very vague, almost prose-like information. <br/><br/>I must admit, that I'm not deeply familiar with the material, this film builds up on. But you know what? I'm kind of glad about that. With me being disconnected, I enjoyed every second of this wonderfully crafted movie. I enjoyed the fighting scenes, even so some of them were cut pretty fast, letting you guess the action. I loved the dialogs, despite of them sometimes being a bit cheesy. It simply fit the characters, the time and the atmosphere. The acting was breath-taking at times. Peter O'Toole is a genius, Brad Pitt was cast perfectly as well as Sean Bean. Brian Cox gave a superb villain ( yes I know, it's unfair that Agamemnon was portrayed as an evil conquerer). Yes, Orlando Bloom probably isn't the best actor out there, but his performance was at least mediocre. It for sure couldn't ruin the overall impression concerning this movies acting. <br/><br/>I usually don't write reviews ( as you may have guessed by now :) ), especially not in English, but in this case I had to make an exception, given some of the bad reviews I read on IMDb before. <br/><br/>Something I enjoyed very much was the duality of emotions, I was confronted with. Excuse me, if this doesn't make any sense. I hope to clarify this in the following lines: I simply couldn't decide on who's side I should be on. It's hard to define Achilles role, and this gives this movie an extra edge, in my point of view. Many people resented the fact, that the movie ""created"" a black and white image, having the noble Priam on the one, and the purely evil Agamemnon on the other hand. And I understand that. But somehow, in the end it really didn't bother me. I love villains :)<br/><br/>If you have a chance to watch this film, don't hesitate. Even if you may not be overwhelmed by it, you will at least not waste your time. Tha, I can assure you!"
"wgfinley-1","9","3","6","30 January 2005"," Mythology Purists Go Home
","****Spoilers Within*****<br/><br/>I usually don't like to respond to other reviews but after seeing this movie I was interested to see what IMDb addicts like myself thought and was thoroughly disappointed to see some of the trashing it got though I expected some of it.<br/><br/>First off, this movie is INSPIRED by the Iliad, it's not meant to be a totally accurate portrayal of it. Secondly, just how can you have a ""historically accurate"" film of a Greek myth? The concept in and of itself is laughable. The other fact being there are literally hundreds of translations of the Iliad so you can take your pick of which of the hundreds you would like to be true to if you're making a film. <br/><br/>I believe the approach that Petersen (a true auteur director of our day) was trying to take was imagine that these events really did happen, what would they look like? I like the interpretation and if you like that interpretation you'll like that film. If you're gonzo about a film sticking to its source material you won't like it, but you knew you wouldn't like it in the first place wouldn't you? I don't think audiences would be too enthralled to know that Hector's son was thrown from the walls of Troy when the city was sacked. Of course the purists would have just assumed the movie ended before Achilles dies or the Trojan Horse is employed, or the film should not cover what led up to the Trojan War because none of those events are depicted in The Illiad. Issues unresolved lead either to sequels or bad movies and i don't think sequels were on their minds when they made this film.<br/><br/>Now, how about we talk about the movie? To me, this is the finest work Pitt (Achilles) has done since 12 Monkeys, he is absolutely superb and I am not a big fan. I believe he portrays the essence of Homer's Achilles -- a person living within a life already determined for him (""I was born, and this is what I am"") who then is forced to question whether that life that he thought was just and honorable really is after all. The way he carries himself and his athletic performance are absolutely first rate and not something he is normally identified with. Overall a job very well done.<br/><br/>Eric Bana (Hector) steals the film and rightfully so because most people who walk away from The Iliad leave it thinking the story is really about Hector more than Achilles or the Greeks. He gives another glimpse inside the warrior mentality but unlike the lone-wolf, solitary warrior he portrays in Blackhawk Down, he's a man fighting for his family, his home and his way of life. It is at the moment that Priam (Peter O'Toole in another great performance) tells Achilles all that he has lost that Achilles realizes who the true immortal hero should be and it is not himself. Bana's portrayal brings the audience to that point and I think it brilliantly illustrated the underlining subtext of what The Iliad is about in the end. <br/><br/>The gods and goddesses and their interferences, games, and tricks that take such a major part in The Iliad and made it interesting in its time have been told over and over again. A focus on the HUMAN side of these events and what all the characters would be if left to their human limitations has not been done before and for that Petersen is to be applauded. This film does an excellent job, in a short amount of time, in conveying those ideas in an entertaining way. To me, the concept of this film is to depict actual events that could have inspired Homer to write his mythological masterpiece, approach the film in that manner and you'll likely enjoy it. Approach it as if it is supposed to be an ""accurate"" reflection of something that is myth and you will certainly be disappointed. You should just ask yourself, isn't accurately depicting myth an oxymoron?"
"paxbritannia1453","9","3","6","30 January 2005"," See this movie for what it is, the best of the recent epics.
","I wasn't totally convinced this film would be as good as they made it out to be, I thought it would probably be a little cheesy, over the top, another poor attempt at an epic.<br/><br/>However I found it to be quite simply an excellent movie, so many reviewers condemn it but critics often condemn a lot of movies of this type, they are easy targets and if you look at a movie as simply a movie then you can really see it for what it is, credit the story for how its told, admire the performances without being spiteful for the changes in the story.<br/><br/>If the film had included every single part of the original tale by Homer, then it would have been far longer than it actually was (to long) and come across as a boring history lesson. Remember this is a MOVIE not a book or a poem but a movie now, changes to the story are necessary to make it interesting and watchable.<br/><br/>To the movie itself, the acting is by most of the cast flawless, Brad Pitt (Achilles) Eric Bana (Hector) Peter O'Toole (King Priam) Brian Cox (Agamemnon) all give top notch performances Sean Bean as(Odysseus) provides a typically excellent and often humorous performance in his supporting role. However Orlando Bloom (Paris) was as usual useless, when oh when will people realise this man (pretty boy) is not i repeat not! worthy of being a film alongside the likes of Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. He's clearly only in the film to attract legions of teenage girls to the cinema isn't that all hes used for nowadays?<br/><br/>As for Brad Pitt he has for so long been an underrated actor, for far to long seen as hollywoods elder pretty boy, but hes a fantastic actor and pulls off the role of troubled Achilles brilliantly, Achilles was nothing like i expected him to be like, in most epic movies where the hero or at least legendary soldier is practically invincible, Achilles shows that he isn't invincible but instead is simply far more skilled than his adversaries.<br/><br/>A number of key quotes by Hector and Achilles shows that although the movie is still respecting the mythical side of the story including the all powerful gods that really its leaning to the more realistic side of the story. To the annoyance of Iliad buffs of course, but it adds substance to the movie, its annoying when you know the hero in invincible but Achilles never once claims to be so, the character has far more depth than you'd expect capable of love, compassion, and wisdom, hes not just some barbarian lunatic cutting everyone up for the sake of it. He wants to live forever and using the talents he has he intends to achieve it Pitt portrays that perfectly.<br/><br/>The battles are exciting and far more realistic than most battles in movies, where the armies clash and formation, tactics, strategy go out the window for 3 minutes of frenzied hacking and smashing where the viewer hasn't got a clue whats going on. They show the bravery of the common man and the heroes in the story without going over the top its truly believable. All the while though there's a sense of myth and legend in the movie which is brilliant, but the movie never once allows itself to be dragged along by it and instead offers you a story that you can believe whilst still feeling the exciting and interest that made it a legend.<br/><br/>To summerise, there are few negatives to this movie, there really is, Orlando Bloom is poor (but we expect that) Diane Kruger is there fittingly because Helen of Troy is meant to have been incredibly beautiful but really thats all she is a shell no depth whatsoever. The manner of Achilles death is deeply irritating, the fact the useless Paris could kill him is a disgrace especially since Orlando Bloom was a joke throughout the movie really annoying.<br/><br/>The true successes of the movie are these, the way the characters themselves through superb acting destroy the legend of war, Hector and Achilles both tell us war isn't a game, its not glamorous, heroes do die, men fight wars not gods, there is always room for respect and honour. This adds so much depth to the movie, which could have just been silly and over the top. The realism and dispelling of the myths surrounding the story, the humanity of the characters they feel real to the viewer.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10 it does not deserve a lower mark for what it was."
"hakapes","7","3","6","22 January 2005"," Passion, blood, catharsis
","I often had the impression that Greek legends are just about people loving each other and being unhappy because of that. 'Troy' is an excellent example of that, as couples love each other extreme, but none of them have a beautiful life in peace. Men do love their spouse, but they love more pride, honor, glory and patriotism, so they leave to fight against each other, they are being killed on the battlefield and women are left alone in tears and perhaps this is why they are loved by their women. I think these are all real values, no problem with that; however on my list of values love for my wife and family comes before some honor of a victory.<br/><br/>If you are not familiar with the legend of the Trojan War, just relax, as the story differs from the usual storyline known from the most known interpretations - the 'Iliad' or the 'Odyssey' of Homer or from the later Roman book II of Virgil's 'Aeneid' - at several points and you would be probably upset examining which parts are conform to the ancient literature and which aren't. I don't see it as a problem, as in my understanding a legend is a legend because you can alter it if you like. So here's a little summary of Petersen's simplified version, which contains just the right amount of happening for a movie.<br/><br/>We have the Greeks on the West, led by power hungry king Agamemnon (Brian Cox). He loves war and takes every opportunity to conquer on a new land. This way, he turns almost all the neighboring kingdoms to be his servant and their soldiers to fight for him. On the West, we have Troy, separated from the Greeks by the sea, almost the only kingdom resisting the Greek attacks, ruled by the old and wise king Priam (Peter O'Toole). King Priam sends his two sons, the elder Hector (Eric Bana) and the younger Paris (Orlando Bloom), to make peace with one of the kingdoms in Greece, Sparta. However, in Sparta, Paris falls in love with Helen (Diane Kruger), wife of Menelaus (Brandon Gleeson), king of Sparta. So, on the way back, Paris simply eloped Helen on his boat. Here we go, Menelaus gets angry, wants his wife back, and king Agamemnon is just happy to have an apropos to gather all his armies and attack Troy. They sail over to the shores of Troy and the war begins. A key element in the war is super hero soldier and king of Myrmidons, Achilles (Brad Pitt) and the of course the large wooden horse. Though in the legends the war lasts for 10 years, here in the film it is only a couple of days.<br/><br/>However, in the 2.5 hours of the DVD, there was way too much blood for me. Achilles, then great Greek warrior opens the movie by a triumph over Boagrius, the we go on watching soldiers fall in various ways, however I just got tired having every ten minutes someone with his blood spreading out. Of course, this movie is about a legend of a great war, but it was just too much for me.<br/><br/>I was happy for the lack of Gods being shown on screen - people pray to them, call for them, there are temples and statues of them, but except a short appearance of the mother of Achilles in the beginning, fortunately no any God appears. We see things happening 'from the Earth' perspective and this way everything were so real compared to those 'fairy tale' like adaptations I had seen in my childhood. Otherwise, I got the most popular aspects of the Greek legend I expected: beautiful Helen taken away by Trojan prince Paris, the giant wooden horse full of Greeks and hero Achilles being hit on his tendon.<br/><br/>Before I started to watch the film, I had the impression this won't be a romantic comedy and it really wasn't. 30 minutes before the end I became sure that all heroes I got to like during the story will die soon - after several hits on each side, the war finally gets an ending when the Greeks pretended to withdraw, leaving behind them a large wooden horse with a raiding party concealed inside. When the Trojans brought the horse into their city, the hidden Greeks opened the gates to their comrades, who then sacked Troy, massacred its men, and carried off its women. Ergo there's no happy ending and you live the cinema with this certain though complete but pleasing sadness.<br/><br/>The extent to which the story reflects actual historical events is not known, and the version in the film remembers me to the Medieval European writers, who unacquainted with Homer at first hand, found in the Troy legend a rich source of heroic and romantic storytelling and a convenient framework into which to fit their own courtly and chivalric ideals; see the French 'Roman de Troie' (1154) or the English 'The Recuyell of the Histories of Troye' (1474).<br/><br/>In summary, the movie reaches to be monumental, with a huge number of extra, with pictures, colors, landscapes, costumes being magnificent throughout the film, however we don't get that outstanding acting like in Ben Hur or Cleopatra, therefore I rate it 7/10."

","Interesting distortion of the story; it helps if you don't remember details of the Illiad. This is Hollywood! Brad really bulked up for the role, but seems more like a snitty prima dona than a warrior who inspired warriors to follow him. Eric Banna is the best of the lot. Orlando Bloom largely wasted on an unattractive, wimpy role ... with eye liner, no less. Good effects and filming, but I thought the big-battle action sequences were a little superficial ... I had a hard time believing that the sword strokes were doing the damage implied. It seemed like, ""gotcha, fall down."" I'm quibbling ... it was entertaining."
"Macadamian-Nut","9","3","6","8 November 2004"," Eric Bana steals the show, but movie remains great nevertheless
","'Troy' is basically your typical action film: hot actors, gorgeous actress', lot's of gore and insanely long. But if it's extremely stereotypical, why did I find myself liking it so much? The reason is that, although 'Troy' is like every other action movie around, there are certain points that stand out. <br/><br/>One of these is Eric Bana. He is one of the most talented actors I have ever seen, and is completely overshadowed by well-known hotties Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom. Bana, however, completely stole the show for me, and for numerous other people. He led me into one of my crazy actor-obsession fazes, and I wasn't afraid to admit that he was the best part of this movie. In the movie, he got a lot of impacting lines which are laughable if you don't say them right. However, he managed to pull it off and his lines actually were inspiring. You grew to care about what happened to his character; more than any of the others.<br/><br/>This film is so underrated and I can't understand why. Sure, there are some cheesy lines and some bad acting, bad what film doesn't have that? A lot of people say that the storyline was weak and Hollywood-ized, and that might be true. But if you just sit back, stop thinking about everything that should have happened, etc., and watch the movie, you might find yourself enjoying it. <br/><br/>One thing that I really liked about the movie was that, though there was an evil character (Agamemnon), they did not show either of the two armies as being the 'bad guys' or the 'good guys'. They were equal, and by seeing both sides of the story, you can easily sympathize with both of them.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where you either love it or you hate it. I can't decide for you, but I suggest you give this movie a chance instead of letting it disappear into the B-film section. <br/><br/>9/10"
"dromasca","7","3","6","6 November 2004"," Exactly what I expected
","'Troy' is exactly what I expected. A big screen historic epics, taking a lot of licenses relative to the classic story, re-creating the ancient times via the perspective of the modern American cinema viewer. Some of the characters behave just like Western heroes, some other quote classic text while behaving more like contemporary American politicians or Afghan war-lords. Directing is quite straight-forward, the story is told well, acting is good - especially Peter O'Toole which is a pleasure to see again in a historic role after all these years. It is not art, and if you do not expect anything serious like Greek tragedy and you take it for what it is - popular entertainment - you can enjoy the fights and effects. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale."
"sshogben","10","3","6","2 September 2004"," Beautifully realized grand but human epic, faithful to the scope and spirit of its source
","The bare bones of this material should be familiar to everyone. Paris (Orlando Bloom), a Trojan prince, falls in love with Helen (Diane Kruger), the unhappy wife of Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), king of the Greek city-state Sparta. The trouble starts when Helen leaves Menelaus and runs off to Troy with Paris. Menelaus turns for help to his brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who as king of Mycenae is the most powerful man in Greece. Agamemnon seizes upon this excuse to assemble a coalition of Greek armies to attack Troy, the richest city and primary obstacle to Agamemnon's sole control of the whole region. Troy is ruled by an elderly king, Priam (Peter O'Toole), and defended by Hector (Eric Bana), Paris' older brother, who is heir to the throne and Troy's greatest warrior. Agamemnon and Menelaus lead against the Trojans a host of great Greek warriors, principally the clever Odysseus (Sean Bean), the giant Ajax (Tyler Mane), and the famous Achilles (Brad Pitt) who is believed half-immortal and thought invincible. What ensues is the Trojan War.<br/><br/>Thank the filmmakers for allowing themselves to be ""inspired by"" rather than slavishly copying the ""Iliad"". It is one of the great mercies of the film Troy that they spared us Homer's unendingly confusing superfluity of names and consolidated the primary roles while eliminating extraneous characters (most of whom existed in the ""Iliad"" solely to be killed off by one of the principals in some particularly gory fashion). Beyond this, most of the modifications of the source material serve to strengthen the story of clarify the motivations of the characters. For instance, by failing to mention that Helen also took a hoard of treasure with her when she left Menelaus for Paris, we no longer have to wonder whether Menelaus is more concerned with getting back Helen or getting back the money. His motivations become more straightforward, and thus more powerful to the audience.<br/><br/>Other modifications are equally successful in promoting the strength of the work. Director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"") sidesteps the whole literary controversy over whether Achilles and his friend Patroclus were, or were not, bisexual lovers by treating Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) as Achilles' young cousin and ward. In so doing, he sets up a particularly effective parallel structure between Hector's natural care and protectiveness of young Paris, on the one hand, and Achilles' for young Patroclus on the other.<br/><br/>In this film version, director Petersen avoids the active interference of gods in mortal events. Here whatever happens, happens, free of supernatural control. This is a legitimate directorial approach, and greatly empowers the story. It is not necessary for us, the audience, to believe in the Greek gods. It is sufficient that the characters in the story believe (or not, in the case of Achilles) in the power of the gods over their lives.<br/><br/>Thank the filmmakers, too, for toning down the explicitness of the violence:<br/><br/>reading Homer's detailed account of headloppings and disembowellings is quite revolting enough, but visualizing such on the screen would send a film straight into ""NC-17"" land. ""Troy"" effectively suggests the horrors of war and the sack of a city without actually making us watch babies being thrown from the walls.<br/><br/>The battle sequences in ""Troy"" are uniformly excellent, succeeding equally well in conveying both the grand scope of whole armies at war and the intimate consequences to individual persons. The unique nature of period combat tactics and techniques is effectively captured. The large battle sequences as well as individual encounters are each distinct and tell their own story: By the time Achilles (Mr. Pitt) and Hector (Mr. Bana) finally meet in their climactic duel, the audience is so effectively prepared and emotionally engaged that one can hear a pin drop in the theatre while the two mythic heroes battle it out. In these days of endlessly overdone computer-generated battle sequences, there is something so . . . fundamental. . . about reexamining the days of hand-to-hand combat between live men with real faces.<br/><br/>That the audience come to care so strongly about the fates of these characters is a great tribute to the exceptional performances of a truly exceptional ensemble cast, who take these mythic -- almost archetypal -- figures of legend and give them life and scope. Once again filmmakers successfully turn to a pantheon of great British character actors to bring power and feeling into even minor parts. Specially noteworthy are Mr. Cox for his endlessly ambitious Agamemnon and John Shrapnel for his aged adviser Nestor. I particularly enjoyed Mr. Gleeson's blunt and brutish Menelaus, who honestly doesn't seem to ""get"" why his beautiful young wife found him revolting. Mr. Bean's turn as the wily Odysseus is so enthralling one could eagerly await an ""Odyssey"" sequel. And the regal Saffron Burrows is so moving as Andromache, the loving wife and future queen of Hector, that their relationship quietly becomes even more powerful to the audience than the more explicitly rendered loves of Paris and Achilles.<br/><br/>Of the three principals, Mr. Bloom deserves especial credit for making the most of what must have seemed an exceedingly thankless part. He plays Paris with an earnest sincerity that not only makes us understand why Helen would throw all to the winds for his sake, but also succeeds in winning our compassion and forgiveness for the youthful blindness of an adolescent striving to become a man. The chemistry of Mr. Bloom's Paris with Mr. Bana's elder brother Hector (particularly well cast, as a pair) becomes one of the most interesting relationships in the film. Paris' question, ""Do you love me, brother? Would you protect me against any enemy?"", thus becomes the crux of all the conflict that follows. When Paris awkwardly dons his helmet before facing Menelaus, he appears to the audience a little boy lost in his brother's clothes; at that moment one can understand, finally, why the elder brother can never bring himself to sacrifice the younger, even to save his country.<br/><br/>Frankly, I expected to laugh at Mr. Pitt's turn at Achilles, thinking the part simply beyond his scope as an actor. But I confess Mr. Pitt did surprise me. After some rocky going early on -- the Phthia scenes filmed on Malta -- Mr. Pitt seemed to settle in to his character and make Achilles his own. Not a minor achievement. The film makes considerable effort to render Achilles a more sympathetic character, but it's an uphill battle. He still necessarily spends all that time sulking in his tent, for instance, for ultimately rather petty and irresponsible reasons that nonetheless produce major and severe consequences for all those who rely upon him. The character remains conflicted. If the legendary Achilles was half-immortal and hence neither quite a god nor quite human, this Achilles seems equally torn. The man ""born to take lives"" seems so remote from connection with the humans he kills that he seems almost bestial. There is a conscious identification with lions that seems quite deliberate: when Achilles stands atop the Trojan beach with other men's blood dripping off his helmet, he appears more ravening beast than human man. The film tries to gradually humanize Achilles through his interaction with Briseis (Rose Byrne), but that character is a composite of at least three different women from Homer's ""Iliad"", and at times that composite nature shows. The romance between Achilles and Briseis is ultimately less convincing in Achilles' resolution of his inner struggle than his relationship vis-a-vis his opponent, Hector. Only when Achilles can admit to himself that he has at last met a peer, an equal, and that in that meeting has destroyed a man worthier than himself, can Achilles finally connect with his own humanity. Then, and only then, can he die -- and the death of Achilles ultimately comes across more as a blessed release, than a tragedy. He has finally learned what it means to be human.<br/><br/>Mr. Pitt notwithstanding, however, the emotional core of both ""Troy"" and the ""Iliad"" remains not Achilles but Hector.<br/><br/>If the Australian-as-beeah Mr. Bana has been previously little known in the United States, that clearly is due to change. His compelling performance as the timelessly fascinating Hector is nothing short of brilliant. Hector is perhaps the most complex character ever drawn by Homer (which is saying quite a lot, given that a whole epic was devoted to Odysseus), and Mr. Bana brings Hector to life in full colour. A deceptively straightforward man, tragically caught between impossibly conflicting obligations. A surprisingly gentle and peace-loving man, doomed to spend his entire life at war. A young man, whose last shreds of youthful optimism and illusion were torn away by bitter experience long before time. A pious man, he honours the gods, but has learned through hard experience that the gods help those most who help themselves; he has learned to expect no miracles. He has seen, and probably done, terrible things, things that he shudders to contemplate, and yet must face everyday. A loving son, brother, husband, and father, he is torn by conflicting loyalties toward those he loves. Without direct political power, he nonetheless carries alone the full burden of the state. He is, in a real sense, trapped by his own success at achieving the impossible. One good man, tragically doomed by circumstances beyond his control. And yet . . . it is the manner in which he chooses to meet that doom which is itself most characteristic. Hector represents, in so many ways, the ultimate assertion of the human spirit.<br/><br/>Demanding role? Certainly. Yet Mr. Bana never falters. His powerful but sensitive rendition of Hector never ceases to move and fascinate, dominating the screen.<br/><br/>Leave it to a grand master, however: 70-year-old Mr. O'Toole has lost none of his skill and power, and his Priam at times steals the whole show. His timeless lament of a father for his slain son would move a stone to tears. After seven unsuccessful nominations, could a Best Supporting Oscar at last come within Mr. O'Toole's grasp?<br/><br/>Production values throughout are excellent. Cinematography and framing of shots constantly reinforce the duality of individual acts with epic scale consequences. Superior costume design keeps each major character ""period"" but distinct at all times, difficult to achieve in such a true cast-of-thousands picture. Even the musical score is worthy of note, especially the haunting ethnic vocal soloist (Tanja Tzarovska) whose tones echo over the destruction of war like the timeless voice of ageless loss and woe.<br/><br/>One final observation: Warner Brothers did themselves no service in their ill-conceived promotional campaign based so solely on Mr. Pitt. ""Troy"" succeeds, but succeeds as epic human drama ably realized by a truly outstanding ensemble cast. Mr. Pitt's turn as Achilles is only one part of this epic, and never really the most interesting part. More honest and effective publicity would have touted the timeless epic scope and broad emotional impact of the film: the Trojan War still interests us today because in so many ways it embodies every war, and the impacts of war on its characters still resound with an audience today because those choices, those motivations, and those impacts are equally real today."

","I know that the film completely departs from historical accuracy, but if we can just put that aside for the moment, we would all admit that this was a spectacular movie. Now, I realize that in a historical movie keeping with the actual story is somewhat important, but since the beginning of time, theater has required a willing suspension of disbelief. So, let's give the film makers that courtesy. Done... I was blown away by how beautiful this movie is overall. Eric Bana was sensational. He had the dark, loyal prince routine down to a T. Orlando Bloom, in turn, was fabulous as well. He truly captured the spoiled nature of Prince Paris. I was a little disappointed in Helen for the simple fact that she was too Western. I had pictured her as a dark beauty with a solemn nature, more like Hector's wife. The battle scenes were so beautiful that I found myself longing to be there watching and cheering my soldier, envious of the women on screen. This is caliber movie making in action. I recommend that anyone who didn't find themselves enraptured return to see this movie again with an open mind. You won't be disappointed!"

","Everyone needs a good epic now and again. Troy fits the bill in a number of ways - the scenery, battle scenes and sets are of epic proportions, so, in general, it is good to look at, an essential with any epic. The problem with the film is that it is boring! The story-line (such as it is) creaks (we can blame this on Homer) and a good deal of the acting creaks along with it, some notable exceptions being Eric Bana, Brad Pitt and Rose Byrne - however, the director and scriptwriter (not Homer!) must take some of the blame for the wooden-ness as it seemed that characterisation and plot came a lowly second to the more spectacular stuff. Diane Kruger as Helen is gorgeous and we should look out for her in the future as she proves to us that she can act. Orlando Bloom now seems typecast as a romantic character who is good with bows and arrows (not much future for him on this showing). And . . . because it is boring, it is much too long. Worth a look on DVD if you can fast forward each time somebody speaks and just watch the battle scenes."

Helen of Try, the face that launched a thousand ships, is cast as a standard Hollywood bimbo, there is nothing special about her at all.

"wmnews","Null","3","6","1 June 2004"," That's Greek to me...
","When they say this film takes place in ancient history, they ain't kidding. The time in which `Troy' takes place is so old the Greeks hadn't invented Greek accents yet and instead spoke with the tongue of the English. Sometimes when moviemakers think their film is going to be too long yet still needs some background storytelling, they throw in a voiceover or a scroll as they did in `Star Wars'. Here, they had to do both. It's explained to us the shaky political situation of the day and how the Greek King Agamemnon united them all under a tenuous empire  sort of. (You won't remember it all, anyway.) So Agamemnon sacks and pillages, (once again, the Greeks get yet another original concept stolen later by the Romans), with the help of the mightiest warrior the world has ever seen  Achilles. According to legend, (and I suppose there's nothing else to go on anyway), Achilles was the son of the mortal Peleus and the Nereid Thetis. He was the mightiest of the Greeks and was the hero of Homer's `Iliad.' Peleus placed the child in the care of the Centaur Chiron, who raised and educated the boy. She held the young Achilles by the heel and dipped him in the river Styx where everything the sacred waters touched became invulnerable, but the heel remained dry and therefore unprotected.<br/><br/>So Achilles, played dourly by boy-toy Brad Pitt, reluctantly agrees to fight for Agamemnon. `Imagine a king who fights his own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight?' Achilles says with Agamemnon responding, `Of all the warlords loved by the gods, I hate him the most.' This isn't what you'd call great protocol from the Human Resources Department. The Trojans, most notably Prince Hector and Prince Paris, make peace with one of Agamemnon's conquests, Bogarius. Unfortunately, Paris wants Bogarius' wife, Helen, stuffing his grape leaves, and they proclaim their love for each other and they sail away together. Though Hector is furious about what happened, he can't bear for his brother to be without the one he loves so he's OK with it. After all, it's not like the combined weight of the entire Greek military is going to come after them. Bogarius pleads with Agamemnon to bring his wife back, (she hadn't learned to boil water yet), and Agamemnon says, sure, why not? It's clear Agamemnon doesn't give a darn about Helen, he just wants to conquer the unconquerable walled City of Troy and now has an excuse to do so. But he'll need Achilles' help. Achilles' is forewarned if he goes he'll be remembered forever but he'll die. Oooh  love that Greek tragedy part. I wonder where they got it from? So the Trojans, (at least Helen will be having safe sex), welcome Helen with open arms. Now, what was it that Helen was complaining about? Did Bogarius beat her? No. Did he insult her overuse of makeup? That must've been it. Why did she marry Boagrius in the first place? Was it a forced marriage like Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley? Hmmm  they don't say. She was a Queen and she decided to throw it all away for Orlando Bloom who may look like a virile figure standing next to Johnny Depp on a pirate ship, but looks like salsa next to Eric Bana's Price Hector. And it's Hector that's the real hero of the film, not Achilles. Hector is understanding, sweet, subservient to Troy, while Achilles is bored with life because he thinks he can never die. Unfortunately, that part about being dipped in magical waters making him invulnerable never made it to the screen. Indeed, there are many references to the Greek Gods in the film yet screenwriter David Benioff never went there. Hector is upset that the God Apollo does not show his wrath when Achilles destroys his temple.<br/><br/>Now you and I are supposed to be sitting there thinking, `Well, duh, that's because there are no such things as the Greek gods.' Fair enough except Achilles wouldn't be Achilles unless there were Greek gods hence making the character who he is. Even Achilles admits he's seen the Gods and says, `The gods envy us... because every breath might be our last. Everything's more beautiful that way.' 	This is why Achilles is such an Olympian bummer. He's ticked off that he can't die like any other mortal and is in a conundrum of being a warrior without the beauty of being mortal he speaks of. But this is not brought to bear on the audience. You just see this really sour pseudo-philosophical adolescent natured adult who needs to go to Rocky Point and relax. Instead, he chose the battle seeking immortality in history yet seeking mortality on the battlefield. 	Achilles proves to be a really nasty mean spirited punk that you can't stand. But wait, that's really Brad Pitt. Who wants to dislike Brad Pitt? Even men think he's good looking and he's a fine actor. Try imagining Cary Grant or Tom Cruise as a bad guy. Not meant to be  maybe for John Travolta You want to like Achilles because he's Brad Pitt but it's clear you wish the guy would just die already. You never get a chance to see him hit with a spear through the heart and watch him live to shoot the arrow back at the attacker to his amazement. Perhaps Warner Brothers didn't want this to look like an episode from `Hercules' or `Xena: Warrior Princess.' 	Rule number one for movie stars should be never be in a scene with an actor that's a true superstar as is the case with Peter O'Toole. O'Toole plays the King of Troy making Pitt look like he'd never been in front of a camera before in one brief scene. 	A horse is a horse, of course, of course, unless it's a Trojan Horse. The Trojan Horse plot was pretty diabolical, even for Homer to write, but now it sounds like a `Pinky and the Brain' scheme. I can just here Brain saying, `Pinky, tonight we're going to build a wooden horse, get inside, and be hauled into the Trojan gates! Tonight Troy, tomorrow the world!' Narf. 	The script is finely tuned, the acting is above par, James Horner's soundtrack unfortunately is not memorable, though director Wolfgang Petersen's, (`The Perfect Storm', `Air Force One', `In the Line of Fire'), direction is more than capable. So, shell out those drachmas, and watch a Greek urn his place in history."

","TROY is a great film. This is what films are supposed to do, entertain, and this one does. I enjoyed it, and most especially the different reasons for the war and how it was handled. Brad Pitt did a good job in his role, as expected. Orlando Bloom did what his character called for, and more. O'toole carried great emotion and feeling to set up what was to come after the big fight between Hector and Achilles. But, the actor that stole the film was Eric Bana. Not only was he the best looking (Pitt is nice looking, but too pretty faced), extremely manly, noble, and the perfect actor for his role, his presence was felt at every important scene. But after the inevitable happens in the film, it seems that there becomes a loss and loneliness to the remainder of the it. The rest of the cast helped carry the film, and once the audience sets its eyes on the glory of the scenery and a war that was squeezed in such a short time, instead of the 10 years in the original story, it still makes for a great film. I give this two thumbs up.......There are great things in store for Bana.......his star has been cast!!!

Still others live longer than the original story had them survive, characters are changed up completely, and Achilles, who's body was supposed to be immune to daggers, swords, arrows, and spears, takes four arrows too many. I realize that it was only loosely based on the Homer epic, but enough is enough. There was no real reason to change that much of the story....it was fine just as it was.<br/><br/>Bana and O'Toole are both excellent, as is Burrows, but it left me sitting in wonder when it ended....is that what all the talk is about? Personally, I much preferred the mini-series, ""Helen Of Troy"" to this one."
"bolo_yeoung","Null","3","6","22 May 2004"," Worst movie ever? Let me ask you a question... Did you see Gigli?
","I have to say that I had been looking forward to this movie ever since I saw the trailer for the first time, but I went to the movie yesterday with very lowered expectations because of what I had read here (and because of the very bad things Swedish Movie-critic Orvar Säfström had said about it). But since my expectations were so low, I got positively surprised. It's not so bad that some of you claim. The acting, which has been very criticized, was overall OK. The only one that didn't work was Orlando Bloom, but that was compensated by the very good performances of Sean Bean, who in my opinion excelled the few times he appeared on the screen. Brad Pitt did all right, even thou it's hard to see an icon like him play such a famous character as Achilles. Every time he appeared on the screen I say him more as Brad Pitt then Achilles. This was not because of bad acting, but because of the contrast between these two. Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox all did their job well, nothing to complain about there. One thing a very much agree on thou is that the music was bad, almost very bad. Since I had read these posts before the movie I listened especially to the music, and I must say it sucked. The only theme that worked was the a little dark one that is played when the Greeks approaches Troy for the first time, but you probably don't remember it, and neither do I. I think this is the main problem of the film, since music plays a VERY important role in an epic film like this. Apart from these things, the movie was good to me. I know you can complain about the Hollywood ending, or the SOMETIMES exaggerated dialogue, but these are not big problems. I think the ending with Achilles getting an arrow in his heel and then get shot a few times in his chest, and then pull-out the arrows so the only one left when they find him is the one in his heel, is a very good thought of what might had happened if the story was true and no gods were involved. And please stop complaining about changes made from the book. A film is not the same thing as a book and cannot be treated the same. End of story. Another scene that was worth remembering was of course the fight-scene between Hector and Achilles, and as a fighting enthusiast I must say it was the best-choreographed fight-scene I've seen in a long time. I haven't really read 'The Iliad' yet, even thou I know the story pretty well, so I'm off to borrow it at the library as fast as I can. I got a little inspired, which is a good review for this movie. By the way, does anyone know if the rumor about Brad Pitt having a stunt-leg for this movie is true? I mean he looked pretty well fit on the upper body, got to check which training program he used.<br/><br/>Troy: 7/10"
"sith-7","9","3","6","25 May 2004"," Very Good.
","This was a superb film.  It is 'Inspired' by Homer, not based on the poem.<br/><br/>  Some have complained or criticised it for not being accurate.  It did not intend to be.<br/><br/>  As an action / hack and slash film it is simply brilliant.  The castings are all very well chosen.  Brad Pitt was in amazing condition, his years of training had obviously paid off.  Eric Bana also commanded the screen when he was focused on. Orlando Bloom as Paris always had me chuckling when he was trying to be manly and a warrior, simply too pretty and so was also well cast.<br/><br/>  I liked the twist on the cause of Achilles demise.

It showed that even a legendary warrior noted for not having loyalty,love or guilt can hide these things very well until truly tested from all directions. I cried for Troy and the fallen Achielles for the love he finally let through. Very moving piece of men,greed, love and pride the price each will pay for.

","Having been an extra on the Malta Unit I must say that at last my hunger for the screening of this movie has been partly satisfied.<br/><br/>Bloom (Paris) kicks of the Trojan War immediately at the beginning of the movie by stealing Helen and sneaking her below the deck of their sail ship<br/><br/>Brian Cox: his performance as the malignant Agamemmnon is outstanding as is the contrasting gentleness of Peter O'Toole's King Priam.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's Achilles, is a warrior best unleashing his sword after his opponents all attempted strikes fail; whether they come from spears, swords, or arrows, he parries them and dodges them in impulsive manner. His knee backward twist is the best avoiding those sword slashes. Even when training with his cousin back home, the fluidity of the motion is impressive. Defending as well as attacking their moves are unprecedented in all Hollywood epic movies. <br/><br/>Achilles strolls up the beach on his chariot and stands alone below the mighty Trojan walls and its warriors demanding to fight Hector (Eric Bana). The fight that ensues is a full spear / sword showdown with one winner.<br/><br/>What I found dragging is the common references to the gods by the Trojans. They depend on them too much as opposed to Hector, who insists on that it's the soldiers who defend Troy and not Apollo and his 'signs'. But I am sure the screenplay David Benioff adapted, left most of the Gods out. Perhaps that's why Achilles slashes Apollo's head off. <br/><br/>In fact this movie is not about Helen, or Paris and their love for each other. Its more about fighting, excuses to attack each other, deceptiveness, and finally a full surprise Greek flow attack at night through the Trojan gates. <br/><br/>Having seen this film last Sunday, 2 hrs. & 43min compared to the first screening of 3 hours, I feel that a lot was left out, referring to the fight scenes at night, and the aftermath of the burnt Trojan city. Because its not as bloody as people say it is. All the pulp was left out.<br/><br/>As to the digital work, I did not appreciate the scenery as much as I expected it to be however I did appreciate the new breed of stuntmen. The outcome when both armies meet with a mighty clash left goose bumps on my skin. <br/><br/>The movie in the end climaxes with Josh Groban's Remember, a soundtrack that gives a nod to Achilles's immortality ; was perfect for the end credits.<br/><br/>I'll watch it again and then if I'm still not satisfied, once again !"
"jcunningham-3","10","3","6","18 May 2004"," A superb adaptation of Homer's Iliad!
","The movie 'Troy' just released in May 2004 is a superb adaptation of Homer's 'Iliad'. Homer's massive epic of 24 books has been successfully reduced to a three hour movie. The plot line has been correctly truncated, so that the fundamental story of this drama is still clear and intact: the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon placed in the complex context of the politics concerning the Greek assault, and conquest, of Troy. The diction of the screenplay is perfectly balanced: it is at once mildly elevated, yet up-to-date and accessible. The casting is perfect: all the major characters are well acted; Brad Pitt, it turns out, is superbly cast as Achilles: he gives a completely convincing performance. The stunning cinematography, and excellent soundtrack, sustain and enhance the story. Director Wolfgang Peterson has given us a three hour screen adaptation of the 'Iliad', which succeeds on all levels -- above all, he has made sure that the story of the fall of Troy is the spectacle!"
"marcin_kukuczka","8","3","6","23 May 2004"," Ancient story with psychological reference to modern times
","Since I love ancient epics, I went to see this movie hoping to appreciate its splendor, like the one in CLEOPATRA or BEN HUR. However, while watching it, I realized that the aim of this movie is not only to show the story of the siege of Troy, like the movie by Robert Wise HELEN OF TROY (1955) did, to emphasize gorgeous costumes, the courage of great heroes or the love affair between Helen and Paris. Mr Petersen did another wonderful job thanks to which this film may be remembered for long. It has a certain psychological message.<br/><br/>It is noticeable to find a lot of such scenes that really touch human heart. The director beautifully showed the stupidity and misery of war. What is, in fact, war? ""It is young men dying and old men talking!"" I particularly like the scenes where the greed of Agamemnon is shown. He did not care for his brother and his recapturing Helen. He aimed at conquering Troy. That is what war means. The greed and ill ambition of one man that leads thousands of others to fight and die. How universal it is now!<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect presented in the movie are the fundamental thoughts of existence. Consider the moment when Achilles tells Briseis that ""gods envy us mortality since every moment can be the last one for us"". Isn't it purely psychological and universal?<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER: There is one thing, however, which I do not like about the movie. The choice of some cast. A lot of people go to see the movie because of Brad Pitt. He is a very good actor with nice diction. However, he does not look ""a stereotypical Achilles"". Even if Achilles could have been blond, Brad may be too destructive. The same can be said about Patrocles. Nevertheless, others are great for their roles, especially Orlando Bloom as prince Paris and Peter O'Toole as old king Priam. Consider the incredible scene when he comes to Achilles and asks him for the body of his son Hector. VERY MEMORABLE AND TOUCHING! So far, this is a best played scene of Priam coming to the Greeks!<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is worth watching but it has to be seen and INTERPRETED. If you see a reference to our times, then it is not only the admiration of costumes, locations, and ancient, passed stories..."
"jtsmillie","Null","3","6","17 May 2004"," More Hollywood than Homer
","I went to see ""Troy"" with an open mind. I was willing to accept Brad Pitt as Achilles, and I thought the casting of Orlando Bloom as the vain but ultimately ineffectual Paris a good choice. I was bolstered by the selection of Peter O'Toole (who is good at playing loonies) as Priam, and of Sean Bean (possibly the best supporting actor of his generation) as Odysseus.<br/><br/>The last three do not disappoint. Unfortunately, nearly everything else about ""Troy"" does: Homer's epic of a ten-year war is twisted so that the events of ""The Iliad"" appear to have happened within a week. Eric Bana, as the noble and ultimately doomed Hector, is never given a chance to rise above leaden dialogue before he's crushed by Pitt's garbled Achilles, although there are some genuinely touching scenes between him and Andromache (Saffron Burrows). <br/><br/>The greatest disappointment about ""Troy"" is that it weighs down truly exciting, sword-swinging action with thoroughly dull dialogue and predictable sequences. If the audience heard one more variation on ""This is a fight for the ages, and the names of us fighting it will be remembered forever"" or saw one more sequence in which some hero who had died valiantly was put to the torch by one of his warrior comrades, it would have been two too many.<br/><br/>Finally (and I know this will get me flamed from here to Homer's Styx), Brad Pitt looks awfully nice as Achilles, but he can't carry off a line. When he's not required to be showing off his personal-trainer-honed physique, he's delivering his admittedly more-wooden-than-the-Trojan-Horse dialogue in such a manner that the first half is unintelligble due to its speed and the latter half insufferably slow. ""What did you say, and would you get to the point?"" sums it up. <br/><br/>In short, by the time Troy finishes burning two and a half hours after the film starts, it's not a moment too soon. This could have been a fantastic epic had its adapters given their source the kind of attention Peter Jackson and company gave ""The Lord of the Rings"". They chose not to- and Troy suffers for it."
"AZINDN","8","3","6","22 May 2004"," Troy Sans the Gods?
","Troy is a great fun date film filled with exterior panorama shots that harken to the old David Lean Lawrence of Arabia views, and of course, Brad Pitt, who is buff enough to give a girl the vapors. Lordy!<br/><br/>However, for anyone who has ever read Homer, and has an iota of recognition of the Oddessey, the absence of the Greek gods is a major disappointment. Hollywood of course went for the love story between lesser characters to play up the roles of Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt, and this was more an annoyance when actors with chops including Peter O'Toole were on screen. The thin Hollywood pretty males looked decidedly underfed compared to the beefy Greek brothers from Sparta, and at times this was comical contrast in fight scenes between Orlando Bloom's Paris and Agamemnon. <br/><br/>The important and tender scene between Hector (Eric Bana) and his wife (Saffron Burrows) and infant son were all but thrown out with the bath water in this production as was the friendship between Achillies and Petrocles. Can't Hollywood just leave Homer alone if it wants to make a movie where a boy loves girl, girl runs away with the boy, and Greece goes after her with 50,000 extras. I enjoyed the spectacle, but missed the substance, however, Brad Pitt's pecs were a mighty rush of lust for the wide screen. Once he dropped his leather skirt, who cared!"

"hazel1","Null","3","6","17 May 2004"," Enjoyable, but could've been better
","Troy was an immense spectacle, beautifully filmed, wonderfully cast (with one exception), and given the time allotted followed the Iliad fairly closely. <br/><br/>However, some things left me with a lukewarm feeling. For instance, we never get the impression in the film that the war has been going on for 10 years, and for such an epic the song during the credits could've fit a bit better. But the biggest hurdle for me is to believe Brad Pitt is Achilles. It seemed to me the casting of Pitt in the role of Achilles was more of a marketing ploy than a wise casting decision. There are plenty of actors capable of carrying that role well, but I don't think Pitt is one of them.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast did a superb job, especially Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole, and newcomer Diane Kruger as Helen.<br/><br/>Overall, worth seeing on the big screen!"
"HumanIMDB","Null","3","6","17 May 2004"," I liked it, but the could have used more of the story.
","This was very much Brad Pitt's movie and it could have easily been called Achilles instead of Troy. I liked the movie even though Eric Bana's acting didn't seem that great and neither did Orlando's. The fight scenes seemed a fake (matrix style jumps and obvious CGI armies), but were good and expertly choreographed. I loved that they didn't make Achilles invulnerable but that he was just so much better than everyone else. Helen was very pretty as she should be since history calls her the most beautiful woman to have ever lived. I couldn't remember if there was a character named Briseis let alone if she was actually Achilles love interest as I haven't read it since Grade 7, but I looked it up and yes there was a Briseis and she was Achilles' love interest although the changed the story like they did with many other story lines in this movie. I was also upset that they ignored the entire Cassandra as well as many other ones that Helen of Troy covered, but that was a long mini-series. I also didn't like the fact that this was to be the greatest war ever fought yet they didn't even attempt to make it feel that the siege lasted 10 years.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie and the 'slimmed down' version of many of the stories but it could have been better.<br/><br/>Still, I give it a 'See it in a good theatre and rent/buy it when it comes out on DVD' rating."
"sbrocky","Null","3","6","16 May 2004"," Not Homer but OK
","I was disappointed by the way Petersen hasn't paid much attention to the plot of the Iliad. But then the words ""inspired by the Iliad"" came on the screen, and well, ""inspired by"" doesn't mean they have to stick to the plot. I just wondered: If you attempt to put such an epic on screen, why would you not make a few concessions less to Hollywood and call it a good adaption instead of a meagre echo of all those myths.<br/><br/>The gods had to go, I can see that as it would have been too long. Unfortunately, that makes Hector's death less heroic and Paris less of a coward. I did however love the way they showed Achilles's mother, a sea goddess, as a human with strong bonds to the sea. The Priam - Achilles scene was quite moving as well. I also liked Hector's hesitation when he saw that Helen was coming with them <br/><br/>BUT WHY did they have to invent the following:<br/><br/>1. All that my cousin, your cousin stuff between Briseis and Achilles. After all, Briseis was not related to the Trojan princes in any way, and Achilles did not fall in love with her, he just wanted her because Agamemnon wanted her too.<br/><br/>2. Achilles being killed after Troy was taken. The point is that his destiny is bound to that of his opponent Hector.<br/><br/>3. All those silver (presumably iron) armour - the Iliad takes place in the BRONZE age, they had bronze weapons!<br/><br/>4. Agamemnon's premature death.<br/><br/>5. The whole ""sword of Troy"" thing, and (worst of all) giving it to Aeneas.<br/><br/>6. Hector's wife and child escaping. The fact that these loveable characters are taken captive and thrown down the walls of Troy by Odysseus respectively shows the brutality of the war more than any other episode.<br/><br/>7. A couple of other points mentioned before but IMO these were the most important.<br/><br/>And yes, I have read the Iliad, large parts even in the original Greek."
"triple8","8","3","6","16 May 2004"," Where did the time go?
","This was an extraordinary movie but one's enjoyment of ""Troy"" will depend entirely on the attitude one has when going into the theater.<br/><br/>I knew the story from a very long time ago and while I remember the basic story I do not, I freely admit, remember the details. For me however, it did not matter how accurate the movie was because I went into Troy with the attitude that it would not be accurate at all. This IS Hollywood. Few movies of this type are gonna stick to the facts. There are many reasons to go see a movie. In the case of Troy, I went to be entertained. I wanted to be swept away into the exciting legend, into the adventure of it all. And I was. And that's why I would recommend Troy so strongly to people who want that particular movie experience. The movie was also well acted, exciting, touching, thought provoking and beautifully filmed.<br/><br/>Firstly-I will comment on Brad Pitt who has been getting a lot of flack for reasons that are beyond me. This was Pitt's problem in Legends of the fall too. He's simply to handsome for people at times to take seriously and that's doing both him and the moviegoer a disservice because he's truly excellent in this and his Archilles possesses intensity, fierceness-and humility. Pitt started off OK and got better, this wasn't an instant ""wow"" more of a slow burn. He managed to move me to tears in one or two scenes so I'd say he did his job. In fact, I will not fault the acting of anybody, all were good in their roles, but the two who it would be criminal NOT to receive Oscar nods are Peter O' toole and Eric Bana, both of whom were electrifying. This wasn't Pitt's fault, the other two just had more to work with. Diane Krueger was certainly beautiful enough to incite a war but her character was a bit cookie cutter, Helen's dialog WAS a bit weak, as was Orlando Bloom's, we never really know just WHY these two fall in love with each other, their interaction together was a bit weak, even their love scenes were a bit-well-DULL. I know Helen wasn't meant to be a main character but she could have been given a little bit stronger character development.I will say Eric Bana should become a household name after this performance, he was outstanding and O'Toole's scene with Pitt was as close to perfect as a movie scene can possibly be. Visually, the movie is amazing(the scenery etc) and the music was great too. I really do think this movie isn't just good but excellent. <br/><br/>In spite of all the positives, Troy's not perfect. There are a few other negatives I'll admit. The battle scenes were a bit gory but that is to be expected. What bothered me was the graininess of some of the battle scenes. Was it me or were there a lot of spots that were just blurry? All my friends noticed that too, the cameras seemed out of focus or something, that detracted a bit and is one of my only criticisms along with what I call ""The Blond factor"".<br/><br/>What I mean by that is this: where did Helen of Troy have blonde hair? Wasn't she a brunette?(I'll admit I could be wrong on that though.) In fact, everyone in the movie was so BUFF, it was a bit hard to take seriously at times. I don't think there's a female on this planet who could say that Brad Pitt did not look extremely handsome in this film, even if one isn't personally attracted to him, one would probably admit this guy looked extremely sexy. But he probably would have been taken more seriously if he had dyed his hair black and not been so BUFFED-there were so many shots of Pitt's muscles that after awhile, no matter how visually pleasing that may be, one has to think: yeah, this is how their planning to get people into the movie.<br/><br/>I don't mean to be overly critical at all because this was a truly extraordinary film but it did, at times, look like a party for a model agency with all those perfect people. EVEN THE BABY had those big blue eyes and sunny smile.... And: WARNING: END SPOILER: When Brad Pitt dies he sure manages to look absolutely stunning-I mean unlike everybody else, there's little blood or gore or ANYTHING-it's a bit much. However, those are minor quibbles because the movie's positives easily outweigh any negatives there may be.<br/><br/>I still think this is an easy 8.5 of 10 maybe even a 9-it's got a lot to like-action, adventure, intense Oscar worthy performances, humility, fun and very importantly, moves at an electrically fast pace which is why I chose to head this review: where did the time go. This is a three hour movie and by the time it ended I was puzzled because it felt like maybe an hour had gone by. That is the mark of good movie, when you not only don't notice the time going by but actually think it was way to short. Troy turned out better then I thought, they could have really botched this but as it was, it was about 2 points higher then I thought it would be(I thought maybe a 6.5 or 7). I think if someone comes into this with no other expectations then to be swept away for three hours they will like this. 8.5 or 9 out of 10 and I hope to see a few Oscar noms."

","Most people would think this is a good movie because of hot guys like Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana. Overall the movie was good, it did not really inspire me like the actual book did, but most people always say that the books are better than the movie. The fighting scenes were pretty good, but it wasn't anything new like lord of the rings, so the computerized men, sort of got old. <br/><br/>The best actors in that movie had to go to Eric Bana who plays Hector and Peter O Toole who plays Priam. They did awesome portraying those roles and should be honored somehow. Eric Bana was so perfect playing the honorable Hector. And so was Priam, especially when he talks to Achilles, about his dead son. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt, I was a little disappointed, though he had the handsome looks and great acting in other movies such as Snatch, Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club, he disappointed me with playing such a serious role of Achilles. Though, he did have to have arrogance and indifference throughout the movie, when he went to beat the big guy in the beginning, it seemed so simple for him, and i thought there should have been a scene where it could awe the crowd. Orlando Bloom played the weak and passive Paris, and it just seemed old him playing a role with a bow and arrow (not that girls will ever get tired of it)."

He was acting like a ""star"" he is and not ""Achilles"" the warrior he was supposed to be.. another thing in the first few shots he was just looking like ""Jeniffer Aniston"" :P hehehe.. His oh so American attitude(without any offense to all you lovely Americans out there) didn't match the theme of the movie since it was about ancient time Greece and troy.. Then there was Paris.. Orlando Bloom is one of my most favourite new actors in the Hollywood but Paris was simply the most stupid character to be portrayed in an epic like ""Troy"", enuff said. The only character that made sense was of Hector's and thank God Eric Bana didn't let us down. I was never satisfied with Eric Bana being in that movie, and always thought that some more well known star should have been casted.. but he surprisingly emerged as the winner and the only character i cared about during the whole movie.. As for the the movie it was about 2 Fs ""f**k"" and *fight"".. The thing i missed most during the movie is the feeling of being in an ancient time and feeling of an epic journey.. I still remember that when i first watched the trailer of ""troy"" i was soo thrilled and excited.. I missed that part during the whole movie..This movie is more for the fans of the STARS than the people looking for a good epic saga..

Overall probably the best movie I've ever seen, which is a tall order, I won over 500 DVD's and almost never give even the greatest movies a spot in my top 20.  The special effects didn't seem life effects at all, the immense size of the production was breathtaking, the plot was extremely accurately portrayed (with the exception of the lack of Gods and Goddesses in this version as compared to the Iliad)."
"Dennison327","7","3","6","15 May 2004"," Troy triumphs as expected.
","I must say that despite the negative reviews I've read about this movie before I saw it, I was actually impressed by it.  Ever since I saw the first trailer to this movie, back when ""The Matrix Revolutions"" was released, I was anticipating the release.  This movie, plus ""The Passion of the Christ"" were two of the biggest movies I've anticipated watching for the 2004 movie season, and just like ""Passion,"" I was satisfied with ""Troy.""<br/><br/>
Brad Pitt, who is Achilles, starts the movie off with his swordplay, as well as his arrogance.  But that was the man Achilles was.  Pitt puts Achilles in a good perspective as to the man he was in the Greek ages.  Pitt also keeps the movie going into its climaxes and other points.<br/><br/>But Pitt isn't quite the heart of the movie, Hector, played by Eric Bana, is.  He is a good man who loves his city of Troy, in which he holds the crown of the Prince of Troy.  He devotes his honor for Troy and his father Priam, played by the great Peter O'Toole.  Hector knew that there will be a time in which Troy would need his protection and honor, but it wouldn't have come so soon if it hadn't been for his brother Paris, played by Orlando Bloom.<br/><br/>I must say that Bloom is a good actor, but I, along with many others who have seen this movie, don't like his character.  I understand that Paris was very naive and cowardly, but then again, I thought Orlando Bloom was right in playing a role in which he wasn't the brave man he portrayed in ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, and in ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""  But he isn't the main flaw of this movie.<br/><br/>I have learned about Ancient Greek mythology way before seeing this movie, and I will only complain that most things in this film were completely inaccurate.  I'm not going to spoil things for everyone, but I will only say that if Homer were still alive, he would complain on how his poem, ""The Iliad,"" would have only been half the inspiration for this film.  Because that's about how much ""Troy"" had presented itself from the poem.<br/><br/>But the inaccuracy isn't enough to label ""Troy"" a bad movie, because it's not.  I still recommend this film to everybody.  If you have loved ""Gladiator,"" this movie will be loved by you too.  As for Bana, I believe he should get an Oscar nomination for his performance as Hector.  Good job, Bana!<br/><br/>Troy: 8/10"
"yak-yak","7","3","6","14 May 2004"," 7/10 Excellent acting, respectable dialog, terrific artistic presentation, bad direction, bad soundtrack, lacks momentum.
","THE GOOD: The acting was as good as I would expect from anyone. The characters were presented in a consistent way. The script was good, definitely held a few nice touches and avoided a few auto-complete phrases. The action, generally, was done well.<br/><br/>THE BAD: The soundtrack was annoying. Bah. Tried to be 'epic'. It was botched. The directing... This movie has no momentum. Just when you start to care what's going on, just when something interesting is happening or is being said, something mundane and pointless follows and you're back to zero. There was way too much time spent looking at ordinary things happening, large groups of people moving around, or pan shots of scenery. We all know that ordinary things happen and that large groups of people must move around. Normally this would be ok, except that such things killed the momentum of the movie and wasted precious screen time.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Generally I liked the movie for what it was, and I'm very very glad that the actors did a great job with a fair script; they saved the picture. 7/10"
"shorty007","10","3","6","8 May 2004"," All that I wanted -- and more!
","I had the chance to see ""Troy"" a week ahead of release, much thanks to a free military showing. Now, I'm excited for its regular release; ""Troy"" deserves to be #1 for several weeks.<br/><br/>It was everything I wanted it to be: entertaining, interesting, and filled mostly with action.<br/><br/>Normally, it's tough for an action movie to stand out in my mind, since they're my favorite and I see them all the time. I'm probably one of the few people in this world that didn't like ""Lord of the Rings"" because I thought it dragged on and had too much talking & not enough action. I didn't even like the last Matrix movie because some of the battle scenes repeated too many of the same actions. But ""Troy"", in my opinion, doesn't have these problems. It captured my attention so much that I had to remind myself to blink, and I didn't notice how long the movie was until after I left the theater.<br/><br/>The action sequences contained some original moves, were gruesome-as-needed, and impressively fast (not to the point where you can't figure out what's going on). Since I've never read ""The Iliad"", I found myself guessing during the most important battles, which probably heightened the experience for me.<br/><br/>As a young woman, I do have to mention that Brad P., Orlando B., Eric B., and Sean B. all looked very good, very sculpted. Again, the action was the reason I went (or maybe it was the free ticket), but much is seen of their bodies (especially Brad's), another bonus to this movie. The men wore very short 'loincloths', and everytime a man jumped up, it made you wonder whether they really wore anything underneath.<br/><br/>Some of the acting did seem a little stiff, but the fight scenes made up for it. I noticed a lot of shots with the actors just staring, a dramatic technique that I think was overused in this movie. But then again, I always stared back.<br/><br/>The music was forgettable though. At the beginning, it resembled ""The Passion"" too much.<br/><br/>But, for an action/adventure epic, I really loved ""Troy"", and I'm sure millions of people this weekend will feel the same way. I was captivated during the fight scenes, and I enjoyed the little bits of humor that were mixed into an already intriguing storyline. So, if you want to be thrilled for 2 hours and 45 minutes, go see this film!<br/><br/>And, ladies, don't forget to blink every once in a while! ;)"
"ash_sharpeone","8","3","6","25 April 2004"," Many changes from the work of Homer, still a good epic
","Okay- Never written a review before, but then again I have never been to a movie screening in such advance before. I don't think there are too many spoilers in this review. Again- I based my review on the movie alone, not the actual story of Troy or any of Homer's writings.<br/><br/>Just saw Troy in a screening. I didn't know for sure if it was going to be Troy becuase it was not announced until just before it started, but I had a feeling. I was planning to see this movie when it came out anyways so I was glad to see it early. There were still some color problems on film that they said they had yet to fix, but it sounded like it had a complete soundtrack (that I have to admit was kind of overbearing at sometimes)<br/><br/>
I can't really comment on the accuracy of the film to Homer's the Illiad because I'm not that well versed in the story, but this movie is definitely striving for epic. To me there was no defined ""main character"", becuase in the beginning, characters, including Brad Pitt's Achilles come and go off screen for up to 15 minutes or so. The beginning was a bit slow, and there were some elements in the very beginning that I heard others around me commenting on being unecessary as well.<br/><br/>Some Minor Spoilers Below-<br/><br/>
Diane Kruger (Helen) is very beautiful, and I read on some other post that there is a full frontal shot of her naked, sorry to disappoint the males, but that scene was gone from this version. There was a lot of leg from the male cast... which I, being a 21 year old female have to say that I enjoyed a lot. It was nice to see gratutious male skin instead naked girls for once.<br/><br/>
The battle scenes were alright (and I do have to say that I have seen my fair share of battle/war movies) but none of the choreography was that exciting or new.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom, god bless him, is hot, and you get a nice shot of him from about the hips on up naked. But halfway through the movie they give him a bow and arrow, and I could not help but think of him as Legolas. He makes the same facial expressions over and over. I have seen him in Pirates Of the Carribean also, but I had not seen the LOTR movies yet, so I cannot say whether I will always just picture him as an elf or not.<br/><br/>
For me, Eric Bana and Sean Bean gave the best performances.<br/><br/>
I have never been a huge Brad Pitt hater or lover and I don't think he did a bad job by any means in the movie, I just don't think he had enough redeeming qualities by the end of the movie. He didn't really seem like a likeable enough hero to me. I could be way off on this, perhaps thats exactly how Homer wrote it, but Achilles ""Hero's journey"" was just not complete enough for me.<br/><br/>There is definitely enough blood and shots of Brad Pitt's rear for the movie to be rated R. I can't see it as PG-13 unless they trim down a lot of the battles. The movie ran just about 2 hours and 40 minutes without end credits.<br/><br/>
I would still recommend this to friends, it was a good escapist movie and a good way to spend a few hours. I wasn't at all disappointed in it on the whole, it could have been better, I would like to see what changes they make if any, for the theatrical release. I think it well do very well in the box offices, but as for Oscars? well.......I guess we'll just have to see how the rest of the movies pan out to be in 2004."
"noralee","2","9","27","17 May 2004"," 2 Minutes of Eye Candy Brightens A Long, Stiff Epic
","My viewing of ""Troy"" was helped by my son's exegesis, courtesy of two years of Ivy League reading of Dead White Men's civilization. He pointed out the legend of Troy isn't just based on Homer but also Virgil's ""The Aeneid,"" among other sources for the Trojan Horse legend, and he approved of Aeneas's sudden appearance in the last few minutes of the film. As I haven't yet started my summer reading of Homer and Virgil, I'll depend on his comments.<br/><br/>Paris's wimpiness was Homeric, especially in his use of the bow & arrow, as Homer strongly feels that archers are cowards and Real Men use spears and swords. Gee, and I thought it was Orlando Bloom being ""Legolas"" again from ""Lord of the Rings."" All the best scenes - such as Hector saying farewell to his wife, the consequences of Achilles' cousin in battle, Priam begging for Hector's body (with Peter O'Toole wiping Brad Pitt off the screen with his acting)-- were straight outta Homer. <br/><br/>The guy in front of me complained that a review he'd read ""had given away too much of the plot."" Gee, 3,000 years of literary analysis seems to have passed this guy by. But, then, as the arrow hits Achilles, there were a good portion of people who gasped and said ""Oh! His 'Achilles heel'!"" I couldn't help laughing when Achilles bellowed for Hector as if that's where the word ""hectoring"" must come from. <br/><br/>Leaving out the quarreling gods' manipulations of humans leaves out a good part of the legend, but my husband thought a modern audience wouldn't buy magical excuses. People got killed off who didn't die in Homer just because the leaden screenplay had turned them into figures that the audience would want dead. Of course that would leave several Greek playwrights high and dry as they dealt a lot with the aftermath of Trojan War soldiers. <br/><br/>I got a kick out of Helen and Paris's adultery being treated like the Tonkin Gulf incident as just an excuse for the king's imperialistic intentions. The effort to get us to sympathize with a young woman trapped in an arranged marriage to an older lout was weakened by the model's non-acting (yeah there's been a lot of jokes in reviews about how many ships this face deserved), but she managed to be quite heroic in her nude embrace against Paris's metal armor. <br/><br/>Pitt's spoiled surfer dude is actually very close to Homer's portrait of Achilles, according to my son, and Homer did report on his constant squabbling with the king about a woman captive. As for me, I had no doubt that she wasn't going to resist Achilles when her first sighting of him is naked and covered in sweat and the blood of her fellow Trojans. I was wondering more if Brad's glistening, very impressive body could possibly really be all personal training and had any prosthetics as I don't recall any interviews with him during shooting that had him THAT muscle-bound.<br/><br/>I did think the best parts of the movie were the 2 minutes altogether here and there of beefcake (including Eric Bana, who also movingly portrays Hector as a devoted family man, and a quickie shot of Bloom, though mores the pity none such of Sean Bean as Odysseus) that can wait to be seen until folks post screen shots on the Internet from the DVD, with the sound off so as not hear Pitt's wandering accent and ineffectual declamations. The major difference between this very long movie (after all the Trojan War did last some 10 years) and '50's sword-and-sandals epics is now the camera can go quite seductively a few inches lower on the hunks. <br/><br/>The leaden directing tried to use the bombastic music to make the action move while the dialogue was just sillily stiff. I stayed through all the credits and wasn't surprised that I didn't recognize any of the special effects shops as the cheesy boats and soldiers looked like the old ""Jason and the Argonauts"" movies, resonating like Pitt's voice-over in the cartoon ""Sinbad"" last year. <br/><br/>Along with the hand to hand combat, one of the few imitations of ""Gladiator"" that almost works, Tanja Tzarovska and the Bulgarian Women's Choir do a fair imitation of Lisa Gerrard's Oscar-winning soundtrack contributions. <br/><br/>As to Homer's stirring tale of war, politics, family, and loyalty that has echoed through millennia, the only lesson that all the women and at least 10% of the men will take away is that Achilles was eminently beddable. So if this film gets more people to use condoms, it will have been a success."

","I'm a huge fan of Brad Pitt, but I guess even the best slip every once in a while. Too bad for a movie that carried so much hype (great trailers).

The cast was great, but the script didn't fit. The movie is still entertaining though, great fight scenes, pretty faces and even good acting (Eric Bana). Gladiator is 10 times better than this epic, hands down. I love Brad, but Achilles just wasn't the right role for him.

But true to 'Clash of the Titans'fashion,which depicts King Kepheus,Queen Cassiopeia and their daughter Andromeda as white even though they rule Ethiopia! This movie can't be mentioned in the same breath as ""Gladiator""! This omission was no accident, Peterson and all of the people associated with this film know full well of Homer's affection for the ""blameless Ethiopians, the tallest, most handsome of men, favorite of the Gods"".

Since when is ancient Greek sword fighting akin to East Asian martial arts?<br/><br/>The 9 or 10 year Trojan War is condensed to about 2 weeks.  And Achilles, who had a male lover in Homer's epic about the Trojan War, is made safely hetero for the homophobic audiences of our modern age. Achilles (in the real story) refused to fight at one point, and was only convinced to return to the battle when his lover, Patroclus, was killed by Hector.  In the movie none of these key facts even exist.  The story is totally re-written.<br/><br/>There's way too much graphic violence.  Way too little story.

","Huge pre-release hype may have destroyed ""Troy"" as much as anything else. This long, drawn-out, dull, pretentious, silly and highly disappointing epic shows that tons of money, a great cast, an excellent director and amazing technical and visual effects are not enough to overcome bad writing and poorly executed dialogue. This is of course based on the musings of Homer, a writer and philosopher from Greece who lived about 800 years before Christ walked the Earth. ""The Illiad"" is the inspiration; it is a long poem that doubles as a novel which focuses on a very strange mix of mythology, fact and opinion. Helen of Troy (Diane Kruger) cheats on her Greek husband (Brendan Gleeson) with the youngest son (Orlando Bloom) of the king of the titled location (Peter O'Toole). Kruger and Bloom end up fleeing Greece and a war is declared. The ruler of Greece (Brian Cox) has dominated armies because of the excellence of the world's greatest warrior (Brad Pitt). There are strained relationships abound though as Cox and Pitt do not get along at all, even going so far as using military man Sean Bean as a liaison. Also Troy may have a hero of their own as O'Toole's older son (Eric Bana) could actually be Pitt's equal. Bana's captured cousin (Rose Byrne) gets close to Pitt and sees something in him that no one else seems to see while Bana's beautiful wife (Saffron Burrows) worries constantly about the fate of her husband and also the fate of her home. ""Troy"" sounds more interesting than it is. Cox and O'Toole are dominant as the head honchos, but everyone else seems like they were just discovered playing beach volleyball on a tropical island and have no acting talent. The cast looks good as the men are muscle-bound and the women are red hot, but really the performers should have spent their time with acting coaches instead of personal trainers. This is a hard film to listen to because it just does not sound good (this is because of the screenplay and the crazed battle sequences). When the movie shows life through land battles they stop abruptly and another long stretch of empty conversations start up. Director Wolfgang Petersen really drops the ball here unfortunately as he cannot cope with the meandering script and he is left to try and save the production with spectacle and action (neither helps much though). A wonderful role by O'Toole is demolished by lack of screen-time and a total disregard for the complexities of his character. Just imagine ""Gladiator"" with its good parts taken out and you have ""Troy"", a gigantic disaster of epic proportions. 2.5 out of 5 stars."
"White_base_groupie","1","4","10","17 May 2004"," Murder has just been committed, here...
","Did you people see the same movie...? I wish that I could post my entire review which was originally four pages, but I condensed it and also included full out excerpts. Sorry, I tried.<br/><br/>What Wolfgang Peterson has done has taken a magical tale and taken the magic right out of it. No gods, no beauty that launched a thousand ships, no prophecies. In fact, when the gods were mentioned it was extremely sacrilegious. It reminded me too much of how people act in modern days, and had the movie been set then it would have been okay. But back then, there was no science to disprove the gods, and in the book everyone, even the cocky Achilles, fears the gods. When he beheaded that statue of Apollo my expression matched that of the guy who saw him do it. No Greek, or Trojan, would dare to defile the Gods. Atheism did not really exist back then.<br/><br/>Another one of my complaints was the glorification of the Trojans. First off, because there were no gods to start the war or keep it going they placed that burden on Agamemnon, who may have been a jerk but was no imperialist. The movie absolutely made you HATE Achilles, like you do in the book, but unlike the books they don't show enough of the other Greeks to redeem the entire side.<br/><br/>And yes, the ""romance."" I do not understand how anyone who did not know the true reasons for the war could honestly sit through and think that the romance was nothing more than two spoiled brats condemning more than an entire kingdom for their selfishness. Even if the actor and actress involved in it, Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom, had any chemistry-which they did not-I do not see how any romance could be justified. The problem was the movie kept attempting to make you like it. Even Hector, who in the real version is constantly admonishing Paris for his selfishness, seems to support the two. The movie, of course, says otherwise, but Paris loved Helen no more than a farmer loves his prize pig. She was a bribe, an object. <br/><br/>But because we're supposed to like Paris, and the romance, the movie continues to go out of its way to tell us how unhappy Helen was with Menelaus. And certainly, one cannot disagree, as Menelaus is shown as old, unfaithful, bulky, and brutish when in the book Homer constantly goes out of his way to tell us how handsome, young, and honorable Menelaus is. The movie makes him say that he only wants Helen back so he can kill her himself, when in the book he says nothing of the sort. But no, we're supposed to hate him; Helen continually says things like ""Everytime I was with him I felt like walking into the sea and drowning myself,"" and ""Sparta was never my home. My parents sent me there when I was sixteen to marry Menelaus."" Never mind the fact that Helen was actually from Sparta, and Menelaus from Mycenae, who inherited the throne when he married her. And never mentioned is the Oath of Tyndareus, in which all of Helen's suitors pledged to protect her marriage, which Agamemnon and Menelaus invoked after Helen left for Troy. My guess would be this is because it would reveal the fact that Helen herself actually chose to marry Menelaus, and we simply cannot have that. <br/><br/>Paris himself is glorified in a way that he certainly does not deserve. In the movie he is the one to suggest fighting Menelaus one-on-one, and rather than going home to have a nooner with Helen like in the book and being yelled at by Hector, in the movie he cowers behind his brother's legs and Hector says nothing. Such a scene epitomizes how the movie treats Paris, like this naïve but well-intentioned hero. Rather than being hated by the city for instigating a war against them like in the book, Paris is loved by Troy. Which makes no sense.<br/><br/>The movie omits, or worse gets wrong, simple details that would have enriched it. For example, they constantly show the ancient Greek burial rituals-and get it wrong every time! I knew this because the fact was explained in a Greek mythology book that I'd read in grade school-grade school, for crying out loud. Speaking of grade school, the knowledge of mythology itself appears to be at that level. The only gods mentioned are Apollo, Artemis, Zeus, etc-mainstream ones. They constantly refer to Charon, calling him the 'Boat Man.' I really was just waiting for someone to ask, 'You mean CHARON?'<br/><br/>Other things constantly screwed up are character backgrounds. I already mentioned Helen, and how I wish that would have been the only mistake. But, oh no, it was not. The most glaring to me was when Hector tells Paris an anecdote from when he was ten. In actuality, because he'd been predicted to be the downfall of Troy, Paris was raised as a shepherd until one day in his early adulthood, Cassandra recognized him as her brother and he was realized to be a prince of Troy. Okay, so maybe they were trying to be realistic, but it was these kinds of eccentric backgrounds that make Greek tales so magical.<br/><br/>SPOILER AHEAD <br/><br/>Far from beyond bastardizing Homer the movie goes on to kill off other stories. Let me just tell you that the movie kind of gets who lives and who dies totally opposite.

Orlando Bloom does not impress at all and when it comes to Brad Pitt, he is as wrong in the film as Gollum would be in Finding Nemo. It is obvious that Pitt is (almost) the only one who frequently is posing naked (well...). His well shaved face and waxed body is so pathetic that it makes me laugh. He delivers his lines in a low register without any enthusiasm at all. And so is Bloom. The only one who impress is Sean Beam who acts his part as Odysseus, brilliantly.<br/><br/>James Horner's score is beautiful. If it would be in a different film, that is. I have to admit that I am sick and tired of bombastic background music that has no connection at all with the film. The music takes you far away from the time the films is telling and that is disturbing in every way. But the biggest problem is the script that really doesn't give the actors a chance to do a good job.

","The line ""Is this the face that launched a thousand ships?"" is from Christopher Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, in reference to Helen, the wife of Greek King Menelaus, stolen off to Troy by the spoiled-brat prince Paris as desired reward for deciding that Aphrodite was a pretty good-looking Goddess. One would think that Marlowe's having entered this line into the history of English literature would be enough to preserve it for us, but apparently the makers of Troy felt we needed a reminder; so when Menelaus and his brother Agamemnon decide to sail in pursuit of Helen in this film, one of them just has to say ""We'll need a thousand ships!""<br/><br/>There are about ten other lines of dialog in the whole movie, which the audience hears repeated by every major player in some form or other, but the one heard most often is ""my name will be remembered throughout history!"" or it's 2nd person variant, ""Your name will be remembered throughout history!"" Occasionally one even hears the 3rd person variant, ""His name will be remembered (etc.)!"" I can no longer remember who actually says these lines in which order, because all the actors act the same, and perform the same actions, and maintain the same low-level of technical (im)perfection. I think somewhere in this film is Peter O'Toole (God forgive him!), and was that Brad Pitt pretending to be the fabled Achilles? No, I don't believe it, no producer would be that low!<br/><br/>Somebody wrote somewhere that this film was based on Homer's Iliad; that's like suggesting that Disney intended to make a Mickey Mouse cartoon based on Hamlet: ""To hee hee hee or not to hee hee hee - whaddya think, Pluto? - Hee hee hee - down boy!""<br/><br/>This film makes Hollywood the number one target for a terrorist suitcase bomb; but apparently their brains are so addled there, they probably wouldn't notice the explosion. My dog writes better dialog than anyone speaks in this film, just by banging on the keyboard at random with her paws. And did I mention the horrific ""acting""? Will someone please send Orlando Bloom to drama school before he gets any older? And if Brad Pitt wants to be the next TV Hercules, let him audition for that part, and leave these god-awful pseudo-epics alone.<br/><br/>There was clearly a lot of dough spent on production of this film; well, fools and their money are soon parted; so a word to the wise: don't spend a penny to see this; remember what your mother told you about self-abuse - do it and you'll go blind.<br/><br/>The gods look down, and puke."

A good actor should bring me to care about his character within the first minute. Now I'm not saying Brad Pitt is a bad actor, but it was either his acting or the sleaziness of the character (or both or all three) that prevented me from really caring if he lived or not. Yeah, he had his good qualities, sure, but the first thing I want to see of a hero is not him lying naked in bed with two naked women. Sorry.

"pietderver","4","3","7","20 September 2005"," very poor story
","Some of the reactions here are overreacted, but it is not a very good movie. That the Troian Horse is not in the ""Ilias"" from ""Homeros"" (stupid English Homer)is not a problem at all. The movie is a story about Troy, it is not a movie version of the Ilias.<br/><br/>The Ilias is just one of the many stories about Troy and the Greek and Trojan heroes. There is also the Odysse, but still many, many more. Stories of the stealing of the Paladium by Odysseus and Diomedes, the story of Palamedes (who was responsible for getting Odysseus into war, and was there for hated by Odysseus. Odysseus tricked him and he was accused of treason and then murdered. His father than set up many of the wives of the Greek heroes against their husbands, and also caused some returning ships to shipwreck), etcetera, etcetera.<br/><br/>And what a nonsense that Achilles was not gay in the movie. He is neither in the stories! There are aspects that can support the suggestion that he is gay, but it could just as easily have not been. That is even more likely. So not taking that view on Achilles was certainly not wrong. The same counts for the part of the gods. Why should they be in the picture? They could, but it is not a necessity. The heroes have most likely really existed, the gods of course not. So why us them in the movie? Only because they play a role in the story ""Ilias"". And if it was to be a filming of the Ilias, there should also be an important part for Diomedes. In the Ilias he is, together with Achilles, Hector, Agamemnon, Paris and Odysseus, one of the most important characters. He plays a far bigger role than Priamos, Menelaos, Patroklos, Nestor, Aeneas and Ajax, for example. But in this movie he plays, like in most Troy-movies/series, no part at all. However, this movie is not the ""Ilias"", but a (bad) story about Troy and some of the heroes.<br/><br/>But what is bad in the story is that too much is altered. - Menelaos is killed?? In fact, he goes home with his wife Helena after the war and is king of Sparta for a long time afterwards. Menelaos is not the biggest hero of the Greeks, but in this movie he is a monster!! What a big brute. The casting does not look good at all. In my opinion Brad Pitt is a good Achilles and Orlando Bloom a good Paris. But Menelaos is not at all as you picture him from the stories. - Helen flees with Paris?? Paris is killed bij Filoktetes and Helena goes home with Menelaos. - Agamemnon is killed by Paris?? In fact, he is killed bij his own wife Klytemnaestra after the war, when he just got home. Achilles was in the Troian horse?? He was already dead before Troy was conquered. - Paris does not know Aeneas, who in real was married to his sister and a son-in-law of Priamos. - Ajax is not killed by Hector. He goes mad and kills himself after he lost the armour of Achilles to Odysseus (Ullyses) after Achilles is killed. Too many important parts are wrongfully altered in my opinion. I think the aspect that the war lasted 10 years (and the warriors all knew each other) is important in the stories. Most of them are sick of the war. They want to go home. In the movie the war seems to last only two weeks????<br/><br/>So afterall, not very good at all ..."
"Buddy-51","6","3","7","11 July 2005"," uneven though sometimes rewarding film
","Wolfgang Peterson's ""Troy"" is an attempt to recapture the look and feel of those sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950's and 1960's - those multi-million dollar, wide screen extravaganzas that helped lure audiences away from their television sets at home and back into the movie houses they had so recently abandoned. As is to be expected, ""Troy"" shares many of the strengths as well as many of the weaknesses of those earlier films.<br/><br/>On the positive side, ""Troy"" provides us with the pleasure of watching history (or pseudo-history in this case) unfolding on a grand scale with events greater than ourselves being enacted on the screen. It also boasts spectacular battle sequences with thousands of extras (or the computerized equivalent thereof) stretching back as far as the eye can see. On the negative side, the movie suffers from over length, corny dialogue and banal characters who frequently get lost on the vast canvas of the film. The good news is that, for the most part, ""Troy"" manages to triumph over most of its weaknesses.<br/><br/>""Troy"" is based very loosely on ""The Iliad,"" the epic poem by the Greek writer, Homer. So loose is it, in fact, that the screenplay dispenses completely with the gods and goddesses who play so crucial a role in the original tale and, instead, concentrates exclusively on the humans who are left on their own to act out the drama. Those characters read like a Who's Who of great mythological figures. On the Greek side, we have Achilles, the pouty warrior who sits out most of the fighting because he feels personally slighted by the king who doesn't appreciate him the way he should; Agamemnon, the arrogant chieftain who is more concerned with personal glory than with doing what is right; Menelaus, the impulsive cuckold who has no compunction about taking his nation to war over a personal humiliation; Odysseus, the pragmatic fighter who tries his hardest to get Achilles to see the error of his ways; and Patroclus, the impetuous youth eager to prove his mettle and his devotion to Achilles on the field of battle. Lined up on the Trojan side are Hector, the sensitive tactician; Priam, the wise king and loving father of Hector and Paris; Paris, the callow youth; and Helen, the world's most beautiful woman, for whose sake the epic battle is ultimately fought. In fact, it is Paris' ""abduction"" of Helen from her Greek husband, Menelaus, that inspires that nation to launch a thousand ships, cross the sea to the fortified city of Troy, and do battle with the Trojans.<br/><br/>Because of the quality of the source material, ""Troy"" boasts a slightly more complex and conflicted hero than we are used to finding in action/adventure films. For even though he is reputed to be the world's most invincible warrior, Achilles is also petulant and spoiled, quick to anger and often more concerned with amending personal injuries than with safeguarding the welfare of his own countrymen. The squaring off between the two bitter rivals, Achilles and Hector - two men who, under different circumstances, might have been the best of friends - is excitingly well done and suspenseful. Ditto for the scene in which a mourning King Priam slips into the tent of his enemy to beg for the body of his son. On the other hand, Achille's love affair with the Trojan ""war prize"" Breseis emerges as pure Hollywood hokum. And poor Agamemnon has become far more of a conventional villain in this version than he is in ""The Iliad."" Although the screenplay stays relatively faithful to the broad outlines of ""The Iliad""'s storyline and characters, it can't duplicate the beauty and soul of Homer's poetic verse. The closest the writers seem to be able to come is having the characters repeat over and over again to one another that men for thousands of years will still be speaking of Achilles, Hector, Troy, et. al. and the events in which they are engaged. All this pretentious, self-reverential speechifying merely succeeds in throwing us out of the drama every time someone utters one of those ""prophetic"" lines.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Brian Cox, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne and Sean Bean round out the cast, but it is the veteran actor Peter O'Toole who, as Priam, delivers the one truly compelling performance. It's also nice to see Julie Christie in a movie again, although her role as the sea nymph, Thetis, Achilles' mother, is too inconsequential for her to have much of an impact.<br/><br/>""Troy"" is little more than an Illustrated Highlights version of ""The Iliad,"" but for those unfamiliar with the work, it serves as a decent enough introduction for those willing to take on the real thing."

","I have to say this was a wonderful film and does a pretty faithful depiction of the original text. (the few times it strays are plot motivated, and work well) Brad Pitt turns in a top notch performance, as does Eric Bana. Sean Beam and Brian Cox consistently provide terrific performances as well. Peter O' Toole also gives an incredible performance and one of the best portrayals of a king I have ever seen. The major disappointment I have is the terrible job the director of photography did in this movie. Not just are many of his shots unmotivated, but some are just downright awkward and even hurt the feel of the film. I have certainly heard of the Dir. of Photography having a hand in the success of a film, but this is the first time I have seen one hurt a picture. I also question the directing in general; anybody can make a great epic from such a great text, and David Benioff wrote a terrific screenplay. It seems that Wolfgang Peterson might've had his work cut out for him, especially with such a strong cast. The auteuring here relies upon the story and the actors who portray it, and that maybe works for the better."

","I need to make something clear to the literati here. For what it's worth, a lot of us have read the Illiad and heck, many even enjoyed it. But - and here's the kicker - THIS IS A MOVIE. A MOVIE. I have every suspicion that portraying the events as they 'actually happened' would make a fine MINISERIES. But of necessity for the medium, they chopped up your beloved epic. And if we *really* wanted to get down to it, the events you so desperately seek aren't found only in the Illiad either. Get over it. To the question of whether this is a great movie - no, it's not a great movie. But it isn't a 'bad' movie either. The central characters are portrayed as they needed to be - flawed and invariably compromised by their actions. Nobody's acting to eat the scenery; things are played in a rather straightforward manner. I respected the effort put into the movie and mostly the fact that the ""Bradster"" wasn't allowed to run away with things... which the studio would have loved. Yes, the movie has flaws, but it is neither a disaster nor an classic. This movie won't be fondly remembered. But it ought not be completely dismissed either. It warrants a 6-7 out of 10 simply for being able to keep people attentive to the goings on (please oh wise literati, show us *your* even moderately coherent script comprising dozens of characters) and maintaining at least a semblance to the material. If it gets someone turned on to the old Homie's epic (epics actually - The Odyssey and the Illiad), then I say good on ya Wolfgang. I'll also point out that the studio that produced Lord of the Rings *guaranteed* 3 movies. Wolfie and his crew got 1. This is a good effort at making a mainstream movie from exceptionally difficult material. And besides, even Herodotus was skeptical about the stories he heard. So give it a rest, bookworms. Everybody knows movies and books are *VERY* different animals - why don't you lot?"

And it definitely is a lot more than Brad Pitt moving around the scenery.Don't get me wrong, folks, the guy is handsome but it takes much more than that to make a really good movie, especially this kind of movie.In my opinion a movie about old legends and myths or about history should reflect them as accurate as possible and this movie doesn't do this at all.From it's very building the city of Troy had a special relationship with the Gods,according to the legend.Where are them, the Gods of Ancient Greece?Where are their plots and quarrels that influenced the course of the war?Where is Heccuba (Priam's wife)?Why doesn't Achilles die before Troy falls?Oh, i see, it would have taken Brad out of the movie...Come on, people, the film should have been named Brad instead of Troy cause it is all about him. And trust me no one would have seen the difference.<br/><br/>As i really enjoyed the Greek myths and legends, being obsessed with them and reading them over and over again during my childhood, this film annoyed me a lot.In my opinion the screenwriter and the director did not have the right to change the legend that much.It is already another story...just the names are the same. The only thing i liked about the movie was the conflict between Achilles and Hector although i saw it according to what i read a long time ago...A conflict full of drama and heroism (Achilles knew that after he kills Hector his own death will follow and Hector saw in Achilles his most powerful opponent but had to stand up to defend his country).If the movie would have ended after Hector's death it would have been much better.All the rest is trash..."

Troy on the plus side is chalked full of stars and has great acting. The scenery is beautiful. That is the plus side however, Troy fails miserably to entertain because Achilles, played by Brad Pitt, is awful in his part. Not only this but anyone who has actually read Homer will find this movie a poor representation because we lose one of the best parts of The Iliad, the Gods acting in the affairs of the mortals. This would have added a lot to the movie. I'm not some pretentious butt head who needs purity but come on, THE GODS that would have been great and they can't say they didn't have the budget for it.

","After screening this film, I have to tell it like it is. I found myself struggling not to giggle at many parts of this movie. The script is laughable with lines no actor should have to utter and no movie patron should have to hear. <br/><br/>I personally think that the biggest mistake made with this movie is with the casting. Brad Pitt is seriously out of his league in his role of Achilles. I think he was cast for the appearance of his buttocks more than anything else. Diane Kruger as Helen of Troy?? This is the classic beauty that ""launched a thousand ships?"" Who the hell is she first of all? Orlando Bloom is also miscast in the role of Paris. Eric Bana as Hector is also a bit of a stretch but a better fit than the others previously mentioned.<br/><br/>The second mistake was with the script. Terrible lines that made me want to smirk...in fact I did smirk, many times. Thankfully I passed on the popcorn this time, as there is enough corn in this movie to feed a herd of cattle.<br/><br/>I have to agree that much of the CGI was not impressive. The overall feel of the film is lacking. It does not have that Epic atmosphere about it, and personally, seeing it once is enough. I cannot imagine suffering through it again on DVD.<br/><br/>My most memorable scene in this movie was the person two rows in front of me checking their indiglo watch over and over and over and....OVER again.

"zacky902","5","3","7","3 June 2004"," This movie was the epitome of melodramatic suck.
","Terrible movie, in my opinion, and it doesn't rate any higher than a mediocre 5.0. <br/><br/>Things that sucked about it: <br/><br/>1. The acting was awful, especially from Brad Pitt, who I usually enjoy. He was so unbelievably bland. I think he may have been doing his Keanu Reeves impression, actually. Seriously though, if this is Achilles, then there's no reason at all to believe he did anything to be remembered for. Pitt is woefully miscast and did nothing extraordinary. Hector's wife, Andromeche (played by Saffron Burrows) was equally awful. Also, her story was so predictable and badly acted ... ""no, Hector! You'll be killed! Don't go fight ... stay ... stay for our ... our son! Ohhh! *faints from fear*"" Lame.<br/><br/>2. Peterson and Benioff changed so much stuff from the original story that I was sickened. Paris did not steal Helen from Menelaus; she was given to him by Aphrodite. Hector did not kill Menelaus; Menelaus lived throughout the war. Briseus was not Hector's cousin and she was not a disciple of Apollo. She was the daughter of an Apollonian priest and she was given to Agamemnon who then gave her to Achilles (and later took her away from him and then gave her back again later). Briseus did not kill Agamemnon either; Agamemnon survived the war, only to be murdered by his wife and her lover (read his tragic story in ""Agamemnon"" by Aeschyclus). In fact, Peterson ruined Agamemnon's credibility and story in this movie. He wasn't the power-hungry barbarian they made him out to be. He was a leader who commanded respect. He was also a fighter. He did not sit back and let others do the work. He was a strong general and a king who clashed with Achilles, but had everyone elses respect.<br/><br/>3. The scene where Odysseus comes up with the idea for the Trojan horse was ridiculous. I could almost see a lightbulb flash over his head and hear ""ding ding ding!"" in the background.<br/><br/>4. Paris lives? Huh? In the epic poem, Paris is MURDERED BY MENELAUS!!! Paris living through the film made absolutely no sense. He already handed off the sword of Troy to Aeneas (which is correct ... Aeneas was given the sword of Troy, just not by Paris ... sidenote: Aeneas goes on to found the Roman empire in Virgil's ""The Aeneid""). What sense did Paris being alive at the end of the film make if he already handed off the sword of Troy?<br/><br/>5. For an epic, Troy the city seemed like it was no bigger than the size of Bumsville, Idaho. We see about 5% of a city, including an incredibly bland temple and a sparsely populated courtyard. Where were all the Trojan soldiers that 12 hours earlier were guarding the walls with bows and arrows? In the epic, the siege of Troy is much more chaotic, with Greeks killing Trojans, Greeks killing Greeks (accidentally), Trojans killing Greeks, and Trojans killing Trojans (accidentally).<br/><br/>6. There's more chemistry in a meth lab than there is between Paris and Helen. ""Everyday I spent with Menelaus I just wanted to walk into the ocean!!!"" It's one thing to just say that, but you have to make us feel and believe it. ""I can hunt deer and rabbits!"" Of course you can, Paris. Of course you can.<br/><br/>That's about all I got for now. This movie was the epitome of melodramatic suck."

I stewed for days, unsure if I wanted to subject myself to disappointment, then I realized that I know what to expect from Hollywood these days. So I just took a breath, swallowed and went to see it and take whatever it was going to give me. What I got was 2 hours and 45 minutes of entertainment. I was never bored. I never wondered when it would end. And the most important things I'd held from the Illiad were there for me, crossing eras. Trojan Prince Hector was great and true, honorable and courageous.

I had to turn it off after 30 minutes. My advice leave well alone there are far better films to watch than this. This was an example of a film devised by committee. A studio sees a number of hits in the historical battle epic genre, so they decide to copy it. They cast it with some great character actors and a couple of leads who are often on magazines covers, throw hundreds of millions of dollars at it for marketing and then expect a hit movie. Contriving a film in that way can never be a success unless of course its the first installment of a comic book franchise, and even then not all of those are successes."

","I think the best metaphor for this piece of disgusting trollop is how Brad Pitt chose to ""act"" in this film. I would like to note that Brad Pitt is not necessarily a bad actor (see twelve monkeys), but instead decided to take a couple of months on vacation for this film. Be amazed by his three facial expressions in the film and his complete lack of emotion! Gasp as you learn Orlando Bloom's acting peak was Lord of the Rings. Vomit as you notice that they have completely butchered the myth to a point that you can no longer recognize it. The only good action scene in the film (the great balls of fire) doesn't even make sense for the time period! I mean come on! Not to mention the cliché filled script that oozes with mediocrity and should be have the title changed to ""A three hour long summer movie that should have gone straight to DVD"". Personally, I enjoyed the new TV version of Hercules more than this because I could at least laugh at that! You have most likely already seen this movie if you are reading this and I feel sorry for you, but if you haven't stay far far far away!"

","After impatiently waiting for the release of this movie, I must say that I am sorely disappointed. I think that Brad Pitt makes a terrible Achilles. The movie dragged on and on. Even the battle scenes did little to keep me awake. Save your money, do not see this movie unless Shrek 2 is sold out and harry potter and the day after tomorrow and Van Helsing and raising Helen and a new york minute. The movie had too many computer generated soldiers, and poor acting on the part of Brad Pitt. He is not the right person to play this part. I love Orlando Bloom and he did well with very little to work with. Sean Bean (also of LOTR fame) contributed to the feeling that TROY was a movie made to take advantage of the LOTR popularity.<br/><br/>Bottom line: stay home and save your money."

","Could have been so much better. Badly cast, badly scored, desperately flawed script, in places badly acted by bad actors and over-acted by good ones. Accents ridiculously inconsistent - why was Mennelaus Irish, Agamemnon Scots and Helen German? The worst part? By the third act I could've cared less about any of the characters (except for Paris, and only then because I wanted him dead). Not a patch on Gladiator. See something else instead.<br/><br/>ANYTHING else, really. Very disappointed in the director, who has done some good work in the past, particularly Das Boot, which is an absolute classic."
"narine_tevosyan","10","2","4","22 March 2019"," Review
","Troy is an incredible movie, which is based on the epic poem ""The Iliad"" by Homer. It perfectly demonstrates the viewer the story that we know about this war. We all know that it is still unknown whether Trojan War happened or not, however, the story that we know from Iliad is perfectly demonstrated in this movie. To be frank with you I watched this movie after my presentation about the Trojan War and I had a knowledge about this story. Thus, I was expecting to see a great depiction of this story and I got it. I liked the actors of this movie. I think that Bred Pitt, who played a role of Achilles, Orlando Bloom, as prince Paris and his brother prince Hector, whom played Eric Bana ideally showed their characters. We see Prince Paris's fear and weakness, on the other side we see his brother's power and fearlessness. The part when he knows that he will die during the battle with Achilles, however he fought with him and it was the most heartbreaking part of the movie. Overall, all the characters in this movie show their weak and strong sides and also we see a great depicted scenes of wars. Thus, who is a fan of history and wars, should watch this movie, because it is one the best movies about wars."
"jamesrupert2014","9","2","4","29 January 2019"," Excellent post-CGI 'sword and sandal' epic
","A-list Hollywood hunks Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean play A-list mytho-historical hunks Achilles, Hector, Paris and Odysseus in Wolfgang Petersen's spectacular vision of the legendary Trojan War. A staple of Western classical tradition, the legend tells how the Trojan Prince Paris fell in love with beautiful Queen Helen of Sparta, wife of King Menelaus. The lovers escape to Troy, hoping for protection from the Spartan's wrath behind the city's great walls and by the sword of Paris' heroic brother, Hector. The Greeks, led by Menelaus' brother, King Agamemnon of Mycenae, and numbering amongst their ranks the heroes Achilles, Ajax and Odysseus, lay siege to Troy for a decade before famously overcoming the city-fortress by equine deception. Petersen streamlines the story, speeds up the war drastically, minimises the meddling of the Gods, and focuses primarily on Achilles, adding a romance angle as the indomitable warrior falls in love with Trojan princess/priestess/virgin Briseis (Rose Byrne). While not a history (or classics) lesson (see 'goofs' section for inaccuracies), the film is hugely entertaining and well made. The intersections between CGI and live footage is seamless, and the scenes of the vast Greek fleet (the famous ""thousand ships"") and Troy's towering walls (""the topless towers of Ilium"") are striking. The cast is excellent (especially Bean and Peter O'Toole as Priam, King of Troy) and Diane Kruger as Helen makes a plausible ""most beautiful women in the world"" (at least by contemporary 'Western' tastes). Despite a few implausibilities and anachronisms, 'Troy' is a great cinematic retelling of Homer's epic verse. Towards the end of the film, Aeneas makes a brief appearance, setting the stage for a 'sequel' that, sadly was not made."

"pfgpowell-1","8","2","4","22 November 2010"," Solid Hollywood epic. Just enjoy
","With actors given such dialogue as 'The Sun God is the patron of Troy - our enemy. Take whatever treasure you can find' and 'What are you doing in thrall to that pig of a king?' you'd'd think that a film such as Troy is stymied from the off. But you'd be wrong. I have to admit that dialogue is not this film's strongest suit, but what it does do is to lay down the ground rules, to prepare you for the kind of film it is: this is, in essence, a glorious Hollywood epic of the old school and, it has to be said, one verybworthy of that genre. The saintly Roger Ebert, with whom I find myself having to disagree more than once (his encyclopaedic knowledge of film and film making notwithstanding) grumbles that 'Troy is based on the epic poem The Iliad by Homer, according to the credits. Homer's estate should sue'. Elsewhere other IMDb reviewers complain that Troy is not true to Homer's Iliad, that the gods have been written out of the film, that historically – and odd complaint to make about a myth – the film is inaccurate because the Greeks and Trojans didn't have horses which in Petersen's version are abundant. Oh dear. They entirely miss the point: this is not a film version of the Iliad, this is a film in its own right 'based on the Iliad' and Petersen and his scriptwriter have every right to do as they damn well please. And it is to their credit that they neither sell you short, nor stray into pretension and try to make out there's more to their version, more depth, more meaning. If you want to stick to Homer's version , go and read it. If you want an 'historically accurate' version of the Iliad, don't bother with Troy. If on the other hand you want and exceptionally well-made, imaginative and thoroughly entertaining film 'based on the Iliad', this is your number. From Brad Pitt and Eric Bana to reliable Peter O'Toole and a gallery of old Brit thespians who can do this kind of thing with their eyes closed, there is any number of strong performances. OK, so there aren't any particularly moving dramatic scenes, except when O'Toole's King Priam ventures incognito into the enemy camp and Achilles' tent to reclaim the body of his slain son Hector, but – do I really have to repeat it? – it isn't that kind of film. And of the kind of film it is, it is better than many. Petersen makes ample use of CGI, but the film is not dominated by it, and it serves the film. In many ways calling the film Troy is a misnomer. Achilles is, more or less, the central and most interesting character. Ebert moans that Homer's Achilles was not introspective and did not sulk on the sidelines. The only answer to that is: well Petersen's Achilles is and does. As portrayed by Brad Pitt, Achilles is a superb warrior, an almost unbeatable warrior who finds it a little difficult to reconcile himself to the death he causes, but who is under no illusions that those who live by the sword, as he does, must inevitably die by the sword. His Acilles, and Eric Bana's Hector, almost break out of the two dimensions this kind of epic reduces its characters to and provide something more. That they don't quite do so is simply down to the fact that if they had done, this would no longer be the kind of film it is intended to be: (for the third or fourth time) and epic. So ignore the whingers and complainers. Sit back and enjoy a rollicking yarn. I was going to give this a 7, but on reflection it's getting an 8. It might not be gold, but of its kind it is pretty damn good."

"shanerdesuyo","9","2","4","22 August 2008"," My thoughts on Troy
","Well to start off I love this movie. Everything about it just puts me in awe. The actors and how they played their roles so well. The special effects to make this movie spectacular. The fight scenes which made me clench my fists. The costumes that were completely beautiful. I will first start off by talking about the actors. Brian Cox who plays Agamemnon does a great job acting as a bad guy. I loved his facial expressions and just that attitude that he gives off while watching the movie. Next is Brad Pitt as Achilles. Achilles is my favorite character in this story because he is a pure warrior. He is the best fighter in this whole story and I thought that it sucked when he had to die from the coward and wuss Paris, played by Orlando Bloom. I think that Brad Pitt did an excellent job fitting the part of the almighty Achilles, from his body structure to his acting ability. The next person i will talk about is Orlando Bloom acting as Paris. I felt that Orlando Bloom did an excellent job acting as the wimpy and young Paris in this story. I personally don't like the character Paris for that he is a coward and does irrational things. For example, how he started the war between Sparta and troy when they were suppose to be joining forces. If it wasn't for Paris then they wouldn't have gone to war, and Hector wouldn't have to die by Achilles for killing his cousin Patroclus. Another reason why I don't like Paris is that he kills Achilles even though he saves Briseis and he can see that Briseis and Achilles have something together. I guess he did that because he wanted revenge for killing his brother. Overall I just think of Paris as childish and stupid. The next character I will talk about is Hector, played by Eric Bana. I personally love this character also because he is just an overall good guy in every way. He is the picture-perfect big brother because he watches over Paris. He is a warrior who is the second best fighter amongst Achilles. He is a great leader because he led the Trojans against the Greeks. And he is a good son who did what he could to please his father King Priam. It was a sad moment when Achilles killed Hector, and then dragged his body with his chariot back to the Greek camp. The next character i will talk about is Patroclus, played by Garret Hedlund. I think Patroclus was played out very well also. In the movie Patroclus was the closest with Achilles because they were supposedly cousins. When Patroclus wear Achilles armor and goes into battle and dies Achilles is devastated. Achilles then goes into a rampage and summons Hector to fight. Overall I feel that Garret did an excellent job playing Patroclus."
"RichardKleiner","6","2","4","10 May 2008"," A lesser epic (in comparison to the source material), but still entertaining
","If you had a cellophane schematic of the Iliad with all the important details and events in the plot as dots and placed it over Troy, most of the dots would be in the right place.<br/><br/>While the premise, characters and events are the same and essentially faithful to Homer's epic poem, still some major elements of the story were decidedly dropped for the sake of youth audiences and to grow into them an interest in literature and history.<br/><br/>Where is the mythology? Where are the gods? Instead of including such important characters and settings, the producers decided to go for a more realistic (though not historically accurate) depiction of the Trojan War. This included a notorious change in Achilles. While in the poem and in popular knowledge, Achilles was invulnerable, thus making him the grand warrior that he is, the movie sees him only as some agile, tough to kill guy. It's no longer ""Achilles, the invulnerable"", but more ""Achilles, the arrow dodger"". This makes Paris' strike to Achilles' ankle more stupid, as the strike just take's him by surprise and that's pretty much it.<br/><br/>However, in keeping the action and events realistic, the portrayal of the Trojan horse was more believable, since an entire army could not fit inside one wooden horse, as it was more likely that just a few Greeks could hide inside the horse and later open the doors to Troy once they were let in.<br/><br/>Besides from that, the performances are rather good. With the ensemble cast, it is expectable that the actors would work good. And they do. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt both bring dramatic deepness into their titular characters. Orlando Bloom goes a little inconspicuous here. Diane Kruger was average, though I thought there are far more beautiful women today that could play Helen of Troy (said to be the most beautiful woman that has ever lived). It's not that Diane Kruger is not pretty. She just wasn't the right choice for Helen of Troy. Of course, Peter O'Toole is the best in the movie. His portrayal of the good hearted but dumb and easily persuaded king Priam was superb. And Brian Cox, who I would normally expect for him to be extremely good falls a little flat as Agamemnon.<br/><br/>The visual effects are very good. The action and battle sequences are far better than other films of the same setting, and the CGI armies, as clichéd as they are, work fine at inspiring awe in the viewer (at least with myself, the sometimes easily impressed).<br/><br/>I can't say the same with the score. As far as I've tried to do James Horner some justice and hand it to him, Troy could possibly be his worst job in film music. Although, you can't really blame Horner for this one. He had just weeks to write a full score (although this didn't seem to be a drawback when he did Aliens). Why does the score suck? Half of the score is moaning and wailing, a trademark of epic Mediterranean films since Gladiator, and another half is the famed ""danger theme"" that makes an infamous appearance for far too many times, to the point where it gets annoying and not engaging. A small percentage is dominated with percussion, but that also grows annoying. It's sad to consider that Gabriel Yared's score was turned down from reactions to a test screening.<br/><br/>As it is with such commercial and generic directors as Wolfgang Petersen, this is just another action flick. Still, it is very entertaining and worth several views. It was smart to end it in tragedy, as I had originally knew the story from the Greek's point of view.<br/><br/>It's not the worst movie ever made. It's far better than other similar epic films, the script is more interesting and well crafted. I personally enjoyed the action sequences, as I'm a fan of watching two armies collide and fight to the death.<br/><br/>For all you literature lovers, you most certainly won't enjoy watching this one. Still, this is a good pick to watch with the family on a Sunday night (there is some rear nudity, but it's minor and useless so it won't leave you mentally scarred).<br/><br/>It does has its flaws, but it's still basically faithful to the Iliad and has an engaging dramatic ending. 6/10."

Troy king replied "" YOU STILL MY ENEMY TONIGHT"", but enemys can show respect. Eric Bana mostly played emotional actings, which bring all the viewer to their side and against Greece.you can expect most emotional and action scene are in the film. may be not satisfying your Historical needs, but u'll get it everything else from the movie and you don't move from the beginning to till end.

"yes_i_am84","7","2","4","23 February 2008"," Fine entertainment - purists might have some issues,
","I happen to be quite fond of Greek mythology. Since I was a kid, I used to enjoy immensely the ""stories of gods and heroes"", as my book labeled them. Building on that, watching this movie I often found myself thinking : No, the war of Troy was not a blitzkrieg. Yes, Patroclus was Achilles' ""young protégé"", with all that this implies in the culture of the time, not his cousin. Yes, gods and divine messengers are overwhelmingly present in the Iliad, while they are nowhere to be found in this movie. Yes, ancient Greek, Persian and Roman cultures and histories seem to be mixed here in a colorful pastiche in pure Hollywood fashion. And so on.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention that maybe Greek temples have been temples at some point before being ruins, that Homer would have worked a lot more on the oh-so-corny dialogs that Paris and Helen are forced to utter in this movie, and that it is kind of childish to *always* make the bad guys utterly ugly, as well.<br/><br/>That being said, I enjoyed this movie a lot. After all, suspension of disbelief is (or should be, at least) easier to achieve in a fictional story based on another fictional story, than in a ""true account""-type of work. And there are a lot of things in this movie that make it easier.<br/><br/>First of all, the cast. I was all prepared to dislike Brad Pitt's Hollywoodized portrayal of Achilles, but you can't help to be entertained by his amazing screen presence, ""super-hero"" aura (that does not prevent a handful of secret tears on Hector's body) and yes, even the bombastic lines he shouts from the Myrmidons' ship. I won't add a lot of words to the general praise that Eric Bana deservedly received for his charming, well-rounded portrayal of Hector. I will just limit myself to an enthusiastic agreement. Orlando Bloom is just as irritating and childish as he should be in his role as Paris. The ladies - Diane Kruger, Saffron Burrows, Rose Byrne and Julie Christie in a cameo as Achilles' mother Thetis - all do more than good jobs. In particular, I thought that Saffron Burrows stole every scene she was in in her relatively small role as Andromache, her beauty and intensity almost outshining Kruger (that does a very ""human"" and down-to-Earth Helen). Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson as Agamemnon and Menelaus respectively, Sean Bean as Odysseus, and especially Peter O'Toole as Priam, all deserve their part of the accolades.<br/><br/>Secondly, the visuals - inaccurate as they may be with respect to techniques and fighting styles, the battles rock, especially the first one on the beach. They succeeded much more that the ones in ""300"" to involve my attention. And a special mention should go to Achilles' and Hector's duel, very skillfully choreographed and performed.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the costumes and scenarios - once again, fantasy has in more than one case yielded to faithful reconstruction, but one ends up not thinking a lot about it in the jubilation of colours and action.<br/><br/>All in all, I would still go for the great ""Odyssey"" brought to the TV screen by Dino De Laurentiis in Italy and Europe when my parents were kids. But ""Troy"" is not bad, looking at it with an open perspective. Not bad at all. Raise your hands, anyone who didn't feel some satisfaction at the moment in which Hector appears in front of Troy's walls to meet his rival? :)"

","I don't really like ""war movies"", I just hate all the blood and violence. I watched it because my English teacher was giving out extra credit. I rented the movie and watched it; I have to admit it is a really good movie. Just like a good book, you never want to put the book down; I didn't want to take my eyes off of the television. I feel that the actors did a really good job.<br/><br/>After discussing the Trojan War through out all my years in high school, I never really understood it. This movie pretty much explained it well. One of my favorite roles in this movie was Hector; he did a very good job as being a leader and a protector. He was one of the ""good guys"" in the movie and I envied that. I like the scene where Paris backs down in the fight with Menelaus and Hector comes in and kills him. I like that scene because he protected his brother, even after his stupidity of bringing Helen into Troy.<br/><br/>Another one of my favorite roles in this movie was Achilles, even though he was not one of the ""good guys"" I liked the scene where he gave Hector's body to Priam. Even though he said that Priam will always be his enemy, he showed respect to him Hector's body. After that talk that Priam had with Achilles, I think Achilles felt really guilty because he was crying over Hector's body.<br/><br/>I think it was very foolish that the Trojans accepted the statue of the horse from the Greeks. I mean how can the Greeks hate the Trojans so much, up to the point where they want to demolish them and then all of a sudden end the war and give them a huge statue of a horse? Priam should have listened to his son Paris and burned it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was a good experience, I like the plot of the whole thing and the actors fit perfectly well in their roles."
"poohsoccerpooh","7","2","4","27 September 2006"," Troy
","I have just finished viewing the movie Troy for my first time and I enjoyed watching it. Greek mythology is not my favorite subjects and I thought the movie would be boring. However, to my surprise it was not and I was actually drawn into the movie. I can even say that I learned more information in a shorter period of time watching the movie than reading the story. The movie was very interesting and I would definitely watch it again if I had the chance. The best part of the movie for me would have had to be when Achilles and Hector were battling in a one on one combat and Achilles triumphed. After winning, Achilles took Hector's body and dragged him back to his tent. Later that evening Priam entered Achilles tent dressed a large rob. He then kissed Achilles' hand and stated that he has done what no man has done before; kiss the hands of the man who killed my son. After, Priam begs Achilles to give his son back to him and after some consideration, Achilles does so. I choose this scene because this was the scene that my class had discussed about in school and I was very confused and lost. But after watching the movie I can say that I now know exactly what my teacher was talking about and will now be able to participate in discussions if more were to arise. The worst part of the movie would have to be when Patroclus was killed in a one to one combat with Hector. I disliked that part of the movie because Patroclus died at a very young age and would have not died if Hector had known that he was not Achilles. But due to ambiguous identity Patroclus lost his life. Because Patroclus lost his life Hector lost his as well. This is because after Achilles found out that his cousin, Patroclus had been killed by Prince Hector Achilles wanted revenge. Not thinking about why Prince Hector would kill Patroclus he took action. Achilles did not think the information given to him thoroughly; he acted on anger and rage. If he had sit down to hear the information, Hector had thought that Patroclus was Achilles. But because Achilles was stubborn he fought Hector in a one to one combat and Hector fell. All this bloodshed happened because Patroclus wanted to fight in the war and wore Achilles' armor. This could have been prevented and two lives would have been saved if Patroclus had listened to Achilles when he said he was not ready for combat. The movie was excellent and I really enjoyed watching it. It gave a new meaning to the story Troy and I now understand what is going on. The movie was very easy to follow and understand. There were no unclear parts where I thought to myself, ""What's going on."" I think that the actors portrayed their characters very well and did an excellent job and the director with his cast and crew worked very hard and put a wonderful movie together. This was an excellent movie and I wish I had seen it right when it was being previewed in the movie theaters. I rate this movie as being very good and I hope everyone else enjoyed it just as much as I did."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","6","2","4","28 June 2006"," Its desire to be great is its doom, just like it was Achilles'.
","For a big-budget Wolfgang Petersen production, it had the potential to be so much better. All he needed was to lose a few things. Brad Pitt, for one.<br/><br/>Watching this 163minutes (too) long adventure, I did enjoy quite a few parts. The foreshadowing of the attack on Troy by the Greeks was handled in a similar manner to the Helm's Deep battle in LOTR: Two Towers, mostly because it featured a strong fortress-like wall and a tense build-up that culminated in a very fierce battle. I liked this part; I thought it was well-done.<br/><br/>Other than that, Troy simply doesn't hold one's interest; it is too long and tries too hard to be ""epic"" without succeeding. I really can't emphasize enough just how wrong I think Brad Pitt is for the part of Achilles. Sure, he's got the vanity part down alrightbut he's still too much likeBrad Pitt. It's annoying and distracting.<br/><br/>Diane Kruger as Helen of Sparta/Troy truly is the face that could launch a thousand ships for me. Yet her beauty is rivaled to that of Rose Byrne's and Saffron Burrows'. The casting directors should definitely have gone with less pretty girls to emphasize Diane Kruger as Helen and make it more believable that 50,000 Greeks would set out to fight for her. Now, with all the gorgeous girls everywhere, it's almost a little overblown. It goes back to what I said about ""trying too hard"" and it seems as though this is Troy's inherent flaw. I guess that could relate to the themes of Achilles in the Iliad. Achilles' desire to be great and glorified leads to his doom, just like Troy's desire to be a great, epic film leads to its failure, but I sincerely doubt the filmmakers had this irony in mind. In fact, I'm quite sure they mostly had box-office success in mind and made this film according to the standard recipe for Hollywood adventure."

If you want to see a great war movie, this is it. Detailed battle scenes and elaborate props make for something you can really enjoy. This movie is like a boiled steak.

"christoskz-1","6","2","4","12 October 2005"," Good as an alternate-universe version of Homer's Iliad!
","As a Greek-American who has known the stories of the Iliad and the Odyssey since my childhood, I found the changes and omissions in the film annoying if not downright irritating. The production values of the movie were great, and I didn't particularly notice any of the continuity errors mentioned---well, I really don't view movies to find out who goofed or what goof was made.<br/><br/>It was hard to enjoy the movie altogether when Menelaus was killed off before the first big battle and then Agamemnon was killed during the sack of Troy. It was rather irritating to see Paris survive and escape. It was annoying to have Aeneas, the eventual founder of Rome, be presented as a kid whom Paris just meets during that escape scene. The absence of Cassandra was something else that was hard to deal with. Reducing the war to something that lasted a few weeks instead of ten years was yet another irritant.<br/><br/>I was also upset by the fact that Menelaus and Agamemnon were presented as a couple of huge, brutish men while most of the Trojans were slim and trim. Thank God the filmmakers didn't present Odysseus as another nearly ugly brute! I didn't mind that the Olympian gods were not included as actual participants in the war and only referred to by the characters. As for Achilles, I think he came across as way too arrogant, although his seeking glory was not in itself inaccurate.<br/><br/>I'd really like to know the specific reasons for those detail changes because as far as I'm concerned they did nothing to improve the drama of the story. Suffering from depression as I am, I can't recall the names of the screenplay writers and the director and producers. I nevertheless think--feel--that the changes in detail did nothing to improve the story--unless it was sheer laziness to have to deal with Menelaus and Agamemnon living and Cassandra warning and being unheeded about the disaster to come. Geez, would the movie have been too long if, say, another ten minutes of story were included?<br/><br/>To enjoy this movie, one has to be able to see it without knowing the story as given to us by Homer. That's why I said that it has to be viewed as something out of an alternate universe. I think for those who have neither read Homer's epics nor know anything about the story, the enjoyment of the movie was more available. For those of us who do know it, it's hard to dismiss what we do know. Still, with a major mental effort to set aside Homer, I must say it ain't a terrible movie. It's good. I agree with many of the observations about the performances. I have to get Homer out of my mind to say that it was a pretty darn good movie. But I still feel that it would have been a better one if those detail changes had not been made because I don't think the reasoning behind those decisions was based on any truly dramatic aesthetics or creativity. Of course, I don't know what the exact reasons were--I just suspect they weren't good.<br/><br/>By the way, are any of you aware that it is the Odyssey and not the Iliad that is considered the better story and is also viewed as the first true novel, even if it is created as epic poetry? Think of the differences of the themes. Think of the differences between Achilles and Odysseus. Think... ."

","I did enjoy this movie, but what I found disturbing is the change made to the relationship of Achilles and Patroclus. And since the screenwriter has Achilles directly quoting Homer's lines from the Iliad in some instances I find it odd that it was opted to make the two men ""cousins."" Other 'historical' facts can be debated I suppose - and of course there is no true historical documents existing - but what is clear from Homer's time is that Achilles and Patroclus are close - very close - companions. It is implied, in fact, that they were lovers. In the Iliad Patroclus' pleads with Achilles that their bones be buried together. (Later literary references to the relationship make it even more implied that Achilles was gay, but I'll stick with Homer's implications for this movie.) Being gay, it was disturbing enough to have a movie about Alexander the Great distorting his lifestyle - but now Achilles? That being said - I enjoyed the movie and could overlook many of its flaws. But the deliberate distortion of Achilles' relationship left me offended and saddened that it took thousands of years but someone decides they are 'cousins' and that distortion is now forever committed to film...sad."

(Achilleas was actually the king of Thessalies), and the way Petersen ended the film was way off.<br/><br/>but in the end..it was entertaining...and that was the entire point of it. Brilliant cast, (Hectoras was always my personal favorite of the book's characters,and i was amazed to see Eric Bana doing a wonderful job)great acting,the directing was alright, i would expect more effort though in not trying to wrap the story up as it happened in two weeks... the beauty of the book was the ten years of the Greeks waiting,by reading the book you understand how tired and dedicated to their beliefs the Greeks and the Trojans were..and some more respect to Agamemnona and Menelaus would be the right thing,they weren't really pigs like the film describes.. but every Hollywood blockbuster needs a strong ""badguy"" so i understand. (agamemnonas was much younger too, mid-thirties)<br/><br/>Overall..I'm Greek and i enjoyed this film very much. It gave me exactly what i wanted of it, pure entertainment. No one can outmatch Homers poetry and if the director tried to reproduce a copy of the Iliada I would be insulted...the book is a masterpiece and should stay UNTOUCHED!"

","Two things wrong with this movie; some wonky dialogue, and how far the revision goes. I am just not sure why it has to go so far...<br/><br/>other than that, a highly underrated movie. Almost ranks with Blade Runner.<br/><br/>The Iliad, an epic poem written in ancient Greek, is a book now. I wonder what kinds of complaints followed it transcription? Anyway, the poem is...uh, perhaps the first foundation text for Western History. It occupies THE FIRST spot, outside of the Middle Eastern importation. Its a story about a really messed up situation. This is how things go bad and keep getting worse. This is a story about the foundation of Greek civilization; the greeks cherished it because it explained the problem with valuing the individual and valuing the family and valuing the tribe over what it right, over what should be better government. The movie does an excellent job, superb, (if not for a few wrong notes by Bana and the rest of the cast) in describing why we set up governments and justice systems OVER the rights of individuals. Unlike most other texts, I see The Story unique in that no one is likable, no one does the right thing, and everyone is drawn into a whirlwind of agony because they do not think of people as people, but people as what they represent. A point for democracy.<br/><br/>And by the way, Mr. Cox has been doing some fine work. My vote for him as the best actor in the epic.<br/><br/>And I didn't want to like Pitt...never do, but he's undeniably good as well."

","Hollywood should NOT make films based on ancient stories. Because according to them, the story itself is not good enough as it is, and must be changed.

Eric Bana does an amazing job as Hector, Orlando Bloom looks very pretty as Paris, and although Brad Pitt could have done a much better job, he's pretty decent as the mighty Achilles.<br/><br/>But loads of eye candy and great actors isn't enough to make a film; Hollywood needs to stay true to a story as famous as this one if they want to make a movie out of it! ...And I didn't know they had South American Llamas in Ancient Turkiye.... how embarrassing."

I'm not sure where all the negative comments are coming from, honestly. The acting is superb (Pitt, Bloom, Bana, Bean, and O'Toole are in top form). I'm wondering if critics and the public weren't suffering from epic-fatigue when this movie was released. It's the same with ""Alexander"" (although this is arguably the better movie).

","Troy is based on Homer's poem, the Iliad, in which we are not assured of any historical fact. Due to this lack of information Wolfang Petersen decided to create fictitious story-lines to please the movie-going public. And it worked. Troy is a passionate, compelling often powerful film that was worth it's duration yet not nearly worth it's quarter of a billion dollar budget. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt turns in an unexpectedly excellent portrayal of a Hollywood altered Achilles. Eric Bana gets a five out of ten and Orlando Bloom's weak portrayal of Paris is the down point of the film. His presence may have enticed the female crowd to see this epic, yet in every regretful scene with him he is low and transparent. Nonetheless the younger cast of pretty-boys is made up for by the older more experienced cast including Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox.<br/><br/>The war scenes are not what you would have hoped for. They are lacking in comparison to Braveheart and the Lord of the Rings. What you really have to watch out for are the one-on-one fight sequences between the key characters.<br/><br/>Troy is an exciting film worth watching even more than once though watch it as a compelling action flick,not as a historical epic."

Apart from that, the other actors would have been just as convincing if they were on a Greek stage holding dramatic masks to their faces. It seemed Brad Pitt was always trying to act but just couldn't jive with the character. I wanted to laugh at some parts, such as when he was ""acting"" angry while calling Hector out to fight. Terrible. Peter O'Toole, though once a great actor, is just too old, and I hate to say that. I sincerely believe that Brad Pitt and Peter O'Toole were recruited because the producers wanted some ""big name"" appeal. Shame. To set the record straight, I do not dislike Brad Pitt.

I couldn't help wondering whether there was supposed to be a message about modern American behaviour behind the insanity of casting a bleach blond underwear model as Achilles, Greek Hero.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole shines amongst the mire, as one would expect, and Eric Bana as Hector strikes a reasonable note. The anachronisms, even for a viewer who is not a classical scholar, were nauseating: swords piercing armour (that would be bronze piercing thick leather), and all-out charges because the special effects people used the same software that was used in LOTR.

"Antagonisten","Null","2","4","25 November 2004"," Gladiator is to blame!
","I don't know how the whole ""swords-and-sandals""-trend started this time around. But i can take a qualified guess and say that it started with Gladiator, and of course all the Oscars that rained down on that film and it's cast. Just so you know who to blame for this bore.<br/><br/>Troy is based on an epic by the Greek Homer. Since it's a genuine Greek tragedy one should not expect laughter and brightness to be the bulk of the film. It starts off with Troy making peace with Sparta. However the Troyan prince Paris can not keep his hands away from the Spartan king's wife, and as he steals her away the Spartan king promises to destroy Troy. The whole Greek army comes with him and they lay siege to Troy, among the Greeks is also the great warrior Achilles.<br/><br/>I don't think movies that are slow are necessarily bad. I think a slow and thoughtful pace can sometimes heighten the experience. But Troy just seems to drag on forever. And, can you say pretentious? I don't really know what they wanted to make here. Did they want an action take on history, like in Gladiator? Did they want a loyal and truthful rendition of a classic story? Or did they just want people endlessly walking around i loincloths murmuring pointlessly to each other?! I don't think the last alternative was what they were aiming for, but i'm afraid that's what they got.<br/><br/>Of course there are forgiving attributes. The acting is above par in many cases. Especially Brian Cox as king Agamemnon and Eric Bana as Hector stand out in my eyes. Eric Bana is increasingly becoming one of my favorites on the big screen. Brad Pitt however feels tragically miscast as Achilles, and his blond muscular surfer-look never really conveys the feeling of a ""great warrior"". And Orlando Bloom still remains one of the most overrated actors of our time, this is another stiff and uninteresting performance from him.<br/><br/>But in the end, the actors neither save nor destroy this film. A script with more depth and perhaps more background to makes us feel ""inside"" the story would have been needed. Also the pace should be quicker. If they moved a little faster and cut 20-30 minutes the movie could actually have been watchable. They could also have worked a bit on the period setting. It doesn't feel too convincing when all the actors have perfectly toned muscles, waxed and evenly tanned bodies and cleanly shaved faces. This is a constant annoyance in period-pieces like this. <br/><br/>While Gladiator felt like a great film in the vein of (for instance) Ben Hur, Troy only feels ""big"". It looks expensive, feels expensive, but never really achieves that feeling you need to make it a true epic.<br/><br/>A disappointment to say the least. I rate it 4/10."

","A well hyped film may sometimes find it hard to match up to the expectations set by the press. ""Troy"" does relatively well in this area, though the battle scenes are an excellent eyefull for the gore lovers, and quite watchable and interesting for those who aren't, they do come off, particularly the storming of the beach of Troy, as a little try hard, attempting, and failing, to be as glorious as the battles of The Lord of the Rings. Also, some of the dialogue and acting leaves something to be desired. Peter O'Toole brings quite a back ground character effect to King Priam, and fumbles several lines, whilst Rose Byrne fumbles even more and leads viewers to the belief that they could have done a better job, all they need is to turn on the water works at the appropriate time. Brad Pitt is an excellent Achilles, but if film makers wished us to like his character they did a sad job of it, and the Achilles we see does some unredeemable things. Eric Bana truly is something brilliant as the heroic prince Hector, and there isn't much to say in the way of fault to his performance, an incredible embodiment of both power and responsibility being held together. Orlando Bloom has been continuously attacked for his acting skills, but is every inch the young Paris, and any misgivings about him are lost as the end of the film arises. Meanwhile Brian Cox gives another interesting performance as a bad guy, and assures a few laughs as he goes, and imprints the line ""I like your land!"" in most viewers brains. Diane Kruger makes a favourable appearance as the beautiful Helen, once Queen of Sparta, now Princess of Troy. But there is only one truly flawless actor to show himself on the big screen through out nearly 3 hours of film, and that is the mighty Sean Bean, as Odyseuss. Nothing but praise can be given to his presence, and he holds the movie high. While battles are all well and good, special effects are fine, and storyline is quite simple, it really is a character film, and this leads to most of my comment being on the actors and actresses, good or bad. Altogether a definite good time, and a memorable watch. 7/10."

","This is a film that could have been better than it was. The sets and special effects are spectacular, as are the battle scenes and the burning of Troy. Against that magnificent canvass, the film fails to offer a convincing story mainly thanks to a weak script (are all good scriptwriters working for T.V. or what?), ill-advised changes to the Iliad story, weak characterisation and the most irritating music score ever. Apparently, today you can't make a Hollywood epic without some gritty ululating woman in the background.<br/><br/>Eric Bana was convincing as Hector, as was Brad Pitt as Aquilles (if one liked his rogue take on the character). Otherwise, the film ignores the importance of secondary characters in building such an epic story. Peter O'Toole plays a king Priam who seems permanently on drugs and gets away with it because he's Peter O'Toole. You could forget Diane Kruger's face a few hours after having watched a movie, hardly believable that her beauty and presence caused a whole war. Rose Byrne's depicting of Briseis shows none of her motives. Orlando Bloom is at his best when throwing arrows (now, that's something he knows how to do). Perhaps the worst is Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus, although he can hardly be blamed considering the complete lack of definition of his character.<br/><br/>Now, a film like this cannot and shouldn't be expected to be a literal rendition of Homer's Iliad. However, it should be careful with changes that have the potential of affecting the core of the story. The makers of the movie were obviously not brave enough to depict the love story of Aquilles and Patroclus. Instead, Patroclus becomes Aquilles little cousin, and the later has some unpersuasive romance with Hector's cousin. The change is effected without conviction or substance. As a result, the viewer never fully understands Aquilles' rage towards Hector. <br/><br/>Watchable, but unsatisfying epic."

I find that the bast scene in the movie as a whole was the moment when old king Priam went to Achile's tent to beg him for his son's body.The reason?Peter O'Toole's performance.He once again proved his quality as an actor.Unlike Brad Pitt.This could have been the role of his life.Achiles is a great character - the warrior who was born to fight,the warrior,fighting for immortality,the warrior who falls in love and is ready to change his life for this love's sake.But instead of focusing on the emotional side of his character,Pitt seemed to be concentrated only in showing his masculine body...What a pity.If it had not been for his poor acting,the film would have definitely been a good one.Take Eric Bana for example.He was made for that role,he acted with passion and devotion and that definitely showed on screen.If you compare Troy to other historical films like Brave Heart or Gladiator,you will see that what was missing in the film was a good actor in the leading role."

Of course there were times when I was like, ""Paris how could you?"" But hey it's only a movie. <br/><br/>The one on one battles were beautiful and Hector and Paris looked really good in helmets. All in all it was quite an experience and I can't wait for the DVD."

","I feel this movie was mainly showing Brad Pitt's statue like physique off. If you may have noticed every opportunity he was given he would ""strike a pose"". But all in all it was very good as far as the cinematography, and sound was concerned. I loved the thousand ships. I also feel that Hector was the better actor and I was impressed with his role. His acting was great. The actress that they used (who was she?) to play Helen of Troy wasn't as beautiful as history described her to be, well actually they could have gotten a prettier actress. Who would you have suggested to be that actress? They should have depicted the meaning of Achilles's death (why he died by getting shot by a arrow in his heel). Achilles was half mortal and half demigod. His mother dipped into water hold him by only his heel. So the only part of his body that was fatal was his achilles tendon. Historically it was some what accurate if you know your Greek Mythology."

"spltner10","Null","2","4","24 July 2004"," Flawed, yes...but bad? no
","I was overseas when Troy was released in the United States but I kept up with the press it received none the less, and, I must say, I was quite shocked by the reviews I read.  Nevertheless, being the movie buff that I am, I had to see it as soon as I got back.  Personally, I didn't think the movie was all that bad.  Of course it had its flaws when compared to Homer's Iliad, but what book-to-movie adaptation doesn't?  Its absolutely impossible to 100% translate whats on page to whats on screen.  If that were done, the movie would have been a disaster.  And I have read comments about how the movie was bad because it didnt include the gods and how it featured too much Brad Pitt.  But lets face reality here.  Could this movie (director, producers, what have you) have included the gods and actually pulled it off in a non-comical way.  The gods work in a movie such as Disney's ""Herculese"" when they are drawn in gaudy costumes and outrageous colors, because that is fun and it shows the grandoisity of their characters.  It also works in a movie like ""Clash of the Titans"" because the whole movie revolves around them.  But in a live action, historically based movie like Troy I think it is very hard to correctly display the gods without them being cheesy. Honestly, wasn't the depiction in ""Clash of the Titans"" kind of funny anyway?  ""Troy"" has to be judged from a different angle than The Iliad because ""Troy"" is looking to portray this whole ordeal from a historical, ""this is real life"" standpoint- not form a fantasy, epic poem view with gods flying around in the air and discussing their matters in the heavens as battle rages on.  In my opinion, that would have spoiled the movie. And of course this movie is going to be Brad Piit-centric.  If you've read they Iliad, the whole thing is Achilles-centric.  The whole poem revolved around his character and his choice between pride, glory and anonimity.  This is not to say, however, that the character wasnt fleshed out enough.  I do believe that the writers could have done a better job of showing this duality through dialouge and actions.        All that said I have a few more comments.  Eric Bana played an incredible Hector and I actually felt emotion when he was killed by Achilles.  Their fight was incredible as well, as was the build up to it. Orlando Bloom did fairly well, but he basically played his real life self-the pretty boy who can shoot a bow and arrow.  ""Troy"" had huge expectations that it didn't entirely live up to, but with big summer blockbusters that present themselves as highly serious in their trailers, you have to go into expecting the worst.  That makes it much easier to concentrate on what is actually good about the movie."
"Clossius","Null","2","4","6 July 2004"," a rotten bad movie
","My two cents' worth: First, this has nothing whatsoever to do with Homer, because the Iliad especially is not understandable without the Gods, who are - this is pretty much consensus by now among Classics experts - not support characters, but absolutely essential. The entire story makes no sense without them; the humans only act with them. To add them out is like Moby Dick without a whale, Snow White without the Stepmother, etc. <br/><br/>So, was this a successful movie otherwise? I don't think so. The battle scenes were all the same (compare good movies with such scenes: people actually fight differently!), the mass scenes seemed like Mummy II or other trash movies, the characters indeed did not develop and moved like puppets... I really thought these were some wasted hours. <br/><br/>I should like to add that the Iliad really supplies key insights into how we (as humans today in the glovbalized culture in which most of us IMDb readers live) became what we are, and also in what we are now - and especially so because of such problematic characters like Achilleus, who is a whiny boy and a hero at the same time. It is thus really really sad to have a movie like that invariably blocking access to this great work, because - as can be seen already now - people do mistake this thing for somehow representing at least ""the story"". Too bad."

","Not quite as good as I expected it to be but definetely worth seeing. However I've never been a big Brad Pitt fan and this film done nothing to change my opinion of him. I suppose his female fans would have enjoyed his performance though as he spends most of film with little clothes on, being male I found the massive battle scenes more appealing and they WERE massive and superbly shot. Eric Bana was really good and stole the picture and Orlando Bloom was as usual completely awful. Wolfgang Petersen is a great director and he does a fine job here, I give it 7/10, if you hasn't seen it and want some Summer thrills wait until it comes out on DVD and see the much more entertaining The Day After Tomorrow or Van Helsing instead."

On the other hand, Brad Pitt was only mediocre. I usually like him but I didn't think he was right for the part of Achilles. He didn't make me care about the character. Orlando Bloom was good as well. Overall, I enjoyed this movie but it's very long, you really have to be in the mood for an epic. One thing that bothered me was that in the film, the Trojan War only lasted three days but according to the story I think it was more like years and decades.

But I found out that this movie was absolutely just great! The acting was great, maybe except Brad Pitt. The role for a big hero who was all about war, Brad Pitt didn't show his best effort. And thanks a lot, because that's why Roger Ebert gave this movie thumbs down, because of Brad Pitt's acting, or partly. But I'm glad I saw this movie on the first day it came out, even though I'm writing this review later. Orlando Bloom did one heck of a job, he's such a great actor. Eric Bana did an okay job too. And I loved the way the script was written, and the special effects, especially when they light the haystacks on fire and roll them down the hill at the enemy. It was so cool. And the film, oh my god, it was so well directed. The score was great too, so I had to buy the soundtrack. When I voted for this movie, I gave it a 10, if I could, I'd give it a 20. See this movie!

","To say this is the greatest movie achievement of many years is a lie! The Iliad has many interesting intrigues to tell of and only a handful made it to the silver screen. And it wasn't the fun ones either... I missed the gods. This is not a story about a war in the name of love. This is the story of some stubborn, spoiled and bored gods. I've seen other screen versions of this story but they didn't forget the monsters, gods and legends. The sad thing for these version was their lack of technology. They couldn't make the sea monsters look believable. But today we have that technology so I have all right to be disappointed that it wasn't used for this film.<br/><br/>Also, I would like to hear an explanation why the story was shortened from seven years to fourteen days. I wanted to see some desperation instead of Brad Pitts love scenes. <br/><br/>I'm OK with changing the perspective by exchanging the hero of the story from Odysseus to Achilles by you should still stick to the story.

"supertom-3","6","2","4","9 June 2004"," Not bad but I suggest watching Gladiator!
","In the year of the epic this one stood out for me as the most excitable. The other big one left is King Arthur and as a fan of Excalibur I thought that they would have a tough time beating that. Also we have not as yet seen a large scale version of the Trojan wars. It is a story that screams out for a big screen adaptation. Impenetrable fortresses, super warriors and giant wooden horses it doesn't get much better.<br/><br/>As far as your standard epics this is somewhere in the middle. Not great but certainly not that bad either. In terms of spectacle it is fantastic. The film looks superb and has some truly massive battles. In many ways though it offers nothing we haven't seen even more impressively in LOTR. I now the basic details of Homer's story so in terms of peoples complaints that it doesn't stay true enough to the text I couldn't really comment on, but it does have what I wanted to see, the giant wooden horse.<br/><br/>The cast are good. You have a big array of talent all on top form. Firstly though the negative side. Brad Pitt. Now just to point out, I'm not an anti-Brad person. I'm in the minority who thinks he doesn't get enough appreciation for his acting. In Troy however he seems to Brad Pitt, too much like he is putting on an accent and acting. It's not natural and it seems very much like the makers are milking the fact that this is Brad Pitt, much like Cruise was milked in the Last Samurai. As an action man he manages to convince however. He's in great shape in this movie. In fact he has put on a lot of muscle and kept his trademark six pack, the ladies will be happy. Eric Bana is superb as Hector. He also makes a good action man and he is basically Troy's super warrior whereas Achilles (Pitt) is the Greeks super warrior, albeit one who hates his king and can't be controlled. Orlando Bloom is okay but for the guy who causes all this trouble over a bit of skirt he certainly seems to disappear from the film for lengthy spells. Brian Cox is as usual superb in a villainous role as Agamemnon. Is he really supposed to be that evil though, I remember Agamemnon was in Time Bandits played by Sean Connery and he was a stand up bloke. Brendan Gleeson is also good as is Peter O'Toole. Not forgetting Mr Sean Bean as well who is good as ever, if underused. As for Diane Kruger as the trouble making wench Helen. She is really required to do little else than be pretty (and did they have make-up in those days? because she doesn't half wear a lot of slap.).<br/><br/>The films action and effects are as you would expect from a reportedly 200million dollar epic, first rate. The action really crunches, particularly with one-on-one encounters. The fight between Achilles' and Hector is excellent stuff. The battle scenes are impressive but as I said before they aren't as good as LOTR because of the ingenious way Jackson can use effects, he is a master. <br/><br/>The story has problems for me. Not the screenplay as such, but the original text. They had a lot of stories from all those thousands of years ago that can seem at times pretty stupid. They didn't really mind plot holes back then. Yes people will say this is an epic love story, but those people will be females who love Orlando Bloom and want to mother his children. This fool Paris steals away the king of Spartas wife and then starts a war that will probably mean the destruction and death of his kingdom, all for a woman. No offence to Diane Kruger but there is not woman alive who looks good enough for that! I might for Jennifer Connelly though. The real hum-dinger is the fact that the Greeks supposedly seem to have left the shores of Troy having left a giant wooden horse, just large enough to house 500 Greek soldiers with adequate room for toilet facilities and a pool table. Then they decide to bring it into their impenetrable fortress. I reckon that Homer couldn't think of a realistic way that the walls of Troy could be breached so he decided that the Greeks should be let in, then he thought 'I'll have them hide inside a giant horse'. To be honest they did kind of deserve to get slaughtered, and Blooms head should have been put on a spike to show the world what a Muppet looks like. Yes I'm getting sarcastic now but this is a problem, you cannot side with the Trojans. Effectively Greece are the oppressors and the bad guys and the audience should be siding with the Trojans but they aint half stupid. The human side of the story and the characterisation doesn't allow you to get close to a character. You can't help but dislike Paris for being a fool and having a girly name. You can't help but think that Achilles is being acted out by someone. Peter O'Toole as the King of Troy I didn't like either, he should have given Paris a damn good thrashing when he came waltzing in with Helen Of Sparta, and sent them both back. He kept listening to crap advice ahead of sensible advice too. As far as rooting for characters the only one who is given a good human dimension who we can root for is Hector and Bana is very good in his role.<br/><br/>As for the sound and the music in this film. Well the sound is excellent. When people get sliced into two you can really here the cracking of bone cartilage. Every penetration of sword buzzes and vibrates from the rafters to your chair and into your spine. Really great sound design in this and as with most films of this scale it is pretty much got it's name down as an Oscar nomination for the sound. The score however will not. It is a big let down. Apparently they had an original score done then they dumped it and hired a new composer to do it coming up with something that is so standard epic and 'lets rip off Gladiator' that it becomes intrusive at times and at other times doesn't affect you enough.<br/><br/>Overall though this is a good popcorn muncher. It doesn't have any great depth that an epic really must have to become a classic, and certainly I preferred Last Samurai this year in the battle for number one epic. Thus far it has been a bit disappointing as none have come close to Gladiator. LOTR is kind of an epic but it is more fantasy as well. I suppose I'll count them as epics but that means that King Arthur and also Alexander will have an even higher, probably unobtainable standard to beat. Thus far Troy comes third in the year of the epic behind Passion Of Christ and behind current leader The Last Samurai.***"
"mmrosa","Null","2","4","6 June 2004"," Good but not spectacular, missing that special something
","Not a bad movie but it just doesn't have any soul. Comparisons to some recent movies are pretty obvious  LOTR, Peter Jackson's baby was full of its directors love and admiration for the original book, 'Gladiator' was obviously Crow's labour of love. Those were two great movies with lots of character  'Troy' is a good movie too, it just doesn't have that special 'it'. I went to see the movie really expecting the worst after reading some reviews from reviewers whom I usually trust and respect  actually I didn't want to see the movie, but my wife really wanted to see Mr. Pitt  this time however I don't agree with most nay-sayers. I guess my partial approval for that movie comes from the fact my expectations were so low, but anyway, some aspects of it are OK. Eric Bana is very good in the movie. I can still remember him playing little comedy sketches on Australian TV and I was really unconvinced of his abilities as an actor (well, 'Chopper' should have changed my mind I suppose) but he proves to be a very good and versatile one in this movie. He plays the role of Hector with a lot of dignity and pride. He is THE star in 'Troy' I think. Brad's Achilles is very different to Homer's Achilles. I guess that's how the character was written, not really Pitt's fault, but I didn't find him very convincing as such. If anything, he inspired me to work out harder at the gym  perfect six-pack, oh where are thou?  so I guess his role wasn't totally wasted. As to the rest, Helen was pretty badly miscast I think (the actress playing her is quite beautiful but not nearly goddess-like as I believe is required by this character), Peter O'Toole is very good (as always), Sean Bean acts quietly somewhere in the background and that's pretty much it. The battle scenes are good but only just good. LOTR really raised the bar of battle scenes and 'Troy' unfortunately never cleared it. One-on-one fight scenes however are very good, Achilles vs. Hector is IMHO one of the best duels ever. Cinematography is solid but uninspired, score is bland and as I have already mention, the movie just doesn't have that special 'it', simply has no soul. Perhaps one of the reasons for it, is that it's just too short for what is was trying to show. I would have to sit longer in the cinema watching it but I wouldn't mind watching 4-hour long DVD special versions (perhaps one close to the original). Oh, the original. At least I'm glad they called it 'Troy' and not 'Iliad'. The plot, the characters, the story is changed so much there are just shades of the original there  don't watch it if you love Homer's classic, it's going to break your heart. One could only imagine what would happen to Peter Jackson if he had taken so many liberties with LOTR  I'm sure he would get lynched by Tolkien's fans! I give it 6 out of 10. It's not as bad as some make it to be, but classic it is not. Anyway, I'm off to the gym to work on my abs!"
"crypticcrytic","8","2","4","5 June 2004"," Semper ubi sub ubi, Brad.
","Clocking in at two hours, fifty-five minutes - less ten if you pass on the final credits- 'Troy' has thrice your daily dose of testosterone, while offering a chance to redeem those tuition dollars you invested in your liberal education. If Achilles took my tagline advice, he may have survived to pillage and plunder. And no, it has nothing to do with ankle armor.<br/><br/>'Troy' has a good balance of action and plot development with special effects that don't rely on a darkening screen. The scope of the Iliad calls for lavish treatment, larger than life performers, spectacular effects and a cast of ...well who can really tell? With the revelations of those (Star-Wars) special-effects geeks that portrayed the cheering throng as really a bunch of multi-colored Q-Tips, who can really believe our eyes anymore. The casting of Troy was epic alone, with many of the major and most of the minor talent of the Anglo-Saxon stage and screen. You couldn't throw a spear without hitting one.<br/><br/>If 'Troy' sparks an interest in 20% of the audience to review some of those dusty classics and discover a world ignored by most of our 'literate' Americans, I say, Eugepae! Even if you came just to see Troyboy Brad Pitt and walked away with a curiosity for the bigger picture like 'you mean those early Romans were known for more than prophylactics?' or 'Achilles wasn't such a heel after all,' it has achieved some good.<br/><br/>My memory of classical literature has dispersed to the extent that my recall of pertinent detail was as hopeless as the Trojan cause. So rather than struggling with it, I let it flow and hoped to pick up shreds later as I did with the aid of the internet - NPR and Google - making it more worthwhile when it's put in context. Like Odysseus (Sean Bean) who's deference to Achilles' penchant for war for his own talent for treachery, sets up a unique opportunity for a sequel with his name on it. For a hint to a potential conclusion to this trilogy, pay attention to Paris' hand off near the end to a young Aeneas.<br/><br/>Veni, Vidi, Amavi!"
"Lunagoddess","8","2","4","2 June 2004"," Good adaptation of the Iliad story for modern people
","I thought the film did an excellent job of adapting the Iliad story for a modern audience. When I read the Iliad in high school it was the most difficult muck that I ever had to wade through, and so difficult to understand because there were so many different characters with 4 different names per character, and by adding all the actions of the gods to that, it was pretty incomprehensible. However, the film minimizes the characters to only the important ones (although there are still a lot of characters), and cuts out the gods, which makes the film more applicable and understandable to today's modern audience. The film is like a version of the Iliad that says, ""This is the story as it actually happened to human beings,"" instead of reducing the credibility of it by having multiple gods take all sorts of actions.<br/><br/>Also, the film did a good job of portraying the characters as real people, and of showing their motivations for doing things. In the Iliad, a lot of times it wasn't clear why people did anything. In the book they just say, ""Paris kidnapped Helen,"" without ever going into why Paris was so willing to risk a huge war over this woman (I don't think it was just for a pretty face). I thought it was good that the movie went into more detail about that, explaining the motivations and made it seem more realistic.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an interesting film, although there were some historical inaccuracies (which will not be mentioned here for spoiler content), if you consider Herodotus to be historically accurate."

","Shame. All that time, effort and money to create an ""epic"" of which nothing will be remembered within a month.

Achilles was a warrior of mythical prowess. A talisman. A leader of men. As written here, he's a sulky lout with dubious and contrary principles; a wobbly foundation on which to build a tale of legend. Likewise Orlando Bloom - would you risk a kingdom for this insipid drip? Thanks the gods for Bana, Bean and Cox who add weight to the often-dull proceedings.<br/><br/>Try as it might, Troy fails to match - or even offer anything different from - the battle standards set by The Lord Of The Rings.

","I've heard some quite mixed reviews about this movie, and while I can understand that some people don't like it, I think ""Troy"" is a very solid and entertaining action epic that is a lot better than many make it out to be. <br/><br/>If you expect a serious recreation of the Iliad though, you'll be disappointed. The story has been simplified and altered quite a bit (probably to make it fit into a three-hour movie), but it's still by no means a brain-dead action movie. Apart from a couple of unnecessary parts (the Achilles - Briseis relation, for one), ""Troy"" still offers a strong and coherent story with characters that actually have some depth. Considering that they could have turned this movie into a sentimental piece of trash (e.g. something produced by Jerry Bruckheimer) it's good to see that ""Troy"" at least manages to avoid some of the cliches and overly simplistic depictions that plague many Hollywood ""epics"".<br/><br/>The acting is generally quite good, as well. I don't see what's the problem with Brad Pitt as Achilles, and the rest of the cast is good as well, with Eric Bana as the obvious highlight. <br/><br/>Where this movie really shines is the action scenes though. Although there aren't as many of them as you might expect, the action that is there is beautifully shot, quite realistic (no bullet time here), and sufficiently visceral. And fortunately, the editing isn't all over the place like in ""Gladiator"". The fight between Achilles and Hector in particular stood out.<br/><br/>
All in all, ""Troy"" certainly isn't a masterpiece, but is certainly isn't a stupid action blockbuster either. It messes up some of the details, but overall it offers a good story, sufficient depth, fine acting and excellent action. Certainly worth your time.<br/><br/>*** out of **** stars"

"sjwest","8","2","4","30 May 2004"," The 'Not The Choir Boys Show'.
","If there is anything the poster was going to scream at you, it was that this is going to be one of the biggest movies of the year. In the cast department, we have Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Brian Cox, Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole. When quality actors are brought together on the same production, you know that it has to be something special. Then there is of course the director, Wolfgang Peterson who is synonymous with movies that display his penchant for realistic craftsmanship. This is no more admirably displayed than in 'The Boat'. The team list and epic sequences brings comparisons between it and 'Ben Hur'. In my opinion, it will not surpass 'Ben Hur', but you will find no better way to be spellbound at the movies this year.<br/><br/>One cardinal rule in the art of movie-making is that you must capture your audience within the first ten minutes. Enter a stand  off between two great forces led by determined powerful Kings. A dispute settling challenge is agreed upon and out steps a snarling Herculean warrior waiting for full blooded action. The Kings calls for our hero and he is eventually tracked down sleeping off a good night with the women. He snaps up the challenge and nonchalantly makes his way to the battlefield. A malevolent grin cracks across the giants face as he eyes out his diminutive opponent. It begins and Achilles dodges the spears and leaping into the air buries his blade deep into the colossus's shoulder who falls to the dust. Oh, and by the way this is for a kingdom. Interested yet?<br/><br/>A movie of such grandeur necessitates CGI in order to field a great attacking army. This is delivered supremely and we are aghast at the magnitude of the force. The explosive impact of the massive battles that take place explode across the big screen as we witness a titanic struggle between an army thought to be invincible and a gargantuan drove of soldiers at the service of a power hungry king. Although some of the CGI is noticeable to the practiced eye, it did not dilute the realistic effect.<br/><br/>The individual battles were well coordinated and it is obvious that a great deal of planning and preparation had gone into these scenes. They indicated the supreme skills of Achilles and the brute strength and courage of his followers. The only evident fault here was when the Greeks landed on the beaches of Troy; it was noticeable that these scenes were slightly speeded up in order to capture the ferocious pace of the battle. While understanding the purpose here and it is essentially a good idea, the speed reduced the realism effect. Fortunately, this effect was used sparingly throughout the forthcoming skirmishes.<br/><br/>The scene between Prince Hector and Achilles' cousin was another well prepared scene and it showed the lack of battle time that the cousin had. His inability to keep his balance and poise led to his death at the hands of a revered opponent. This would prove to be the turning point in fortunes for the Greeks as Achilles was now going to put the rift between him and the King to one side as he sets to avenge his cousin.<br/><br/>The story was an encapsulating one. We have the hero on the side of a grossly ambitious King who wants all the credit in history for the conquering battles that are undertaken. They are against a King who is virtuous, albeit naïve, and leads his people with respect and honor. Prince Hector is the way Achilles should be. Although not as great a warrior as Achilles, he is a noble one who fights for his own survival and that of his people rather than for notoriety. This is a classic character situation where the opposing forces are opposite in nature and their interaction will influence their outlook. It is Achilles the hero, who learns from his journey. The characters turning point was witnessing the risk that the King took in trying to give his son a decent burial. Achilles realizes that his lust for immortality within the annals of Mans history books is at the cost of his own humanity and the love of a Princess.<br/><br/>His revelation motivates him to sends his soldiers home as his battle was now a personal one for love and not the glory of the battlefield. During the invasion of Troy, he searches only for the Princess and when he finds her, his passion for war is lost and in its place was his passion for her. Her cousin attacks him and although processing the skill to kill him, he does not. He was no longer the self  serving bloodthirsty warrior, but a man who had saved the woman he loved and had now achieved the honor that a great warrior should have. This tragic ending was indeed a fitting conclusion to the story and it made its impact on the audience.<br/><br/>The performances were all good with the ensemble cast delivering the goods. No  one stood out, but this is indicative of the fact that the actors were all of a high standard rather than someone not putting in an outstanding performance. Brad Pitt was ideal for the role of the hero as the audience could see the good in this warrior and the lessons learned did not seem out of character, but rather as inevitable. Pitt's nature was thus exuded. Brian Cox was a natural for the role of a power hungry King and his affinity for the role is plainly evident. The audience can sense the pleasure that he takes in playing an evil, powerful character as he revels in being somebody outside the norms of his regular life. Who can forget him as the original Lector in 'Manhunter'? Many a critic thought that he was better and for me that is no surprise. It was good to see Peter O'Toole and although age has softened his eyes thus making him amenable to playing the role of a compassionate king, he still has an obvious air of authority. Indeed the movie had a cast worthy of it.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Peterson has yet again delivered a story that virtually all can see. Despite the lavishing of violence and romance, the movie appealed to both genders, something very necessary for blockbusters. His craft is showcased once again as his skill at delivering realistic scenes and sets is graced upon the audience.<br/><br/>Watching an epic movie is a great way to spend some of your spare time. The strong emotions that they evoke as well as the spellbinding visuals will keep you entertained from the introductory narration until the rolling of the credits. Producers know that people like to escape to another time, another place and engage themselves in a story of a hero that they would wish to aspire to. Unquestionably, grand historic periods are formidable settings for this to happen and tales of valiant warriors have spellbound people down the ages. No movie as big as this would have been appropriate without a message. It would not have done justice to the scale of the project and ultimately all truly great stories must teach as well as entertain. We see that personal glory at the cost of humanity is unfulfilling and does not attain true honor in the writings of Man. Like Achilles, if we all listen, we can learn."

","This movie captures Brad Pitt in an entirely different light. I know they probably used trick wires, but it was great to see Pitt as a warrior, especially when he fought against the 2 greatest fighters of Troy! This movie is a must-see film for all young adults and older adults alike! Helen of Troy wasn't as good looking as Perseus, but oh well. I really loved this movie, as it tells the story of the Trojans and the Greeks. It has evil, good, darkness, and of course, the central theme, love.

","I think that most people going to see Troy were looking for something a little more akin to Ridley Scott's gritty Gladiator film. But that is not the case with Troy, it is gritty yes, but in a different way. The film takes place on a huge scale and is full of epic battle sequences and one on one combat scenes, all very intense. A lot of people have criticized director Wolfgang Petersen's heavy use of CGI but I doubt it would have been possible to get 50,000 extras who know how to stage fight with 3,000 year old weapons.<br/><br/>The performances in Troy rely heavily on the actor's abilities to seem serious through the admittedly weak dialogue and because of this film's pedigree the performances succeed in being just what they need to be at any given time. Brad Pitt looks and acts like what i imagine Achilles would have looked and acted like. Brian Cox, the new European villain du jour has a great time as Agamemnon. Eric Bana stands out as the reluctant Trojan champion Prinec Hector and Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean are solid as usual.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the film are the characters of Paris and Helen. Both seem selfish and weak and it is maddening to watch Orlando Bloom perform his final scene. Otherwise, a great underated film."

","I believe that this wonderful epic is one of the best films I have seen in along time, although my opinion is biased because I am a great fan of these sorts of films. Obviously Troy fails to surpass the great Gladiator, but I believe it is up there with Braveheart. The reason why I thought this film was so good,not only does it have a great story line to begin with. It also has a great cast to go with it, I thought inparticular Hector's father was superb. Another thing that I thought was outstanding about this film is the actual city of Troy as it is so detailed and really quiet amazing. I was glad to see that there was not much computer graphics, and the majority of the outrageously large budget of 125 million was spent on set, actor, etc. Because these days the majority of films in my view have to many computer graphics, a prime example of this is van helsing, which in my opinion was possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Overall I thought that Troy was the best films of 2004, so far. Hopefully there will be more great epics coming my way. Thank you, and goodnight."

","Any review of Troy must be necessarily long and complicated. It is one of those films that gets some things remarkably right and other things remarkably wrong. The result, imbalanced film-making and lengthy reviews.<br/><br/>The Cast:<br/><br/>Well, so far many have said this and I will add my voice to theirs: Brad Pitt??? Were they thinking? Pitt is a far better actor than most people criticizing this performance grant. But, this was not his performance. They tried harder to match body-type than Screen-Actor type and it hurt the film and Brad Pitt. <br/><br/>Orlando Bloom does a decent job but nothing close to what this kid is capable of. His acting is better than in LOTR and Pirates . . . so he's improving but, sadly, don't expect much from a Paris that comes off more pathetic than necessary <br/><br/>[Blame the script for this as well]. <br/><br/>Brian Cox has a good performance but it is shadowed by the sheer brilliance of Peter O'Toole's job as the tragic king of Troy. Undoubtedly, O'Toole will land another Oscar Nod [Supporting of course] and he probably has his best chance of winning one in more than two decades. Eric Bana could surprise us with a<br/><br/>2nd Supporting Actor nod for Troy with a performance far better than many<br/><br/>anticipated. He captured the passion and reverence of Prince Hector in a way that shames most of the other cast members.<br/><br/>I can sum up the ladies of the cast in one word: Forgettable. None of the female characters stand up to their Male counter parts.<br/><br/>The Rest:<br/><br/>Cinematography is well done. Especially when one considers the Cinematographer was strapped with demands to make this film look like a marriage between Gladiator and LOTR. Wolfgang Petersen did a good job working with his Cinematographer to get, what in my opinion, are the best possible shots for the script in many areas.<br/><br/>Art Direction/Set Direction and Costume Design are well done. If you are a historian, archaeologist, or other purist prepare to be disappointed. The Costumes, while authentic looking, are authentic for other armies and other times. If accuracy is the issue, this stuff fails. If a unified wholistic image that is awe-inspiring in areas and captivating in others, then this stuff succeeds. In short, your degree of satisfaction is based on what degree of historical accuracy you are looking for.<br/><br/>Nothing special by way of the Script. Part of Pitt's and Orlando's failure is due to unremarkable lines and even awkward dialogue moments. Editing, Visual Effects, Sound, etc. all acceptable, even well done in areas but nothing so wonderful that we are talking multiple nominations for this film.<br/><br/>And, finally, the Score: James Horner is a great composer but this film's score is nothing more than a glue-job of pirated scores and themes. It is mainly influenced by Gladiator with echoes of even the Hercules/Zena t.v. series. Even more alarming is the direct cut of the main theme of Stargate for the final sequences of Troy and the burning of Achilles's body. <br/><br/>[On a historical accuracy note: There was a lot of Egyptian-like elements in the film. No doubt the use of the Stargate score meant to echo that.]<br/><br/>The Summation:<br/><br/>In short an enjoyable and well put together film. Serious issues in the script and the casting [more the fault of the casting director than the actors themselves] causes distinct problems. Definitely worth seeing once.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

Brad's body looked gorgeous, but his face was not the right shape, he should have been more classically featured. He would be best in light comedy roles, like Rock Hudson / Cary Grant.

"rosscinema","5","2","4","31 May 2004"," Unspectacular ""Troy""
","I thought I was going to truly hate this film but after viewing it and thinking about it for a day I realized that while it has nothing to make it special it's not that bad on a purely entertainment level. This is of course based (Loosely) on Homer's ""The Iliad"" and early on we see the Trojan forces on a peace mission in Sparta where Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) discovers that his wife Helen (Diane Kruger) has fled with Paris (Orlando Bloom) to Troy. Paris is warned by his brother Hector (Eric Bana) that this will probably start a war but he insists that they are in love. Menelaus's brother Agamemnon of Mycenae (Brian Cox) views this as the perfect opportunity to wage war and take over Troy but his best warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) is very independent and doesn't hold back his lack of respect for him.<br/><br/>
*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>The united Greek forces head to Troy to wage war but Priam (Peter O'Toole) and his army are ready at the walls and score a victory as they momentarily repel Agamemnon's army. At night Hector leads the Trojan army on an assault while they are sleeping and Hector kills who he believes is Achilles but it turns out to be his cousin instead. Achilles finds out and is furious and heads to the gate to fight Hector one on one. Achilles wins and later the Greeks have an idea on penetrating the walls of Troy by building the Trojan horse and sneaking inside.<br/><br/>This film is directed by Wolfgang Petersen who is one of those directors that can easily handle an epic film of this size but the screenplay that accompanies this story doesn't do it any justice. The dialogue is just unbelievable and it crosses the border into silliness and Kruger especially is forced to utter some modern dialogue. Does her Helen come across as someone you would go to war over? Audiences have become totally accustomed to CGI effects and films such as this are just not special looking and the lack of characterizations and tedious dialogue stick out even more. Pitt has been getting a lot of negative feedback for his role as Achilles and I can't argue that he's probably miscast but at the same time I think he makes this film watchable. Pitt is one of the biggest stars in the world and a solid actor and even in a misguided film such as this his incredible screen persona is evident. Let's face it, you can't take your eyes off of him even though this film lasts over two and a half hours. From the battle scenes to the musical score this is a film that screams ""I want to be another Gladiator""! Unfortunately, it's not but this is a mildly entertaining sword flick that is no worse than some of the old Hollywood films of the past."

It also bring forth some of the hero's of the ancient world Achilles, Hector, Odysseus and Ajax, not forgetting a large wooden horse, (never trust Greeks bearing gifts'). <br/><br/>From the outset of this film I was amazed at its sheer scope, the sets are very good and in most places the effects are seamless. I always have a fear that to much emphasise is being put onto CGI but then I also find that a lot of people are now spending a lot of the time trying to spot the joins. This is a film that does rely on the composition of CGI and live action; yes you can spot a lot of it especially with the 100,000 strong Greek army marching agents the walls of troy. But just think of it in this way, they just couldn't of film it with a 1000,000 real people the feat of managing that many men in one place would have been extraordinary.

This could be said as the character he was born to play.

"Virgil2127","9","2","4","19 May 2004"," reminiscent of the big-budget epics of the past...for good or ill.
","""Troy"" is the Hollywood story of Homer's Illiad. The film is only inspired by Homer's epic poem, and thus makes several major changes to the source material. Most noticeable is the gods, or the lack thereof. In Homer's book, gods fought the battle alongside men, fighting each other although, unlike their Norse counterparts, none of the them could die. Could gods be put into Troy? Probably, but it would add another hundred million to Wolfgang Petersen's budding epic, which is already costing almost two hundred million dollars. <br/><br/>So the gods aren't in it. Petersen has decided to focus on the people fighting the war instead of the gods watching it. This is both a curse and a blessing, as several characters have removed while others have been changed to suit the Hollywood image. Gone is Cassandra, the Trojan seer who predicted the city's fall.There is a theory among literary critics that Homer, possibly a former soldier (no one knows if Homer ever existed), wrote the powerful Greek warrior Achilles to serve as the antithesis of everything he despised in the military. While Achilles is seen as wrathful in this epic, some of more controversial nature has been removed from the film. When Achilles beheads a statue of Apollo (something that spells doom on most cases anyway), the film makes Achilles out to be making social commentary, not arrogantly showing his meglomanical tendencies, as he was in the poem.<br/><br/>Thankfully, some characters aren't changed. The Trojan Hector, played brilliant by Eric Bana, is what some literary critics believe to represents Homer's ideal soldiers, a respectful veterans who serves his country, loves his wife and pays homage to the gods. This one character focuses the audience's sympathy for the Trojan situation, even though it was Hector's whiney brother Paris who first brought the Spartan queen Helen to Troy in the first place. Orlando Bloom's Paris is another character that wasn't changed too much from the book. A flawed character, Paris doesn't share his brother's affection for the military, choosing to service his country better bedside, with as many women flocking to him. Still, Paris tries to do the right thing, and his duel with Helen's former husband Menelaus, although not performed in the poem, reinforces our notions of Paris' deeply flawed by somewhat likable character. Finally, the other factor that focuses the audience sympathy away from the Greeks is Brian Cox's Agamemnon, Menelaus' brother and chief overlord of the Greek fleet. He brings a darker notion to the war, for while some believe the Trojan war was fought over love, Agamemnon openly admits his invasion of Troy is just another power play. Brian Cox delivers performance that is, as usually, his talent, menacing, comical and playful all at once.<br/><br/>Of course, probably the most notable character in this tragedy is ""the face that launched a thousand ship"", Helen of Troy. Diane Kruger is certainly beautiful, and her presence adds a sort of old fashion Hollywood starlet mystique to the role. That said, her scenes are few and the romance between her and Paris seems oddly contrived at best. Still, as a beautiful actress, she does succeed in convincing us that her beauty, in a mythical sense, could spark an epic war.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole is a magnificent joy in this film, playing Priam, the aged king of Troy. Only Eric Bana seems fully capable of standing his ground with this wondrous actor. When Priam mysteriously appears in the tent of Achilles, I suddenly became aware that Brad Pitt, for all his talent, could barely stand beside or against Lawerence of Arabia. Thus, Achilles becomes the sully and stolid warrior in this scene, not because it is called for in the script, but because I am convinced that any emotional outburst from Pitt would be dwarfed in comparison to O'Toole's scene.<br/><br/>The reason the Illiad is such a hard concept to grasp is because ultimately it isn't a story about happy endings. In the original story, only two characters really live to see a brighter day. While the death toll isn't quite that high in the movie (although it is close), thankfully these two characters have roles in the film. The first is something of a footnote to the movie. He only has a cameo, and one line, but Aeneas, survivor of Troy, will go on to found Troy in the Illiad's ""spin-off"", Virgil's Aenid. The second characters has thankfully large part. Sean Bean (Boromir in ""Lord of the Rings) plays the one man Achilles respects: Odysseus. Although his scenes are a bit fewer than others, Bean's Odysseus maintains a consistent role in the film. Odysseus is the clever warrior that solves his quarrels through brains rather than brawn, and we see this through Odysseus' use of rhetoric to mediate and master the roles of Agaemmenon and Achilles. Although a small role compared to Pitt and Cox, Bean seems to have the best lines and the best character in my opinion. His narration, although sparse, provides a comparable book end for the film, at the beginning and end.<br/><br/>Troy is reminiscent of big budget ""cast of thousand"" epics of Hollywood times' past. Ironically, these types of movies were almost the death of some studios, as their elaborate budgets sometimes flopped at the box office. Troy is a brilliant masterpiece in the Hollywood library, but as far as adaptations go, it could have been better and it could have been a lot worse. The film isn't without its flaws, but its epic direction and brilliant actors gloss over the problems, considerably hacking the three hour movie into a sweeping and sprawling epic that commands both our attention and imagination.<br/><br/>***1/2"
"cheshirecatco","3","2","4","17 May 2004"," Just read Homer instead
","It's not that this movie is so inherently awful. It's that it managed to take what is known to be one of the greatest stories ever told and mangle it so badly. I think the chief problem is lack of vision on the part of the director (and/or writer). He seems to want to make an epic of this, and yet he doesn't want epic characters or events. (Witness the lack of gods and the rather blandness of the heroes.) The plot moves forward mostly as an afterthought. I still have no idea why several of the key decisions where made by some of the key characters. Most of the characters are rendered horribly two-dimensional. (Agamemnon, Menelaus, even Priam for the most part is more a caricature than a character.) And he seems to forget about plot points by the end of the movie. A lot of this could be forgiven if the fight scenes were more interesting and inspired, but even as a non-brain action movie this one falls pretty flat. (Yes, we've been spoiled by the constant one-upping action movies of late.)<br/><br/>Of course, the director isn't alone in contributing to the sub-standard quality of this one. The acting is generally unremarkable. (Hector and Odysseus are notable exceptions. Alas, we see too little of the latter!)<br/><br/>The not-quite-redeeming qualities of this movie are nice establishing shots and views of the armies moving to fight and, if you're in to this, Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom looking pretty.<br/><br/>For my money, I'd say skip this one. If you want to see Pitt or Bloom, rent it later and turn the sound off. You won't miss anything and you could listen to the original poem on CD. Better yet, read the original. (Just make sure to get the Lattimore or Fitzgerald translation.) With the 3 hours that this one lasts (including ads), you'll get pretty far. And you'll both enjoy Homer more and you'll probably learn more, too."

","From Wolfgang Petersen and a huge team of international film technicians and artists comes Troy, the latest chapter in the swords-and-sandals revival. Often debated for its distortion of the source material, Troy, to a modern blasé film audiences, often hides its qualities very well...<br/><br/>Troy is a throwback to the mythology-inspired epics of yesteryear, despite certain contemporary touches that ground it in the new millennium. It owes less to Ridley Scott's Gladiator and more to ensemble epics like Spartacus. People who favor a classic good versus evil or a simple protagonist/antagonist model will be surprised, since, for the most part, the many characters on display are surprisingly developed and layered.<br/><br/>Many of the players give out memorable performances: Brad Pitt goes against expectations with an often unlikable Achilles, but the film's real gravitational center is Eric Bana's Hector. Rose Byrne is given her first chance to really impress in a major release, and the other supporting roles - of the kind that were formerly given to actors such as Jack Hawkins, Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn and Omar Shariff - shine thanks to seasoned pros having a ball: be it Peter O'Toole's touching King Priam, Sean Bean as Ulysses (worthy of his own self-contained film) and Brian Cox as a mad, warmongering Agamemnon. The only bum notes, casting and writing-wise, are the very bland Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger as the love duo that sparked a massive war.<br/><br/>Two things annoy and stop this from being a really good movie. First, the scale is sometimes ridiculous, and you get the feeling that one pull-back shot reveals way more CG ships that all the wood in Europe could have allowed, a sad symptom of having to measure up to the Lord of the Rings level of epic audiences have grown used to. Second, this is not Homer's Illiad, but rather an attempt to reconcile that epic tale with historical probability. The Gods play no part and the interpersonal dynamics have been adapted to a late 20th century audiences in ways that are at times more progressive (the women are fleshed out a bit more), and sometimes strangely puritanical (needless to say, any homosexual undertones or relationships from the source poem are completely redacted here).<br/><br/>John Ford once said: ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend"". Petersen and team have tried to blend the two, and the result, while not always successful, definitely has its moments and points of interest."

The ending? Complete surprise. <br/><br/>Three days later, I am still thinking about the movie and am still scratching my head over it. I had a great time not only watching the movie, but also talking about it later. The changes do such strange things to the story. <br/><br/>And yet it still manages to show the war as something unpleasant conducted between two sides that are fully developed and sympathetic. <br/><br/>So very wrong.

"karvan_g","8","2","4","16 May 2004"," worth watching once
","I just came back from watching the film. I would say that this movie is worth watching once (but maybe only once since it is almost 2hrs 45 mins long). Given the storyline, the director has tried to create a believable epic. But i would say that he has only tried but not completely succeeded. There are a lot of similarities to ""Gladiator"" including the music and the haunting, ""wailing"" woman singing in the background. ""Gladiator""'s music was well set for a lot of reasons. Here the sound effects during the fight scenes esp the fight between Hector and Achilles is jarred by onerous music in the background. The music in such ""tense"" sequences, could be playing second fiddle to the sound effects instead of the other way around. There is some nudity in the film. But i think it is unnecessary and has been added purely for box-office reasons. Nudity could have been avoided by using subtle indications.<br/><br/>As for the performances, i would definitely give 10/10 to Peter O'Toole for playing the king of Troy so incredibly well. He is very convincing as the proud and confident king before the battle, as the scared father during the battle and as the father who lost his son after Hector's death. Eric Bana (I first noticed him in ""Black Hawk Down"") does justice to the role of Hector, the prince and heir of Troy and also the best Trojan warrior. His acting is just perfect, not underacting not overacting. Diane Kruger as Helen of Troy, makes us wonder how she could have been the ""face which launched a thousand ships"". She is definitely good-looking, but doesn't have that ""out of the world"" beauty that Helen was famed to have. Even Liz Taylor did justice to ""Cleopatra"" much better. And definitely she should learn more in the acting department. Orlando Bloom: Oh my god! What a waste of money! He could have been replaced by an unknown actor who could have gotten a chance to prove himself. He is not convincing at all as the ""ladies man"" when he steals Helen, as the cowardly warrior when he fights the husband of Helen, or as the warrior who has suddenly realized that honor is more important and fights back. He has a long way to go in learning what characters he might fit best.The person who stands out though is the actress playing the cousin of Hector. I don't know her name, but definitely she has played her part very convincingly and she also is a ""looker"". <br/><br/>Okay, okay! I know you have been waiting for my views on Brad Pitt. Actually, i have none except that he shoudnt have played the part of Achilles. He struggles throughout the movie to be convincing as Achilles. Waste of money, again! But i guess ladies will go to the movie to see him nude.<br/><br/>Neways, as a person who has read ""The Illiad"" by Homer, i can confidently say that if you have read the work or have come across parts of the work somewhere, definitely there might be some gaping holes in the movie. But this is a Hollywood movie and you can expect that from one since they are made to make money, not be true to a literary work of do justice to history. That is why, the studio has very clearly stated that this movie was made based loosely on ""Illiad"". But to the average moviegoer, ""Helen abduction"", ""thousand ships"", ""Trojan Horse"", ""Achilles heel"" etc might seem familiar and associated with the war between Greece and Troy. The makers of this movie have been sure that all these popular components have found their way into the movie. But definitely, who said that they stuck by the literary work!<br/><br/>The graphics in the movie are very convincing and to the naked eye, very ""realistic"". Locations are superb, photogrpahy is stunning and so also the special effects. Don't expect to have any emotions like you might have felt in the ""Gladiator"" because though the makers have tried to weave 2 love stories(Paris's and Achilles's), father-son sentiment, husband-wife sentiment etc, it doesn't jell well with the audience because of the jarring music and the ""wailing"" woman singing.<br/><br/>Go to this movie expecting to get your money's worth of entertainment, but nothing more. BTW if you hadnt noticed, i have not given the story away, since i want you to see for yourself to judge the movie."

","Just saw Troy and loved everything about it except the script. WHY, WHY, WHY do screenwriters and directors insist on mucking up well-known stories? The story of Troy has lasted thousands of years because it is a great story. Who the hell do you think you are to ""improve"" it? How many superb novels and Broadway plays have been butchered for the screen this way? WHY? (I wish I could shout that louder.)<br/><br/>How in the name of all the gods does it ""improve"" the story to waste significant screen time on a degrading ""fight"" between Menelaus and Paris that contributes nothing constructive? A clever writer could have sidelined Menelaus far easier than that. And since when is it good storytelling to denigrate your young romantic lead? Sheesh!<br/><br/>Several other aspects of the script annoyed me greatly. One: the constant harping that only great deeds will get you remembered by history. We got that the first time it was brought up. And the next and the next and the next.<br/><br/>Two: There was no sense of any ten year duration. Looked like a couple of weeks, tops.<br/><br/>Three: Paris and Helen both escape and live happily ever after. What a 50's copout! Ya wanna happy ending? What was wrong with the real one? Andromache and Helenus escape and build a new life together. And where was the rest of Priam's family? Cassandra? Hecuba? Etc.? We didn't need a lot of about them but they sure shoulda been there. Picture Peter O'Toole watching his city burn AND all his children and wife being killed. AAARRGGGGHHH!! You may have cost him an Oscar.<br/><br/>Aside from raging about the movie that Troy should have been, I can still appreciate what was there. Namely, O'Toole, Pitt, Cox and all the gang. Absolutely splendiforous performances from everyone. Sean Bean is Mr. Heroic in my book.<br/><br/>I wish we could trust Mr. Petersen and Mr. Benioff to film the Odyssey and not just jack up the title and run their own dimestore version under it.

But, I think the one-on-one battles were better. the love story: the Paris and Helen love in the movie was showed with much more passion than in the Iliad. It was quite touching. Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom really played their characters well...they really looked as if they were in love. But the most emotional love in this movie was Hector's and Andromache. the story: was timeless. The god's not being there did not bother me. I think it was smart to leave out the gods.

","Firstly I do not comprehend his perseverance to present Greek as barbarians. The villain however from all is that he twisted authentic history and he presented a... tail. The Trojans are presented as brave and moral (that was truth) while the Greeks were bloodthirsty, immoral, avid, coarse, rapists and a lot of other. And of course remains the following query: If the Greeks were those that Petersen presents how they produced culture? Mr. Petersen doesn't stop here unfortunately. He changed even the end showing disrespect in a immortal work. In the film Paris is not killed but he escapes having his beautiful Helen in side. The fact that actually Paris was killed and Helen returns with Menelaus back to Sparta obviously is a detail for Mr. Petersen. Petersen however had attended to all. He ''killed'' Menelaus, he ''killed'' also Agamemnon and the Greek leaders came out from the middle. Also even if it reports that the Greeks were roughly 50.000 men, however in the impressive plans of battles it seems over a million! It is not reported nowhere that this war kept 10 years. Seeing the film it gives you the impression that they passed hardly... 15 days from which the 12 were armistice. The positive points of film were that it removed all unrealistic things (divine interventions, monsters etc.) giving thus more historical picture. Positive was the choice of Patroklos that resembles with the one that we all had in our brain and finally the bravery of Ektoras even if the director made it only in order to stresses the opposition between the good Trojans and the bad Greeks. Finally, I would want to say the following. Somebody that has not read or remember the true story, seeing the film will believe that the true was as the film shows. For this reason, at least as for the instructive and pedagogic part the film failed. I spend 2,5 hours in order to see the film and 3 more in order to explain to my friend (that he is ignorant of history) that the true is completely different.<br/><br/>The true is that Achilles never been in the town of Troy because he was killed by Paris before the Greeks make the Horse. Paris was KILLED as well during the war. Menelaus and Agamemnon never been killed in this war. Menelaus took back his Beautiful Helen. Helen killed herself after the death of Menelaus. Agamemnon was killed in his bath by his own wife. As you see, the true story has nothing to do with the movie film. Shame to you Mr. Petersen. How would you feel if Greeks make a film called ''Hirosima'' where the Japanish drop the two atomic bombs against the Americans? What if Juliet never fell in love with Romeo? What if everybody died in ''Gone with the wind''? I expected more respect in this immortal piece."

Other than that, the only thing that I could say is that the choreographer should have gotten a lot more love. Some of the best fight choreography that I have seen in a long time.

"purelily19","6","2","4","15 May 2004"," Just Eye Candy
","I thought Wolfgang Peterson directed good movies. That is until I saw Troy. Troy was highly anticipated by me, and not merely for the fact that Orlando Bloom, Brad Pitt, and Eric Bana were starring in it. I truly believed that this movie was going to be the next summer blockbuster like Gladiator was. I was mistaken. This movie played out like a mediocre soap opera. I know I have seen better television shows than this big screen, million dollar picture. Everything made it sink lower and lower than it should of. I have pinpointed some areas which needed drastic help to improve this movie:<br/><br/>The Acting - How can Wolfgang Peterson be happy with the acting? The only good actor that carried the movie was Eric Bana. I was expecting more out of Brad Pitt, but he never seemed to deliver. And his emotional outburst at the beginning of the movie really bothered me. It hit too close to Russell Crowe in Gladiator. Also, why Orlando Bloom? He can not act beyond what he has done in previous movies. I now have to admit he is in movies just for eye candy. Nothing more. <br/><br/>The Music - The score didn't play along with the time period of the movie.<br/><br/>One minute it played heavy brass, and then switched to some mournful woman singing away (again, like Gladiator). The music made the movie cheesy. There was no great score to work with the film to make it better.<br/><br/>Make-up - O.K., I know this is minor, but I couldn't focus on the dialogue when I had to stare at Diane's face with one eye done in make up and the other eye without any. Was that to add to the effect? I don't know. But it did happen more than once.<br/><br/>Dialogue - Was this movie supposed to be funny? In many places I found that the characters humoured me. Why? Because the dialogue was cheesy and my 4 year old cousin could of come up with the lines. <br/><br/>How could Peterson make such a horrible movie? I know it will bring in money because the teenage girls will flock in droves to see Pitt, Bloom and Bana on screen. That is really all this film has to offer. I wish I could of liked this film, but with nothing going for it but eye candy, I hated it.<br/><br/>For all of you out there that want to see a popcorn movie, this is decent to see, but just don't expect too much. <br/><br/>P.S. Don't give Orlando Bloom a bow and arrow ever again."

","I have been looking at the previews for Troy for about a year now. So naturally, I was pretty excited for the film's release: Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, Brad Pitt, all great actors. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, all the acting talent in the world could not have made this a better movie. Why? Because the actors had nothing of true good substance to work with. Wolfgang Petersen, whose credits include The Perfect Storm, Air Force One, Outbreak, and In the Line of Fire, should have been able with that experience to come up with a sense of direction. Instead, he gave the film-goer a bunch of pan-away shots, badly blocked shots, and a terrible used-up film score. We all remember Gladiator and the the brilliant story that it told of a fallen soldier who brings honor back to Rome. We all remember that wonderful use of the elements and the haunting, yet uplifting music that was used to tell the story. Wolfgang Petersen should have sat down and taken some serious notes or talked to the Godfather of the movie himself. Actually, Jerry Bruckheimer should have just paid Ridley Scott the extra money and had him direct the movie. <br/><br/>But it is also the screenwriter's fault. The adaptation of the Iliad is a lie. I am not a classicist, but this story was re-written to give a feel-good, cheesy ending to an otherwise horrific-ending story. The women of Troy did not get away, they were turned into slaves and their children were all killed.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom as Paris was a good idea, but he seemed quite like he wasn't sure what to do. Why? Because his character was not written well. Also, for the face and the affair that launched a thousand ships, there should have been a steamy love scene to bring that home. Orlando Bloom's well-tanned, oiled up body is almost not enough really. We needed to see the guts of how Paris and Helen came together. Diane Krueger has a pretty face, but she is useless as Helen. Like much of the film, there is no resonance with her.<br/><br/>In fact, there is no resonance with much of anything. We should have felt severe emotion during the funeral pyre scenes and yet we feel nothing. Eric Bana was awesome as Hector, he brought home the sense of honor and duty that a son of Troy should have for his country. Saffron Burrows, who annoyed us in Circle of Friends, took a star turn as his wife, Andromache. In fact everybody did a great job with what they had, it just wasn't enough though because of bad screenwriting and poor direction."

","*lots of spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>I'm a Homer fan. I admit that. I know that the Iliad actually ends at Hector's funeral, and all the stuff about Achilles' death and the wooden horse and the sack of Troy, as we knew it, was from Quintus' THE FALL OF TROY (around 4th century BC). So the writing credits were already wrong, but I'm happy to see that in the closing credits they did have the line 'Inspired by Homer's Iliad'.<br/><br/>Much has been said about how deviated the plot was or how shallow the characters were, and I'm not going to judge on that. Knowing that Benioff basically re-invented everybody's death is enough for me - yes including Hector's, even though he did get killed by the correct person: their actual one-on-one was in fact extremely short, and Achilles never stabbed Hector to death with a sword in the Iliad.<br/><br/>The characters, shallow as they might appear, were more often self-conflicting than anything else. A half-God Achilles talks about how God envies human being mortal (a line that looks more like Lestat the Vampire's); a merciful Hector giving Patroclus a bloody stab with such evil hatred that I can't stop suspecting this scene would be right should Bana took off his helmet; a Helen brave enough to sneak back to the Greeks alone at night didn't mention anything like dying with Paris when Troy is being sacked; the conqueror of Greece, Agamemnon, would shout for his soldiers to charge into death without looking at enemy formation; Odysseus, the only guy who had the luck (or 'unluck') to have some original tongue-wit kept for him, was a brilliant, philosophical joker. One comment actually mentioned that bad scripting was to be blamed instead of bad acting, and I certainly found it so, for even Orlando Bloom got his moment right before engaging Menelaus with a sparkle of being totally lost.<br/><br/>And I don't want to mention the total demolition of secondary characters (Nestor, Patroclus, Ajax etc.) because the movie is trying so hard to 'shine' the major people.<br/><br/>I do love the few huge battle scenes: the Myrmidons hacked and slashed their way to the Temple of Apollo; the defence of Troy; the sneak fire attack to the Greek camp. Pretty thrilling and well-controlled. The best one-on-one goes to that between Hector and Ajax (who should be Aias in Greek, btw, because Ajax is Latin).<br/><br/>Peterson has his shortcoming for having no new tricks: I find in TROY shadows of LOTR The Two Towers (Troy's 1st successful defence), The Matrix (one-on-one between Hector and Achilles), The Gladiator (one-on-one between Hector and Ajax), and even Schindler's List (the sack of Troy, with no sound but a lone soprano chanting away). But this is not the major reason for TROY to fail to be truly epic. I'd forgive the re-invention of the story for the Iliad was no history either, and Peterson got his fluid mastery over the scenes, but I still see that he probably doesn't take TROY as seriously as he should have done.<br/><br/>The sets and settings, so much praised for being 'real', carefully polished and stunningly splendid, are seriously flawed: and that fails TROY from being great. I'll mention a few most prominent ones:<br/><br/><ul><li>The golden statue of Apollo as an archer outside the temple looked like a copy of Hercules the Archer made by A. Bourdelle in the 1900's. That's not a flaw, but all the other statues in Troy are in the early Greek style (c. 7th century BC) which is flat, simple, straight-forward and more Egyptian-like, and this statue is like the only one that is in the late Greek style (c. 2th century BC) that is a beautiful, accurately-represented human body.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Myrmidons called Achilles 'my Lord', a phrase that belongs solely to the English and nowhere to be found in even the English translations of the Iliad. The Greeks would use things like 'son of Peleus' or 'my King' or probably something that is closer to 'my leader'.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The technique used by the Myrmidons to breach the Trojan beach, and the Trojan defence formation, is obviously the famous 'phalanx', in which the infantry line up and use the shields as a wall, wait for enemy to close up and stab in-between the shields. This technique for attack was invented by the Spartans (who were among the ones attacking Troy) and was used so well by them that the Spartans took out Athen's army and dominated Greece during the Peloponessian War. In the movie the Myrmidons used it for attack, the Trojans used it for defence (and wonder how they learnt it from across the Aegean), and the Spartans were running blindly into the range of archers, stuck by the Trojan phalanx and getting slaughtered. Brilliant.</li></ul><br/><br/>So much said, I'm ultimately depressed by what my friends told me - 'Don't get so excited, it's just a movie.' Well, if Peterson doesn't mind a movie that is 'just a movie', I don't either. In fact, this movie sure gives me certain likable treats, and I mind Homer only.<br/><br/>I'll rate it 6/10, for those inaccuracies in the parts where I expected some historical accuracy."

","Umm, I saw this movie last night and they even made us fill out a Neilsen survey regarding it afterwards, but I can't give it a great review (not that our surveys gave us much room to review it).<br/><br/>Where are the Gods? Without the soap opera background of the gods, this movie makes much less sense. Without the competition for the golden apple, and aphrodite's meddling with Helen and Paris, they just seem like a bunch of spoiled kids. ""Whoops, bro, I brought this chick back with me from Sparta."" I mean, really. What kind of statecraft is that? It means more that the goddess of love has made Helen's defection fate instead of a stupid accident.<br/><br/>I also feel bad for the tons of High School students who may never read the Iliad and may never know WHY Achilles' was so invicible and and WHY an arrow in the ankle killed him when nothing else could. It's implied his mother is a nymph (not that the word is even used) but the story of his ankle is never explained. I think this movie would have been much better in two parts, with a better screenwriter. I mean, I loved this story when I read it--it was like an ancient potboiler I couldn't put down. I couldn't believe Helen and Paris were in love at all, and that was the start of this whole war. Without believing that, the rest of the movie seems a little hollow.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the fight scenes were great. Just what I needed to see about ancient warfare--no fancy schmancy fake stuff, just men actually fighting face to face with very little of that computer generated crap that is going around nowadays. Some skill here for sure.<br/><br/>And Eric Bana is great! I find him believable in almost everything I see him in. The only TRULY three-dimensional character in the movie (too bad the women didn't have the opportunity to flesh out there characters like he did). After this, I'd watch him at the opening of an envelope. Too bad one man and some nice fighting scenes can't save this movie.<br/><br/>
I would buy the DVD, though...as long as I could mute certain stupid speeches, ffd through the scenes with the long lost Hansen brother (I mean Patroclus) and learn to get over the lovely tie dyed mu mus (I know blue is a royal color and that they wore tunics, but COME ON).<br/><br/>Anyhow, that's my two or three cents."

","(Multiple SPOILERS)<br/><br/>There's an essential tragedy enacted when Hector and Achilles meet in this film. Each is brave, honorable man, who in a different circumstance ought to be brothers in spirit. But, as Hector fights for his home and kin and Achilles fights for dead Patroclus and to make himself the very definition of the warrior ethic, each is dedicated utterly to the destruction of the other. Their greatness makes them blind. This scene lifts 'Troy' from being a very ordinary, po-faced recounting of a legend and pumps blood into veins. The following scene, with Peter O'Toole's marvelous take on Priam's grieved request, cements this and the film drives to an appropriately apocalyptic finish. <br/><br/>Many will say 'Troy' is a great film and even more will call it a terrible film; it is neither. It is a sturdy Hollywood epic studded with moments both excellent and lackluster. Critics have delighted in suggesting it's a campy throwback to 50s kitsch of 'The Robe' and its ilk, but this is not true; actually, it's too damned low key and phony arty. A bit more trash would have helped. Coming to it after just reading 'The Iliad' is not kind. Ah ha, you say, but why should it compete with some high-falutin' bit of Grecian poetry when it's supposed to be a good night at the movies? Well, firstly, 'The Iliad' is as vital and solid a piece of writing as any in existence, and it's got more action than any 'Die Hard' flick. Homer could turn a story on a dime and make the confrontation of two men not encountered before in the story of sudden deadly interest. It swings from ugly thrilling slaughter to poetic beauty to tear-jerking sentiment to high farce within pages. In short, it's like all the life of the Greeks and the Trojans have been stuffed onto the page. 'Troy', stripped-down, dourly real, is at no time such a rich and involving, multi-leveled work. Hector and Achilles' solitary confrontation on a vast plain reminded me of the finale of Sergio Leone's 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly', and then the real problem struck me. Leone's films with their operatic style, loopy humor and mythical heroes, are far more Homeric than this film which proceeds academically, even dully, for its first half. <br/><br/>Perhaps its worst crime is to rob its characters of the awe that has made them memorable for 3,000 years, that fame the film reminds us so frequently they are trying to earn. Ajax (only the Larger: Ajax the Runner is left out) is reduced to a big guy swinging a club; both he and Menelaus are killed within minutes of each-other by Hector. Patroclus is supposed to be nearly as brilliant and experienced a soldier as Achilles, where here he's a whelp scarcely out of Myrmidon Junior High. The emphasis on Achilles here helps to dull the others, although David Benioff's unwieldy script doesn't help. Agamemnon's part is also frustrating, and tied in to the film's irritating insistence on projecting Hollywood-type morality. This is tale of ancient times with very different standards, some obnoxious to modern taste. Agamemnon in the legends is no saint, but in this era, the warrior leader puts his money where his mouth is; he fights mightily. The emotional Agamemnon had to sacrifice a daughter to get this war moving. At no time in the film is this portrayed. Brian Cox's Agamemnon is simply a ranting, power-mad dictator. In 'The Iliad' though the Greeks are aggressors, they make us admire them for brave and brilliant. Apart from Achilles and Odysseus, I strongly suspect most audiences watching will wonder why they should care for the Greeks. Whilst this is no Manichean battle as in the 'The Lord of the Rings' films, we are clearly reduced to good guys and bad guys. <br/><br/>Iin 'The Iliad', there is both great tragedy and glory in these two armies mauling each-other, rather lost in this version as the Greeks are reduced to Agamemnon's conquering Panzercorps and the Trojans to besieged ranchers. Troy has proved rich ground for interpretation, from Shakespeare's cynical 'Troilus and Cressida' to cardboard sword and sandal epics. So we have a 'Troy' for the post-9/11 era; lines of loyalty, good, and bad, are terminally blurred; idealism is manipulated by conquerors into a smokescreen of self-righteousness; slaughter gains a snowballing momentum until all have to look upon their basest natures. This is a intelligent take but it's not fulfilled; Barry Unsworth's recent novel 'The Songs of Kings' took many of the same ideas and plays them much more competently; the soldiers' desire for immortality in art, and the excuse of Helen for pillage, conquest, and political success; and the possibility that out of their self-mythologizing and violence will indeed emerge a noble future of Hellenic solidarity and glorious myth. 'Troy' wants to explore these things but still have its classical tragedies and heroes too, and it's an unwieldy combination. It's then neither successful as political metaphor or heroic tale.<br/><br/>Achilles too is changed, to an existential warrior longing both for glory and death. But Benioff has the cheek to turn this into a love story. Where Briseis is simply a minor Homeric pawn setting off Achilles' dispute with Agamemnon, here she's a Trojan royal princess protected by Achilles. Achilles of 'The Iliad' is a perfect soldier as likely to be emotionally involved with a chattel woman as he is to become a wheat farmer in Macedon. This aspect is only added so we accept his killing of family man Hector more easily. In our age which respects strength and bravery much less than purposeful constructiveness and protective impulse, Hector overtakes all the Greeks as the story's tragic hero. Hector's earthy, social sensibility is inevitably beaten because Achilles' relentlessness in war comes from his having nothing to lose. As part-god he is aware of the temporary nature of life - this aspect is well put across but his attachment to Briseis is a shallow distraction. This changes but doesn't kill the tragedy of his and Hector's fight. As Achilles drags Hector behind his chariot, a woman behind muttered 'Oh god!' - the story's primal power came through at last undiminished. There's something anti-climactic about Achilles' death, with his confused, unlikely search for Briseis in the falling Troy. That said, the fall of Troy is good, gut-wrenching sequence. <br/><br/>As film-making, and not myth-making, the film is solid and unspectacular; the CGI armies are rather improved, but it's dull compared to the battles in films like 'Alexander Nevsky' and even Kenneth Branagh's 'Henry V' where it looks like real people are fighting and dying. This is particularly why Hector and Achilles' fight saves it; it's personal and exciting in the way the whole of 'The Iliad' is. Visually it's very ordinary, lacking even the moments of plush decoration that made 'Gladiator' a bit more than a glorified remake of 'Rollerball', except again in the conclusion with a very convincing and dramatic burning city. I doubt this will jump Wolfgang Petersen back to the front rank of film-makers as Ridley Scott managed; 'Troy' is really kind workmanlike, well-told, without confusion, but without risks or inspiration either. That said, where 'Gladiator' fell into a morass of murkiness and bad plotting, 'Troy' lifts as its proceeds, becoming more dense and more passionate. Particularly at the beginning, the acting is stiff; Diane Kruger's Helen is desultory, Orlando Bloom's Paris another breathy pretty boy, Brian Cox all shouts and growls. Eric Bana, a brilliant comic actor, keeps landing parts of humorless gravity. He seems less Homeric here than in 'Black Hawk Down', and struggles not to sound like he's from the Bondi side of Turkey, but to his credit he manages emotional depth and grit. Brad Pitt as Achilles is the most important performer, and the real target, but he's not bad, overcoming like Bana the difficulty of mastering hero-speak and capturing a curiously pained superman; one-note but a sustained note. All of these actors improve as the film continues, but Saffron Burrows and Peter O'Toole make the best impressions, both with tremulous, convincing emotion. What this film leaves you then with is a confused yearning, to have been given more, to have felt more, to have thought more. It should be twice as great as 'The Lord Of The Rings', but it's not half as good a movie."

","I didn't expect much from Troy, and I'm glad that I set my expectations low. It was a good film, but nothing more. I can see it being overtaken by future films this year, quite easily (although it should achieve a Best Director nomination next year in the Oscars). The film was done justice, but it just didn't have the factor that so many other films had. It was a long film, with very little put into it.<br/><br/>I felt that Peterson could have done so much more with this epic concept. It was just battle after sex scene after battle after sex scene and a little bit of ""honour"" and ""glory"" sandwiched in between.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I found Eric Bana's performance a stand-out from all the other characters. His portrayal of The Prince of Troy was dignified and greatly acted. I was hoping to be impressed by Orlando Bloom, but alas. The best scene with Bloom in was his cowardly solitary fight against Helen's ""husband"". Otherwise, he was exactly the same as in any other movie. I think that we will see a different side of Bloom, once he is given a more challenging and diverse role.<br/><br/>I did find the film entertaining, and I did feel sad at the end (the last 20 minutes were spectacular), but it just wasn't as good as it could have been.

","I feel I had reasonable expectations of this movie: a classic tale of war to be greatly enhanced in its retelling by incredible fight scenes and terrific actors. I basically  assumed the script structure and basic direction would be good enough not to get in the way of the movie. I was so wrong.<br/><br/>   This movie is awful. The  storyline has no linearity and no resonance. I am not even critiquing the liberties taken with Homer's work. It is just that in terms of how the story in the film is told, there is no clear vision. Obviously, the battle scenes are pretty exciting, but the rest of the time there are serious lags of interest. There are several film sequences in Troy that could have had remarkable impact, but were lost in boring still shots. While the fight scenes were well-staged, many other scenes were poorly formatted and blocked. The script could have employed a few devices to make the story and its characters more coherent and cohesive. These lapses in the screenplay, cinematography, and direction produced a sodden, overcooked  mess of a movie.<br/><br/>    That said, the actors in the movie did a great job. The most worthwhile elements of the movie are Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. They are tremendous in their roles of Hector and Achilles. Sean Bean, Peter O'Toole, Saffron Burrows, and Rose Byrne are very good as well. Brian Cox, though a brilliant actor, is a bit over the top in his role of Agammenon. Orlando Bloom as Paris is a little lost, but his character isn't very well-written. Lastly, while Diane Krueger is beautiful, she is somewhat useless in her role of Helen of Troy.

","TROY was an interesting movie, and I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out, but it won't be a repeat view at the movies for me. The first hour is so campy it's comparable to an episode of the old 60's BATMAN TV show, but the last 45 minutes or so saves the entire movie.<br/><br/>As a wrestling fan, I have to say that Brad Pitt does a great imitation of Raven, in his ""everything is about me"" attitude. Truthfully, ANYONE else would have been better in this role..including Raven himself, probably. Pitt is just SO over the top it's scary...and it marrs what otherwise would have been a great character. I didn't find myself liking the character at all, even for what it was...I found myself wishing his scenes would end ASAP.<br/><br/>The movie's true stars in my own opinion is Peter O'Toole, who should pull out an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor; and Eric Bana, who isn't one of my favorite actors, is fantastic as Hector. Orlando Bloom, who I usually like, is thrust in many scenes into a cowardly version of Legolas and sometimes his scenes are truly laughable.<br/><br/>Garrett Hedland, playing Patroclus, is the discovery of the movie...he often steals the scenes he's part of in such a way that he doesn't come across as over the top, but subtle...you have to be, since most of his scenes are with Pitt.<br/><br/>All in all it was an enjoyable almost three hours...but too much overacting will keep it from being the dynamically remembered epic that most of the critics out there are claiming it to be...<br/><br/>My score - 6"

","Epic (n.) 1) An extended narrative poem in elevated or dignified language, celebrating the feats of a legendary or traditional hero.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd define an epic FILM as being huge in scale, scope and size, something most of the '10' voters for this film apparently haven't ever seen.  This can be anything at all, kids.  ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" from so many years ago.  Even as recent as ""The English Patient,"" or the directors cut of ""The Abyss.""  It can and does exist, with dozens of characters, places and events.<br/><br/>""Troy"" does not fit any of these categories.  Nine-tenths of the film take place in one of two locations (the walls of Troy, or the beach next to it), and the numerous characters speak in wooden, clunky dialogue that was so un-memorable, I couldn't even recall any from the time I saw it, to the time I'm typing this.  And the theater wasn't that far of a drive.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt?  Yeah, he's pretty.  Peter O'Toole?  Great actor, but you can't win an Oscar when you only have six lines.  Most of the actors (save the gorgeous but one-note Diane Kruger) held their own, too, but they weren't given much to do.  Director Wolfgang Peterson is one of the few living directors who COULD deliver an epic, but the entire film collapses under the weight of a boring, paint-by-numbers script riddled with cliches and predictibility.  Want to know who's going to die next?  List the above-the-title actors in order from Most Famous to Least Famous, and start at the bottom.<br/><br/>Yes, it's very pretty; lots of money was spent and evidently we're all still impressed by computer-generated armies.  Lots of people will go see this movie and think it's great, and then forget about it by June.  There's really no reason to see this except it's trendy the week of May 14th, 2004-- it's structured and written like an over-budgeted Soap Opera, from a screenwriter who didn't exist before last year and probably won't after this year.  Seriously.  Check his credits.<br/><br/>Nothing at all interesting or surprising here, except the ending... at least for me, cuz I actually read ""The Iliad.""  If you didn't, then at least compare it to all the epics since, and rent one of those instead."

","Does anyone not know this story? Helen is supposed to be marrying the king of Sparta, but ends up running off with Paris, the younger prince of Troy. Sparta declares war, as does Greece, which has been eyeballin' Troy for some time and uses the incident as a pretext. <br/><br/>Sorrowful anti-war war epic takes its time getting going, but after about a half-hour of self-serious throat clearing we finally get to the war and the movie catches fire. Director Petersen has a nice touch with the action sequences -- he never allows the epic sweep of his story to overwhelm the focus of the camera. (The big battle between Hector and Achilles is a highlight, well staged with some interesting fight choreography.) He also manages, for the most part, to dramatize his anti-war themes gracefully: the only exception is Brian Cox, hideously miscast as Agammemon. (Cox is a character actor who specializes in Snidely Whiplash style villains; he's fine in the right role but here he overacts outrageously, pushing things into a cartoon land that Petersen mostly manages to avoid.)<br/><br/>
Outside of Cox, though, the performances are good. Bloom is not likable, but very believable as the spoiled pretty boy Paris. Bana is even better as Hector, who he essentially plays as an all-American type, a decent patriotic guy in a bad situation. Achilles is an impossible role, really -- he is, after all, the child of a goddess -- but Pitt manages to capture something of Achilles's essential strangeness and the petulance brought on in part by being so outstandingly beyond most men. <br/><br/>Solid all around, except for the sleepy beginning. Recommended. With Peter O'Toole as the weary, somewhat naive King Priam and Sean Bean in a very nice turn as Odysseus."

","I just saw a screening of this, and I was VERY disappointed. All the characters were too dramatic to be taken seriously. Most of Paris' lines got laughs from the audience, but it wasn't because they were jokes. Nothing about this movie was at all inspired. It's just Braveheart and Gladiator all over again, but done with a lot more money and a lot less heart. Hollywood loves to throw big names and lots of CGI into an overdramatic plot that was developed several thousand years ago and rehash it with minimal actual creativity and this movie shows that perfectly. I debated with myself during half the movie whether or not to walk out. The only thing that kept me in my seat to the end was that I had to give my friend a ride. I think he summed it up best, ""That would be a great movie to watch on mute and do Mystery Science Theatre."""

","I have always been a fan of long epic movies, The Ten Commandment and Gone With The Wind being favorites of mine ever since I was young.  I just returned from a screening of Troy and while it had its faults, I have to say that overall it was a decent movie with many good moments.<br/><br/>If I could improve anything I would have liked a better script, since most of what they said seemed trite or melodramatic.  The story line is pretty much what you would find in Homer with the exclusion of the gods and a little more love interest for Brad Pitt who plays Achilles.<br/><br/>
I was not really a fan of the book, but the movie really drew me in pretty quickly and although it was 2 hours and 40 minutes, I really didn't notice.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was only alright as Achilles and I expected much more out of Orlando Bloom, but the performance of Eric Bana as Hector was marvellous. He really brought to life every aspect of Hector that is admirable in The Iliad and he definately sets himself apart as the real hero of the story. It is so touching to see him interact with his wife and young son.  Eric Bana is brillant, while Achilles's story did not really touch me or spark my interest quite as much.  I also wish Sean Bean had had more screen time since he did an excellent job with the few moments he had.<br/><br/>
I don't want to give anything away, but my favorite scene was the battle between Achilles and Hector.  It was breathtaking, even when I knew what was going to happen.  I would see this movie again just for that scene.<br/><br/>As a lover of great epics, I would have to say that I enjoyed the film on the whole.

","Loosely based on Homer's 'Iliad', Wolfgang Petersen directs this epic war film, with an ensemble cast including Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Rose Byrne, Garrett Hedlund, Peter O' Toole, Brendan Gleeson, & Tyler Mane. Set in 1193 B.C., this movie tells the story of a war between the two cities of Troy and Sparta, and the story of one of the bravest warriors to roam ancient Greece named Achilles. King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is ruler of Mycenea, but wishes to rule an empire, so his army slowly conquers the rest of what is now Greece. The only threat to his empire is a neighbouring country called Troy. Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) is tired of war, so he negotiate's peace with the Trojan princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom). Upon leaving, Paris reveals to Hector that he has taken Menelaus's wife, Helen (Diane Kruger) with him, as he loves her. Menelaus goes to Agamemnom to start a war, and Agamemnom manages to convince legendary warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) to fight among the Greek army. Hector and Paris arrive in Troy, and tell their father Priam (Peter O'Toole) of the upcoming war. Agamemnom arrives on the beaches of Troy with 1,000 ships, but after day 1, Achilles refuses to fight, and instead cares to Trojan prisoner Briseis (Rose Byrne). Over the next two battles Hector kills Menelaus, Ajax (who is the Greek's best warrior after Achilles), and Achilles's cousin, Patroclus, and finally Achilles decides to don his armour and face Hector in a duel to the death.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of his career as Achilles, giving the right amount of power and strength. I couldn't care less about Pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying Greece's greatest warrior. No, he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. I have been a longtime critic of Brad Pitt as a second tier talent who became famous only because of his looks, but in this film he surprised me. He is the true star of the film. Achilles is easily the most interesting and entertaining character. I applaud Brad Pitt's effort in making his character a tragic hero. Achilles acknowledges that he is not the son of a goddess and is not immortal or invulnerable. The movie basically shows us how a rumor can blossom into a legend unto itself. Achilles' legend becomes immortal. He even refers to this in my favorite scene when he is inspiring his men and starts the invasion heavily outnumbered and still triumphs. Later in the same scene he scoffs at the so called gods the Greeks and Trojans worship by decapitating the statue. I found this scene symbolic of the movie itself. The gods are nothing to both the characters and audience<br/><br/>Eric Bana is also terrific as Prince Hector, trying to negotiate peace between Troy and Sparta. Besides the supporting cast, Peter O' Toole is just perfect playing the king of Troy.As for beautiful women, there are only a couple mention able: Diane Kruger plays Helen, ""the face that launched a thousand ships."" Some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but I disagree. I'm not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me (not to mention has an impressive behind shot). Besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. If Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.<br/><br/>This movie contains some of the most elaborate action sequences that I've ever seen on film. The costumes and the art direction all stay true to the ancient Greece setting, and they all create a realistic feel to the movie. This movie is perfectly well-made, from the distinguished art, to the intense battle sequences.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen's film benefited from the effect ""Gladiator"" and offered the possibility of expanding commercial horizons towards a movie that achieved a big commercial success . The hand of the director carries out an interesting story as well as thrilling and unsweetened , reasoning the causes and motivations of their roles , taking their time and giving large doses of artistic genius . If you are accustomed to battles as Braveheart or Gladiator, you will enjoy with ""Troy"" , a great epic that shows the limits of the legend , which allowed Petersen to take some particular elements based on the ""Illiad"" of Homer . The battles are breathtaking, thousands of people took part though mostly were staged by means of computer generator . The tale is pretty violent , the struggles are very bloody and savage , in fact , Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did not use stunt doubles for their epic duel . The main cast is formed by big names who give acceptable acting .<br/><br/>The script was written with a mind to keep the important details of the original story intact but to make it as realistic as possible. The gods are there but only in spirit. They don't get directly involved in the action like the original. I think this is a good thing as well. Troy looks like historical recreation rather than a literal translation of the poem. In one scene I thought there was an unlikely event and researched only to find it actually is in the Iliad. When the writer was asking for too much, he was in fact being true to the text. My bad.
I haven't seen that much gladiator movies in my time, but I can safely say that ""Troy"" is one of the most remarkable and action-packed motion pictures that audiences will never forget. ""Troy"", in my review, ""action-packed, beautifully well-made""."

"HaNzz99","8","0","0","17 September 2017"," They don't make movies like this anymore..
","So, recently I checked out the film again on bluray after a very long while because I just felt like it. I do remember watching the film in theaters back when I was like, 6 years old. It was the first time in my life I went to see a movie that wasn't an animated one, so in a way this film is special for me. I remember enjoying it then, but after re-watching it again last night (the longer director's cut, that is) I found myself appreciating the film even more. They truly don't make films like this anymore. <br/><br/>First and foremost, I don't really care if this was loyal or not to Homer's texts. I'm judging it as a movie. One of the aspects that stands up noticeably after 13 years of being released is the scale of it all. The action in this movie is insanely brutal, realistic, engaging, and exhilarating, and most of it is due to its practicality. Real stunts, real people are fighting ""real"" wars, and the film allows you to see this in many close-up shots, making you feel part of the action and truly selling the epicness of it all. <br/><br/>I highlight the practical aspect of the film because nowadays, most war films heavily rely on CGI armies performing CGI battles, and it just.. it doesn't feel the same when you make the comparison. Films like Seventh Son, The Legend of Hercules, The Hobbit, Warcraft, among many others forget the importance of practical effects and the assemblance of lots of extras, in costume, performing actual stunts in front of our very eyes. This things help make the film feel more grounded, and you get to develop higher empathy for every soldier, raising the stakes and making you feel you're part of the action. CGI done wrong can work in detriment of the film, making the action feel bland and repetitive instead. <br/><br/>The film doesn't only offer epic war sequences, though. The romantic side of the film is also skillfully realized, and all of the main characters have their time to shine and showcase some necessary emotional bits. Brad Pitt as Achilees is perfect casting, and he embodies the imposing physicality and agility of the character quite nicely. Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom are also given substantial roles and they both have great chemistry with each other. The supporting cast is also pretty good, with the talents of Diane Kruger as Helen, Brian Cox as Agamemnom, Sean Bean as Odysseus, among others giving their all whenever they show up. <br/><br/>Cinematography is, indeed, spectacular, and some of the shots I could consider iconic at this point (the upper shot showcasing the Greek boats heading towards Troy, Achilles standing in front of the soldiers, panoramic shots of armies clashing into each other, just to name a few). Soundtrack is equally amazing, the chorus in particular is entrancing, and allows the emotions to hit home whenever they must. <br/><br/>As for flaws, there are a few for me. Some characters are somewhat annoying and you sometimes have the urge to punch in the face, in spite of understanding their role in the film. The pacing can sometimes alter, in particular during the first act. We start with a brief action scene, and then it takes a while before it, once again, gets going. You could easily cut some shots or scenes that I felt were unneeded during the first half and the main narrative wouldn't have been affected in the slightest. Also, while I did mention that the romantic aspect of the film is well realized, sometimes it can come off as excessively melodramatic. Not necessarily cheesy, but heading towards there. <br/><br/>""Troy"" is really something to behold. It is an achievement in filmmaking that does stand the test of time. Easily one of the better sword and sandal epics ever produced (not quite as great as Lord of The Rings, but great nevertheless) and still a clear example of how to make an epic movie properly. Here's hoping future directors realize what makes films like these work and click with audiences, and borrow an element or two from Wolfang Petersen's picture."

","*This review may contain spoilers!!!*<br/><br/>I got to see this film through school. I think I've seen bits of it before, but I haven't watched the entire film until now. I've been wanting to see it for a while, but I never got to it, now I finally did!<br/><br/>The film Troy can sometimes be a bit boring, but after a while something pretty exciting can pop out of nowhere. The actors and actresses really seemed to enjoy playing the roles that they did, you could tell that they had worked hard and took the job seriously. and there are some really good actors in the film, for example Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom. <br/><br/>One specific thing that I liked with this film was the fighting scenes. They felt natural and wasn't overdone. I also liked the costumes, they looked real to me. My favourite part of the film is definitely the Trojan Horse scene, because it's such a classic scene, it's probably the most famous scene too. <br/><br/>I decided to give this film a 7/10 because it's a really good movie, but it can be a bit boring at times. I hope you'll find it very interesting and exciting, I recommend that you watch it! It gives you some historical perspective as well.<br/><br/>Like I said, 7/10"
"carlos37andre","6","0","0","13 May 2017"," The war is good, the script not so much...
","The fight scenes are certainly the best thing about Troy, the strategies on the battlefield, and even some ancient myths are portrayed in a grandiloquent and very beautiful way of seeing. Aquiles (Brad Pitt) is the character who seems to work the most within the story (one of the few who can do that, by the way), much for the performance of Brad Pitt, who even arrogant most of the time, still be charismatic. The story as a whole no longer has so many trumps. The movie takes a long time to ""mesh,"" and has a very slow start. And the script itself is not a primordial one, full of very vague dialogues, made only to establish things that will be used as hooks later (in a way not very subtle), and with a very inconstant rhythm, with huge stops, Rather than forced, that break the rhythm of the film without any very concrete reason. All in all, the film does not set out to give you a great, complex story line, so even with a mediocre script it's still a good war movie, with incredible fights and a visual of envy. Ps: The Hector vs Achilles fight is amazing!"
"waqarsabar","10","0","0","4 April 2017"," awesome movie ever seen
","Troy is an excellent movie. For any war/history buff there is enough here to feed upon to overlook any flaws.<br/><br/>First, in response to all the Gladiator lovers who said on the boards that there is no one to cheer for in Troy, I say they are idiots. Gladiator was about a single protagonist. Homer's Iliad was always a complicated, ensemble story. The audience has to deal with a lot of main characters and THIS IS A GOOD THING. Its the Iliad, not Batman.<br/><br/>There was a complaint about the film not having a good side to relate to. This one irritates me. Real life seldom has the simplistic good guy vs. bad guy dichotomy. This in my mind makes Troy that much more believable. When events unfold I actually believed they could happen. Japanese cinema is so good at times precisely because we don't know who the good guy is. The question is simply irrelevant.<br/><br/>The script was written with a mind to keep the important details of the original story intact but to make it as realistic as possible. The gods are there but only in spirit. They don't get directly involved in the action like the original. I think this is a good thing as well. Troy looks like historical recreation rather than a literal translation of the poem. In one scene I thought there was an unlikely event and researched only to find it actually is in the Iliad. When the writer was asking for too much, he was in fact being true to the text. My bad.<br/><br/>OK, visually this film is amazing. Not just the army special effects but the sets and scenery are all beautiful. The costuming is first rate and feels very authentic. Remember, we are going back 3200 years. Quite an accomplishment.<br/><br/>The violence is likewise beautiful. Blood and guts galore, but interestingly it is both on the battlefield AND in single combat. A fight fan will appreciate the attention to detail in the combatants' moves. I had never seen a shield wielded so realistically on film. Spear and sword are given very realistic treatments as well.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is a good actor. No question about that. Here he has a few moments where he seems out of place, a pretty boy in a soldier's world. But the combat scenes with him are more than enough to make up for that. It has already been discussed how much bigger he is than in Fight Club. The womens will have plenty to look at. His character is complicated and this is also true to the Iliad. Brad Pitt does this internal conflict lots of justice. His actions in the film really seem appropriate. I never asked, like I do in other films, ""Why did he do that?"" But this is not Brad Pitt's film. It's Eric Bana's.<br/><br/>Eric Bana was amazing. If Achilles was complex, then Bana's Hector is even more so. I had only seen Bana in Black Hawk Down and The Hulk and while BHD was good, there wasn't much for his character to do but be a soldier. The Hulk was so bad I wrote him off completely, blaming his acting for not saving a horrible script. But here in Troy I have new-found respect. He is the main character in the film if you judge by acting power. Lots of emotional struggling going on here that Bana takes on like a pro. He will join this generation's acting elite if he finds more roles like this.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good enough with a special note for Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox. Their lines are well delivered and their characters are believable.<br/><br/>The writing is good as far as plot development goes but I would take a few points away for some of the modern vocabulary. ""Stop playing with me,"" the pretty Helen tells Paris. ""Playing"" should have been ""joking"" in that scene since I associate playing with modern English and even worse, with modern hip hop English. I shouldn't be getting that feeling in an ancient epic.<br/><br/>A+"

","With no reasonable reason this movie become one of my favorite, I don't actually Know why but I loved it. Maybe it's because the amazing acting by Brad Pitt and how he really made me love Achilles or because of the amazing fighting scenes specially those of Achilles or maybe because of how much I hated Paris which was played by Orlando Bloom or because of the amount of stupidity the really bothered me, I actually don't know.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen ,the German director, did an acceptable work in this movie with few mistakes that I am not going to talk about because they aren't of much importance. David Benioff wrote one of his best screenplays and made me love and hate Achilles at the same time.<br/><br/>The whole acting team were amazing except Orlando Bloom which didn't give his best and I think I hated him because of how the character was written not because of his acting.<br/><br/>After all I really loved it and enjoyed the whole 3 hours."

","""Imagine a king who fights his own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight?""<br/><br/>Not exactly great tbh. A historical war movie similar to 'Defiance' and 'The Last Samurai', but not as good as either. It didn't feel like there was any relationship between the audience and the characters, so it lacked the emotion other war movies have. The one-on-one fight scenes were impressive, despite the lack of good music. As far as themes are concerned, the movie was about mortality and the physical power of a human. It IS original to have a physically- perfect character like Achilles in the 'War' genre, but it's not enough to save the film from averageness. Watch half an hour of this too see if you like it. If not, don't keep going because it's like that the whole film and it's 3 hours long (could've been cut to be much shorter as well)."

","Though Hector and Achilles are different sides of the same coin, it's Hector who gives the commodity any sense of value.<br/><br/>Achilles, you hate loving, and yet still end up disliking him anyway. He had a code, which made him a respectable character, however, he was also very inconsistent and vulnerable to his own emotions - like a little child, to a point where he became a hypocrite, by turning into the very king he abhorred.<br/><br/>Hectors patriotism was very understandable, and he stayed true to his code. However, what makes Hector a far better man than Achilles, is that he displayed consistency. Hector fought to defend... Hector fought for peace.<br/><br/>Paris and Patroclus were foolish mimics of their mentors. Paris had integrity, without the strength and discipline to endure it. Patroclus had a love for war, without a code or purpose to pursue it.<br/><br/>Paris is an embarrassing character with no hope of redemption, Patroclus a sheep, that died in a wolf's clothing. Achilles is an arrogant megalomaniac and Hector... A man of honor, a hero.<br/><br/>That concoction of personalities, with some Priam here, Odysseus there and Agamemnon everywhere else, translated into a poetic collision of tragedy and... More tragedy.<br/><br/>I would've preferred Achilles live, than fall at the hands of someone as unworthy as Paris.<br/><br/>The ladies were gorgeous, and their performances, eye-catching. Wolfgang Petersen made the 3 hours feel like 2, and above all else, inspires a rewatch. The story had you in a firm grasp, and you can't help but love Eric Bana, dislike Brad Pitt and hate Orlando Bloom... and that, is a good thing.<br/><br/>8.6/10."
"efthymispsychologos","9","0","0","12 August 2016"," Excellent Hollywood (although quite altered) version of the Trojan war
","I give this movie 9/10 not because it respected the ancient writings on the Trojian war (it didn't), but because I was captured by it, and watched it quite a few times after the first. It is the combination of aesthetics (scenery, costumes, music, photography) with a tragically epic story that touched me. I have read Homer's Iliad several times, and I think that Troy retains the ancient Hellenic (Greek) tragic element that is so abundant in the Iliad, despite all the changes in the original story. Troy is a very plausible (out of many) interpretation of the actual motives and causes of the Trojan war, and thus comes quite believable to the viewer. Of course it has a typical Hollywoodian touch to it, but it is minimal compared to other Hollywood movies based on ancient stories. Above all else, I love James Horner's original soundtrack that fills every scene with the right emotions (I have a degree in Greek music and I am not at all offended by the western melodies composed here), as well as Brad Pitt's appearance and acting as the most suitable Achilles, both gentle and fierce.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of my favourite movies."

It's a stellar cast with a young Orlando Bloom and a living monument of Cinema like Peter o'Toole. Then the always so good and so beautiful Dianne Kruger. It's a film about love, a love that is stronger than army, more powerful than any King on earth.

"kdavies-69347","7","0","0","15 March 2016"," Artistically Beautiful, Despite Literary Inaccuracies
","Wolfgang Peterson's tastes for deep and powerful stories resonates through the epic adventure 'Troy'. It is a loose adaptation of some of Greek literature's most historical poems (as it seems to be based on Homer's Iliad, and the Aenied from Virgil), brought with flair and a rather beautiful sense of artistic license.<br/><br/>A star studded cast fill every scene of this movie. Most notably in my opinion is Brian Cox as Agamemnon, a man driven by his own nepotism towards his brother, and his desire to conquer. Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, both in their physical prime, portray Achilles of Greece and Hector of Troy respectively and create an excellent dichotomy between their rivalry.<br/><br/>Despite Troy's departure from its poetic origins, it's main theme is one of immortality. Right from the beginning there is a wonderful little quote between Achilles and a servant boy who is sent to summon the warrior to battle on bequest of Agamemnon. The boy expresses his fear of battling the great warrior awaiting Achilles, and he looks down on the boy from horse-top; ""That is why no one will remember your name."" Achilles only dream is to be remembered beyond his years as the greatest warrior in Greece. To die in battle is the only honor a soldier could receive in those day, and was fully expected of them, however only the truly exceptional, or the truly powerful, will be remembered for millennia. The love of the Greek people is what causes the main rivalry between Achilles and Agamemnon, as both are striving to be remembered for eon's after they are gone. It's a beautiful idea, and a constant drive for both characters.<br/><br/>Overall, there are a lot of critics who deride this film for its departures from its literary origin. But I believe, just from a cinematic viewpoint that it is an exceptional tale. Perhaps this film will even aspire a few viewers to go out and read Homer's works. It is a fair estimate that most viewers will watch this film simply for the adventure, and that is where this movie excels.<br/><br/>7/10"

"dgs-94399","6","0","0","13 July 2015"," Not the Iliad
","Taken by itself, the 2004 movie Troy, Written by David Benioff, is a wonderful and exhilarating cinematic experience. The star of this film, Brad Pitt, is truly Achilles reborn and he does a phenomenal job portraying the perfect, yet still flawed, character during his long on-screen sequences. Pitt's portrayal of Achilles' arrogance and rage coupled with his sense of honor and passion for his loved ones could not have been more spot on. Also, Vincent Regan is to be praised for his role as Eudoros, the General in charge of Achilles' Myrmidon Army. While the writer did omit the character Phoenix from the movie, he does a good job of incorporating aspects of the character in Eudoros. Regan does a great job of being the loyal friend a soldier to Pitt's Achilles as well as the often ignored voice of reason. However, if the viewer of this movie has ever read Homer's Iliad, the shine wears off this penny quite quickly as there are many inexcusable omissions and modifications to Homer's original story.<br/><br/>Though the glaring omissions were many, the first that the viewer, who is familiar with the Iliad, notices is the total lack of the supernatural. In the original Iliad, Homer stresses the roles of the Greek gods in nearly all aspects of the story. Nothing in the Iliad seems to occur without the direct intervention, or the express consent, of the gods. However, in the movie Troy, if the viewer wants to see any gods, they will be sorely disappointed. The gods are merely mentioned in the movie and sadly make no appearances. This is shameful as, according to Homer, the gods were real and physically present during the Iliad. Changes to the story line for transfer to screen are to be expected but, in this movie the writer goes too far. Barely a quarter of the way into this movie the Character King Menelaus is (spoiler alert) slain by Hector during his battle with Paris. This event never occurred in Homer's Iliad in any way shape or form. In fact, this character's death is never even mentioned in the play by Homer. Also, (Spoiler alert) King Agamemnon is slain by the character Briseis. This also, never occurred in the Iliad and Agamemnon's death is recorded later to be at the hands of his wife, Hellen of Troys Sister, Clytemnestra. The writer kills two major characters in ways that they were never meant to be killed. This was likely done for effect but does not actually help the story in any way.<br/><br/>The last affront to the true Iliad fans sensibilities was the inclusion of the Trojan horse. This character is famously portrayed at the end of the movie, as was expected, saving the day and delivering the city of Troy to the Greeks. But, as true Iliad fans are aware of, the Trojan horse was not even mentioned in any of Homer's works. It was not until nearly 1100 years later that the story was written of by Virgil in his Aeneid. This combining of stories that were over 1000 years apart, while socially acceptable for the continuity of the movie, is truly a slap in the face for anyone who wanted a true re-telling of Homer's ancient play.<br/><br/>Though this movie was entertaining and well made, the lack of respect given to the original story was unacceptable. This re-imagining was nearly as bad as what was done to Robert Heinlein's masterpiece, Starship Troopers. Troy has the audience wondering if the screen writer even read Homer's original play before typing up this piece."

","Troy (2004): Dir: Wolfgang Peterson / Cast: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Peter O'Toole: Troy is a place of war, destruction and the everlasting punishment of blind passion. Can one woman really be worth the lives of many? That is an argument that the film fails to convince yet Prince Paris steals away the wife of the King of Sparta, which ignites into war. The Greeks seek Achilles to fight on their side. He is said to be the greatest of warriors but he hates the Greek King. Director Wolfgang Petersen captures the feel and exhilaration as this epic plays out effectively although it's a despairing conclusion. Brad Pitt embodies the role of Achilles with confidence and skill. Eric Bana delivers the best performance as Prince Hector who fears for his wife and child. From there the film goes wrong with its initial troublemakers. Orlando Bloom as Prince Paris is totally unsympathetic. After all the lives lost because of this loser we are expected to cheer at his concluding victory when a loss might have been more deserving. Diane Kruger is underwritten and despite her obvious beauty she cannot render this woman anything more than a deserving kick in the ass. Peter O'Toole steals moments as the brave king of Troy who isn't afraid to travel into enemy territory. Visually well crafted film that shows the consequences resulted from destructive decisions.

"Maladjusted_1","8","0","0","1 June 2015"," Some departures from Homer, but largely justified.
","I was quite surprised when I gave eight stars to 'Troy'. I expected mediocrity, or, at the most, a moderately enjoyable but relatively forgettable epic. Putting it simply: I was very impressed. I've read a number of comments which criticise the lack of depth in the film, especially in relation to a purportedly more evocative title such as 'Gladiator'. I strongly disagree. Rarely has tragedy been captured in an epic as effectively as when Priam, played by the great Peter O'Toole, stares in abject bewilderment and grief as his legendary city collapses around him. This scene, the sacking of Troy, really hammers home the moral ambiguities of war; are we supposed to cheer for Achilles (Brad Pitt), Odysseus (Sean Bean) and co., as their charge leads to wholesale slaughter? Can we forgive Agamemnon's (Brian Cox) abrasive nature and cruel and bitter leadership if it helps the Greeks win the war? What I like about 'Troy' is that it doesn't force allegiance on the viewer, unlike many other films which have an unfortunate tendency of portraying the unfavourable side as unholy, evil barbarians (e.g. '300'). The ""historical"" accuracy of this film isn't dreadful, and seems to convey the important details of 'The Iliad' effectively. I've noticed that other, more astute reviewers have identified genealogical inaccuracies, but this shouldn't significantly detract from the enjoyment of the film. A more significant departure from Homer's epic poem is the choice to almost wholly omit the gods and their influence from the conflict; again, this doesn't concern me greatly, as the removal of the divine helps in conveying the Trojan War as an affair framed around human emotion and human error. If you approach 'Troy' expecting a documentary or an unfailingly loyal re-enactment, you will be disappointed. However, if you begin watching this film with an open mind, you may be well rewarded."

"CinematicInceptions","8","0","0","2 February 2015"," Great character driven plot with A- action.
","Though Troy does not follow the Greek legend it is modeled after, it is, in my eyes, the epitome of war movies. It shows every side of what is happening and allows the viewer to feel for the characters and choose who to root for. There is no true ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"", which I think lots of movies would do well to emulate. That said, it is not a perfect movie, but has much more good points than bad points.<br/><br/>Going into it, I thought it would be action driven and have relatively bland characters, but it is incredibly character driven. Achillies, though advertised as the main character, is really one of many main characters and takes the backseat at several points. He has legitimate flaws, mostly driven by his pride and desire for glory, but is still someone you can sympathize with and root for. Hector, my favorite character, is motivated by love of his family and country, and he acts as the voice of reason at several points. Paris, though he initiates the war, generates a reasonable amount of sympathy and is not portrayed as a villain or a total wimp. Helen, like Paris, is not portrayed in a negative light, though her character could have been written a little better. Agammemnon is the only person that I think is incapable of connecting emotionally with the audience since he is only driven by his greed and is the true instigator of the war. Menalaus has relatively little depth, mostly because he (SPOILER) is killed by Hector prematurely. Briseus is the strong female presence of the film and enhances Achillies character by bringing out his humanity. Priam is another semi-prominent character and contributes to the arcs of Hector, Achilles, Paris, and Helen. Lastly, Odysseus is the constant voice of reason and contributes wisdom throughout. There are some other minor characters such as Achilles second, Eudorus, his cousin Patroclus, Nestor, and Andromache. <br/><br/>The movie is, of course, about a war, making action a prominent element. It should satisfy anyone seeking a good action flick, though it gets pretty intense at a few points. There is some gore, but nothing over the top as in the Passion or the 2010 Clash of the Titans. The choreography is great and you can tell that Achilles, Hector, and the Myromidians are incredible warriors even though they don't move with lightning speed like elves or ninjas. It flows nicely and doesn't have any insanely long battle sequences. The three main types of action are one-on-one combat, raids and sacking's as in the climatic battle, and full on army against army brawls.<br/><br/>The execution has some dents in it, but nothing that detracts too much. The script could have been better, but there are lots of good maxims and proverbs from various characters. The visual quality is very good, though not award-winning. James Horner's film score has a good amount of orchestral themes and female opera singing that are commonplace for his scores and many scores in pre-renaissance settings. The acting is satisfactory and even superior in some cases, as it should be considering the All-Star cast. The camera work and cinematography were both sufficient, but not spectacular.<br/><br/>The main thing that might deter prospective viewers is the deviations from the original story. The gods are not included, though they are mentioned a fair amount. This generates some interesting points such as Achilles feeling that gods like the ones the other characters worship are not deserving of his servitude, along with the various leaders he interacts with. The duel between Paris and Menelaus is not taken from the myth and can be a detracting point. It adds depth to Paris, Agammemnon, Helen, and Hector, but the resulting death of Menelaus gets rid of a character who had potential to add to the overall plot. Also, it kind of wrecks the chance of making a spin-off with the Odessey since Menelaus is relatively important to that story. Perhaps Troy is best as an individual film, but I wouldn't mind seeing an Odessey sequel since it would be good to see Sean Bean as the protagonist for once, and because the story deserves better than the 90's movie with Aramand Assante.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who likes action, good characters, or a pretty good and deep story. If you are a fan of any prominent actors, it might be worth seeing. Personally, I feel that it is Top 250 worthy, but obviously others feel differently. If you watch it, you have to be willing and able to pay attention throughout. Also, it's good to have a general idea of the legend before viewing. Overall Rating: 8.7/10."

He pays a heavy price for the discretion of a younger brother.<br/><br/>I think the two characters could have been friends, they both believed in trusting comrades and friends, and standing by them. With Achilles played as such an unstoppable force, Eric's portrayal of a man who pretty much knew he was doomed to face Achilles and not come away with his life.<br/><br/>I really thought Brad deserved the accolades he got for this, but I think Eric should have gotten a best supporting actor out this great performance."
"KineticSeoul","7","0","0","20 July 2013"," Still a epic movie
","Yeah, this one is a epic movie that goes in a narrow direction without much substance. But it's still a epic movie and does have some substance going for it. It's a entertaining epic movie where these mythological stories are shown in a way like it could have really happened that way kinda deal. It does mention mythological gods a lot in this movie but that isn't the primary focus of this movie. In fact the people are portrayed as fools that lack common sense when they believe and worship the mythological gods in this one. And shows how even the most men with honor can fall. The battles are entertaining, including the duels. Which are cool and thrilling at the the same time. Especially one of the duel, since I actually cared about the characters. One is Achilles(Brad Pitt) who is is charismatic, brave, egotistical, cocky warrior that has a talent for killing people and has a ambitious goal of having his name written in history or become legend. In another words he is the type that a lot of girls would fall for. While Hector(Eric Bana) who is a prince of troy and also a courageous warrior that fights for the people of his land. And has a strong sense of code and honor even in battle. And shows respect even towards his enemies. So it may seem like it's obvious who's side to root for especially since on king is better than the other. But the direction it goes makes you actually care about Achilles since he is a man that a lot of guys can relate with in some ways. Plus he is the main marketing tool when they tried to promote this movie, with Brad Pitt flexing his muscle and almost naked in few scenes. But I thought he stood out as Achilles because of his charisma. Well as long as it sells tickets I guess. I personally thought this movie has enough substance and entertainment value to make it worth seeing. The characters was very well integrated into this movie and actually has a presence. This is a enjoyable movie that has a lot of the right elements although it's kinda rushed and weak in some areas.<br/><br/>7.9/10"

","Imagine you're watching a lotr adaptation from a renowned director who employees actors of exceptional talent for this kind of cinema at least. It looks good although soon you start noticing slight deviations from the story you know. How slight? Let's say Gandalf is a pot- head, Bilbo a pedophile, Aragorn a narcissist, Boromir a coward, Gimli a cross-dresser and so on. You ignore it for the moment because Legolas kicks ass. On the other hand Saruman is noble, the witch-king merciful, the orcs valiant and Sauron a dreamer and an idealist. You still refuse to be bothered because..well because Legolas kicks ass. Then the truly big issues emerge, like the oppression of the giants by the greedy dwarfs, the genocide of the orcs by the racist elves, the butchery of the desperate goblins crossing from the desolation of Mordor to the fertile lands of men by the immigration police of xenophobic Gondor. Now you're getting suspicious. Legolas is tricked into killing pour orcs by the dastardly alliance of men-elves-dwarfs who have discovered oil in Mordor and want to steal even that from Sauron's people. And for that they order Legolas to kill Sauron, the world's last hope for freedom and justice. But Legolas falls in love with a female goblin and she teaches him the ideals of communism that make her people so hated by elven capitalism. In the end Legolas abandons his corrupted degenerates of companions and sacrifices himself to get the Ring to Sauron saving the world in the process. The end. I hope dear reader that by know you'd be properly infuriated. Still the Iliad Lotr is not. It is by far the most important work of literature, the core of Western civilization since it clearly shapes the ideas explored by Greek drama in the next centuries. The moral conflict taking place in Iliad is complex and subtle in a way beyond its time. It is understandable if a director is having a hard time bringing it to the screen. But to deliberately screw up something that belongs to us all just to teach us..what? that Greeks were scum?(although it is clear the Trojan War was civil war - Greek names, Greek religion, Greek customs for both sides) Or that authority is corrupt? (a safe message that hurts no one when the original explores the depths of human nature in general and the capacity of everyone for their own destruction) I am disappointed most of all because Brad Pit through sheer magnitude of performance will dissuade any future attempt. What a tremendous Achilles he would be in a decent adaptation, I shiver to think."

Is rendition is probably close to what a invincible demigod would be like. Eric Bana is probably at his best in the role of a good hearted Hector. Brian Cox, as the power hungry Agamemnon, makes us hate his character like only he can do. Diane Kruger seems to struggle in her role lacking some fluidity. Orlando Bloom, as lacking talent as he does, probably did his best performance as the romantic, clueless, charming and cowardly Paris. Sean Bean is perfect as the valiant and cunning Odysseus. And finally, Saffron Burrows moves us with her lovingly tragic rendition of Andromache, Hector's wife.<br/><br/>Now, for a few bad things. The fighting, either man to man or on large scale, is not realistic, and neither are the armors, although they mostly respect the style of the time. Also, the rowing wouldn't be functional as depicted.

"thewillt08","7","0","0","1 April 2013"," Weak Lead Role but Strong Support
","I have a sweet tooth for Greek Mythology and medieval war films. Troy had all the pieces to become a huge success. Wolfgang Peterson brought together a very talented cast to deliver the Trojan War to the big screen. Brad Pitt is the star who plays Achilles and given the role, it was good enough. Eric Bana gives the best performance of his career as the Trojan Prince Hector. Brian Cox plays the same villain once again as King Agamemnon. Sean Bean is a must for this kind of movie as he plays Odysseus. Then there is the wildcard in Orlando Bloom playing Paris. I love these actors, I love the idea, I love history behind the movie, but did it live up to my expectations? <br/><br/>Achilles was played really well by Brad Pitt, but I didn't like it. I know, how does that make sense? Achilles is an arrogant demigod who can't be killed in battle. His character is very one sided and I think Pitt played him correctly and got the character correct, but I didn't like the character Achilles. He is the main character and so important, but I can't stand him. I enjoyed the movie more when he wasn't on screen. Good acting by Brad Pitt, not his best, but given the character and the role itself it was good enough. He has a girl he falls in love with but it doesn't work as well as it should. It sort of shows characterization and growth as a character but it almost makes me hate the character even more. <br/><br/>Even though the main character was boring, bland, and hard to relate to the rest of the cast blew me away, mainly Hector and Agamemnon. Troy is so confident that they can fight off Achilles and the rest of Greece. Hector sees the world for how it is and he realizes that they are in trouble. He knows this war cannot be won and when his brother Paris takes the Queen of Sparta away, he wants to bring her back because he knows it will bring war. Helen of Sparta is the most beautiful women in all the world and Paris stole her from Sparta. Hector protects his brother even though he knows it will bring his doom. It really is noble of him because it shows the strength and weakness in his character. Throughout the movie we see all of his strengths and weaknesses. His greatest strength and weakness is the love of his country. We feel sympathetic for his character as we see him struggle with everything that is going on. Brian Cox plays the exact same character in all of his movies but it works so well. Agamemnon is the greedy brother of Menelaus, King of Sparta. He wants to destroy Troy and burn it to the ground. Brian Cox was casted perfectly for this role. He plays the villain so well and how he treats the world like a candy bar waiting to be stolen and he thinks he can do it so easily. His relationship between him and Achilles drives the movie forward, but the relationship was kind of one sided because Achilles shows little to no emotion and is boring. Agamemnon pushes the rivalry and emphasizes the importance of Achilles. Then there is his relationship between him and Priam, king of Troy. He and Priam are rivals and we see the difference in how they lead. Priam believes in the Gods while Agamemnon depends on an army. Both are their strengths and weaknesses. A major aspect of the story is how characters strengths are also their weaknesses, I just realized that.<br/><br/>Troy is based off of Homers, The Iliad and lets just say I personally like Wolfgang Peterson's version better. In the epic poem the gods were more involved and the Trojan War is more of a game for them. The Greek Gods could have had more involvement but the focus on the movie was more on the characters and humans themselves. Certain characters die in the movie a lot better than the way they die in the poem. Ajax is the prime example. Ajax is one of my favorite characters in Greek Mythology and Homer did not give him justice. The warrior went down the way he should have, in battle, not him committing suicide over a dead pig, pr something like that. Peterson does stay true to the original story with some details that a true fan could enjoy but the two are mostly very different. <br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy Troy. The battle scenes were very entertaining, most characters fit well and were acted out appropriately, but I can't get over how much I hate Achilles. He literally almost ruined the movie for me. He mopes around and complains and acts like he is the greatest thing in the world. Even if he is and he is supposed to act like that, I hate him. I guess Peterson did his job in making me hate him. Another thing I enjoyed was that I bought the Directors Cut in Blu Ray. I always say, there is no such thing as too long of a movie and in the Directors Cut there are scenes that deserved to be cut out, but I loved seeing them. I liked seeing more interactions between characters and more development of characters, except for Achilles, and the extra battle scenes were disturbing but brilliant. James Horner does another fantastic job with the score. Nothing is more epic than hearing the magic of music in this movie. Music makes the movie, I say it all the time and once again, the music was amazing in this film. With the poor quality of the main character, a few plot holes, and a few nitpicks I have given Troy the WillyT Honorable Mention because I hate Achilles too much and the acting was weak at points, but still a great movie."

Although it could have used a bit more detail regarding what happened after Achilles died and the reason why and how the idea of the Trojan horse was created. Yes I know that's stupid to people whom already know the full Trojan history, but some of us still don't know what happened in the Trojan war. And I also did not really like some of the accuracy of the movie. In history Achilles drags hectors body around troy a couple of times and then dragged it to camp. he did not just drag it to camp Immediately. he wanted to do the ultimate insult to hector. Desecrate his body."

","I don't really need a movie based on the book to be 100% accurate even if this is such an epic book like The Iliad. There is no need for it, it doesn't take away from the greatness of the book itself just because somebody too the general story and made it to a movie the way he likes it.<br/><br/>It does irk me a little bit to see many historical inaccuracies from that time on a big screen. But I think this won't be a problem for many since not everyone will realize that neither architecture, not clothing or war fit the time. I will still take off a few points for that because it bothered me.<br/><br/>I wish Patroculus was Achilles' lover and not cousin, just as it is regarded in many books. It would add so much to the movie and make his coming to Troy for revenge so much more passionate.<br/><br/>I also didn't like Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom as Helen and Paris. I do think that they are both great actors and fitted their parts with their looks, but there was no real chemistry there. No way in hell will I believe that this was the reason the war with Troy happened.<br/><br/>At the same time I loved other casting. Brad Pitt is perfect for the role of Achilles. He does give one the feeling of being half human half god. Erc Bana is amazing as Hector, he gives the character a lot of depth and always shines when on screen. And there are a lot of other actors worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Another thing I wish there was more of is Gods. No need to bring them in as the actual reason of the war, but it would have been nice if they have played an important role in lives of these people like it really was at that time. It would also add a lot of ancient feeling to this movie Would also be nice to cut it a bit shorter. Since they were not accurately following The Iliad, there is no need for almost 3 hours.<br/><br/>The show is full of beautiful scenery, like the sun going down over the ocean and the beach or all the battleships approaching Troy. And seeing toned up, Brad Pitt in his warrior skirt makes the movie even more beautiful.<br/><br/>This movie has its weaknesses, but it is still worth watching for the entertainment value as long as you are not looking for a historically accurate perfect adaptation of the original story."

There's more time for character development and the battles are much more intense. It's definitely the version to watch.)<br/><br/>Troy plays fast and loose with history and Greek Mythology, but it ends up being a pretty entertaining movie, as a result. And really, isn't that the point? <br/><br/>Yes, Brad Pitt as Achilles and Orlando Bloom as Paris are direct and blatant ploys to get butts in theater seats, but they're certainly not bad. The hodgepodge of accents can be a distraction, but the cast is likable (Sean Bean as Odysseus was a favorite of mine) and there are equal parts drama and epic battles to keep a wide audience satisfied. Lots of blood, noble, lusty heroes, beautiful women, and a pretty spectacular take on the ultimate fall of Troy. <br/><br/>This movie doesn't quite reach the heights of the best movies in the genre, but it mostly achieves what it sets out to do: put a fresh take on one of the oldest and most famous stories of war."
"Eternality","8","0","0","18 February 2011"," Petersen takes a simple Homer poem, and constructs a film that is likely to sweep most viewers away, albeit with not as much passion as the Greeks.
","Historical action epics were the craze of the town in the early 2000s. Started by Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning Gladiator, many other directors followed suit to cash in on the trend. Most of them are failures (King Arthur, Alexander), while some suffer mixed results (Kingdom Of Heaven), but Troy surprisingly gives a good account of itself. Led by Wolfgang Petersen (of Das Boot fame), Troy is a solid motion picture that highly entertains. Apart from the visual spectacle, and the exciting battle sequences, it boasts a good-looking cast. Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom provide abundant male testosterone, but I suspect men weren't so vain at that time.<br/><br/>It's an expensive film, with lots of special effects integrated into live action shots. It sometimes feels 'computerized', but the effects are not badly done. It's a bit long, running at over 160 minutes, and gets a little sluggish at times as a result of the sketchy screenplay. Some may debate over the historical accuracy of Troy; I may suggest they go rent a documentary. Forget about accuracy, films (especially from Hollywood) don't really give a damn.

","Troy was aiming to deliver an ""epic"" war movie and it basically succeeded. Epic in scope, grand in vision, full of appropriate CGI to give the impression of vastness...in all these things it did a good job. Not a great job mind you, but a good job. Enough to give it a solid 7/10. I agree with many of the critics that did not feel emotionally involved - at times you felt like you were being ""read"" a good story rather than experiencing one. My ""enjoyment"" rating was a solid 7/10 for much of the movie and I thought it would end up there but there were a number of scenes that had my stomach in a knot. My rule of thumb is that any movie that can get my stomach in a knot or have me on the edge of my seat more than once, assuming that it doesn't screw up in any significant way in other areas, must receive more than a 7/10 on the enjoyment scale. Hence the 8. Let's call it a soft 8.<br/><br/>One last comment, Brad Pitt, whom I think is an excellent actor, was both a hit and a miss in his role. I am convinced based on his portrayal of Achilles that he is not suited for the ""old English"" style of speech. He never fully inhabited his dialog, it wasn't convincing. I wished he'd have employed the Mel Gibson method of Shakespearean acting (circa Hamlet 1990) and delivered his lines with his own natural inflection, it would have come across far more believable."

","I think this movie is a good way to get a rater comprehensive image of pre-classical Greek culture, for those who have never read the iliad or been in touch with the ancient Greek civilization. The battles look spectacular, the setting is quite detailed and the cast is OK. For those who have actually enjoyed (or struggled their way through) Homer, some parts might be disappointing. The characters are rather flat and sometimes completely different from the original (Agamemnon and to some extent Hector). The romance between Achilles and Briseïs is overdone and it looks like somebody was desperately seeking a love-story in the iliad, couldn't find one (though the love of Andromache for Hektor was an opportunity somewhat maltreated)) and invented Achilles' love for Briseïs. The ending of the film is an actually violation of Homer's story (Agamemnon killed in Troy??) and poorly represents the 'the bad ones get what they deserve'-motive. Ah well, maybe I expected too much...Anyhow, nice try, and I hope this movie will encourage people to read the Iliad!"

Though Briseis gets treated a bit better as a result, so maybe not such a bad thing.<br/><br/>Oh, the much-ballyhooed Pitt torso had its moments, for sure.

I know Achilles is supposed to be arrogant, but I'd say that when Pitt dug down deep to portray the character's hubris that he drew from the wrong well -- the one that is filled with the superciliousness that comes with being the hunk Brad Pitt rather than from being the nearly invincible Achilles. In other words, I think he acted like the same hot shot we've seen him be in other films and in interviews.

","Ancient Greece was a very tidy place, or at least that's what the makers of Troy would have us believe. In the scenes following battles, Brad Pitt and his band of Greek soldiers look as pretty and well-kept as any shampoo commercial extras. They're chiseled bodies are clean-shaven, scar-free, and completely devoid of any of the dirt, blood, or other debris that would usually occupy a person after a battle. Not very realistic, don't ya think?<br/><br/>That's what I thought too. There's no way that, following a bloody battle where heads, arms, legs, and other appendages get lopped off in the most grotesque ways, soldiers could come off the battlefield as clean as this. In fact, out of all the characters in Troy, only evil generals Agamemnon and Menelaus, played by Brian Cox (X-men 2, L.I.E.) and Brendan Gleeson (Braveheart, 28 Days Later, Gangs of New York) look as hairy and dirty as one would imagine their characters would. <br/><br/>Troy, ineptly directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Air Force One, In the Line of Fire, The Perfect Storm), comes off as a film that doesn't know quite what it wants to be. Does it want to have the quiet personal notes mixed in with the one-on-one carnage of the much-superior Gladiator, or is it striving for the grand CG battles of Lord of the Rings? This dichotomy of aspirations causes it to fall short on both accounts. In its pursuit of being the ultimate battle-carnage-swords-and-sandals epic, the audience is left with nothing but comparisons to better films. This is not to say Troy doesn't have its moments of awe mixed in with the mediocrity. The sets are great, the costumes are appropriately realistic, and several of the CG shots look amazing, albeit strangely out of focus in some instances. Also, the performances of Cox, Gleeson, Eric Bana as Hector, and Sean Bean as Odysseus are so good that I wish the entire film had been about them. The scenes where they're on screen have such a gravity to them that their characters almost pull us away from the been-there-done-that feel of the rest of the movie. I think this could be because none of them are in the same realm, publicity-wise, as Brad Pitt. Their characters are made more believable by the fact that we don't know as much about their personal lives as we do Pitt's. In fact, I would have to say the casting of Brad Pitt is one of the biggest problems with this film.<br/><br/>Now, before I commence trashing his performance in Troy, let me say that I generally regard him as one of my favorite actors; when he picks the right roles, that is. In Fight Club, Ocean's Eleven, Se7en, 12 Monkeys, and others, he shows he's not just a pretty face, and that he has some definite acting chops. The problem is that he's so visible a superstar that we don't buy him in the least as Achilles. I understand that being the son of a goddess would probably make Achilles a pretty attractive dude, but he is still a warrior. He would still have battle scars, still get dirty, and (gasp!), his hair wouldn't always look like he just walked out of a Pantene commercial. Pitt's performance isn't bad per-se, just average. His fight scenes are nifty, if a little over-choreographed, and his hairless body shows off every muscle to perfection (not to mention his ass, which we get to see a few times too many). Pitt's line delivery is a little shaky, though. His lines are generally delivered with a growl that makes him sound about as menacing as my grandmother with laryngitis. Of course, I can't pin all the blame for his performance on him, since he isn't really given all that much to work with. The script, written by David Benioff (The 25th Hour), is at best summer movie cheese and at worst, a blatant rip-off of Gladiator ('Are you not entertained?' has now been changed to, 'Is there no one else?'), with none of the latter's originality or transcendent philosophizing. <br/><br/>Another major problem with this film is in an area one generally only notices when it's obviously good or obviously bad, the score. Star Wars, Schindler's List, Gladiator, and Lord of the Rings are prime examples of how an epic movie can be made even more epic in scope by having powerful music behind it. Even Titanic had a score so powerful that I'll cop to humming it for days afterward. Unfortunately, Troy has a musical score that is only memorable for being trite, lazy, redundant, and just plain bad. Noticeably bad. Resoundingly bad. Listening to Troy is like playing a cinema version of name that tune; one can immediately pick out melodic lines ripped directly from Braveheart, Gladiator, Stargate, and Enemy at the Gates. James Horner, apart from composing Troy, is generally one of the more dependable composers scoring for films today, even composing scores for Titanic, Braveheart, and Enemy at the Gates, and winning a few Oscars in the process. This is part of the problem with his compositions in Troy. His previous works are so recognizable that it's obvious when he's ripping himself off. An interesting point to mention is that Horner wasn't Peterson's first choice for Troy. Composer Gabriel Yared (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Cold Mountain, and the upcoming Shall we dance?) had composed and recorded a complete soundtrack for Troy, but Peterson, at the last moment, decided to reject it as being too old-fashioned and commissioned Horner to write a brand new score. I find that interesting, considering the entire point of Troy is to be an old-fashioned swords-and-sandals epic. I hope sometime they release Yared's original work so comparisons can be made between the two. <br/><br/>Altogether, I don't think Troy is an awful movie. It's not even a particularly bad one. For a summer distraction, there are much worse ways to spend three hours. The problem I had was that it was just average, not spectacular in any way. Given the cast and budget, Troy could have been great and to have it turn out to be so mediocre is a real disappointment. With all of the budget crunches going on right now at both the state and federal levels of government, I can't help but think that the $200 million spent on making this film could have been much more wisely spent."

If you've read the book, I think it may still be a great movie to see, at least in the context of a parody on a great piece of literature.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure why the gods were left out. It seems to me that one of Achilles most powerful decisions, choosing a path that he knows will lead to his own death but with glory (ordained by the gods) over a path that will lead him home to a happy long life without glory, only had certainty with the presence of the gods. Without the gods, and without that conscious decision, Achilles loses his own divinity, and much of the force of the story is lost. The gods were the spirit of that time, they commented on humanities foibles, and were the parody of us, and without them the story remains empty."

The role should have gone to someone like Russell Crowe or Arnold in his prime.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast does a wonderful job. Peter O'Toole does a great job with Priam."

","First of all, I will have problems commenting on the accuracy of the story. I already knew it had been much altered. However I did have vague memories and was able to guess what would be coming (Paris and the arrows...) I do however regret that the Gods were omitted. The film crew stated it would have been ridiculous. Hum, excuse me, but the armies are themselves a bit ridiculous are they not? As far as special effects and battle scene go, ""Troy"" is more spectacular than ""Lord of the Rings"". There are some visually beautiful scenes, especially the ones with fire in the second part of the movie which I found to be overall better than the first. Now to the cast... I do think Orlando Bloom is gorgeous, but he is quite pathetic in his range of expressions as an actor. I frown to mean the hour is grave, I stop frowning, I frown to mean I'm worried... I was laughing and so was half the audience... Brad Pitt is a little, well, inflated, with his big bulging biceps. He and his cousin Patroclus look like Venice Beach surfers awash on a foreign shore! The actresses I found to be good, as well as Eric Bana, credible as Hector, Sean Bean as Ulysses/Odysseus and Peter O'Toole, especially in his last scene. To put it briefly, ""Troy"" is a visually great show, the sets are breathtaking. However the film totally lacks subtlety, humor and emotion."

","Troy is a good movie, the cast does a great job, and the only cheesy line is Achilles' ""Immortality, take it, it's yours!"". But anyone who has read the Illiad, the Odyssey and some history should be disappointed. _SPOILERS_ The movie works well, although it seems a bit hastened, Bana makes a great Hector, Bloom is better playing the weakling Paris than he was in LOTR & Pirates, O'Toole is the best as Priam, and the ladies do well, especially Saffron Burrows as Andromache. Sean Bean was the perfect choice to play the ingenious Odysseus. The weaponry was accordingly fit for the Bronze Age. What was great was how Achilles never bled, and the wound that killed him was the one in the heel, but of course he never saw Troy fell.<br/><br/>Take Menelaus, for example, in the original story he is the only one who gets back safely to his kingdom, with Helen by his side; here they kill him early in the war. The pace of the war is frantic, it seems that it only took 1 month for everything to unfold, when it really took 10 years. Many people were left out, like Priam's daughters Cassandra and Polyxena & his sons Deiphobus and Helenus; Achilles' sons Phyrrus & Neoptolemus; great leaders like Nestor and Diomede were reduced to furniture. Then there are the ""cousins"": Patroclus was Achilles' best friend and a good warrior, not his sissy squire; Briseis wasn't royalty, just a farmer's daughter. Ajax commits suicide after Achilles is treacherously killed by Paris, who later is killed by an arrow too. Also Achilles famous armor, made by Vulcan, is reduced to nothing as they decide to showcase Pitt's biceps, anyways Bana was much buffer.<br/><br/>In the end is an overall good movie, it just should not be taken as a faithful account of Homer's Trojan War epic. 7 out of 10"

The relationship between Achilles and Briseis was a bit more sympathetic than in the original - heck, Achilles was in general more sympathetic than he probably ought to have been, but who can hate Brad Pitt?<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment was that they winnowed the royal family of Troy down to Hector, Andromache, Paris, and Priam. Hecuba and Polyxena were my favorite characters-not-appearing-in-this-film, and I was sad not to see them. Also, Helenus, Troilus, Cassandra, Ilione, Polymnestor Creusa, Aeneas, Laodice, Laocoon, etc., etc., etc., failed to show up. But the writer and director do a good job making a full story of it without the richness that the full royal family of Troy gave to the original.<br/><br/>There were also more than a few instances where the story departs from the original epic (see above re: Briseis). Also there's no way they can make the sequel ""Clytemnestra"" off this ending.

Secondly several fascinating characters are left underdeveloped esp: Odysseus and Menelaus. In addition many of the big battles just seemed a confusing blur. Finally some people would dislike the fact that the 'good and 'bad' sides are not clearly defined I didn't mind.<br/><br/>The Good: Don't believe all the pessimism about the quality of acting. I distinctly dislike Orlando Bloom but found his depiction of Paris spot on, a sniveling coward I desired to kick whilst Brad Pitt I equally loathed in the role of Achilles as the selfish arrogant mercenary with the massive ego.<br/><br/>However the actors who shone through for me where Hector, Odysseus and Agamemnon<br/><br/>Hector: was the sympathetic hero doomed to die and even though a tinge of Australian accent could be heard from time to time Bana's portrayal of the character was perfect, showing the loyalty,integrity and fatalism that endeared him to the audience.<br/><br/>Odysseus: was excellently portrayed by a very convincing Sean Bean, a voice of reason, and wily operator. I thought his voice overs at the start and end added a strong sense of antiquity to the film and reminded me so much of Boromir in LOTR when he held the ring.<br/><br/>Agamemnon: As a tyrant, was quite funny and made me laugh with the only few moments of sarcastic humour in a largely serious film.<br/><br/>Overrall despite its flaws in terms of directing and music Troy was a thoroughly enjoyable film, bring on the Odyssessy (with Sean Bean please.)"

","I don't blame the script. A few bad lines here and there, but it's a good work by Benioff. Nevertheless, Wolfgang Petersen's direction is just average. He has neither a unique visual style nor remarkable storytelling abilities, like Ridley Scott, for example. Scott is a genius. His films have a tendency to look coldly calculated, because of his almost ""too beautiful"" cinematography, heavily influenced by Scott's experiences in the world of commercials. But here lies the secret of the success of a film like ""Gladiator"". Scott's perfection, also expressed in brilliant editing, and careful direction of his actors, is the basis for the involvement of the audience. He creates a believable atmosphere, almost a world of its own. In comparison, ""Troy"" looks very often like it was made for TV. There isn't any emotional punch. By the way, Diane Kruger is a bad actress!! She looks awesome, but that's it. I'm German and therefore, I saw the dubbed version. Kruger dubbed herself, and it was horrible."

","Troy, 2004's biggest blockbuster (well, so far, anyway) is a swords and sandals epic based on Homer's The Illiad.  The Greek hero Achilles (Brad Pitt) is centre stage in story of the Trojan War, one of the largest ever fought.<br/><br/>Paris (Orlando Bloom), the second son of Priam (Peter O'Toole), King of Troy, has a certain way with the ladies (due to a previous encounter with Aphrodite), and falls in love with Helen, the wife of Menelaus, King of Sparta, a Greek city-state.  After stealing his newfound love back to Troy, the Greek armies all rally under King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who has been looking for an excuse to sack Troy for some time.  Achilles, who is the greatest fighter in the Greek empire, grudgingly follows Agamemnon, to fight for the Greek people, and to ensure his name lives on throughout the Ages.<br/><br/>The film runs for just over 160 minutes, and it's a good thing it does; It<br/><br/>took somewhere between 40 minutes and an hour to get over the cheesy acting and close-ups that are thrown at us.  From the opening dialogue (which seems to be a continuation of Maximus' ""echoes through eternity"" speech from Gladiator), we are given our first hint that this is no character driven drama - it's a swords and sandals Blockbuster!  When a character is upset, we will be advised as much courtesy of an extreme close-up involving a hammed-up grimace, so don't worry, you can leave your brain at the door.<br/><br/>Of course, this is not entirely a bad thing.  The ladies will certainly have something to keep them entertained - Brad Pitt has been working out even more than usual, and even Legolas' wiry frame has been beefed up to us with a lovely six pack.  The action is very well choreographed, and any computer-generated imagery is handled brilliantly, blending in with the action seamlessly.  The plot doesn't lag for more than a second, and did I mention. the swords and sandals?<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by the darkness of the film as well.  We see that the war could have been prevented on many occasions, but for greed and pride, and our hero's flaws are made public knowledge.  Achilles' himself is an egotistical hothead, who seems to almost enjoy exercising his power to kill people that cross him, while Paris is a cloudy headed romantic fool. Eric Bana turns in a great performance as the films good guy, Prince Hector, hero of the Trojan Army, and it was great to see fellow Aussie Rose Byrne (as always) playing Briseis (though I can't say I remember her from the adaptations I read as a child?), who holds her own in (and out of) the sack with Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>It was great to see all the Greek heroes on screen, including my old favorite Odysseus (Sean Bean), and though war didn't seem to last the 10 years it should have (it was more like a few weeks at most), this film makes for quite an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>7/10"

"noirlover","7","0","0","15 May 2004"," Nowhere near as good as Gladiator! Brad Pitt is no Russell Crowe!
","I can't help but compare this to 'Gladiator' and find 'Troy' sadly wanting. 'Gladiator' was one of my favorite films of recent years and I thought Russell Crowe was magnificent as Maximus. (Sure the film had some issues, but the good far outweighs the bad for me). You absolutely believed him as a soldier and general and a man of the ancient world. <br/><br/>The same cannot be said of 'Troy.' Brad Pitt as Achilles is the big Achilles heel of the film. (Sorry, couldn't resist). He doesn't have the necessary heft as an actor and seems to expect his newly muscled physique to be enough. It isn't. He's fine when he's in combat scenes, but whenever he opens his mouth, his ""now you hear it, now you don't"" British accent is embarrassing. Especially alongside real British actors, like the always excellent Sean Bean. (Thank goodness Bean gets to provide the opening and closing narration as Odysseus. Can't get enough of his marvelous voice!)<br/><br/>Apart from Brad's woeful acting is the presentation of the character of Achilles as a very unheroic hero. He's basically a glory-seeking jerk, all about individual acclaim and definitely not a team player, kind of the Kobe Bryant of the Greeks. He doesn't care about country or king (true, his king is corrupt), but compared to the noble and far superior character of Hector, we instinctively root for Hector. Eric Bana as Hector is the real hero of this film and whenever he's on screen, the movie actually works. Eric, all is forgiven for ""The Hulk!""<br/><br/>To paraphrase a Gladiator quote (as this film does freely in its familiar dialogue), Achilles has the strength, but Hector has the honor. At one point, one of Achilles' men tells him, ""To serve you has been the greatest honor of my life,"" but we never see why. Sure he's a great warrior, but he's disrespectful of all authority and frankly a self-centered brat. All he cares about his himself and his cousin. Hector is the true leader here, making the hard choices and taking the brunt of the fallout from Paris' rash decision to take Helen to Troy.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is mostly good. Orlando Bloom plays Paris as an experienced ladies' man but inexperienced and frankly bad warrior, which worked for me. Some of his dialogue is naive and laughable, but I think people were laughing at the character, not the actor. <br/><br/>The only other actor I had a problem with was the girl who plays Briseis. She was extremely annoying and her whole love storyline with Brad Pitt was completely uninvolving and only slowed down the film. <br/><br/>And I'm not an expert on the Iliad, but I do know that Agamemnon meets with a different end than in this film. Read the play 'Elektra!'<br/><br/>Overall, I give the film a 7/10. Worth seeing, if you can tolerate Brad Pitt for nearly three hours. By the end of the film, I was actually cheering for him to be taken down, I hated him and his character that much. And did they ever explain why Achilles is invincible? If they did, I missed it. I think they should have explained it for the majority of people who are unfamiliar with The Iliad."

Two, don't listen to all the crap coming from a lot of people on this site. All they are really here for is to brag about how they saw the movie before its official release and to butcher it, no matter whether it was really good or not. You know how it is these days, if a person says that the movie is good, they sound like an airhead with no opinion who just stares at Hollywood stars and drools all day. However, if a person complains and complains and tears the movie apart (just like the wolf with the three little pigs), then all of a sudden this person thinks that he or she appears cultivated and knowledgeable. What a laugh! Pleeeeeease! If you complain about a movie, at least do it right.... Stick to what you really know and most of all, be respectful (a foreign concept to some it would seem. Just see all the stupid posts with racist comments on the 'Brokeback Mountain' message board. Yes, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal will play gay cowboys in this movie. So what! Get over it!) <br/><br/>1) Yes, Troy is not a perfect version of the real story, but then again they NEVER said it would be. So just sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is.<br/><br/>2) The actors all did quite a good job portraying whom they were supposed to portray. Sure, they were not really Oscar deliveries but they weren't all bad either. Come on, Brad WAS convincing as a killer bent on being remembered for eternity, Bana WAS convincing as the noble Hector and Orlando Bloom WAS convincing in his portrayal of a naive, vain and coward Paris. Oh and for all those people who said that they thought they were seeing Legolas, I would say that you need to get a new pair of glasses....or redo that laser surgery you had done last year. Legolas has blond hair, he's an elf, his wisdom is limitless and he embodies gracefulness while being a most cunning warrior. Paris was NOTHING like him. Actually, he was pretty much the complete opposite, which was what Orlando was supposed to portray. So stop bitching about this actor. I truly think that most of you would have done a much worse portrayal than he did. Or are you all just jealous of his fame, fortune and good looks? How sad!<br/><br/>Finally, for those of you who said that ALL the people in the movie theater were laughing at ALL of Orlando's lines, wouldn't you say that you are ALL exaggerating a TINY LITTLE BIT? Do you really think it makes you sound more interesting to say ALL instead of A FEW IDIOTS?<br/><br/>Funny, I have seen the movie a few times already and no one laughed in my theater, which was full, by the way.

","Regardless of the close to 200 million dollar production the movie falls short of expectations, at least mine. The acting was above par - superb in the case of the unsurpassable Peter O'toole -, and there is no doubting how outstandingly beautiful Diane Kruger really is (able to launch a thousand ships any day). However, certain choices regarding the screenplay, particularly the omission of the Gods as well as some rather unfortunate changes to Homer's masterpiece has seriously hampered this potentially epic film. The element of a true Greek tragedy is not present, which shifts the focus of the original story from tragic fate and its effects to a rather common love story. The battle scenes are not memorable and although it lacks any particularly damaging production error, Troy did not fulfill the potential that special effects and gigantic productions have generated for the filming of historical classics."

It was a pity to see Saffron Burrows in several scenes doing nothing but sniveling as it's not often she's featured in a decent movie. The dialog is a bit corny at times, for example there's a scene where Achilles says something to the effect of ""It's too early in the day to kill princes"". Well, yes. I don't know how Brad had the nerve to say that! At other times, the script seems a little clichéd, predictable and self-important, rather reminiscent of TV comedy spots where the mickey is being taken out of a Russell Crowe Gladiator look-alike. The violence was also rather tame.

The screenplay was awkward and at times indecipherable, the acting, if it can be called acting, was beyond disappointing, considering the actors who's bodies, if not minds, appeared on screen. The direction at best mimicked other films, including ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Gladiator"". At it's worst it left me praying for a quick ending, something this film definitely did not deliver. What it did give was a few impressive fight scenes involving Pitt's Achilles, and a greater appreciation for every other ""Toga"" epic ever made. There are a few massive battle scenes, however no flexing of special effect muscle can make up for such an inept screenplay and such lackluster direction.

Unfortunately I have to say the later. I felt right the way through the film that it was trying to be a 'Gladiator' and this I didn't feel it lived up to.  The film in summary is a good visual aid to the book, or a mindless epic for those wanting a night out<br/><br/>I however recognised that this film was hyped up, it had made a name for itself before release, and as with all films with that much publicity it is never going to be the the image you have in your mind.but in saying that it wasn't far off.<br/><br/>The casting however was superb!

","I have just returned from seeing ""Troy"" and thoroughly enjoyed the film. While anyone familiar with the story knows how it all ends, I found this film a great way to spend a hot summer afternoon. It is one of those huge epic films Cecil B. Demille used to make. This movie has just the right blend of humor, romance and tragedy.  While there is a great deal of violence and some nudity, none of it is overly graphic.  Peter O'Toole was absolutely marvelous as King Priam. Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana provide enough eye-candy for the most fickle female viewer. The battle scenes are quite believable as is the sack of Troy.  If you enjoyed ""Gladiator"", you'll also enjoy ""Troy""."

","Just got out of the theatre. Basically, it's a pretty good movie, and so long as you consciously forget(or just don't know) about what happened in all the originals, you'll like it. I'll avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say that it was a VERY loose adaptation of the original story. Just like some other movies I've seen, it would have been pretty good had it just been a ripoff instead of claiming to be the original, that way there's far less disappointment about how badly they botched most of the details(and a couple of major plot points, too). Casting was excellent(all of the characters did a good job, and whoever played Helen is right up on my hot-women list right about where Helen of Troy should be), the fights were sweet, and all the other stuff worked too, but the story was simply too far removed from the original for me to be happy."

","Half of the screenplay and acting was sketchy and just plain bad. People were laughing during the movie when the Greeks were talking about the ""Trojans"" as everyone was thinking about the condom brand. They made Orlando Bloom look like a complete wimp by making him back out of the fight with Helens husband and it almost ruined the movie, but in the end Brad saves it. I became a big fan of Bloom after The Lord of The Rings and I thought the way they played him out in Troy was disgusting. What they should have done instead was have Helot, not being able to watch his brother die, come to rescue Paris(Bloom) and kill Helens Husband. That would have been alot better than Bloom cowering back to his brother and hanging on to his leg. It might have taken a little credit away from Helot but its worth making Paris not look so pathetic.<br/><br/>Anyway, all of these bad elements about the movie may make it sound like crap but in the end, they dont add up to being THAT much of a difference as Brad pretty much takes it away himself.(no pun intended, but I LOVE that scene!) I think what really tops it off in this movie, is that crappy Trojan Horse. I mean did you see that stupid thing? I was expecting it to be really cool. It should have been alot bigger and look like something you might actually want to bring into your city as a gift after a war. That thing looked like an old toy horsey five year olds play on. And thats suppost to be what condoms named after! Pfft.<br/><br/>the star of this movie would definetly be Achilles(Brad Pitt) he is narrated by Odysseus (Sean Bean, Fellowship of The Ring) Ide give Brad a 10 out of 10 performance. I loved his work in this movie. His romance with that priestess/slave girl was boiling, and his fight scenes were phenomenal. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes really good fight scenes and EVERYONE who likes Brad pitt. But if your looking for good acting on both sides of the conflict, your not going to find it."

","For over six months we happened to fill our movie-conversation with a little bit of the ""Troy project"".We discussed a lot about the possibility and the probability of Hollywood creating something that would not be the ""Helen of Troy""(2003). Something decent, at least a little bit closer to the spirit of Homer's saga.We watched -kind of terrified(!)- the preparation and as time got closer to the first screeners, we prayed to God that this time we wouldn't have to endure a disgrace of our legacy. But what we heard was not really encouraging... Still we watched the movie to have an opinion of our own and the result was far better than expected:""Inspired"" by Iliad - and not ""based"" on it, the film did not in any way ""insult"" Iliad or the heroes.The differences are plenty but- in the end- we cannot expect a lengthy epic poem, written about 2.600 years ago to become a contemporary movie without being altered at all. SPOILERS:I must admit that some things in the movie could strike to a person who knows about Trojan war a little too much: Watching Menelaus dying, for example, or watching Brisseus killing Agamemnon (who was supposed to be killed by his wife and he took part in other stories told in ancient tragedies) was somewhat shocking. Also Paris staying alive and fleeing with Fair Helen was too much ""dynasty"" or ""the bold and the beautiful"".Still, I could accept that. The performances were decent.Sean Bean impersonated the clever and cunning Odysseus in an amazing way.Peter O'Toole was pretty shakespearean. Brian Cox was good in being the -far too evil- Agamemnon and Menelaus was decent, as was Byrne too.Eric Bana was really ""royal"" but his performance was somewhat ""wooden"", while Brad Pitt did the best he could (which was possibly not enough) to impersonate his extremely difficult character.Kruger was not convincing as the daughter of Zeus and the Queen of Sparta or as the divine woman everybody desired.Bloom was in short almost unacceptable. I would like Troy to be Iliad but it isn't and I don't think it could ever be.But -as a cinematic creation- it was grand.The scenery, the costumes, the battle scenes, the special fx, all were at least admirable.The character's analysis was decent and-considering the lack of gods- the plot was at least not insulting for Homer.6/10 for good intentions and a semi-decent result."

Tried to ripoff Gladiator style but it was entirely mediocre and irritating. - The dialog was horrible. So was the acting, which might be because the dialog was so bad (Sean Bean, Peter O'Toole and Eric Bana were good, though). Either way, whenever anyone else was talking, it was really boring. - The characterization sucked. The only character I somewhat cared about was Hector. It makes it hard to watch a movie when you don't give a s**t what happens to anyone in it. - I find it really f***ing hard to believe that entire armies will stop fighting to watch a 1 on 1 fight. - The camera work in fight scenes sucked. It was super zoomed in and bobbly, so I couldn't even tell what was happening. - No emotion anywhere in this film. Except I did feel anger at one point, but that was partially because the theater was so hot and the movie was so long. - Uh, everything else. - Oh i almost forgot, Brad Pitt was 95% naked in every scene that wasn't a fight scene.<br/><br/>All in all, I rate Troy above Master and Commander. However it's f***ing far (that's far X 10) below Gladiator and Braveheart. In fact, I take that back. It's an insult to those two great films to be compared to Troy."

","I was pleasantly surprised with the movie, ""Troy.""  I will say there was an excess of bloody fighting but it was very well done. Brad Pitt did a very good job, as did the other main characters. The history depicted in the movie was very informative to a person who has little or no knowledge of the history of the era.  As an epic I would rate it top- notch. My husband & I were both impressed;  we are well into the mid   & late 70's and we both liked the movie.  The costumes & scenery were topnotch.

","It falls victim to all the usual flaws with hollywood epics. The soundtrack is too intrusive, the mix of accents can be offputting, the liberties taken with the source material grate. Some of the dialogue is incredibly naff, and some of the long deep gazes into space to portray a sense of gravitas are crude.<br/><br/>But for all that the story is just so strong that it carries the movie. There are some truly exceptional scenes that rival any epic from ben hur to the passion of christ. it also has far more fascinating characters and events than anything in Gladiator, to which i guess everyone will compare it. For the record this is the better movie. The relationship between king agememnon (brilliantly played by Bryan Cox) and Achilles is 100% convincing and equally as captivating to watch. Equally, the tactical manouvers and mistakes made by each army are gripping and exciting. Helen of troy succesfully carries the weight of burden of her actions but orlando bloom is utterly out of his depth in a role that needed a much defter touch (and why the hell, when his star is in ascendance would he take a role opposite Brad pitt? madness).<br/><br/>Of course, it is achilles that is the main draw, and for me i cant think of a role more suited to Brad Pitt nor an actor more suited to the role. And he chews it up and spits it out with relish. he is a magnet on the screen. Graceful, pensive and heart pounding. Unfortunately the camera loves him a little bit too much and sometimes lingers on him for what seems like farcical amounts of time. Almost like a brylcreem advert or something.<br/><br/>technically there are flourishes of absolute genius alongside utter hamfistedness. Getting pretty bored of mass swordfights these days, and troys battles are nothing we havent seen before. The one on one fights however are shockingly brutal and fantastically well shot. Again, far outsstripping anything seen in gladiator. Unfortunately, the emotional peak of the movie has been placed right on top of a reel change, which seems incredulous and stupid, as it breaks the flow of the action terribly. Other technical probs include some dreadful ADR (for which, strangely, brad pitt always seems to be a victim. one wonders if he has real trouble saying his lines), some tacky cliched string arrangements on the soundtrack and some very hokey dialogue. Fortunately, theres also some tremendous dialogue, some wonderfully subtle music (the drums on the hector/achilles fight) and some really well handled build ups to the more dramatic moments.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the movie fascinating. it never lulled for its 3 hour length, and the story is utterly absorbing. There are occasional embarrassing faux sentiments and some cliched dialogue and hammy delivery, but isnt that the case with every Hollywood epic? This one is better than most.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I just saw the German language version of TROY and I enjoyed it! As everyone should know the story for this picture is taken from Homer's ""Ilias"". But beware if you think that you can spare yourself some history studies. Maybe it can help understand and/or imagine how times must have been but you should mainly just enjoy watching some very fine actors in superb sets.<br/><br/>Minor spoilers inside!!<br/><br/>King Agamemnon tries to unite the different peoples of Greece but he is simply after becoming the greatest power. He is using Achilles as his biggest weapon because of his fighting skills, although Achilles has his own mind and actually distastes Agamemnon's lust for power. But nevertheless Achilles is just not the good guy as we meet him as an adolescent and arrogant young man. In the meantime King Menelaus of Sparta hosts festivities for the princes Hector and Paris of Troy to celebrate a new alliance between Sparta and Troy. But Paris the younger brother and the beautiful Helena and wife to Menelaus fall in love with each other. When Paris discloses to his brother that he took Helena with them on their voyage home to Troy, he immediately knows that this calls for retaliation from the Spartans. King Menelaus asks his brother Agamemnon to help him attack the people of Troy to kill Paris and Helena to get even. Agamemnon agrees but dreams of defeating the whole of Troy...<br/><br/>Even though most of the story is known, it is very interesting to watch how the different actors bring life to each character and the visualization of the epic sets. The wide shots of the city of Troy from within and without are truly breathtaking and so much better than the Rome shots from Gladiator. Just as good are the shots of the hundreds (or thousands - how much of it is CG? Thank god that I could not see what was and what was not) of Trojans and Greeks fighting. I also have to praise the fight choreography of the one-on-one battles.<br/><br/>It is the dialogue that here and there comes around too artificial and leaves me unsatisfied. And I have to add that I didn't like the way Achilles is portrayed but that is more about the script and less about Brad Pitt. For me it is just unbelievable that one person can be so arrogant, lusting for fame and driven by testosterone while in other moments he is so much wiser, emotional, caring and more honorable than his peers. Another thing was awkward: Pitt is not dubbed by the voice that normally dubs him but the dubbing voice of Nic Cage which doesn't quite fit here. That and the bad CG of the Greek fleet were hard to watch but I nevertheless had a good time at the theater and let me tell you that I liked Troy so much better than van Helsing!!!"
"nick-m","Null","0","0","13 May 2004"," A surprisingly well-balanced movie about the atrocity of war
","With ""Troy`, German director Wolfgang Petersen is entering Hollywood' s Olympus. After delivering American oriented action stuff like `Air Force One', Peterson shows convincingly that he is still able to make ambitious movies. The fall of legendary Troy is a well known classical tale, which Peterson modified for dramatic sake. His intention was not to stay true to Homer, but to defoliate an epic of intricate political complexity. He neither shows the ancient Gods in persona, nor does he present Achilles as invulnerable. He rather shows different groups of interest, fighting to follow their goals. It all starts with the abduction of Helen. Paris, Prince of Troy, falls in love with the wife of Menelaos, king of Sparta, who doesn't hesitate to leave her belligerent husband. This triggers a chain of events, not even the most considerate heads of both parties can stop. On the one hand there is Hector, Paris' brother, who is trying to tame the waves of excitement, on the other there is Odysseus, who is seeing through Agamemnons' motives of using his brother Menelaos' disgrace for his own plans of conquest. Achilles on the other hand is following his own agenda. Yet, intrigues, chance and wrong decisions soon lead to disaster. A good ensemble is adding to the depth of the movie. Above all, Eric Bana as Hector and Peter O'Toole as King of Troy provide an impressive performance, while Brad Pitt seems as inaccessible as the role of the outsider demands. Even though Petersen takes some historical liberties in telling the story of Troy, the film itself works out fine and catches the audience's attention for nearly three hours while giving them food for thought.<br/><br/>I would give it an 8 out of 10"

","Troy <br/><br/>History has another take on the lives of Helen of Troy and Paris. According to history, Queen Helen of Sparta was indeed the worlds most beautiful woman. Back then, royals believed they were impregnated by gods. Helens father was Zeus. This parentage made sex with her very desirable to Greek kings. <br/><br/>In Troy we are first introduced to the brilliant warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt), the most fearless and invincible warrior of the time,in battle. Achilles is so legendary a warrior that he is brooding, self-centered, and at odds with King Agamemnon (Brain Cox). <br/><br/>The plot is well known: Paris, Prince of Troy (Bloom) on the eve of a peace treaty with rival Greek King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), spirits away Menelaus wife Helen (Diane Kruger), setting off a Greek-Trojan war. Menelaus joins forces with his powerful brother/king Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who raises an army to assault and conquer the high walls of Troy a feat reputed to be impossible. One of the Greek kings pressed into service for the attack is Odysseus (whose trials returning from this war are chronicled in Homers The Odyssey) and Odysseus in turn convinces the famed warrior Achilles (Pitt) to seek fame in the battle. On the Trojan side stands Paris, his brother Hector (Bana), and their father/king Priam (OToole) and the battle for Troy rages for the bulk of the film. The story is told on an epic scale. Reports of a ballooning budget plagued this movies production. After watching it, I can tell you that it was time well spent. A combination of enormous sets, a cast of thousands, and the magic of computer-generated imagery bring this story to life to such a degree that it appears as if it was filmed in an ancient Greek city rather than on modern sets. The sheer look of this movie is entertainment enough. Only one element is missing from this modern retelling, and that is the Gods themselves. While in the original tale, and in the Classic Comic version for that matter, the Gods played active roles in the battle, here they are worshiped, but never make an appearance. It gives the story a more realistic tone, but I do wish the filmmakers had found a way to work them into the movie. If there is one weakness to the film, it is the somewhat melodramatic dialogue. But this is a Greek tragedy and it fits the mood of the story. <br/><br/>The cast is superb, with Pitt and Bana getting the best roles. Bloom, in a bit of bravery as an actor, plays a moment of cowardice as Paris, which had several members of the audience actually booing him. A buffed up Pitt gets the sexier role as Achilles, but it is Bana as Hector who is the real hero of the piece. And of course, Peter OToole brings a bit of old time movie acting class to the modern production. <br/><br/>History or Mythology teachers looking for a way to get their students into Greek mythology have a new tool to make learning exciting and action fans have a new film to add to their must-see summer movie list.

"Goatrider","6","0","0","13 May 2004"," My short opinion
","I went to the cinema's with the expectation Troy would at least as good as Gladiator, as some Dutch newspapers said. On the outside this film looks better, but when you pierce through the looks, you have to recognize that the film fails dramaticly to compete with an instant classic like Gladiator.<br/><br/>Let me start with the positive things. Troy is truly a cinema-movie: the battles (there are lots of them, since this movie is only about the war @ Troy), 1on1 fights and actions sequences are great. The settings are marvelous too. The costumes, locations and effects really let you be a part of the action. The actors are really fighting themselves and some scenes really take your breath away. Extra thumbs for the message of the film: there are no winners in war and some things are inevitable (excuse me for my bad English; had some drinks :P).<br/><br/>Now the points where the director fails: no really interesting dialogue, absence of emotion, and a missed change to intwine a romantic love story with old school epic action.<br/><br/>Even the top-actors in the film couldn't prevent the emotional scenes from being dull. The director showed us he can film great action sequences (Das Boot, Perfect Storm), but he doesn't know what to do with the dialogues at all. The romantic scenes between Achilles and his Troyan girlfriend could have formed a nice second storyline, but instead they look roughly cut in the rest of the film. The lines said between the action scenes make you scratch your head and awake deja-vu feelings from The Matrix Revolutions: great action interrupted by inapprehensible philosophical sentences. But where you can unravel some deeper meenings out of the lines of that film, Troy only cites them superficially. Another thing: Orlando Bloom again proves he has no acting talent at all. In fact, the whole audience laughed at him when he was making his 'I'm so sad and lonely and I'm so surprised cuz a monkey jumped into my boot' face. FOR THE TENTH TIME. The model who plays Helena doesn't seem to have any emotion at all. I've seen Brad Pitt play much more exciting roles, but maybe he's trying to show the desperate proudness of Achilles. Then again, the real GOOD actors like Bean, Bana and Brian Cox do a fine job bringing to live Odysseus the Robert the Bruce of Troy, Hector the hero and Agamemnon the bad guy.<br/><br/>So the movie lacks emotional weight and certainly DOESN'T allow you to feel banded with a character (like we sympathized with Maximus' fight against the cruel emperor). It isn't as bad as the instant action carnival of Van Helsing. Instead, it brings decent entertainment to the big screen, and it is a nice beginning of a night out. That probably will be the future for other legends and myths (Hannibal, Alexander, King Arthur)..."

","Hmm, after a while I sort of expected Golem to appear. But then, good actors are had to find, so you use the decent ones you've discovered over and over. Its been a while since I read the Iliad, but most of the movie  seemed to be more or less faithful to Homer's plot (except, maybe, the ending). I'd particularly like to complement the set designers, those were damn functional yurts on the beach, and I don't recall seeing that many ships assembled before, even in WW II D-Day photos. Also, I liked the way that Petersen developed the viewer's appreciation of how the weaknesses and strengths of the major characters changed over the course of the movie.  At the beginning I pigeonholed Achilles as a bloodthirsty status seeking dork. By the end I realized he was a noble bloodthirsty status seeking dork with a conscience. Helen of Troy's character, though pretty, didn't really ring my chimes at all. very 2- dimensional she was. But, all in all, the whole shebang was worth the price of a ticket."

This film reminded me of a Carry-On film (sadly lacking the lavatorial humour, which may or may not have improved it) but acted with less enthusiasm.  The acting was really very poor, particularly from all the 'young guns' - Sean Bean is the only thespian able to hold his head up after this.  I particularly enjoyed Brian Cox pretending to be Brian Blessed. My main problem was with the dialogue, I can't imagine how hard it must be to act believably when the lines are so bad.  On the positive side I will say it looked good and the Brad/Orlando dream-team certainly have the faces/physiques to launch a thousand screaming teenagers.  I found it mostly watchable and a part of something that pretends to be my brain enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons (such as Brad Pitt jumping around in a short skirt) but I will never, ever need to see it again.

The war story is excellent: lots of characters very well acted, with real complexities and a real sense of tragedy and fate.  The Paris-Helen story is jejune and selfish and hardly seems to fit. No more does the weepy wife of Hector, or the inane counsellors of Troy. Priam (O'Toole) is a very Lear, though without Lear's felicitous madness. Achilles is cynical, flawed, a bad boy, complex.  The casting of Brad Pitt should be brilliant - Achilles is a swaggering rebel - except someone made him do it impassively, thoughtfully, and in a very sketchy English accent. What happened?!<br/><br/>The fight scenes are multifarious and excellent.  Each is suspenseful and interesting.  CGI troops/ships are used in setup panoramas, but I didn't notice CGI in the actual action.  Achilles has minor superhuman abilities, but they're not excessive or used constantly.<br/><br/>Mythology and many great parts of the Iliad are completely excised.  This is the story of men at war, with women thrown in mostly for color.  Did a woman start this war?  You'd never think it.  The gods - well, who knows if they're even there?

When the enraged Spartan King finds out, he unleashes the largest war the world has ever seen to get Helen back.  Achilies (Pitt) is sent in to command the troops and to defeat the other Prince of Troy, Hector (Bana).<br/><br/>Action-  The action in ""Troy"" is top notch.  Swords clanging, arrows wizzing, people screaming, blood gushing.  Your local action nut will go for this film like a fly to a lightbulb.  The special effects are great and the eventful fall of Troy is beauty to withhold.  <br/><br/>Eyecandy...I mean, actors-  Bloom is convincing yet neutral as Paris and does a good performance when he is sent to fight against a Spartan.   Hector played by Eric Bana, does his best performance to date.  Lastly, Pitt is tough and feiry as the legendary warrior Achilies.  His fight with Hector is very exciting and no stunt doubles were used in the fight.  Good job to both of you! Guys, feeling left out?  Don't worry.  Diane Kruger is stunning as Helen.<br/><br/>Dialogue- Paris gets a hillarious, possibly unintensionally funny line that had me scratching my head.  When he and Helen are debating what they are going to do when the Spartans come to get her.  She suggests they run away and he gets into a long thing about how he can ""hunt rabbit and deer and live off the river"".  The audience was laughing and not sure what to make of this little line.  <br/><br/>Overall- A great way to kick off the summer movie season.  The action is great and all of the performances are good.  Despite some lack of pace in places and some odd lines, Troy is worth your money.<br/><br/>Grade-  B"
"immortal74205","Null","0","0","12 May 2004"," The Epic of all Epics
","One of my favorite films of all-time is Gladiator.  This film was better than that.  With an all-star lineup, 'Troy' tells the epic story of Homer's Iliad.  Achilles (Pitt) is the rebel warrior of Greece who reluctantly agrees to fight with Greek King Agamemnon (Cox) against the city of Troy. Peter O'Toole plays the King of Troy, while Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean) and Eric Bana (Hulk) play his two sons, Paris and Hector, princes of Troy.  When Paris willfully kidnaps Helen of Sparta (Krueger) and brings her to Troy, it prompts Agamemnon to go to war with Troy in order to get her back, although the Greek King desires to destroy the city, caring little about the safe return of his brother's wife.  The acting is great, as is the fight scenes, including the one-on-one fight scene between Hector and Achilles.  The film is definitely worth a full price ticket, and is actually filled with more elements of dry humor than I would have expected."
"jamesr87","3","4","12","1 May 2006"," Less than Adequate.
","** Minor Spoilers if you haven't read the literature **<br/><br/>I have set about reading a fair majority of reviews on this movie and have a few things to say.<br/><br/>For one, so far as i'm concerned, this movie is not based on the Iliad. This is based on a Greek war on Troy, something with historic basis and uses the Iliad's characters.<br/><br/>I by no means qualify myself as a History buff, with only 2 years of classics under my belt, but the story is so far off, it is almost impossible to recognise. Some pretty key people die, who just shouldn't have, in fact ... most of the villains who die shouldn't have, and that is just too much to stomach.<br/><br/>Now, Brad Pitt. I could not have thought of a better person for the role, physically Brad Pitt looks utterly perfect, but I was simply not impressed by the quality of his acting in this piece. It can pretty much be summed up by his ""emotions"" during the scene when he is informed of Patroclus' demise. It is so poor it physically makes me cringe to just watch it.<br/><br/>The one, and probably only, saving grace of this movie is Eric Bana. He does the part of Hector flawlessly, looks the part and emotes correctly, unlike his Greek counterpart. Bana is nicely paired with Orlando Bloom which creates the correct contrast between the two very different characters.<br/><br/>I am particularly shocked by the complete lack of Honor shown by so many people in this movie, for a movie supposedly based on Epic Literature where honour is paramount, I was shocked to see Agammemnon, Hector and several others completely ignore it. I was baffled ... they certainly were not Homeric heroes.<br/><br/>For those who say that the various 'edits' of Homer's masterpiece were necessary for the conversion to the silver screen I have to ask, where were the Gods? What could be more spectacular and Hollywood than a group of swanky Gods, certainly the complete absence of them (and in turn they do not even mention the literary reason for the war) pushes this yet further away from the literature it is supposedly based on.<br/><br/>To finish, on a film note, I actually do not like the Zoom shots used in this movie. They felt very ""Blaire Witch Project"" and did not really fit with the flow of the movie - The fights always seemed to end up on completely stable shots. This effect can be beneficial - ergo Serenity - but here it just is not used correctly.<br/><br/>3/10. Sorry, I am willing to accept this as a movie and ignore the literature, but even then its just not that good."
"The_Man_In_White","4","4","12","9 February 2006"," Not only an unfaithful adaptation but an insult. Fans beware!
","I'm aware that not many people will take the time to read Homeric poetry or the Greek plays at their leisure, but what saddens me about the movie TROY is that it is the primary impression that many people will have of the Trojan War legend.<br/><br/>Artistic license is expected, and when done well it is welcome. But the cliché drivel this movie buttresses its storyline and dialog on are insulting, to Greek literature *as well as* to its audience.<br/><br/>To begin, the 10 year war between the Spartans and the Trojans is reduced to a 16-day skirmish, with 12 non-fighting days of funeral rites. You can hardly call what happens in this movie a ""war."" <br/><br/>Don't expect too much reverence to the original story. The writing in any case is awful. When Helen mouths the anachronistic retort, ""Don't play with me,"" you wonder if Paris will respond with, ""Don't be a playah hate-ah."" Subsequent dialog contains lame one-liners and grade-school history lessons, and the story comes across as visual Cliff Notes...painfully inaccurate Cliff Notes.<br/><br/>The cast is awful. You'll be treated to misplaced British accents (and mangled ones at that, via Brad Pitt) and formulaic historical-epic dramatics, delivering all the charm of ""SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE trying to be SPARTICUS. Brad Pitt as Achilles and Orlando Bloom as Paris seem to be able to manage two different facial expressions each. Their performances were embarrassing to watch; they seem to be reading their unconvincing, mechanical,self-consciously historic dialog from cue cards. ONE REDEEMING MEMBER of this otherwise ill-talented lot IS ERIC BANA, who delivers a commendable performance as Hector. He is as I'd imagined reading ""The Iliad."" Thank god for him, as the rest of the cast seem to have graduated from the William Shatner School of Semantics.<br/><br/>Another pro to this movie's many cons is the historically correct fighting sequences. The writers must have been paying more attention to the History Channel in this regard to the detriment of other writing concerns, such as plausible character development and an explanation (or apology) for Pitt's mullet.<br/><br/>Watch this with caution if you are at all a fan of Greek antiquity or Classical mythology. If you are a civilian to either, I regret the fact that this will be your first impression of this story. What you have is an attempt to combine an alpha-male spectacle of violence with a TITANICesque romantic love tragedy to make the bodice-ripper, Ivory/Merchant fans swoon with wistful delight.<br/><br/>And sadly, it comes off as majestic as an episode of XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS."

"zorro4466","3","3","8","13 October 2005"," Irritating summer Film
","I wonder where the positive remarks come on this one, it really isn't very good. At least the technically the movie is fantastic, because that's it.<br/><br/>The acting is uneven, Orlando Bloom does well enough and so does Eric Bana. But Agamemnon manages to be painfully poorly acted. He possesses one facial expression throughout the whole film. It's painfully noticeable, and the way it remains EXACTLY THE SAME for every shot has inscribed it in my memory. Brad Pitt also can't act here, which seems odd, considering how well he can act(Fight Club).<br/><br/>Of course, the bad acting does little to help the story along. Troy is an Epic poem, it is not easy to put into a movie. It can be done, but if it isn't great it won't work at all. As you might expect, it doesn't quite work. Archilles comes off as a stupid jerk, the length of the war is shortened to fit in the movie, and most of the characters possess motivation that is very hard to accept. The worst aspect of all of this, however, is that Greek Gods are shortchanged. The best part of any Greek story was the Gods, seeing as they were all-powerful and unpredictable creatures.<br/><br/>To the give the story some credit, certain things are well written. Of course, the people who made the script are proud of their story and seem desperate to get you to notice the parts they like. A great example of this is how one of the first themes of the story is the idea of being remembered as a Hero. Sounds like a point any High-School student could make, and it doesn't help when it's made countless times throughout the film.<br/><br/>The end result is a film that annoys more than it entertains. After a few hours of Archilles' feminine features and arrogant actions, a few hours ham-fisted plot points, and a few hours of watching a story get terribly revised, you'll be cheering when Legolas finally offs the protagonist. But even after the movie is over, you will never, ever forget the one facial expression Agamemnon has. Can his face even move? Who knows?"
"scrapple","1","3","8","8 March 2005"," Ridiculously Bad
","I do not write many reviews, but this movie was so ridiculously bad I felt the need to vent a little. First, the movie was about ancient Greece and made by Hollywood. Why then is everyone speaking with a British accent and calling people ""my lord"" or ""milord""? I guess the producer or director thought it would add a sense of grandness or something. I thought it was annoying and laughable at the same time. Second, the movie was excessively long. There were many 10-minute blocks of the movie that could have been cut out completely with no ill effect on the plot. It qualifies as an epic if the term epic only has a length requirement. Third, the dialogue was so cliché it made me laugh aloud on several occasions. For heaven's sake, it was like watching a show about the all-time greatest lines from TV mini-series. This movie was just a flat out dud and bore. Some fight scenes were interesting to watch, but there was no chemistry between any of the couples and the acting was very stiff. At a minimum, it is not worth the time investment."

","Now, as a child I read all about Greek Mythology; I do not remember the people of Greece having English accents or American ones for that matter! Granted this is a Hollywood production and the characters are not going to speak Greek and use Subtitles, that would be to complicated for the target audience, which is boys from 15 to 25 who have little intelligence and a macho man complex ( or a Napolean one). Which brings me to another point, the whole thing with Akillies ""cousin,"" some one made a huge typo, it's his freaking lover!! Everyone knows that!! The scenes bored me accept for the ones with Hector, he stole the show. Great performing! Eric Bana is a brilliant actor and was pretty right on as Hector. Now, Brad Pitt you are no William Wallace!

So what on earth happened?<br/><br/>Having missed the film on its short run, I have just watched the DVD. It was a hell of an effort. <br/><br/>The dialogue was hysterical, the music was painful, the actors were wooden or unbelievably hammy and the story, having survived for 3000 years, had been turned into a TV soap opera.<br/><br/>Afterwards I switched on the computer to read IMDb reviewer's comments. I came across a couple of critiques nominating this film as ""the Best Film of 2004"". Surely the writers were being tongue-in-cheek because if Troy really is their idea of a great film, I feel sorry for them - they are far too easily pleased.<br/><br/>This was one of the biggest wastes of talent I have ever seen 0/10"
"blackoutfilms","1","3","8","16 June 2004"," Absolutely Woeful
","This was worth the price of admission just to see how bad it really is. <br/><br/>To prove just how poorly researched this film was, Agamemnon's brother, Menelaus was constantly referred to as MeneLOUSE. As anyone who has studied Greek literature would know, it's pronounced MEN-A-LAY-US. If they can't get the pronunciations correct (and a basic internet search will get you that), what makes you think the rest of the film will be well thought out.<br/><br/>The dialogue was appalling. Some lines may have been taken from The Iliad but dialogue in a story does not translate well into dialogue on screen.<br/><br/>And the accents, my God! As an Australian, I am proud of our exported actors but never has the phrase ""Paris don't"" been uttered in a broader Australian accent than it was by Rose Byrne at the films end. And since when was Achilles' cousin an American??<br/><br/>I heard many bad reviews before I saw Troy but didn't take any notice of them because I love mythology and love epics but little could have prepared me for this shocking film. The dialogue is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad and the score is bad. By the end of the film, the cinema I was in was scattered with the sounds of sniggers and restrained laughter.<br/><br/>During the fight between Menelaus and Paris, I was convinced it was filmed by a kid on set who must have been on work experience. It was that shambolic.<br/><br/>Was it entertaining? Of course it was, but only because I was stunned at just how bad it was. As an example of bad cinema is gets 10. As a memorable film, it gets 1."

","A fairly good movie. Beautiful sets and an excellent casting. It was as if some of the actors were made for their parts for example Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole. The one actor that I was not convinced by was Eric Bana. There was something missing in his portrayal of Hector.<br/><br/>The movie offered sword fights which affected me more than most in past movies. I loved seeing the huge Greek fleet.<br/><br/>The story was approached by a realistic angle by Wolfgang Petersen but sometimes looses itself in romance.

"RandolfCarter","1","3","8","15 May 2004"," What's a four letter word for overrated crap? Troy
","The season is disappointment has begun with hollywood regurgitating its 'blockbusters' for the next few months. First off is Troy. This film is incredibly overrated and deserves every bad word that has been written about it. The acting is remarkably pungnet, even the great Peter O'Toole is unable to redeem himself in this picture where the bulk of the 'acting' is supplied by Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt (who's names are synonmous with the term overrated actor). The characterization in the film is even worse, never once de we really care about what a character is going through, never once do we sympathize, even scarcer are times where we understand their motivations. The Battle sequences are poorly done as well. Whenever the camera zooms in we lose all track of who we're seeing, if they're important, and even more ridiculously, we can't tell who is being hacked to death even. The long shots are decent, but proof that CGI has made moviemakers lazy. The poorest battle scene in film history is here, in the midst of a battle, all the soldiers stop suddenly because Achilies' dumbass cousin got himself killed. How are these thousands of soldiers supposed to stop to watch 2 idiots go at it? And to stop in the middle of a battle? I know this is a fantasy film but come on. The dialogue is ridiculously poor, considering one of the greatest literary works of human history (The Illiad) is its source. The ending is poor as well, I have a hard time understanding why Paris seems so unconcerned that his adored cousin is sleeping with the man who killed his brother and defiled his corpse. Maybe all those ass shots of Pitt got to him. Bloom, did get one reaction out of me. After backing out of a challenge he asks himself 'Am I a coward?' Yes, you are. You are also the most overrated actor since Tom Cruise. Still, maybe I shouldn't have been surprised at how poor this movie actually is. This film is 'directed' by Wolfgang Peterson, the man who gave us the abomination of patriotic stupidity that was Air Force One. For people who want to watch quality epics, there are far better films out there than this piece of crap."

Peterson claimed that the Greek Gods were silly and unnecessary to the plot. 2. Greeks are portrayed as Vikinngs. Greek kings were not bikers. 3. The town of Sparta was never near sea. It was near a river. 4. Agamemnon never died during the siege of Troy. He died a lot later, in his country, by his son, for killing his wife [his son's mother]. 5.

"thotchkin","1","3","8","11 May 2004"," Worse Than Bad
","I have seen a lot of bad movies in my time: Batman & Robin, Mulholland Drive, Caddyshack 2, Cave Dwellers.  I'm not sure where Troy fits among them, but I am certain that it deserves a place there.  I saw a free screening of it last night and at $0 it was a rip-off.  The movie starts with the word ""Troy"" in a chiseled font on top of a map of ancient Greece. From that point, the movie starts getting bad.  It makes quick work of bad and goes within minutes to worse.  Once it finds itself at worse, it decides it's not bad enough so it finds a pile of manure sitting in stagnant swamp water and rolls around in it for two hours and forty-five minutes.  Realizing that the movie is bad and stinky, director Wolfgang Peterson determines that having gigantic, obviously computer-generated battles every twenty minutes is the only way to save it.  And of course, what's a gigantic, obviously computer-generated battle scene without some ethereal, Enya-esque music in the background to make the audience know that they're supposed to feel Super-Extra Sad about all the death and stuff?<br/><br/>This movie contains good actors.  Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole, and Brad Pitt do as good as they can.  Sadly, when the script is written by what I can only assume was a mentally-challenged teenager who skimmed the Cliff Notes of Homer's Iliad, there's not much you can do. ""Duh, hmmm,"" this poorly-educated child must have thought upon completing his masterpiece, ""I done put Helen of Troy, da Trojan Horse, and Achilles' Heel in dis film, so it am ready to go.""  The poor quality of the script is only accentuated by Peterson's decision to pace the movie so it goes over the 2 1/2 hour mark (one of the sure ways to know it's an epic film).  One such poorly paced and produced moments has Paris (Bloom) about to fight for Helen (Diane Kruger) against her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson).  Low, somber music plays in the background as Paris approaches Menelaus.  Cut to Helen watching from above and switch the music to a high, whiny pitch. Cut to Menelaus looking menacingly at Paris and return to the low, somber music. Cut to Priam (O'Toole)sitting next to Helen and looking like he hasn't blinked in 10 years; accentuate 'intense stare' with a resumption of the high, whiny music.  This back and forth continues for a few more cuts which gives the viewer plenty of time to realize just how little they have been made to care about any of these poorly developed characters.<br/><br/>Sadly, I'm not one to leave movies in the middle, so I stayed for the whole thing.  At one point, I considered plucking my eyes out and shoving them in my ears so I wouldn't have to see or hear any more. Unfortunately, that wouldn't have done anything about the bad taste this film had already deposited in my mouth.  As I said, I have seen a lot of bad movies.  For the most part, those movies weren't trying to be something they weren't.  Troy never wavers from the notion that it is an Epic and Important Movie for long enough to realize that it's a Trite and Pointless Piece of Flotsam.  In fact, after writing this, I think Troy may be worse than even Batman and Robin, because I can look back on that and laugh.  But there's nothing funny about having almost three hours of your life painfully stolen from you.<br/><br/>I hope you have enjoyed this ranting diatribe.  If it serves the purpose of keeping you and anyone you care about away from this movie, I will sleep well tonight."

"kurupt_minds","1","4","13","25 December 2004"," Jesus Christ (Homer shakes his head)
","I am a huge fan of ancient Greek (and other) mythologies, so when I saw the 3 hour debacle they called Troy, I thought, holy s*** what a waste of more than $200 million.<br/><br/>The story is fundamentally flawed with Petersons removal of the Olympians. The Olympians are used mainly as a contrast to the going ons of the war. The removal of them undermines Homer's and therefore the movie's portrayal of the 'human spirit'. And not only that, the the inclusion of the Olympians would have added almost another dimension to the film, with some moments being almost comedic. <br/><br/>Another major pothole was the killing of the major characters and the destruction of the plot. The thing that shocked me the most was the slaying of Menelaus. Menelaus had been the epitome of mercy and forgiveness in the Illiad. The destruction of that character is the equivalent of poking out Jesus's eyes at birth and cutting off his legs. Another death that was misplaced and generally messed up was the death of Ajax. In the legend, Ajax was not killed in battle but killed himself at the funeral games for Achilles. In fact Ajax nearly succeeded in killing Hector on more than one occasion, so I think Hector killing both Ajax and Menelaus within 10 minutes of each other is grossly misleading. Besides the (untimely)death of Menelaus, the other shocker in the movie was how Briseis kills Agamemnon. If Wolfgang had written the story those thousands of years ago, then Clytemnestra, Aegisthus, Orestes and Electra would have been nobodies.<br/><br/>The plot is also hugely flawed with cultural cross references and utter chaos in general in the story. Firstly, in the beginning scene in Thessaly, the armies of 'Unified Greeks' did not march en-masse as shown but in divisions. Secondly the hierarchy in the movie shows that the 'former' kings were like slaves to Agamemnon, contrastingly in mythology (and in reality I might add)they were still kings who governed their own lands and were held together by a 'commision', so to speak, with Agamemnon at their head, hence the King of Kings. Thirdly, the armor and weaponry of the time were standardized throughout the Aegean and the Mediterranean, so the differences in armor and weapon design among the Greeks and the Trojans is not particularly correct. Fourthly, the Spartan culture at the time was Spartan! They didn't have fine clothes or luscious feasts for themselves and even for guests. The dancers at the end of the feast would have also had to be naked to portray the true culture of the Spartans and to understand their opinions on beauty (but this would have been difficult as the rating would have to be higher, in other countries and wouldn't reach it's target audiences). Yet another mistake was Andromache leaving with Paris, Helen, Briseis and Aeneas. Of the five just mentioned, only Aeneas escapes Troy while Paris is killed in the fighting before; Andromache becomes a slave of Achilles son,; Briseis is not mentioned at the end of the Illiad and it is assumed she remains a slave in Achilles household and Helen is returned to Menelaus.<br/><br/>The most disturbing things about the movie are as follows: - Aeneas, Troy's second greatest warrior does NOT fight -Paris never used a sword (except for his duel), his bow is used as a symbol of his cowardice throughout the poem -Wolfgang's use of style for Orlando Blooms portrayal of Paris' archery uncannily resembles Legolas of LotR -While in other movies such as LotR the music blends in with the story, in Troy the music is blatant and stands out too much -The 'love story' between Achilles and Briseis never occurred. She was merely his slave who Agamemnon took because of his pride (long story and at this point I don't think you want to hear it) -The argument doesn't start until the 9TH YEAR -Some may say that the war is supposed to last 10 years, but with this s***ty story would you sit through it? -Patroclus was Achilles childhood friend, not his cousin and lastly . . . -WAY TOO MANY SHOTS OF BRAD PITT'S A**."

","""I've fought many wars in my time. Some I've fought for land, some for power, some for glory. I suppose fighting for love makes more sense than all the rest.""<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Well, I'm on the fence with this one. Despite some egregious liberties taken with the classic poem, 'Troy' is still inspired by one of the greatest stories ever told. I suppose I can forgive the inconsistencies with Homer's ""The Illiad"" and try my best to focus on the film version which comes with a production cost of $200 million. As with all of these obscenely priced blockbuster movies, one expects and demands lavish sets, seamless special effects and extraordinary action sequences. In addition, one hopes to have a quality cast delivering passable dialogue. In the case of Wolfgang Peterson's 'Troy', he succeeds in some regards and fails in others, leaving me torn between a mild recommendation and a marginal failing grade. I hope by the end of this review I will be able to make up my mind.<br/><br/>Almost everyone is familiar with the story. Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) is stolen away from her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) by Paris of Troy.<br/><br/>In an act of desperate revenge, Menelaus seeks the help of his brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who controls the armies of Greece. Together, they launch a thousand ships across the Aegean Sea to attack the impenetrable city of Troy in hopes of recapturing Helen and exacting revenge on those who betrayed them. Their chief warrior is Achilles (Brad Pitt), a god-like man who wins wars by himself if need be. In their final attempt at destroying Troy, they create a gift to the Gods in the form of a gigantic wooden horse.<br/><br/>The Trojan people bring it inside the gates of Troy unaware of its deadly contents.<br/><br/>There are some other twists, turns and plot threads along the way in this 165 minute epic. Hector (Eric Bana), brother to Paris, is the leader of the Trojan army and is the father of a newborn infant boy. Briseis (Rose Byrne) is cousin to the Trojan brothers and is captured by the Greeks. In this adaptation, she is protected from the soldiers by Achilles and they fall in love on the eve of war. Odysseus (Sean Bean) is the messenger between Achilles and Agamemnon, who do not get along at all. He is also the one who devises the Trojan horse plan.<br/><br/>Where to start? The ancient story is beyond criticism. I love the idea that the greatest war ever fought was for the love of one woman... the most beautiful woman who ever lived. I have no complaints with the premise of the film.<br/><br/>The fight sequences are also laudable. This is especially true of the one on one battles. I really liked the way the camera flowed around the fights, never confusing us with lightening quick edits and extreme close-ups. I really felt like I was fully aware of the action at all times. The full army sequences were typically grand to behold and quite spectacular, even though this CGI army routine is getting rather tired. Every film that comes out seems to want to top the previous one in terms of scale. The armies in this film even seem to dwarf those seen in the Lord of the Rings flicks.<br/><br/>However, despite the great story and the incredible action, this film fails in far too many areas to be considered a triumphant success. Although I appreciated the efforts of Eric Bana, Rose Byrne, Sean Bean and Brendan Gleeson, there are a few actors in this film that are truly awful. Most notably among them is Orlando Bloom, who is shockingly embarrassing as Paris. Every belabored twitch that Bloom tries to pass off as acting is cringe inducing. He imbues his character with the depth of a wading pool. It is one of the worst performances in years. I was also thoroughly disappointed with Peter O'Toole, who does his best impression of a skeleton while overdoing virtually every facial expression. Brian Cox has been a tremendous character actor in recent years, but his portrayal of Agamemnon belongs in a Steven Seagal movie instead. Even Saffron Burrows, one of my favorite actresses, gives a weak effort as she chews the scenery with her minimal screen time as Hector's wife.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt handles a difficult task with a fine effort... although it may be in a losing cause. Much like Tom Cruise in 2003's 'The Last Samurai', he constantly struggles to overcome a very modern Southern California look while portraying a legendary warrior. I don't think Pitt gives a bad performance, but he may be too much of a pretty boy to pull this role off. Any viewer will have a hard time forgetting that it's Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Another thankless task is bestowed upon Diane Kruger. Any time that any actress is called upon to play Helen of Troy, the primary requirement is to be stunningly beautiful. And while Kruger handles that with sublime ease, it is her dialogue that lets her down. Some of the lines that she has to utter are quite pathetic. In fact, most of the cast has to deal with unintentionally funny lines of dialogue. However, Diane Kruger is undoubtedly a move star. She has the perfect face and a flawless body to match. Add a little acting talent and a drive to make it in the business and she will be around for quite a while. Just ask Keira Knightley, who became the new Hollywood it girl with a similar resumé.<br/><br/>The great acting in this film comes from a select few. Sean Bean and Brendan Gleeson have small but notable roles that are played with supreme confidence. However, the two stand-outs are Eric Bana and Rose Byrne. Bana is magnificent as Hector, leader of the Trojan army. He exudes a presence on screen that dwarfed Bloom's and outshone Pitt's significantly. At no point while watching him on screen did I feel like he was out of place... he belongs in a film like this. Rose Byrne is my pick as the best thing to come out of this film. This Australian beauty reminds me of Monica Bellucci. Her minor role as Briseis may have been the most intriguing of the entire film. Her burgeoning relationship with Achilles was the one aspect of the movie that had me really riveted. I wanted to see that plot thread expanded upon. But in her limited screen time, Byrne was able to create a truly sympathetic character who felt more three-dimensional than the rest of the cast put together. I predict and hope that Rose Byrne will be a rising star in Hollywood over the next few years.<br/><br/>Two final little issues I must raise have to do with the set design and the score. I found the sets to be amazingly unrealistic given the budget of the film. Many of the buildings seemed obviously fake. I got the distinct impression that I was looking at painted styrofoam rather than actual rock and granite. There was no real weight or realism in the sets. And as for the score, which is the most under-appreciated aspect of film-making, well... it stunk. James Horner has orchestrated many movie masterpieces, but this was his most forgettable work ever. One expects chills to go down one's spine in a film like this. 'Troy' barely has a single memorable bar of music. I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>So... Have I made up my mind whether or not to offer a mild recommendation or a marginal failing grade? I am afraid I have to turn my thumb down on this one. It just didn't do enough to merit the price of admission. I came in hoping that this was going to be the blockbuster event of the Summer movie season. Instead, I left feeling underwhelmed despite a massive spectacle and a handful of quality performances. I've teetered back and forth in the few hours since seeing the film, and I concede that I may sway the other way in subsequent viewings, but for now I have to advise against a trip to see this adaptation of the classic tale.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>TC Candler - Critical Mass Movie Reviews"
"kwongers","5","3","9","10 June 2005"," Rather disappointing  dry dialogue, some terrible casting, screws over Homer's story, visually unexciting
","People who have never read Homer's classic story may not be miffed, but as an ardent admirer of the play, I found the movie unfulfilling, unexciting, somewhat dull, and marred by inconsistencies, terrible acting, and bland dialogue. Also, the movie completely alters the nature of several death scenes (or eliminates the death scenes altogether), which will bother people who enjoy the play. The movie focuses much more on Achilles and his own troubles/relationships than it does on Helen and the war fought for her.<br/><br/>Casting Helen of Troy is pretty tricky, especially when people will have such high expectations of her beauty. Diane Kruger, while pretty, failed to meet my expectations as a woman of enough captivating beauty and personality to launch ten thousand ships. Her bland acting and monotone delivery makes her even more unattractive, and I could feel nothing between her and Paris. Orlando Bloom looks the part of Paris  young, naïve, pretty-boy  but his acting is nearly as bad as Kruger's. He is totally unconvincing in all of his scenes. Other supporting characters, like Hector (Eric Bana), King Priam (Peter O'Toole), and Odysseus (Sean Bean), are excellent in their few scenes, saving the movie from being a complete dud. Also, much commotion has been made of Brad Pitt's naked behind, and it's a very nice-looking one, but frankly, I am a bit scornful of his performance as Achilles. He certainly looks the part, but I can't believe how corny he made his lines sound! This is too bad, because Pitt is normally a pretty great actor.<br/><br/>However, the corniness of his delivery may be partially blamed on the terrible dialogue. A line like ""Immortality! Seize it, it's yours!"" is only one of the few very bad, cheesy lines in this movie, and the movie consequently plays out too soap-opera-ish and toosuperficial. There is none of the human pathos (with the exception of Peter O'Toole's scene) that is present in abundance in Homer's story. The movie is also visually unexciting. The CGI is overblown and uninteresting; it looks so artificial and grandiose that, instead of being ""epic"", it looks rushed and childish. To the movie's credit, though, there are some good fight scenes, notably the one between Achilles and Hector. It is also probably the best because real actors are employed, not computer-generated troops.<br/><br/>Worth a rental, I suppose, but don't expect too much. And probably don't watch it if you are a fan of Homer's books. 5/10."

Is this the comic book version of Homer's 'The Iliad', which could have been penned by Homer J. Simpson? OK the Iliad is not a book of historical facts. Its wonderful story of myth and legend that was worthy of at least trying to stay as true within reason in the retelling.<br/><br/>The battle for Troy was over in two weeks! If they do the history of the Second World War in the same retelling it's all over in four days.<br/><br/>I was warned not to be in a hurry to see this sand and scandal epic, just wait till it hit the TV via cable.

"italjohn","2","3","9","14 January 2005"," What a disaster...
","Aside from being totally INACCURATE, Troy serves to ""please the Hollywood masses"", that is, to appeal to a shoot'em up audience, interested in only action and adventure.<br/><br/>First of all, Paris was NOT a hero. He was a coward, and only shot Achilles with an arrow once, before fleeing. Secondly, in Homer's Iliad, Agamemnon is killed by Clytemnestra after returning to Greece. Thirdly, Patroklos is NOT Achilles' cousin, but rather, his close friend and lover. Fourth, the Greeks are supposed to be the protagonists in the Iliad, and the Trojans in the Aeneid, so which viewpoint is the movie taking? Lastly, without going into the many other mistakes that the movie made, Troy simply failed. It was decent entertainment, while I drank a beer and fell asleep. But based on literature, the film is TOTALLY inaccurate.<br/><br/>WATCH GLADIATOR INSTEAD !!!"
"Spellvexit","4","3","9","29 July 2004"," ""Inspired"" by Homer's Iliad
","I walked into the movie theater knowing that Troy was going to be a bastardized version of the Iliad, but I was unprepared for how freely they mauled the epic. Yes, the battle for Troy lasted TEN YEARS, and they didn't even show up until the last year, so the whole taking of the beach head by Achilles was an exercise in irreverent Hollywood flair. I couldn't believe how they turned Menelaos into a villain, and killed him (instead reserving that to his wife back home). Ajax bought it too, instead of going mad and killing livestock in the fields after the war.I can't remember the post-Iliad chronology, but didn't Achilles die outside of Troy's walls by a poison arrow to the heel rather than sneaking in via the Trojan horse? Nestor was lame; in the book, he was always recounting long, wistful war stories, and seemed more like a valued but annoying old folks' home tenant than a grim tactician. Besides Menelaos, however, the treatment of Briseis was absolutely ridiculous. Women, slave women, were cattle in the Homeric days. They had no voice. Though Achilles was fond of her, she could never have spoken to him like she did, nor would he have have run about the streets willy-nilly looking for her. It didn't even work on a Hollywood level; Achilles killed her brother! Why would she still be crazy in love for him?! <br/><br/>The movie didn't even work if you ignore the fact that it was ""inspired"" by the Iliad. The pacing was weird, and the initial march to Troy took RIDICULOUSLY LONG! First we see Priam looking out. Then a shot of Andromache. Looking out. Then Achilles, looking. Then Hektor, who is... looking. Then Paris, looking. They basically go through every person in Troy, looking out on the marching horde. I know it's the biggest battle of the age; how many times did they say it already? This bit of ""drama"" was followed later by the laughable fight scene with the C4-packed hay bales they rolled down to the boats. As the Trojans are near victory, Achilles' cousin (not lover, apparently... Hollywood wouldn't touch that) Patroklos dies, and like some sort of cricket match, Hektor calls it off for tea time.<br/><br/>My grievances go on and on. I thought Hektor and Odysseus were decent adaptations. Pitt looked the part, and did a good job sulking like he did in the book, but his line readings were awful, and he couldn't really decide on his accent. Sometimes it was grimly American, sometimes British. I didn't even like Menelaos' bearing... he was too unctuous and not brash enough. <br/><br/>I did like the token homages to the poor classicists in the audience. They gave a nod to Aeneas near the end, there was an aristea-like quality to the way Hektor and Achilles suited up; they mentioned (not by its name, xenia) the guest-host relationship, and Achilles had a conversation with his mom, but ... wasn't his mom a goddess? Thetis? The one who dipped him in the river styx, all but for his ankle? They never mentioned her name, leaving it open.<br/><br/>But.. why *didn't* the producers want to involve the gods?! They could have had incredible scenes of Ares himself out on the battlefield, of Aphrodite getting a spear in the arm, trying to save her son Aeneas from the nasty Achaeans. They wanted titanic battles, yet it doesn't get more titanic than the gods themselves chucking lightning bolts and clubbing mortals with weapons forged by Hephaestos.<br/><br/>I know they wanted to keep it ""human,"" and they also probably wanted to keep a cap on the huge number of characters in the work. But they sure hamstrung themselves by once again underestimating the caliber of their movie-going audience. They dumbed it down. Boy howdy, did they dumb it down."
"berlinmitte","2","3","9","17 June 2004"," Ouch! What was Petersen thinking??
","Oh my, I don't know where to begin. This movie disappointed me in so many ways. First, it looked like a 60s B-Movie from italy (these were more fun tho). Where was Troy's glory? It was one of the richest cities back then. But all that Petersen showed were the gate and some walls basically. Boring and unimaginative. Then the script, this one really hurt. It was slow, missed all the important stuff (eh, wasn't the war meant to last 10 years and not 2 days (+12 days pausing)?? Where was all the pain and frustration the greeks suffered? It all looked like a walk in the park, especially after they thought of the horse (and why, please why did they build it after just 1 (!) day of fighting? I won't go into too much detail, but Petersen changed the Illiad way too much (but maybe that's good, so we don't need to fear a Troy 2). Save your bucks at all costs. 2/10"
"darkchilde-3","1","3","9","24 May 2004"," Disappointed in the movie
","The movie should never have been named Troy. It had nothing to do with the mythos of Troy, and the Iliad. This movie is an insult to Homer and his work. Anyone seeing this movie keep in mind that this is not the Iliad. It has nothing to do with Greek mythology and the Trojan war. I will not go so far as to list the changes which is the whole book of the Iliad.<br/><br/>I am saddened by this and I will not see any other movie that will come out based on another great book, unless I get the reassurance that is something as good as the Lord of The Rings. Please, read Homer's Iliad, and understand the greatness of his work. Do not be fooled by the movie."
"Coventry","5","3","9","24 May 2004"," Gigantic epic! But, with the ability to entertain all kind of audiences for a change.
","Usually, I'm really skeptical and negative-minded about these massively hyped and overbudgetted historical epics. I have a lot more sympathy for modest and truthful portraits as they focus more on the actual events instead of the computerized decoration. Productions like these don't come much bigger than `Troy', but still it's a good movie with an enormous entertainment value and lots of professionalism. As far as the history-lessons I attended in school are fresh in my mind, Troy is rather loyal to the original poem and only a few changes and additions have been made in order to make the film more attractive to the audience. Orlando Bloom's character Paris is portrayed a lot less cowardly than he actually was and the whole love affair between him and Helen is wrongfully glorified. Other than these slick twists, the film gives a pretty good image to those who aren't familiar with the legendary tale. Letting Wolfgang Petersen direct this epic was a good choice. Petersen is very gifted director with extremely professional visions and the required skills shoot an appealing blockbuster. Brilliant cast as well, with some prominent names like Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson and Peter O'Toole. Brad Pitt is a lot less miscast as I initially feared and Eric Bana continues his triumph career. I haven't got an opinion on Orlando Bloom yet. I'll patiently await his first non-blockbuster role before judging his acting skills. The settings and scenery are amazingly impressive, the numerous battles are more than exciting and the bloodshed is fairly reasonable. All together, Troy isn't the type of film I'll immediately buy on DVD when it comes out, but at least it doesn't leave you behind unsatisfied and mixed feelings."

Director Wolfgang Petersen's epic adaptation of Homer's 'The Iliad'  showcases grand spectacle in the form of ancient Greece set at war over  Helen of Sparta (beguiling newcomer Kruger) who is taken away from her  husband Menalaus (Gleeson) by Trojan prince Paris (a callow Bloom) that  sets a bloody trek to war between the two nations with much to lose in  the process. David Benioff's solid screenplay rudders the action into  motion with some wonderful set pieces of amazing battle sequences and  one humdinger grudge match between super warrior Achilles (a buff and  excellent Pitt, all audacious arrogance masking some inner demons) and  royale Hector (Bana imbuing vulpine fortitude) expertly choreographed.

"littleging12","10","2","5","2 February 2019"," Spectacular Entertainment
","Following the breakout success of Braveheart and Gladiator, comes the larger-than-life blockbuster about the legendary Trojan War. Troy, loosely based on Homer's The Iliad, is a slam-bang blockbuster action flick. Aside from the commercial appeal, Troy is also an epic, philosophical, and realistic retelling of one of the greatest stories of all time.<br/><br/>Troy has everything a traditional movie-goer could want: thrilling action, sprawling scale, state-of-the-art special effects, A-list actors, exciting soundtrack, endearing heroes, quotable lines, romance, drama, and political intrigue. Troy fulfills enough surface level needs to sustain an action junkie for years on end. It is so entertaining that you could rewatch it again and again and not get bored. But, it is also a film with copious amounts of depth and character development.<br/><br/>Critics were quick to label Troy shallow. However, Troy digs deep into themes such as belief in the gods, passion, and duties to one's country. The director's cut goes deeper into the characters and their motivations, as well as amping up the violence. Even in the theatrical cut, a major theme is how downplayed the roles of the gods are. Troy deviates from its source material as it takes a more realistic approach. So there are no fantasy elements like Apollo shooting fireballs out of his arse. This was a very wise decision because it made Troy more realistic, gritty, and all the more entertaining. Troy looks real aesthetically, and feels real emotionally, unlike the CGI mess that was 300.<br/><br/>Some of the most underrated scenes in the film are counsel debates circulating around the gods and the Greeks, Achilles' monologue on his take on the gods, and Peter O'Toole's heartbreaking plea to Achilles for his son's body. It's smaller moments like these that give Troy the depth needed to feel the inevitable emotional gut-punch delivered by the end. For example, take the counsel debate scene. It's very interesting hearing how religious 'servants of Apollo' and someone like Hector, likely an agnostic, rationalize their thinking. Hector is portrayed as being very logical and practical, as opposed to the priests who try to plan strategies based on religious symbolism (like bird signals). It's all the more saddening when Hector dies as the city becomes doomed by illogical rationale. This all adds another layer of depth to Troy; it's philosophical, and emotional. It takes into account the role of religion and how that affects the characters. The viewer is brought into the characters' world and empathize with the actors' sympathetic portrayals.<br/><br/>If there are any flaws to pick out in Troy, they're nitpicks. In the director's cut, there are needless long takes of dogs, cheesy lines, and inappropriate music played during emotional scenes. But these are minor and forgivable, especially since the director's cut adds more character depth and violence. The acting and dialogue is not Oscar-worthy, but they are good enough. Just like in The Lord of the Rings films, there are minor cheesy or dumb things, but they are easily overlooked because everything around those small moments is awesome!<br/><br/>Troy is just as entertaining, epic, star-studded, bloody, and philosophical as Game of Thrones. Both have the same writer, and you really can't love one without loving the other. Troy hits the mark with spectacular entertainment value while also speaking to the heart and soul."

"bessy_dacow","2","2","5","15 May 2010"," biggest move let down!!
","When i heard they were making a movie about Troy i was exited. It has always been one of my favourite stories, because unlike Lord of the Rings (which is one of my favourite book) its not about fighting the bad guys to save your freedom - instead it a story about the futility of fighting a war simply for glory and neither side is purely good or bad. However when i finally saw it, i could not be more disappointed - the movie contained none of the themes of the original plot. Now don't get me wrong i am not a purist at all, taking the LOTR movies as an example, i love every change peter jackson made. Nor do i believe that there needs some sort of historical accuracy to the story considering that there is no proof that most of these characters ever existed or that such an epic battle ever took place. The fact that the battle is one of the series of events begun because the goddesses wanted to know which one was prettiest, is proof enough that this isn't history. I've read many adaptations of the illiad where new themes, stories and characters are introduced that I loved. But despite these new factors, they all keep the essence of the themes of the illiad. The movie totally failed to do that for several reasons.<br/><br/>The first one, is that there is no background to these characters. the battle is only an element of the story with many significant events taking place before and after that help you understand the characters and what drives them . for example the reason that achilles is so arrogant and why he is so needed for the war, is that he can't die. He is immortal, except for a the spot on his heel which is how Paris kills him. It also helps you understand why Helen was ""the face that launched one thousand ships"" - it wasn't that all those greeks where there because they thought this was a terrible thing for the Trojans to do, they had sworn an oath to help menelaus should anything happen to Helen many years ago. This demonstrates how stupid the war is - all those soldiers die because many years ago, their leader made a stupid promise that they never expected to have to fulfill. Many of them don't want to be there such as Oddyseus who tried to get out of it by pretending to be crazy. Moreover, at birth Paris' mother was given an omen that Paris would cause the death of the city. To make a long story short, Priam does everything in his power to make sure this doesn't happen and by doing that, insures that it comes to pass. This is a very important and recurring theme in Greek legends <br/><br/>The second is that many of the characters die in the wrong place. Achilles, the great hero never made it inside of Troy. Just as Hector who is the great leader and hero of the Trojans is killed, Achilles is pierced by an Arrow not to long after, making both side lose the two great leaders, showing once again how stupid it is to enter a war for the sake of glory when you both sides lose the people they are most proud of. <br/><br/>On top of that neither Agamemnon or Menelaus die. Though little attention is payed to them in the movie this is very important for the story. Menelaus forgives Helen and takes her back - if the Trojans had given helen back in the first place, none of this would have happened, Menelaus would happily have gone home and since the rest of the army were only there because of the oath they would have packed their bags (except for Agammenon who was a warmonger but this would have made it a relatively small army for the Trojans to defeat). Agammenon returns home to his kingdom where his wife Klytemenstra kills him, showing that 10 yrs of war for a victory that u can enjoy for a few week before you're dead is just hopeless. <br/><br/>And lastly the fact that the movie distorts the story so that it seems that the Trojans are the good guys and in the end they win because Paris is still alive and gets to stay with Helen where as most of the Greek main characters are dead also completely shatters the point of the story. Hardly anyone wins - most are dead (including Paris, only one Trojan survives which is aenas) and the greeks that survive don't get much out of it - oddyseus has another ten years ahead of him before he can get back to his wife. And helen just ends up right where she started. Changing all that is the equivalent of having Frodo drop the ring into mount doom without any problems and not departing into the west - despite everything he accomplished and that good triumphed, a part of him was forever damaged and he can't find peace on middle earth. <br/><br/>There are one or two good things about the movies. The battles are quite well filmed and the scene where Achilles kills Hector does a good job portraying the inhumanity that war sometimes brings out in soldiers and the atrocities that they commit. Hector's character is traditionally portrayed as him being one of the few purely noble and heroic characters - a fat load of good that does him. <br/><br/>So yes i though the movie was overall extremely bad. They didn't just take a lot of creative liberties, they completely failed to understand what the story was about"

But he does not make a good warrior, too pretty i am afraid.<br/><br/>Good points are is the design. This film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings/walls impressive. I do like a film that at least tries to get the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely. we hear American, Scottish English anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisation.<br/><br/>All in all, I do not recommend this film for a family sit down. It is too long and the young will get bored.<br/><br/>For adults, it is OK if you don't care about the lack realism."
"freemantle_uk","7","2","5","26 May 2009"," Gladiator Meets Lord of the Rings
","Gladiator and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy have both got a lot to answer for. Because of the success of those two movies studios rediscovered the money making power swords and sandals and fantasy epics. In the space of a few short years we saw the release of Alexander, King Arthur, Kingdom of Heaven, 300, Eragon and The Last Legion with new films about Robin Hood and the Hobbit in development. Troy itself is one of the most expensive films ever made, with a budget of $180 Million, which was a massive amount, even in 2004. It was a massive risk for Warners Brothers.<br/><br/>Troy is loosely based on the famous epic poem, The Iliad by Homer (not the Simpsons' character), and the history of the time, but it's hardly debatable on whether Troy ever existed. It focuses on the conflict between the city state of Troy and a loose alliance of Greek states led by King Agamemnon (Brian Cox). This war was stated when the Troyan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) falls in love with Helen (Diane Kruger), wife of King Menelaus' (Brendan Gleeson) of Spata. But this also gives Agamemnon an excuse to attack Troy and conquer the city. In the middle of this was conflict is the Greek hero Achilles (Brad Pitt). He is an insubordinate soldier and dislikes Agamemnon; but he longs for glory, women and to be remembered in history. He is convicted to first in the war by King Odysseus (Sean Bean), especially when he tries to recruit Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund), Achilles' cousin (lover in the poem). Troy is lead by King Priam (Peter O'Toole), a kind ruler to his people but not willing to back down from the fight, and Prince Hector (Eric Bana), a skilled fighter and commander. They seek to defence Troy the best they can, but Priam and his advisers were too reliance for help from the Gods. Hector is more realist in his opinions. As well as Achilles' rivalry with Agamemnon, he develops a rivalry with Hector. Both are their side's both fighters. Achilles ends up hating Hector after Hector kills Patroclus in battle.<br/><br/>Troy takes a more realistic view on the Trojan War. The writer, David Benioff, and director, Wolfgang Petersen, do not show the Greek Gods involved in the war. This seems to be a good move and tries to show how ancient wars would have been fought. This is strongest element of Troy, showing the director styles of conflict, the epic battles and the one of one fights with a vary of weapons. The film is violence, showing that conflict was bloody, and it had a 15 rating in the UK. Unfortunately there was no served limps like in 300 or Kill Bill which is a shame.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen seems like a safe pair of hands, directing the famous classic of German cinema Das Boot, to Hollywood action films like Air Force One and In the Line of Fire. He handles the action really well in this film. He also assembles one hell of a cast, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Brain Cox, Sean Bean, Peter O'Toole, Brendan Gleeson and Rose Byrne. But the cast is hit and miss. Brain Cox is the strongest performance as the villain of the film. Sean Bean is good and it good to see he is more then the traditional evil English bloke. Rose Byrne, Peter O'Toole and Eric Bana were also pretty. Brad Pitt, an actor I normally like, offered his weakest performance in this film. I didn't really believe in his character. Achilles is a very unlikable and unengaging character in the film. Also Orlando Bloom, shows once again that except for Lord of the Rings, that he can't act. He was just a pretty boy and is type-casted to be in fantasy, epics and a combo of the two. Garrett Hedlund was also a really poor actor. The film also ended as an action cliché.<br/><br/>A element I like in the film is that it shows a mixed picture. Only Agamemnon was a real villain of the film, and the rest of the characters had their reasons for fighting. The Trojans are more sympathetic, but the Greeks are not hateful or stupid like the English in Braveheart. Even Agamemnon had strategic reasons behind why he invaded Troy.<br/><br/>I have never read the Iliad, but it's ready on my bookshelf. But an element of the film I did not like was the war only lasted for a few weeks, where in the poem it was a 10-year conflict. The film also had too many characters and it was easy for some of them to disappear off the screen. One of my history leaturers at university also dislike the fact that Achilles was not gay, simily because Brad Pitt did not want to play the character as gay or bisexual.<br/><br/>Troy is enjoyable enough, but not a classic. 3 out of 5."
"leontion","10","2","5","18 May 2009"," A very good film with accurate production design
","In my opinion, this movie is good, and I don't understand why so many people despise it because ""it is not faithful to the Iliad"", or because it ""is not historically reliable"". First of all, decide what you want: if you want history, you need to throw the Iliad out of the window, because Homer was definitely NOT historically accurate. If you want Homer, you have to get rid of history. Now, some short reflections. Speaking of ""historical mistakes"" with reference to Troy is nonsense: the movie is inspired to a myth, and the myth is the result of fantastic amplification and transfiguration of historical events. The Trojan war was very different from its poetical (not only Homeric) representations: as historians such as Moses Finley showed, it did not last ten years, but probably was a series of short raids aiming at plunder. As a matter of fact, the post-Homeric epics describe Achilles as a thug and the Myrmidons as a band of robbers, spoiling temples and abducting daughters of priests. Besides, at the time of the Trojan war the Myceneans were considerably impoverished in comparison with the wealth of the previous centuries, and so they needed new lands to conquer and sack (as Pierre Leveque has clearly pointed out). Homer describes the Greek army as powerful and glamorous; he aims to glorify the heroes and their achievements, but after all the poet is a Ionic rationalist, and every now and then he lets us understand how brutal and ruthless these ancient warriors really were. And just as he is a Ionic rationalist, he mixes the archaic mysticism with a sort of scepticism towards the Gods and their astonishing deeds, fascinating relics of an ancestral tradition which Homer remembered well but maybe could not completely understand himself. And now, some words about the so-called 'unfaithfulness' towards the Iliad. First, the movie tells the whole story of the Trojan war and not only the subject treated by Homer (Achilles' wrath, Patroclus' death, Achilles'revenge); therefore,the screenwriter needed other sources, and he found them not only in Greek ancient poetry (post-Homeric epics, tragedy), but also in Medieval and modern literatures (Benoit de Sainte Maure's ""Roman deTroie"", Christa Wolf's ""Cassandra""). Besides, Homer was NOT faithful to the previous epic tradition (for instance, he denies Iphigeneia's sacrifice, or Achilles'stay in Skyros, two episodes which probably date back to a very ancient stage of Greek mythology) and later poets and writers were NOT faithful to Homer. They told the myth of the Trojan war in different ways and from different points of view. For instance,the authors of the Roman era (such as Virgilius, Seneca, Dracontius)show a deep sympathy for the Trojans (who were considered the ancestors of the Romans): they exalt Hector's courage and try to excuse Paris for his faults. During the Roman empire, the applauded public speaker Dione of Prusa (something similar to a modern TV anchorman) criticized Homer for his employ of the Gods in the action; besides, he said that Achilles was killed by Hector and the war won by the Trojans, and that the whole tradition on the matter was conditioned by the Greek point of view. Later writers told about Achilles'love for the Trojan princess Polyxena, how they met in Apollo's temple where Paris treacherously killed the hero, and how she killed herself on Achilles'grave (Philostratos). And so on: the Greek myth is a perpetual work-in-progress. Any scholar in Literature should know this well. So, Benioff's screenplay is an interesting work, which elaborates quite a lot of sources with some personal touch, in order to adapt the myth to an anti-imperialistic point of view. As regards the mise en scène, I loved the breathtaking battle sequences (especially the duel between Patroclus and Hector and the one between Hector and Achilles: the latter is nearly a homo-erotic scene, with the palpable physical contact between the two heroes), the magnificent scenery (especially the palaces of Agamemnon and Priam, and the Greek camp), the accuracy in reproducing weapons and armour (notice that, just like in Homer, only Ajax fights in the Mycenean way, while Achilles and Hector use more recent tactics). With regard to the acting: Brad Pitt/Achilles is awesome (he IS Achilles!), but also Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom are very convincing in their roles (however, Bana, who acts the ""good guy"", has got an easier job). Rose Byrne/Briseis plays her part very well, and Julie Christie gives as a present her delightful cameo"
"dragomir_lcn","10","2","5","3 May 2009"," It is perfect...
","Seriously, so many blind and ignorant people give it a small score, wen it is one of the most well made, and beautiful movies ever made. This movie is right up there, next to Gladiator. Its entertaining, epic, and over all 10/10. The duel between Achilles and Hector is a thrilling, emotionally charged highlight.<br/><br/>Sure, the gods are missing, and the dialogue is somewhat lacking. Yet, the film still is tremendously entertaining thanks to the performances of Bana and O'Toole. As for Pitt, he looks the part of Achilles, but he's no Russell Crowe when it comes to acting. <br/><br/>Bloom correctly plays Paris as a coward, and Brian Cox is a wonderful ""villain"" as always. However, the best thing about ""Troy"" is that it doesn't really take sides ... maybe it sympathizes with Troy more than with Greece, but it also focuses on the Greeks and their greatest warrior, Achilles. By the film's conclusion, we feel as if everyone has lost the battle, and that's a refreshing change for a war film.<br/><br/>In the end... Don't believe the negative reviews. This movie is well done."
"thefinisher_23","8","2","5","11 February 2009"," Simply put this is VERY good
","While perhaps not the epic some envisioned upon its' release, director Wolfgang Petersen's adaption of Homer's The Iliad is faithful enough, more than thrilling enough, and its lead actors dominate the screen. Brad Pitt's performance as Achilles brings the famous warrior to larger-than-life status. He is defiant, determined, and unstoppable. His Trojan nemesis Hector is played by Eric Bana who can embody an action hero with a conscience as well as any actor in Hollywood. His battle with Achilles truly goes down as one of the best the screen has seen. The rest of the cast features the seasoned Brian Cox as the disgruntled Agamemnon. His frustration with Achilles seems well placed despite Agamemnon's unsavory intentions. The legendary Peter O'Toole is cast as King Priam. Also notable is Orlando Bloom's performance as Paris. He comes across as rather unlikeable, but I think that is the intention. Paris is seen as a man truly in love with Helen (played with a believable uncertainty by young Diane Kruger) but struggling even more with the fact that he has brought war on his family and Troy, and that he is not the man his brother is or that Achilles. The fight scenes in this film are second to none, as they feature much more intimate combat between groups of men instead of masses of CGI created armies. When CGI does appear in the film it serves the purpose of illustrating just how massive the conflict was, and it is impressive eye candy as well. <br/><br/>The one grudge with the film I share is that Petersen failed to include the massive role the three Goddesses and Zeus play in setting up the action. Perhaps audiences would shy away from such a story but there is no denying that the absence of this element makes story not quite as rich as The Iliad. All in all though, I found the film to be a truly epic piece of cinema with thrilling battles and a very great cast. Troy is certainly worth any movie-goer's time."
"damamirlo","10","2","5","10 November 2008"," Totally underrated by ignorant people and critics.
","Sorry if the title sounds offensive, but that's how it is. This movie was blasted because some ignorant people and VERY ignorant critics decided it wasn't ""faithful enough"" to the Iliad. I didn't see anyone complaining about how Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy deviates from Tolkien's work. Talk about double standards.<br/><br/>Quick and to the point: The city of Troy existed historically and was destroyed. The only account we have of one of the times Troy was destroyed (because it was destroyed a dozen times), is Homer's Iliad. So the filmmakers used it as a source material, yes. And then, they tried to make the story real, they tried to make a version of how things would have happened without Zeus, Hera or Apollo waltzing around the scene. They tried to make the story both realistic and epic. And you know what? They did an immensely impressive job at it.<br/><br/>Once the direct intervention of gods is out, they pretty much respected Homer's telling. Let's have a look at Homer's character development there:<br/><br/>1. Achilles the cocky show-off extraordinaire. Check. 2. Achilles in love with his Patroclus. Uncheck, it's Hollywood, not possible. 3. Achilles in lust with slave girl Briseis. Check. 4. Paris a wimp. Check. 5. Agamemnon proud, ambitious and dictatorial. Check. 6. Priam stupid, overconfident or unwilling to see what's coming. Check. 7. Hector the most courageous, noble, character. Faithful husband, loving father (Homer described him that way). Whoa, check. Special mention to Sean Bean's impressive acting. 8. Andromacha, Hector's wife, model of loyal wife and mother (yep, Homer also portrays her that way). Check. 9. Ajax a brute force fighter. Check.<br/><br/>I don't think it makes much sense to go on with this. I just find it ridiculous that many people who either haven't read Homer, or just have read the Cliff's Notes for the Iliad, are attacking the movie on its supposed inaccuracy. The inaccuracies are extremely few, and the huge ones were obviously done PURPOSEFULLY. The filmmakers wanted a version of the War of Troy as it could have happened in reality, without gods directly meddling in the action. But the character depth and development, greatly respects Homer's writing and style. Even in the play-down of homosexual themes and the better treatment of female characters, since that's what Homer does in his works. He treats women far better than most Greeks used to do, and doesn't focus much on homosexual themes (though they are there... however, I guess you can't ask Hollywood to put that into a super-production, much less with Brad Pitt on it).<br/><br/>The photography, settings and film-making are impressive. The action scenes are great, with the plus of them not being blurred. You can actually see what's happening, something rare in action scenes of late.<br/><br/>I must add the lightning and photography are extremely beautiful. The soundtrack is more than impressive. Some of the dialog is amazing.<br/><br/>The acting is good when given to good actors. Menelaus, Agamemnon, Ajax, Priam, Ulises, Andromacha, and above all, Hector and Priam, fill the screen when they speak.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt looks great when he fights. He looks ridiculous when he tries to act. At least, when he tries to act seriously and tragically. He plays the pimp-esquire guy pretty believable. It's when he tries to get serious that you don't believe him.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom makes an über-wimp Paris. But then Paris should be a coward wimp, that's what he was in the myth too.<br/><br/>Helen is very beautiful, but she seems to have Schweppes tonic in her veins instead of blood. Her character was indeed changed from what it is in the book. In the Iliad, Helen is a tragic figure, forced to desire Paris because goddess Aphrodite gave her (yes, gave her as an object) to Paris. When Paris starts behaving as the coward, irresponsible wimp he is, Helen despises her. In the book, of course. If you get Aphrodite's orders out of the question (as happens in the movie), Helen is a blond airhead with no interest at all, just as wimpy and ridiculous as Paris. But then again, without Aphrodite's meddling, there was no way to make Helen the tragic figure she is in the book. Helen's flee with Paris is more understandable by watching Menelaus.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie deserves a 10, I would have given it just a nine for entertainment, epic, good acting and beautiful imagery. But considering its score is artificially lowered by totally unfair reviews, I've upped my score to a 10, just to compensate.<br/><br/>This movie has been treated unfairly by both critics and reviewers. It deserved and deserves better."

"jdkraus","9","2","5","5 April 2008"," The Direcotr's Cut: Improved, but still not perfect
","Now that I have seen Troy: The Director's Cut four times, I have come to my conclusion of whether I liked this version over the theatrical or not. Most directors' cuts improve the original release such as: Blade Runner, and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I enjoy this version of Troy more than the theatrical, but only slightly.<br/><br/>The story is the same. The following morning of the peaceful pact between Sparta and Troy, Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) loves Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) and decides to take her with him to his home Troy. Her husband Menelhaus (Brendan Gleeson) learns about this betrayal and decides to go to war with the Trojans, aided by the support of his power hungry brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) who recruits the greatest warrior of the world Achilles (Brad Pitt) to partake in the war that launches a thousand ships. King Priam (Peter O'Toole) and his eldest son Prince Hector (Eric Bana) must defend their city from the Greeks onslaught.<br/><br/>Compared to the theatrical version, which to me was just a big budget action flick, there are scenes added in the film that help develop the character's revealing their motives. <br/><br/>For instance, there's an added scene where King Priam tells his son Hector a story about him as a baby when he was sick. He told him he prayed to the Gods and made a promise to them that if they saved him, he would dedicate his life to them. When young Hector's health improved, Priam says, ""Since then I've dedicated my life to the Gods. I've worked thirty years for peace."" The reason why he fears and respects the Gods so much is explained. There are several other scenes like this that makes the characters more believable and more understanding.<br/><br/>There are other scenes that may not have been extended, but rearranged via editing. An example would be in a scene where Briesis first meets Achilles, bound by the wrists in his tent. Rather than cutting back and forth between Achilles talking to her and her talking to him, the screen focuses only on her. The scene is not longer, but it draws its main attention on her. <br/><br/>In the theatrical version of Troy, I found the battle sequences to be very entertaining, but at times unrealistic with the sometimes bloodless slashes, choppy camera angles, and occasional overuse of CGI. I was surprised it got the R rating. But this version rubs the battles in your face, very much like Mel Gibson's Braveheart. The blood/gore fans will enjoy this very much. <br/><br/>There are several other things that have been changed in this new version. The colorization is brighter than the theatrical version. The statue of Apollo is a gold rather than bronze. This also makes the blood stand out more. <br/><br/>The score by James Horner is broader, adding more drama and emotion to the film. It is very similar to the theatrical version, but the pieces are rearranged and a little bit of a Gabriel Yared feeling (the original composer for the film) is added to it. This had quite a positive effect on the film. However, the music during the duel between Hector and Achilles is totally different. Rather than a solo drum supporting the suspense of the fight, an entire group of drums and other instruments are at work, drowning the scene rather than allowing the fight on the screen do most of the work. <br/><br/>As I've said earlier, many scenes added make the movie better. But there are also scenes added that had no purpose to the film. There's an added scene following Paris ecstasy with Helen in which hector confronts Paris. He questions him about who he was sleeping with. Paris lies but Hector doesn't buy it. Instead, he grabs him by the face and tells him that if he ever messed up the peaceful pact with Sparta, he would ""rip his pretty face from his skull."" <br/><br/>This gives the implication that he knew about his brother and Helen, which does not add the surprising revelation on the boat in the theatrical version. This also shows that Hector knew about the affair, yet he didn't straighten it out. I found that to be weak on his part, particularly as such a wise and honorable man who would do anything for his country.<br/><br/>I also found the rearrangement of Hector's funeral to be unneeded. Rather than Horner's score flourish, an annoying female soloist sings her heart out, sounding like a chicken being choked. Every time I come across this scene, I skip it, because I might just scream.<br/><br/>Overall, the director's cut is better, but it is still flawed. Nonetheless, out of Wolfgang Peterson's effort to make such a compelling story, I give it a 9/10. <br/><br/>The myth by Homer will always be the best version."

Achilles taking of the temple of Apollo single handedly was awesome and the Hector/Achilles duel was unnerving, tiring(physically), and sad. It only seemed at the end of the movie it lost some steam. I wouldn't bash this movie just because the bandwagon says to. This movie was done as if it happened. I they filmed it the way the illiad was written it may have seemed to fantastic. The realistic way it was portrayed was very visceral. If your looking for feeling or a revenge flick then you wont enjoy it. If you looking for an adrenaline rush the check this sure to be cult classic out."
"Danimal-7","5","2","5","14 August 2007"," Good and original, unfortunately
","This movie is named ""Troy."" It is not named ""The Iliad."" Troy was a real place, and the Greeks really did besiege it and destroy it. The Iliad is a work of fiction written some centuries after the fall of Troy by a guy named Homer, who guessed at what happened based on the chants and oral histories handed down to him. The movie Troy is not an attempt to recreate the Iliad word for word; it is an attempt to show the kind of real events that might have given rise to the myths retold in the Iliad So it is no crime that the movie leaves out much of the Iliad. The problem is that the new inventions that substitute for the Iliad's version often didn't work. To paraphrase Samuel Johnson, Troy is both good and original, but the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good.<br/><br/>To review the good part: as in the Iliad, Hector is the most noble and impressive character in the story. In fact, he's even nobler here than in the Iliad, as he faces Achilles down directly, while Homer's Hector understandably but ingloriously flees the Greek champion for as long as he can. Eric Bana does the role justice, showing his devotion to his family and his city, and there is a streak of true Greek tragedy in how his love for the one destroys the other.<br/><br/>On paper, Brad Pitt looks like a disastrous choice to play Achilles, so I'm pleased to say he did a fine job. He does very well in his scene with Priam, and he manages to convey with his tears over the body of Hector that he has finally realized that the man he has killed and whose corpse he has desecrated was a better man than he. Also, the movie comes up with a fairly imaginative explanation of how Achilles got his reputation for invulnerability to mortal weapons.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole, meanwhile, gives a radically different performance from his customary acting, investing Priam with far more dignity and majesty than he usually gets. It's delightful to see O'Toole still willing to strike out in a new direction at his age.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but that's it for the good part. The bad choices are overwhelming.<br/><br/>To start with, making Agamemnon into a villain was a perfectly defensible decision, but making him into an incompetent was not. It is impossible to believe that a man like Brian Cox's Agamemnon could have united Greece despite lacking not only scruple but also courage, foresight, diplomatic skill, and military prowess. The pious complaints that kings don't fight, but let their underlings die for them is an almost charmingly clueless modernism: from ancient Greece to the Middle Ages, personal skill at arms and tactical mastery were the qualities most demanded of a king, and kings who lacked those qualities were usually deposed and killed by kings who had them.<br/><br/>The second major failure is that the movie wants us to like Achilles, and I left the theater wishing that Briseis had cut his throat when she had the chance. Then Hector would have lived, and possibly Troy would have been saved. And what, precisely, would have been lost by Achilles' death? A talented killer whose only motivation for killing is so that generations untold will sing of his butcheries. Who is worse: Agamemnon, who slaughters people who did him no harm in order to unite warring nations under his rule, or Achilles, who also slaughters people who did him no harm, but does it only to make a name for himself in the epics? Achilles gives a high-falutin' final speech to Briseis, saying ""you brought me peace,"" but what exactly did she do to bring him ""peace"" that the woman he slept with in the opening scene didn't do too? <br/><br/>It would be easier to like Achilles if there were at least some justice to the Greeks' cause; if, for instance, Paris had been the sniveling coward he was in the original text, or had kidnapped Helen, and if Menelaus had really been in love with her. But in this version, Paris is doing Helen a favor, Menelaus is fighting not for love of his wife but for his wounded pride, and Paris bravely (if incompetently) challenges Menelaus to single combat. Who can possibly want the Greeks to win? <br/><br/>Rating: **1/2 out of ****.<br/><br/>Recommendation: See it on TV."
"kenneth-r-close-1","9","2","5","3 May 2007"," True Greek Drama
","How refreshing it is to see a writer and director actually research classic literature before making a movie about it! ""Troy"" is very true to ""The Iliad,"" and exceptionally well done. The movie accurately captures the methods and motivations of ancient warfare in the Bronze age. Beautiful scenery and breathtaking action keep you glued to your seat until the tragic drama plays out its course. My only minor criticism is that it ran about a half hour too long, bogged down by dialogue we didn't need to hear in order to get the point (i.e. Agamemnon must say ""Achilles would just as soon spear me as talk to me!"" at least four or five times). BTW, the score is fantastic and has an enormous impact on the movie - especially during Hector's death.

"AdderCowley","6","2","5","6 March 2007"," A film which grows on you
","When I first saw this film I found it a disappointment. The historical inaccuracies were terrible, I mean really bad. Not just small mistakes like they didn't use that sword at that time but major characters being killed who didn't die in the the Illiad and also the ridiculous idea of the Trojan war lasting 2 weeks? <br/><br/>Apart from the historical inaccuracies there was the problem of Brad Pitt's acting. It takes about 5 minutes to realise that Pitt uses one method of facial action for each emotion. When he is angry he pouts, when he is happy he pouts, when he is making love... he pouts. Yep that's pretty much it.<br/><br/>Also I found the casting stupid as well (I mean who decided on the actresses for Helen and Hector's wife? I mean come on!). Also the master stroke of Sean Bean playing Odysseus, the only 'good' Greek, ha!...the irony!.<br/><br/>However after watching the film again I am able to see the positives. Despite Pitt, on the whole the actors do a good job. Eric Bana who is a constant danger of being a good actor is the only character I actually like. Hector makes you want to support the Trojans and I found that I supported the Trojan cause much more than the Greek cause. <br/><br/>The film is actually pretty enjoyable. The fight scenes are no Helm's deep or Osgiliath but they still can hold their own.<br/><br/>In short I liked this film because it does grow on you. However it is no LOTR killer which it set out to do. Really its just a combination of decent to mediocre actors saying one liners throughout, with a huge budget for the director to waste."
"schumybv","8","2","5","6 June 2005"," More about the gods.
","If you know nothing about the history behind the movie then you will be able to enjoy it. But I doubt that there are many people who don't. Even if you never read the Iliad, you probably heard the story of Troy.<br/><br/>The movie is well done. Nice settings, nice costumes. I can say that they managed to get the major elements of that era. But the characters and the story are not the way they are supposed to be. First of all there was nothing about the gods, who were very much involved in the war on both sides. And what about the fact that Achilles was immortal, and the only spot where he could be killed was his heel? There were so many great parts of the story that they could've incorporated in the movie. Like for example, when Hector went to fight Achilles, knowing that he was going to die, or what about Achilles who had to choose between fame, followed by an early death or a long life without glory. The portrayal of Achilles, besides the non-mentioning of his immortality, is fairly accurate. He was a great warrior and very cruel, especially after the death of Patrocles, but he did became a nicer person when Priam came to him to ask for Hector's body, because Priam reminded him of his own father. In the real story, Priam was actually sent by the god Hermes to Achilles because the gods were very mad at Achilles for not allowing Hector's body to be buried, and also because the gods, especially Zeus, liked Hector very much and at one point he was even thinking about changing his fate but then he was reminded by Athena that he can't do that.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Paris is by far the worst. I mean, yeah Paris wasn't a very good fighter but he wasn't the wuss they made him look like. According to the Iliad, it's the gods who saved Paris from the fight with Menelaus. And they could've mentioned a bit more about the causes of the war. I mean yeah, the main reason was the kidnap of Helen, but there was more to it than that. Paris had to choose between 3 goddesses, and when he chose Aphrodite, she gave him the love of the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen. So basically it wasn't all Paris' fault for the war. <br/><br/>One thing they didn't explain was the beauty of Helen. I mean why was she the most beautiful woman in the world and desired by all men? It was because she was the only daughter of Zeus. That's part of the whole no-gods-involved extravaganza.<br/><br/>Also, when the Greeks manage to get inside Troy, Menelaus goes after Helen wanting to kill her, but when he finds her, she shows him her beautiful body and he can't do it and so she goes back with him to Sparta and they live happily together. <br/><br/>This story is a great one and they could've followed it more, although I know that many movies are not historically accurate. But my opinion is that if they would've involved the gods in the movie, it would've been much better, since there is no Greek myth in which the gods were not involved.<br/><br/>If you wanna see Brad Pitt in a skirt and fighting like a great Greek warrior, looking absolutely great, then you should go see this movie. If you know the whole story, you will be a bit disappointed."
"MLDinTN","3","2","5","18 March 2005"," a badly acted generic Hollywood action movie
","I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater. Most of the reviews I read about it were correct; this movie isn't very good. I think it was made because of the huge success of Gladiator, but when it comes to acting Brad Pitt is no Russell Crowe. The main problem is the dialog and acting are bad, so you don't care what happens to the characters. And a story like the Trojan War is just too huge to tell in 150 minutes. Many of the characters mention the gods, but there is never time to explain who the gods were and how they played a role in the war. Basically, the writers just made up their own story, and the only way this is related to the Ilyad is it uses some of the same character names.<br/><br/>Also, I was expecting some great war scenes that resembled Glaidator or Braveheart. Well, you don't get them in this film. The movie had 2 good fights. The best one between Achilles and Hector. The quick choreography and jumps used by Achilles looked cool. And the other good fight was when Achilles makes his way up the hill after his boat lands. But, the huge fights between both armies were boring.<br/><br/>As I said, all the acting was bad, but if I had to pick who seemed most believable, it would be Eric Bana. Bloom's Paris was such a wimp and coward, I would think his father would have beheaded him because of the shame he brought from crawling away from his fight.<br/><br/>And the romances in this film were so unbelievable. First that Achilles would hook up with a Trojan Princess and change his ways for her. His job is to kill and he's not going to change for some woman, plus he's introduced being surrounded by two naked women, so this one woman is going to make him fall in love. Then there's Hector and his wife. The movie tries hard to make us have sympathy for her and portrays him as being this great husband. In that time, weren't all woman treated as second class citizens and men had many lovers of both sexes.<br/><br/>The movie also failed to explain the significance of Achilles being shot in the heel. I don't know the story, but there must have been one for Achilles to have been stopped by a couple of arrows.<br/><br/>Now, to the best part of the movie, Brad Pitt's body. He's shirtless a few times and shows off his rear. This is the hottest he's every looked. So, if you like Brad, I would recommend watching it for a few select scenes.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Pretty bad action movie. It's made worse by the acting because the actors are trying to play serious characters, but they are given a bad script to work with. You would never believe any of those people lived 3200 years ago. So, if you do watch this, watch it for one thing: Brad Pitt's abs."
"sac0051","3","2","5","13 February 2005"," Completely historically inaccurate
","Troy was intended to give insight to the Greek culture and the mythological battle of Troy to those unfamiliar with the ancient Aegean world. However commendable its intent, the movie did not accurately achieve this goal, despite their efforts to incorporate truthful artistic and architectural elements. Historically, the movie is completely inaccurate, bending commonly known facts about the Trojan War into material suitable for pleasing the audience. The movie did get some pertinent facts correctParis did in fact kill Achilles, Hector did kill Patroculus, and the Greeks did hide their ships behind a cliff while waiting for the wooden horse ambushhowever, anyone who has read scholarly works on the war, Homer's The Odyssey, and other Greek dramas can point out other facts the movie has misconstrued. Firstly, many scholars confer that the war lasted approximately ten years; however, the movie makes it appear as if the war took only a few weeks to occur. When Achilles was dispatched to Troy, he was only fifteen years old, obviously not a fact the movie wanted to portray by casting Brad Pitt in this role. Paris did kill Achilles by shooting his heel and then shooting his chest; however, in the movie, this occurred during the wooden horse ambush. Achilles, however, was killed before the wooden horse was even built, thus making it impossible for him to appear within the horse. In the movie, moments before Achilles's death, his love interest, Briseis, kills Agamemnon by stabbing him in the throat. However, this is impossible as The Oresteia by Greek dramatist Aeschylus could never have existed. Agamemnon did not die at Troy, rather returned to Ithaca, where he was murdered by the lover of his wife Clytemnestra. Additionally, two more deaths were wrongfully accounted in the movie; Priam was not killed by Agamemnon, nor was Meneleus killed by Hector.<br/><br/>There are many, many more facts the studio overlooked or changed; I won't even begin to touch upon the inaccuracies of the art and architecture used in the film. Obviously, this movie was created solely to generate money for the studio and to provide eye candy to women and gay men. For those familiar or even somewhat interested in this movie, avoid it like the plague. Everyone else who wants a popcorn movie closer to fiction than anything else, this is for you."

","I don't think I've ever known my Mum to want to watch a film more than twice in a row, but after watching Troy for the first time, we watched it again the same night. I love Troy. I don't think it deserved any of the bad publicity it received. The acting wasn't phenomenal but I thoroughly believed in every character, the special effects were breath-taking, the set and scenery were amazing, during the action sequences my heart nearly leaped out of my body. The script was amazing, there were so many new ideas brought up, the idea of everything being more beautiful because we're doomed, and Hector questioning why when Achilles desecrated the Sun God statue he was not struck down. The script was realistic, stuck to the myth and respected the beliefs of that time. I felt for the characters and the portrayal of Achilles as a man tied to the myths surrounding him, the script and acting showed the character from a different perspective, one which you ultimately feel for."
"bcbloyd","10","2","5","9 January 2005"," Epic Love Story - Superb Battles
","I'm very glad I watched TROY before reading the reviews. I'm not a huge fan of Brad Pitt. His name doesn't make me rush to the box office, so I didn't have any ""expectations"" as far as his role in the film. Having said that, I must admit I enjoyed his performance, particularly in the battles. I think some critics wrongly write his performance off simply because of the nude scenes and good looks; A twist on the blonde-bombshell-equals-no-acting-talent stereotype. Yes, Pitt is a good looking man, from blonde locks to tan bottom, but that does not detract from his capability as an actor. He plays the role of Achilles VERY well, from the wise crack cuts toward Cox's Agamemnon to the pain expressed at the loss of Patroclus, and the angry power in his battle with Hector.<br/><br/>The writers' desire to show Achilles as a god-like warrior is successfully accomplished--the fight choreographers should be commended!--The one-on-one battles in TROY are much more realistic than the highly touted wire-fights of movies like, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br/><br/>I for one appreciated the director's efforts to make the story of the Trojan War less ""mythical"" and more ""realistic""...I mean one ""Clash of the Titans"" is enough for me, thanks. TROY is far better.<br/><br/>Eric Bana's honorable Hector is a superb heroic balance to Pitt's powerful legendary Achilles. I disagree with the critics that say Pitt's Achilles is an unlikeable character. From the first battle, it's evident that he's willing to fight for just causes (i.e. to save the lives of soldiers rather than blindly answer the greedy call of an ambitious unworthy king). He gives respect and mercy to those worthy of it, such as O'Toole's King Priam.<br/><br/>The weakest part of the movie, for me, was surprisingly Peter O'Toole's performance. He ""looked good"" as the Trojan king, but that shocked stare from his lofty seat and royal balcony got old quick. The best scene he provided was as the weary father mourning the loss of his son and pleading with his killer for his body.<br/><br/>Now... did the writer's stick to Homer's Iliad? No, but then that's to be expected. We're talking about a Hollywood production here. However, they did keep numerous major points. Achilles is the ""handsomest of the Achaeans"" and best warrior with an eye for glory (foretold to be linked to his doom). He is antagonized by Agamemnon, especially after the king seizes Briseis only to later return her. He laments over Patroclus who dies wearing Achilles armor, and he kills Hector, dishonoring the man's body until persuaded to show mercy by King Priam, with whom he meets in his hut and weeps for their losses. So what if Homer's Paris shoots Diomedes in the foot rather than Achilles. TROY isn't a ""documentary"" of the original classic, but is an entertaining movie inspired by it. Besides, Homer's ""Iliad"" is filled with appearances of the gods and larger-than-life myths. The movie actually comes across more realistic to me with its tragic love stories, warrior's code of honor...and by showing old rulers whose devotion to said gods--instead of listening to their experienced military advisers--bring about the downfall of a city, rather than any direct godly interference.<br/><br/>Is TROY a classic? Only the test of time can tell, but for me...it's a worthy film that delivered 163 minutes of entertainment. What more can one expect from Hollywood?"
"cinnamon_swirly","10","2","5","6 January 2005"," Brad Pitt
","Before watching ""Troy"" I never really understood what the hype was about Brad Pitt. I mean I've seen some movies that he was in but still never really understood. But, now I understand. It's not about the look that an actor protrays, it's about their ability to play a good role. Different roles. And in 160 minutes Brad Pitt showed that he can take on any role possible.<br/><br/>Having seen, and enjoyed many war type movies, ""Troy"" is by far the best one that I have seen yet. It combines war, with love and compassion. A little something for the guys and the gals!! Personally, I think that this is one movie that everyone should see."
"jeddyhi","10","2","5","6 January 2005"," Excellent
","The fascinating thing about this movie, and what made it brilliant to me, is the fact that they portrayed the Trojan War and the famous characters in a realistic fashion. They tried to portray the story that inspired the myth, not the myth itself. Achilles was never shown to be an indestructible superman. Just perhaps the greatest warrior of his time. As I watched the battle between Hector and Achilles, I felt as though I was observing through a time machine and watching two of the greatest warriors of that age fight. Surely an epic match such as that would spawn embellishment, exaggerations, and stories for centuries to come. Achilles death was poignant in the fact that he died from arrows to the chest, but pulled these out before he succumbed. When he was discovered dead by his comrades, the only arrow visible was the one from his Achilles tendon. This could have been the start of the myth of the Achilles heel. We all know that the Greek Gods never existed. This is why they are left out of the movie except when only spoken of. So if the Trojan war actually happened, if Achilles actually existed, he was a mere mortal with extraordinary fighting skills. All in all, a great movie with awesome performances by Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole."

They didn't care about the history, about the truth. It's just a bad story near the greatness of the historical truth. Just a bad movie that must sell. You'd better read the books. It's well produced, the setups are fine, the fights are nice, the acting maybe OK for lots, and generally it's a nice movie for a lonely Saturday night but only if you can get over the fact that a nation's history is so mistreated and so respectless regarded.

","What a poor movie - no plot - no character development.<br/><br/>Extremely hard to believe the movie with so many fake accents and acting - the only semblance of character development is Hector and his wife. Brad Pitt should be ashamed - such a poor performance for such a good actor - Eric Bana was OK - Brian Cox was the best - but thats not saying much. The battle scenes were unimaginative - we've seen it all before - no twist like in Braveheart or Gladiator. With such a wealth of material to work with I think the producers and directors put little into this movie and are hoping for a windfall - such a pity. For the $8.50 I payed I don't think I got my moneys worth - the music score was even poor - absolutely no comparison to Gladiator - Homer is probably squirming."
"Manina","4","2","5","20 June 2004"," Disappointing!!!!!
","I cringed in the very first scene when Agamemnon brings his troops to subdue the next country into his empire; the first two rows of soldiers are European looking but the rest are Mexican extras (Aztecs in Ancient Greece?). Then I saw all this tropical vegetation including agave plants, yes, the ones used to make tequila; next I saw a couple of llamas inside the city of Troy; llamas are native to the Andes in South America. If you want to know what Greece looks like, remember the movie Captain's Corelli's Mandoline with Nicholas Cage an Penelope Cruz. It is very distracting to see a movie where the sets are so cheesy. Even though some of the acting was excellent (Eric Bana), I could not take this movie seriously and walked out after Hector Killed Menelaus."

","Troy could have been better. The movie is basically another vehicle for Brad Pitt to flex his muscles. Casting him as Achilles is fine enough but then giving Achilles superhuman abilities beyond his invulnerability was an enormous dollop of artistic licence which detracted from the movie. Sure, I didn't expect the movie to be historically accurate but hyperbole was everywhere throughout the film. Bright points included Peter O'Toole as King Priam - what an amazing actor- and Helen (whom I doubt would have been a blue eyed blond haired Grecian beauty - but hey genetic outliers happen, just like Hector and his wife's child having blue eyes while both parents were dark eyed), who was definitely a beauty and elegantly regretful as the catalyst for war. Certainly a spectacular movie, although we've now seen massive army 'flyovers' since Lord Of The Rings and it gets boring playing 'spot the non-digitised characters'. Nice try, but no cigar from this reviewer."
"rapt0r_claw-1","Null","2","5","1 June 2004"," 'The Illiad' might have been twisted, but the movie is very good.
","I have always been interested in mythology, and when I heard of 'Troy' I was happy and found the wait long and restless. 'Troy' doesn't delete anything from the plot of the source material; just adds to the plot to make the movie an epic. It has been successful in keeping my attention during a 165-minute marathon.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt fits Achilles in my imagination, but that's only after I found out he would play the famous Greek warrior. Eric Bana does all an actor can do to portray Hector, and Orlando Bloom does the same with Paris. However, I can't imagine them as brothers, nor the king of Troy (Peter O'Toole) as their father. Despite these shortcomings, the trio of sons and father all play great parts. <br/><br/>Diane Kruger was believable as Helen, and I have no complaints. Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is an unlikable character, but the acting is in no way below par. In fact, it's an achievement to make him unlikable, as that is what 'Troy' asks for. Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus, Agamemnon's equally unlikable brother, also succeeds, as the role asks for him to be unpleasant later in the movie.<br/><br/>Briseis (Rose Byrne) falls in love with Achilles, and this is another of the additions to 'Troy'. I don't know if the filmmakers meant for it to be an interesting part of the story or just to make it longer, or if they were taking a chance to get a truckload of money by showing Pitt naked. It is somewhat interesting, though the movie would have fared well without it (although the Pitt scene might have pushed it a bit higher).<br/><br/>
The battle scenes are exciting and action-packed. None of the battles disappoint, one-on-one or the mass collision of armies. In the Hector-Achilles duel, it was the actors themselves mock-fighting, but every blow was aimed to kill. There was no harmless clash of swords or spear upon shield. Every strike was meant to impale you or lop your head off, and I was glad they agreed to make it that way. The Paris-Menelaus battle is also good, though the ending was not to my liking. The army scenes are all great, boasting some spectacular camera angles. <br/><br/>'Troy' is one of a trio of historical movies coming out this summer, but both 'King Arthur' and 'Alexander' will find it hard to beat 'Troy'. The movie is flawed little, and triumphs much."

","There is indeed a legendary beauty in ""Troy"" -- a face that brings the ancient world to its knees, a being whose grace is such that grown men feel stupid and ashamed in its presence. I speak, of course, of Brad Pitt. The actor's portrayal of the Greek warrior Achilles as a predatory Bronze Age - Rock Star is the centre around which this surprisingly lumbering $200 million disappointment revolves. They could have catch the opportunity and create a masterpiece as perfect as the Lord of the Rings! The splendorous computer graphics constitute undeniably an admirable tool in the hands of those artists who however know how to use it.<br/><br/>This is not what the 'Troy' moviemakers did. -Trojan war was not actually between Greeks and Trojans but between Achaeans and Trojans... -Achaeans and Trojans were both Greeks. -Achilles was a king (the King of Fthia, today's Fthiotida.) not some kind of Agamemnon's ""champion"" -It is presented mix of uniforms, arms and martial techniques totally improper for the Trojan War epoch and participants. -It presents a society where women participate in.... Martial councils, the battles are watched from... ""loge"" on the walls, the gods are disputed, in the palace of Agamemnon the dancers dance belly dance etc. -Agamemnon was killed by Aigisthos and the Klytaimnistra at the return not during Troy's occupation (otherwise there wouldn't be any reason for Aeschylus to write the well known astonishing trilogy of Orestia!) His brother Menelaos as well...!!! -Nestor was the wise king of Pylos not a sneaking courtier of Agamemnon<br/><br/>The Troy movie is full of such imprecision. The above was just a few of them. The movie has very few nice scenes and in general looks very cheap and 'kitsch'"
"NoArrow","Null","2","5","27 May 2004"," Didn't live up to its hype, but a good film nonetheless...
","Ever since the first trailer of ""Troy"" - the one with all the ships - people have been saying this would be an amazing cinematic epic, up for many Oscars, one of the greatest adventure/war movies ever made. It's not. In fact, it's very, very far away from all that. It's an inch away from being mediocre.<br/><br/>The plot has Trojan princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) making peace with former enemy Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). Unfortunately, Paris has a hard-on for Menelaus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger) and steals her away once Hector and him leave Menelaus' kingdom. When Menelaus finds out he enlists his power-hungry brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) to join him in war against Troy. Agamemnon doesn't care about Menelaus' personal vengeance, though; he just wants to conquer Troy. So he calls in the greatest warrior on Earth, Achilles (Brad Pitt), to lead his battle, but Achilles is a rebellious jerk and causes Agamemnon a lot of trouble.<br/><br/>There are a lot of super-unnecessary dramatic parts to this film that don't make much sense. One of which is Achilles' wanting to be always remembered as a great warrior but then refusing to participate in the greatest battle of all time. His excuse is that he doesn't like the politics about it...well, I don't know where Achilles got his reputation, then, 'cause it obviously wasn't by fighting wars. If it were, he'd have already known that war is all politics.<br/><br/>Another mistake is the subplot between Paris and Helen  it just wasn't handled correctly. Everyone knows that Paris is a whiny, selfish brat - he gets a whole damned war started because of an erection - but for some reason he was written to be liked. He's a coward and complete moron; he should be shown that way. But instead they show him as a hero to Helen and Troy...instead of the guy who single-handedly killed a peace contract and an entire country.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, it varies. Most of the performances were not necessarily bad, just not good. Kruger's lines are terrible so her performance is at least forgivable. Bloom is basically confused as to whom he's playing the whole time, and it shows on screen - not a very good performance. Brad Pitt should stick to playing psychos; his action hero roles just don't work. Gleeson and Saffron Burrows do what they can with their little roles.<br/><br/>The film's best performances - and the best parts of the film - are Eric Bana, Sean Bean, Brian Cox and, of course, Peter O'Toole. Bana shines in this one, his first great American performance, and if there were anything Oscar worthy about this film it'd be him. Bean has a small role but he's terrific in it, another great warrior but still able to differentiate itself from his Boromir character from ""Lord of the Rings"". Cox is a great villain, he's very 'cool evil', much like his Stryker character from ""X2"". O'Toole, well, I was expecting a great performance and he gave one (the only other Oscar worthy performance of the flick).<br/><br/>The writing is pretty badthe old style that the characters talk in is mastered but what they're saying needed more work. All of the characters basically scream out the film's points (war is bad, war politics are bad, etc.) instead of letting us the audience take it for ourselves. There were two particularly great scenes though, the first being a sad and intense scene where Hector prepares to meet Achilles in battle, and the second being Priam (Peter O'Toole) begging Achilles to let him give his dead son a proper burial. Both scenes were intense, dramatic and perfectly acted.<br/><br/>Most of the technical aspects are good, but its blown out of the water by movies like ""Lord of the Rings"" and even old epics such as ""The Ten Commandments"". The action is kind of messy and unimpressive; the only good fight scene is between Bana and Pitt. The score is too repetitive, but there is a great song that plays in the credits.<br/><br/>It's a good half hour too long too, and gets kind of repetitive by the end, but overall it's a good film, though nothing special, 7.5/10."

(undeserved in my opinion)<br/><br/>so many things are wrong with this movie that it would be impossible to write about this anymore. the audience snickered throughout the entire thing and yet they mostly walked out talking about how amazing the movie was. they are wrong and Hollywood is wrong for making audiences think that this is what good film-making is. no, good film-making is just that. this is a poor excuse for a blockbuster. forget ""braveheart,"" ""gladiator,"" ""ben hur,"" and ""the matrix,"" this movie falls flatter than debra messing. really, don't waste your money and if you do--try to stare at brad pitt as much as you can because that's the best that ""troy"" has to offer. and don't pay attention to the music either, it's a bore. 3/10*"

The film appeared grainy and underexposed. Pitt's Achilles was attractive, but his character lacked substance and passion. He was a bore. I also felt apathy for Kruger, Bloom and Bana performances, but Cox and Bean were captivating and compelling in their performances in their limited screen time. <br/><br/>Director Petersen may have used Gladiator as a template for his so-called epic film, but he overlooked various important elements that made Gladitor successful: Russell's compelling acting performance, beautiful and poignant music, and excellent direction by Sir Ridley Scott.

The film takes great liberties with Homer's work. In fact, the funniest bit is during the end credits when it states, ""Inspired by Homer's 'The Iliad.'"" If only Homer could sue.<br/><br/>Screenwriter David Benioff essentially only uses the basic premise of Helen being taken by Paris to Troy. From there, he veers wildly from the great work. Characters who didn't die in the Trojan War are killed off; warriors who shouldn't be in the Trojan Horse appear inside; Achilles' relationship with Patroclus is altered - no doubt to appease the thousands of women who adore Brad Pitt; and the decade-long war is reduced to a mere fortnight, as if the Greeks are enjoying an excursion on the beaches of Troy. Those are just some of the changes. There isn't enough room to list all the ways in which Benioff ignores Homer's work.<br/><br/>Granted, some license is allowed, but surely Benioff could have stayed a bit more true to the source material. Imagine, for instance, writer/director Ronald F. Maxwell killing off Robert E. Lee at Little Round Top in ""Gettysburg"" (1993).<br/><br/>There are two good moments in ""Troy."" The first, the fight between Achilles and Hector lasts about four minutes and is well choreographed (though, a bit anachronistic, because, at times, the fighting tends to look more like Asian martial arts); the second, Priam's (Peter O'Toole) scene in Achilles' tent, where he begs for the return of Hector's body. O'Toole never overplays the scene and brings such pathos to the moment that he offers a glimpse of what this film might have been had it better, smarter dialogue and stronger characters.<br/><br/>The dialogue, at times, is downright laughable - there's Achilles calling Agamemnon, ""You sack of wine"" (I suppose, ""Saracen pig!"" and ""Spartan dog!"" had already been used years before) and Helen telling Paris, ""Last night was a mistake."" (Yeah, but she'll always have Paris.)<br/><br/>Pitt is terribly miscast as Achilles. Pitt spends much of his time being utterly expressionless. Orlando Bloom, who delivers every line with overwrought emotion, is way out of his league in this picture, and Garrett Hedlund fails miserably as Patroclus, who apparently is Achilles' cousin.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Eric Bana, his pathetic dialogue notwithstanding, shines as Hector and Brian Cox gives Agamemnon some meat. And O'Toole still has one of the most expressive faces (and eyes) ever put on film. The rest of the cast - Saffron Burrows, Diane Kruger, Brendan Gleeson and Rose Byrne - are mere window-dressing. And the lovely Julie Christie shows up for a barely a minute.<br/><br/>At 163 minutes, ""Troy"" is heavy-going, at times, tedious when it's not supposed to be. There's no real excitement in this film. The battle scenes are nothing spectacular and, often, have a bit too much CGI.<br/><br/>I have no doubt ""Troy"" will make a lot of money. It's one of those critic-proof films. But given Petersen's previous efforts, I went in expecting to be awed and thrilled, and came away dejected and disappointed."

","I was looking forward to seeing this movie & sadly, I was very disappointed. As a Classics Student, I was appalled at the changes that were made. There is a reason that this is a classic story, but the film-makers obviously chose to ignore it. They left the most basic elements in and took out many key elements. After awhile, I lost interest due to being distracted by all of the errors in this classic tale. If your going to make a movie out of one of the most important stories of the ancient world, you had better stick to the tale. There's a reason why ""The Iliad"" is a classic. Learn it!!<br/><br/>ERRORS IN ""TROY"" (2004) ""The Iliad"" has no mention of Thessaly in it. The war has already been on for 10 yrs. when ""the Iliad""starts. Patroclus is FRIEND not cousin to Achilles. Gods do not play important role in the movie, unlike the book. ""The Iliad"" ends with Hector's funeral. Hector does NOT kill Menelaus; Menelaus leaves w/Helen & they have a life together. Aphrodite saves Paris from Menelaus NOT Hector. Hector vs. Ajax is a one-on-one combat, no other fights take place during it & Ajax does NOT die in the fight. Briseis is NOT cousin to Hector NOR a priestess, therefore she shouldn't be returned to Troy; seems her character is merged w/""Chryseis"". Hector takes Achilles armor & wears it after Patroclus'death. Agamemnon is not killed in ""the Iliad""; he is later killed by his wife & her lover in Aeschylus'""Agamemnon"". Sack of Troy is NOT in""the Iliad"". Briseis & Achilles are NOT in love. There is no ""Trojan Horse""nor is it Odysseus'idea. Helen feels contempt for Paris after fight w/Menelaus. Trojans hate Helen. No mention of Cassandra, a clairvoyant Trojan princess. Achilles dies BEFORE the Trojan Horse. Aeneas is older than shown. Helen, Andromache, & Astyanax (Hector's son) do NOT leave Troy. Andromache becomes a slave & Astyanax is thrown from walls. The movie takes elements from ""the Aeneid"".

","Just don't watch it. It's like someone took the Iliad, and dumped in an excuse to make money by having Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom in it, and then made up a ridiculous plot that has only a slight resemblance to the actual story. It was painful to watch, and anyone who has any kind of education, will agree. I thought the plot was ridiculous, and the costumes were worse. They were romaticized versions of Greek battle gear. Not only that, but Paris was definitely not some sweet and innocent hero. He made off with another man's wife, and a lot of treasure. Also, neither he nor Achilles survived, and Helen went back to Menelaus. In fact, Achilles killed Hector, Paris killed Achilles, and then was shot by one of the Greek army, and died. So, the moral of the story? Troy was a hyped-up piece of junk that was just an excuse to use Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom and some CG to make an ""Epic"" Picture."

","From director Wolfgang Petersen (The NeverEnding Story, In the Line of Fire, Air Force One) comes a retelling of a period poem with gory Gladiator style. Basically The Trojan War was started because of the love affair of the beautiful Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) against her husband Menelaus (Braveheart's Brendan Gleeson), to the impulsive Paris, Prince of Troy (Orlando Bloom, a year after Lord of the Rings). Led by Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the Greek forces, Odysseus (Sean Bean, also from Lord of the Rings), plus his near-invulnerable brother Achilles (Brad Pitt) on their side, their huge numbers plan to invade and take over the city of Troy, and get their Queen back. The other side is mainly led by Paris's older brother, Hector (Eric Bana) and his father Priam (Peter O'Toole). Also starring Rose Byrne as Briseis, Saffron Burrows as Andromache, Julie Christie as Thetis, Julian Glover as Triopas, 101 Dalmatians' John Shrapnel as Nestor, Braveheart's James Cosmo as Glaucus, Trevor Eve as Velior, 300's Vincent Regan as Eudorus and X-Men's Tyler Mane as Ajax. The battle scenes in the wide open spaces of deserts (near the castle-like buildings) are very gripping and unmissable, even if the story may not be perfect, and the women who watch this will love Pitt taking off his top and seeing his backside. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design. Good!"

Fearless,emotional,respectable,tragic;Bana gives Hector a range of emotions.He's the show-stealer...Peter O'Tooole as Priam,the naive but humble King Of Troy who puts all his faith in the sun-God Apollo:His best performance in a very long time,delivering the sometimes clunky dialog in a way that makes it sound poetic.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus:Too little screen-time,but Gleeson makes him very memorable.You sympathize with this humiliated and furious king,and we applaud when he gets a little taste of revenge.Had Gleeson been cast today,now that he has become somewhat of a leading man against all odds(Fat.Ugly.Ginger.Irish.Old....but so beyond talented,great actor and Hollywood has finally realized that),Menelaus would no doubt have been an even more fascinating character.<br/><br/>Sean Bean as Odysseus:Sly, intelligent, charismatic, diplomatic...Bean portrays the king of Ithaka with style and ease.Saffron Burrows as Andromache,Hectors wife:So beautiful,natural and passionate.Bloom makes us despise the cowardly Paris,which means he did a good job.Diane Kruger as Helen is not that hot or extremely talented but Brian Cox do alright as Agamemnon,chewing the scenery in a sometimes very enjoyable and a few times over-the-top way.<br/><br/>Pitt however is the Achilles heel...incredibly fierce and intense in the action-scenes but he handles the dialog like he's on General Hospital. He doesn't quite get us to care about Achilles but bonus-points to the screenwriter for giving us a Good guy or Bad guy-dilemma...it's up to you to decide who to root for.Paris or Menelaus.Hector or Achilles.Greece or Troy.Except for Agamemnon,there's no black or white,no evil against good.Both sides do wrong for very different reasons,so does the characters.WHAT other epic offers you this intriguing dilemma?Everybody thinks they're right in a war.Magic.Extrastars for that alone.<br/><br/>On the downside,Troy gets a bit rushed in the end when it's time to sum things up and the fate of certain characters become something it's hard to really care about cause of exactly that quick pace.The score is not really fitting for big parts of the film,a bit too cheerful,outdated and doesn't always fit the mood.However,that is forgiven when Hector goes toe to toe with Achilles..Less is more has never been more true when it comes to movie-scores.<br/><br/>Anyhow.Just see this movie!

"misterlinder","9","2","6","3 March 2010"," Wonderful historic film
","Troy- a city that isn't existing anymore and it's also blurry if it ever existed. The story behind this city was written by Homer in the 'Ilias'. Those who bothered to read this enormous book, recognized that it's almost impossible to create a film out of it. However, the director Wolfgang Petersen resolved the problem and brought in the most important part of the 'Ilias' in the film. Hats off! For me the film is a piece of art and can be compared with other historic films like 'Gladiator', 'Kingdom of Heaven' or 'Alexander'. But why is that film so brilliant? First of all the plot beautiful especially the beach and the city with its high wall and the palace. As I know it took the film-crew months to build up this background scenery. Secondly, the actors did an amazing job, especially Eric Bana as Hector. I've never heard about him until I've seen the film. For once also Brad Pitt was doing well as a thoughtful Achilles. A very emotional music is going along with the whole film and it fortifies the alliance between viewer and the characters. Because it's also played during fitting scenes it gives the film a certain credibility.<br/><br/>To sum up, 'Troy' is a wonderful film for history-interested people and is casted with fantastic actors. The music is also doing its part by influencing the viewer even stronger. 'Troy' is definitely a ""Must-see"", otherwise there would be a gap of ancient Greek culture and history."

"zardoz-13","9","2","6","8 July 2009"," ""Troy"" Is A Joy!!!
","""Das Boot"" director Wolfgang Petersen shuns the gods in ""Troy"" but doesn't suffer the consequences. This impressive adaptation of Homer's spear-and-sandal classic ""The Iliad,"" about the legendary siege of the eponymous city and the hard-bodied combatants, who clashed swords, conjures up not only spectacle on a sprawling scale but also delivers charisma on an even grander scale. Traditionally, when we think about the Trojan War, we think about the adulterous Helen, who started it all when she cuckolded husband Menelaus and skipped Sparta with youthful Paris. After all, Helen's claim to fame rests on her comely features that reportedly launched a thousand ships. On the other hand, this revisionist, 21st century rendition spends more time admiring the abs of its heroes rather than the eyes of its anorectic heroines. Consequently, ""Troy"" ogles Achilles more often than Helen, and for good reason, too. Not since John Travolta buffed up for Sylvester Stallone's abysmal ""Staying Alive"" (1983) has an actor so conscientiously dedicated himself to a muscular makeover. Reportedly, Pitt spent six months building up his body. Ironically, he pulled his Achilles tendon during the production. Meanwhile, the producers make sure Brad bares his body early and often to display his magnificently sculptured biceps and six-pack. This is not Brad Pitt as we are accustomed to seeing him. He has a signature lunge as Achilles when he delivers the death blow with his sword that he repeats at intervals against his opponents that is visually striking..<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Petersen and scenarist David Benioff omits scenes of the Greek deities who would have divulged too much and ruined the suspense and tension in this mortals-only account of events. A blond, bluffed-up Brad Pitt portrays Achilles as a pugnacious prima Donna. He thumbs his nose at Agamemnon and lives for the moment in combat when he can attain his dream of immortality. Compelling plotting and memorable dialogue bolsters this lengthy, but satisfying 162-minute, epic rehash of history's most celebrated ancient war. Nevertheless, despite its marathon length, skillful storytelling, and its secular, down-to-earth, reimagination of Homer, ""Troy"" has more going for it than the sum of its shortcomings. An impressive cast, including screen veterans Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox, Nigel Phelp's astonishing production values, the seamless integration of computer-generated effects with live action footage and several superbly staged combat sequences that have no equal in ancient actioneers offset whatever flaws in this $175-million plus, English language extravaganza.<br/><br/>The larger-than-life action opens in 1200 B.C. King Agamemnon (Brian Cox of ""The Glimmer Man"") leads his army out to confront Triopas (Julian Glover of ""For Your Eyes Only"") on the field of battle. Agamemnon is an avaricious, warmongering opportunist. Triopas suggests Agamemnon and he avoid needless bloodshed by pitting the best of their best against each other. This amusing prologue shows the womanizing Achilles as the greatest warrior of his day, a ""Rambo"" of antiquity, who can whip any adversary. In his first, on-screen scrap, Achilles takes down an imposing Goliath-like opponent who makes our protagonist appear puny by comparison. Size counts for little, because the smaller Achilles displays his agility in slaying his adversary with a single blow! ""Perfect Storm"" director Petersen choreographs the action sequences with considerable flair and imagination, thanks in part to veteran James Bond stuntman Simon Crane.<br/><br/>The hand-to-hand combat appears not only believable, but also the actors wield their swords, shields, and spears with credible ferocity. Later battles qualify as more than just aimless mob warfare with splendidly clad extras roughhousing it with their counterparts. Watch the way Achilles and his mercenaries cover themselves with their shields to repulse wave after wave of arrows. The participants wield their armor with as much savvy as their swords and spears. Meantime, the dialogue scenes that intersperse the gritty action are just as memorable. The theme of immortality pervades this fine example of an ancient world epic. Ultimately, anytime Hollywood handles ancient history, the dialogue possesses an ersatz quality, but the lines here are insightful.<br/><br/>Indeed, Homer's classic ""The Illiad"" inspired this illicit romance that prompted this war. Anybody who survived the 1960s should remember the classic Greek sagas such as ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963) and ""Clash of the Titans"" (1981). Every action on Earth generated corresponding action in the realm of the gods with Zeus lording it over his supernatural peers. ""Troy"" ignores the gods but doesn't rank as a lesser effort for this neglect, though one can imagine how many more millions of dollars and minutes of time inclusion of the gods might have required. Generally, scenes with the gods serve to clarify terrestrial conflicts and clue us in on what we might have missed on Earth.<br/><br/>One of the shortcomings lies in the source material and its lack of explanation. For example, audiences not familiar with Trojan mythology might have a difficult time understanding why an arrow through Achilles' ankle would prove so fatal. Petersen and Benioff scale down the action to mortals-only, and ""Troy"" looks as close to what could have happened if it happened. The beachhead landing (lensed in Mexico) emerges as the ancient equivalent of the sixth of June, D-Day landings in Normandy in World War II, with an armada of oar-driven ships crowding the sea from horizon to horizon. You finally get to see the famous Trojan horse in the final 45 minutes. Ace lenser Roger Pratt gives ""Troy"" a big-screen magnitude with his awesome long shots of virtually anything beyond arm's reach. When the opposing armies march against each other on the level lands in front of Troy, the spectacle is breathtaking in its scale.<br/><br/>Although Petersen and Benioff have tampered with the venerable plot, the action is worth-watching from fade-in to fade-out. Achilles emerges as more of a villain, but Hector (Eric Bana of ""Hulk"") looks like a wrongly slain hero. Paris and Helen emerge as the least effectual lovers in a long time. Naturally, Orlando Bloom wields a bow and arrow. Altogether, ""Troy"" ranks as a joy to watch!"

","Troy should've been an UNDISPUTED EPIC. The battle scenes were brilliant, almost Lord of the Rings-esquire, but a bit shorter in spans as true to history. Unfortunately, they ruined it by HAVING LEGOLAS SAVE THE DAY.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe how the movie ended. I knew Achilles would die, anyone who paid attention in history class knows how he died and the famous term ""Achilles Heel"". I just could've believe Orlando Bloom as ruined yet ANOTHER movie. Totally one dimensional, the producers decided to ride on his Legolas fame and destroyed this otherwise fantastic film. Bloom's character, Paris, can't fight for sheet with a sword or a spear, so he starts using a bow and completely owns everyone in the end. And people rip on Keanu Reeves for being wooden? At least he can play a larger variety than ""Prettyboy"" Orlando Bloom. I mean they totally ruined his character Paris by making him look like a coward. HOW DOES HELEN FALL FOR THIS DISHONORABLE BOY? No, it's not Paris' fault, it's completely Orlando Bloom. And it's all you teenage girls who swoon over him, that are encouraging him to continue riding on his Legolas fame-train and now every movie that needs a cheap boost in ratings and box office numbers just employ him for those lovey-dovey scenes. After he shot Achilles 5 times despite Briseis pleading with him, I wished Briseis would walk up and just stab him. And what's with this 'love' theme? I can understand heroes going home every night to love their wives, but they really overdid it in Troy. I mean think Titanic... think of the death scene.... then watch Troy. It's Titanic x 4. Yes that's right, every single death scene is a tear jerker for the preteen. It's sad to see Troy under the 7.0 mark at the time of this review, but the scores don't lie. Unfortunately ""Troy"" will not be remembered for very long after we die.<br/><br/>Please please don't let Wolfgang direct another Iliad classic like this, my heart can't take it anymore. And they didn't even bother to show Orlando Bloom's death. Yes that's right folks, he NEVER made it out of Troy, he was mortally wounded and his wife begged his former lover Oenone to heal him, who refused because of his playboy lifestyle and dumping her for Helen.

"Hancock_the_Superb","5","2","6","9 September 2007"," Weak, bloated attempt at an epic
","Many thousands of years ago in ancient Greece, ambitious, self-serving nationalist Greek King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is reducing the various tribes of Greece, by force or persuasion, with the very reluctant aid of seemingly-invincible mercenary Achilles (Brad Pitt) and his Myrmadons. With virtually all of Greece absorbed by Agamemnon's empire, there remains the island city of Troy, ruled by the senile old King Priam (Peter O'Toole). When Helen (Diane Kruger), Queen of Sparta, is seduced by Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) and returns to Troy with her, her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) enlists the help of Agamemnon (his brother) to capture Troy and avenge this humiliation. So begins the mythical siege of Troy, depicted in a dramatic but plausible manner, with any of those stupid Greek gods interfering in the story.<br/><br/>""Troy"" was one of the many films which was released in the wave of new historical epics. After the astonishing success of ""Gladiator"", more latter-day swords and sandals films were made, and the public responded with favorable results. The fad seems to have ebbed for the moment, but in the early part of the decade the world clamored with excitement for the release of these films. Not only were they not as ""dated"" or ""boring"" as their older equivalents, they had *CGI!* Now, why bother to build sets or use extras when you can create them with a click of a mouse? That is basically the film's main flaw. For all its technical ballyhoo, for all it's attractive big-name cast and epic battle scenes, ""Troy"" is a soulless epic, which lacks in intelligence and heart. It's just a big, bulky blockbuster that tries but fails to hearken back to the heyday of bloated historical epics.<br/><br/>Most of the older historical epics were just as bad as ""Troy"": only a handful even attempted to raise intelligent debate about issues, most featured embarrassing religious codas demanded by the public, and featured laughably anachronistic scripts and laughably miscast actors. But at least these films, for all their flaws, had something of a heart, a feeling stirred by seeing REAL crowds of people and REAL costumes and REAL sets, not fake, grainy CGI replications. There are lots of extras, surely, there are real sets, but the bulk of the larger action scenes rely on computer graphics, creating an emptiness that the film suffers for.<br/><br/>The movie isn't helped at all by a weak screenplay and horrendous casting. None of the films' characters are anything but hastily-sketched cyphers, each with a simple motivation. The few characters who are well-drawn, like Hector (Eric Bana) and Achilles, are largely the credit of the actors playing them. While the film's removal of the Greek gods from the storyline was probably a wise move, it doesn't make up for their absence with any sense of interest or wonder. It's just there.<br/><br/>There are moments of the film which work. The musical score by James Horner is effective, for the most part. The battle scenes are mixed in quality. The opening attack of Achilles' Myramons on the Trojan beach is an expert bit of swordplay; the one-on-one fight between Achilles and Hector is an intense and physical combat, and definitely the best scene of the movies. The scene where King Priam arrives in Achilles' tent to ask for the body of his fallen son is genuinely emotional due to brilliant acting by both O'Toole and Pitt. And Achilles' ultimate fate, due to his lacking superhuman powers, is a clever bit of business which the film could have used more of. But these are fairly small blips on the radar of a bloated film that goes on for way too long to maintain interest - at least with these characters and this script.<br/><br/>The film's star casting hearkens back to the '50s pseudo-epics who resulted in minimally talented big stars rather than talented actors playing period parts. While there are some fine actors in the cast, many of the performances are weak. Brad Pitt does an admirable job as Achilles, contributing some fine moments to the film, but overall he cannot overcome the limitations of the part, or his own miscasting. Orlando Bloom proves for the fifty-six-hundredth time that he does not belong in front of a movie camera. Teen girls may find him attractive, but he can't act. Diane Kruger as Helen isn't much better. On the other hand, Eric Bana gives a brilliantly well-rounded performance as Prince Hector, making his character a surprisingly complex personage, and Sean Bean makes the most of his underwritten part as Odysseus. Other talented actors aren't so lucky: Peter O'Toole has little to work with outside of the aforementioned scene, Julie Christie's cameo is too brief to have any impact, Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson play stock villain characters, and the rest of the cast isn't even worth mentioning.<br/><br/>""Troy"" is just a big, bloated disappointment. It has elements of a great film, but over-reliance on big-name stars and CGI, a terrible screenplay, and static direction makes it a frustratingly flat experience.<br/><br/>5/10"

But the horrible screen writing and the treacherous interpretation of Homer's Illiad makes this movie merely a mediocre action flick that fails to capture any of the greatness of the work it has been inspired by.<br/><br/>Now I've read comments here from grad students and professors who liked or disliked it. People have brought up issues of historical accuracy and some rightly argued back that one cannot look for historical accuracy in an epic poem. But so far all the comments seem to have missed the one important thing about the Illiad: It's status among the people of ancient Greece.<br/><br/>Homer's Illiad was never meant to be an accurate historical account but was accepted in ancient Greece as an educational piece on some of the most fundamental elements of human existence. And it fulfilled the requirements for such a work by containing an immense amount of morals and messages. Greek thinkers, artists and poets often referred to the Illiad, were inspired highly by it and quoted it religiously. This was their ""holy bible"" in a sense that they kept coming back to it for inspiration and advice. Which is why I believe any work that claims to be ""based on"" the Illiad should try to capture or at least not alter its core messages.<br/><br/>Shortening the story, skipping scenes, wrapping things up a little are all fine and needed for a successful screenplay. But not if these alterations completely alter the messages contained within, in some cases to a completely opposite direction.<br/><br/>The story of a Paris who betrays his nation for his love and survives to become prince conveys a different message than the story of a Paris who wins the world's most beautiful woman because of his fondness of Aphrodite (=Beauty) and in turn brings death and destruction to not only his city but also to himself. The story of a Hector who knows his family is going to run away into safety before the fall of Troy before he goes to battle does not say as much about war as the story of a Hector who knows his son will be thrown off from the city walls onto the tip of a spear if he loses his fight.<br/><br/>Homer's Illiad contains a lesson in morality in every verse. And Troy misses all of that because its writers lack the vision and the courage to explore and reflect Homer's wisdom despite its contradictions with popular action-movie-audience expectations."

Did Hollywood have to rescue it?...<br/><br/>By ignoring major aspects of the correct plot and altering other aspects of the plot, they've come up with something only someone neither familiar with nor interested in the original might like, much less be able to follow. The wrong characters are involved in the wrong subplots, the wrong people die at the wrong moment, and so on. <br/><br/>I guess a story 4,000 years old just wasn't interesting enough, it had to be changed...<br/><br/>-4 points for messing up Homer's plot.<br/><br/>-2 points for leaving out the Gods.

","Based on Homer's THE ILIAD, Wolfgang Peterson directs this awesome battle between the Trojans and the Greeks. Around 1193 B.C., Prince Paris(Orlando Bloom)entices the Greek beauty Helen(Diane Kruger)away from her husband Menelaus(Brenden Gleeson), who just happens to be the King of Sparta. This kidnapping/betrayal leads the two nations to war. The Greeks begin their siege of Troy using every available warrior...led by Achilles(Brad Pitt). Prince Hector((Eric Bana)leads the outnumbered Trojan army and frets the reputation of the warrior Achilles, who is rumored in all his greatness to be immortal.<br/><br/>The fighting is brutal and very violent with more than a generous helping of CGI soldiers. The extra inducement to attract female viewers is the fact Pitt has a couple of scenes in which he is almost completely naked. Pitt is as masculine as Bloom is...well...delicate.

","Completely overshadowed by ""Braveheart"" and ""The Return of the King"" in the ""genre"" the fight for right, Troy doesn't make up for the key elements that it lacks. Great battle scenes and visuals just don't overcome wooden acting and sloppy storyline. <br/><br/>Paris (Orlando Bloom) simply won't get away with stealing Helen of Troy. He's had one too many ""nights"" with the lady and the idea of stealing her away is completely preposterous, especially since she is married to the king of Sparta. Was it not based on a true story I'd be laughing in sheer disbelief at the lack of common sense in Bloom's character.<br/><br/>Anyhow, since it did happen, you can guess what's to follow in such barbaric times. The king immediately wages war, picking up Achilles (Brad Pitt) along the way. If you want to win the greatest war, you need the greatest warrior...<br/><br/>So a suitable premise, and for the most point, Troy delivers. It's the fact that it tries to be deep. There is completely where it fails. Did it stay with what it probably should have been (a passable popcorn flick) it would have been entertaining. But it delves far to deep into sentimentality and utter stupidity that its unbearably shallow characters cannot handle.<br/><br/>Visually superb, Troy passes the eye test.

","I rather enjoyed watching the fight scenes, even though the effects signifying the swings of the swords/arrows/spears was an inaccurate representation than in real life. But it's source material is Homer's Iliad. If I had to choose a better version, I would say this is one of the few times where the movie has been better than the book.
For those who haven't read the book, the Gods are present during the fighting, Helen was kidnapped by Aphrodite and given to Paris as a bribe for some golden apple, Achilles has his girl stolen before the war with Troy starts, and that's why he comes only to spectate, and there is absolutely no mention of the Trojan Horse until the Odysseus.
As for the movie, Achilles helps in the beginning of the war with Troy, it tells you at the beginning that the war to unite Greece has been going on for 9 years, and it's more action than listing off who the people were, who their fathers were, and then how they died.
The only similarity between the two is the fact that I only remember Achilles, Agamemnon, Odysseus, Hector, Paris, and Helen because they were the only ones important to the plot."

Featuring a host of stars like Brad Pitt, Peter O Toole, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom the film is an epic with some neat battle sequences.

Apart from the fact that the film does not play the book of homer in detail, there is hardly a flaw. A movie for all antique lovers friends of big battles and Brad Pitt. who is portrayed here as a half-god achilles which role i think He really stands for (not for everyone) His opposite is hector played by eric bana who surprisingly revived the role. The story is told by eddard stark himself: Sean bean as odysseus gives the film a good introduction and a really epic ending.
The music composed by mr titanic / braveheart / avatar personally is in the original version a true masterpiece for the james only 10 days ago the actual composer Gabriel Dates had jumped off.
hector's brother played by orlando bloom may not be the most popular character in the movie yet one of the most important. King of Troy played by legend Peter O Tole is a true king and father of Troy. 
The original version is much better than the directors cut although there are many nice scenes with sean bean and co. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film is the duel between Achilles and Hector, which for me is the best in film history with Darth Vader. The director is a not so well-known personality with wolfgang petersen often criticized for troja but wrongly as I think.<br/><br/>In the end it is with this occupation history and music troja much more deserved than the evaluation of the most ..

No, it is THIS movie and the performance he gives in this movie. The picture that is portrayed of the demi-God Achilles will always stay with me and I have to thanks Brat Pitt for doing that. What has stayed with me all those years are especially the fight scenes; the WAY he fights. The fact that he is so good at it that... well, no spoilers. I've always considered the requirements for a 10/10 to be: Everything has to be perfect: the story, the music, the special effects, the main character, hell - my requirements for a 10 has been that I need to fall in love with the main character, buy posters of the movie and go see it three times in a theatre; and I don't remember any of that... but if a movie manages it to make think about with strong emotions of thrill, still yearning for that same experience again as if it was a drug that I got addicted to after a single use FOURTEENS YEARS after I saw it... then it deserves a 10 too.

"dhalmagean","5","1","2","28 January 2018"," too twisted - not credible
","I just want to emphasize the following: the movie is too twisted - (soap opera style). This is really destroying for credibility.<br/><br/>Paris and Elena loves each other - they both know they will start a war, a lot of people would dye, they both doesn't want this, but ... thy can't stop themselves. Each one try separately to end the conflict but .. somehow they dont finish the try.<br/><br/>So love is worthy to go for a war (Priam say this ! also).
But not any love. 
Pure love between Briseis and Ahile is not worthy. Paris himself (who started the war for ... love) kills the big pure love between Ahile and Briseis. He shot arrows on Ahile while his own cousin desperately begs him to stop. 
There is too much inconsistency between Hector and Paris behavior: Hector is ready to start a war for Paris's feelings while Paris himself doesn't care for his cousin's feelings. Strange and too obvious twisted scenario.<br/><br/>In the movie, Priam, the good king of Troy did everything he could to loose Troy.
All major bad decisions were taken by him. This is really strange.
He was the last one to decide: when it was a debate between attacking the Greeks on the beach (sustained by his priest) and not attacking because this attack will reunite the Greeks (the mirmidons with Ahile were not fighting yet) - sustained by Hector - the biggest military general in Troy - Priam decided to listen to the priest. Terrible decision.<br/><br/>Again, when it was told by his own son Paris to burn the horse, not to bring him into the city, he took again the decision based on the priest advice: it is a gift from gods and brought into the city. Fights ends after this decision - again taken by Priam!<br/><br/>Very strange to put the responsibility of such big mistakes on such a nice character like Priam. Seems for me like a big childish screen play error.<br/><br/>The story of Illiada is difficult to tell, I agree. The gods are missing from the movie, the big speeches also.<br/><br/>So what is rest ? What should I understand ? 
Is ok to love - even impossible love which starts a war, is also ok to kill the impossible love (Briseis and Ahile).
Is ok to let your sons fight to death and let the gods decide. A cowardly escape is accepted also.
Psychopath kings, gentle kings, tricks and sleights .. and everyone speaking about random things like: honor, love, etc.
Courage, yes - this is I think the single constant moral value in the movie. <br/><br/>In fact I had the feeling that the scenario could have change every moment like in a soap opera.
Wow. Such flexibility. In fact I see it like a scenario problem that shows inconsistency and lack of credibility. 
By the way: this is just a Hollywood movie, you don't know Illiada after watching the movie :)"

","I recently had watched Troy on DVD at my house and I felt that the movie was underrated but still had a lot of issues. First of all the way Dir. Wolfgang Peterson told the story wasn't very effective. They told it from the point of view of the Trojans as well as from the Greeks which made the audience not care for another character over another because their wasn't any real protagonist. This was the my main issue because it derived the story of all emotion and suspense. Another one of my issues was with the Trojan horse. Out of nowhere, the horse enters Troy, this was semi effective until the final battle. The whole time I was expecting for them to come out of the horse and destroy Troy. This was the one suspenseful moment but it was sadly ruined because they just wait until night to come out of the horse. The battle was meant to show the destruction of the Great city of Troy but we didn't have any connection to Troy because we didn't have a protagonist or antagonist. In general, the story was extremely bland with a significant amount of dialogue. In my opinion, the movie is semi entertaining but if you are looking for a war movie with a good story I recommend ""Dunkirk."""

First time I watched it in my engineering, may be 2007, and since then I don't think any year has gone without watching it. And every time I watched it I liked it more. I think the movie is really underrated and strongly feel it should be in IMDb's top 250 list. <br/><br/>People complain about the treatment of the movie with respect to actual story of books. I have read the summary of Iliad and Odysseus, and I think it is converted into 2 hours-43 minutes movie very nicely. Characters are unforgettable and portrayed excellently. I don't think anything could be better than Eric Bana as Hector, Brad Pitt as Achilles. Even if you watch the movie only once, you will have Achilles and Hector injected into your brain. People complains about the fight between Achilles and Hector that there wasn't the pain. Not sure about those arguments, but I am sure about one thing you wont be able to hold yourself without watching the fight again. Acting of other characters Paris, Agamemnon, Priam, Odyssey is also very good. Orlando bloom and Sean Bean of LOTR and both are of Troy, I was amazed to see the how they carried themselves into the characters. There is no villain or hero in the movie, only characters, which are driven by their thinking, desires, greed, love, rage, passion, family, country etc. And I think that's how the real life is, there isn't a definite line between good and bad. Dialogues are awesome, the opening dialogue ""Men are haunted by the vastness of eternity. And so we ask ourselves: will our actions echo across the centuries..."" and the closing one ""If they ever tell my story, let them say I walked with giants, men rise and fall like the Winter wheat but these names will never die.."" are my favorite.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the music of originally released version of Troy wasn't good (which I think spoiled movie's initially). However the DVD version was released with updated music, which carries movie very nicely."

","Some say they Hollywooded Homer's epic. I think it was all to the benefit of the film. There are no Gods or miracles, romance is emphasized, and important plot-points have changed. But it all felt appropriate. Better for our heroes to be romantic than rapists. It would have been near impossible to include the Gods and keep the serious tone, so I'm glad they're only mentioned.<br/><br/>It does a good job at keeping to the themes of the original story. Neither side is totally vilified, each with sympathetic characters. The toll of war and the vice of pride are still powerful subjects after 2700 years.<br/><br/>Troy uses its high budget better than most films. No wonder - since it cost $175 million to make! The battles are vast, and every person and background matches the period. If we never have another Iliad film, its because they can't outdo this film's scope.<br/><br/>Troy is a good action blockbuster, but also has more character and emotion than most. It deserves its $500 million gross...and annual showings in high schools across the country."

","I haven't watched too many medieval-type films, apart from the Lord of the Rings and so I thought the battle sequences would resemble a lot of that in LOTR. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The acting, the script, the plot, the characters and the score was all brilliant. There were a couple of well known actors, most notably Brad Pitt, Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom. Most of the characters were extremely likable except for Paris (Orlando Bloom) who was pretty much the jerk of the film. It was due to him that his own brother, Hector, got killed and it was due to him that Greece fell. <br/><br/>Apart from this issue, the plot gradually improved as the film went on and grew larger in context. The soundtrack was very well composed and the action sequences had very dark- medieval type soundtracks. <br/><br/>The duel between Hector and Archilles was just amazing, something which I found missing in Lord of the Rings. The build up to the battle was full of tension and emotion. The way that Archilles kept shouting out ""HECTOR"" was just jaw dropping. It was great to see Archilles being portrayed as not just a killer machine but as a man with a heart. Often, adaptions can fail to do such things but this film did it very well. <br/><br/>The assault on the beaches of Troy was brilliantly filmed and the camera angles were very efficient for the film. <br/><br/>Overall, perhaps one of the better films of 2004 that I've seen."

","It is a bit of a shame that they could not follow the story of the Illiad closer however I believe that they have done a reasonably good job in bring out the theme of this story for the big screen. The problem with the Illiad though is that it is actually a single episode within a much larger story, a story that could not possibly be fully told on the big screen. Well, okay, if we decided to try, maybe three movies, we might actually get close, however I suspect having an entire TV series would be necessary to really tell the story of the Trojan War.<br/><br/>The bulk of this movie is the Illiad bookmarked by the events leading up to the story and the conclusion of the Trojan War. However, for those familiar with the legend, one would be aware that a lot more occurs when the Greeks attempt to return home. Unfortunately, the version of the film I watch runs for at least two and a half hours, there is simply not enough time to cover the murder of Agamemnon by his wife, and then Orestes' revenge (though it is a shame that nobody has even considered attempting to turn this story into a film). However the writers do not create a happily ever after type film, namely because, true to the Greek legend, most of the main characters meet a very sticky end (though Menelous doesn't die).<br/><br/>The story of the Illiad, as mentioned, is only an episode in this grand epic of war and betrayal (and I must say that despite me thinking highly of Brad Pitt as an actor, he simply does not seem to bring out Achilles' wrath or sulkiness in this film). The theme of the Illiad is the wrath of Achilles and begins with Achilles and Agamemnon, the commander of the combined Greek forces, disputing over possession of the slave girl Briesis. As Achillies is not allowed to have her, he withdraws all of his forces from the war effort and prepares to set off home. However, his lover Patroclus (in the film he is Achilles' cousin, but in the legend they are homosexual lovers, something I feel Hollywood would have been too uncomfortable to portray in such a film) steals Achilles' armour and goes into battle, only to be killed by Hector, the Trojan champion. In a rage, Achilles goes to battle Hector, and wins, and then Priam, king of Troy, approaches Achilles and begs for the return of his son's body, and pretty much that is where the book ends.<br/><br/>I want to finish off though with a mention of Agamemnon. The writers, I believe, have done a very good job in developing the political manoeuvrings of the overking of Greece in this film. The ancient sources that we have of this mythological period of Greek history doesn't show the extent of Agamemnon's games that he plays to set himself up as king of the Grecian world. However it is very clear from this film that he is an imperialist, and that the war against Troy had little to nothing to do with him defending his brother's honour, and everything to do with him gaining power over the Aegean. Troy sits near the Borsophorous (opposite the Galipoli peninsula) and would have dominated this very strategic position. If Agamemnon were to control this region his influence could stretch across the Aegean and into the Black Sea. So, when an excuse to go to war with Troy arose, he took it.<br/><br/>However he does not live to see or even indulge in his conquests. In the film he is killed by Briesis, and in the Greek legend he is killed by his wife and her lover. The reason for his death in both stories is a woman. The Greek legend is because he brought Cassandra back, but also because he sacrificed his daughter, Iphigenia, so that they might have good winds to send them to Troy. However, the reasons behind his murder are complex, and it really does depend on which ancient author we read as to the reasons for his murder."
"Polonius85","6","1","2","10 January 2012"," Entertaining but irritating
","It's tough having majored in history, with a concentration on Ancient Greek and Near Eastern culture, and saying too much good about this movie. I do like it on one hand as it's action packed, has great fight scenes, and very good acting. The story moves along at a good pace and the characters are well done. It's an entertaining movie no doubt, and one that can be watched over and over and enjoyed.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Troy is about as much about the Iliad as The Crucible was about the Salem Witch Trials. This movie is really just a thinly veiled allegory about the Iraq War with a bunch of barbs thrown at then-President Bush (""Imagine a king that fights his own battles,"" and ""20 thousand men come to fight for one man's greed,""). The story of poor men forced to fight an unjust war under false pretenses for one corrupt leader's greed doesn't need a genius to unravel what point it's trying to get across.<br/><br/>Also included in the movie is the typical Hollywood disdain for religion. Every character who claims strong belief in the gods is shown to either be misguided, foolish, or vicious while Hector and Achilles, who claim they believe in the gods but largely scoff at them, are shown as wise and having the best grip on reality. The movie also throws a barb at the idea of afterlife, suggesting that the idea of a temporary, though flawed, existence is more attractive than the idea of living eternally, which Achilles claims would cause moments to lose their preciousness. The embrace of death and the devaluing of life is prevalent throughout. Whatever a viewer's personal philosophy is on religion, the world view shown in this movie is so far removed from Ancient Greek and Near Eastern thought that it's hard to take the movie seriously at many points.<br/><br/>It's already been discussed in many other reviews where the movie deviated from the original story, or which characters should have been more prominent, so I won't go into that. My issue with the movie was that the creators were unable to divorce from their own world view enough to create a more authentic setting. Even if the creators wanted to make a movie without the gods as characters, it could have been done if the world view was more accurate.<br/><br/>All that being said, I will conclude with the way I started: It's a fun movie that, if you turn off your intellectual side, you will enjoy."
"amritsikkim-167-68361","Null","1","2","22 September 2011"," Why are all Hollywood adaptations of Greek/roman epics homophobic?
","I was debating on whether on not to see this film for ages after seeing the generally bad reviews on the film, I finally succumbed and it was worse than my expectations. Why make a film on such a well known epic if you want to ignore it completely. I can understand if you make a modern adaption of the epic but to try and portray it as something actually based on the Iliad is pathetic! First of all the age is wrong, all historical accuracies are ignored and second of all the whole hinge of the story - the love between Achilles and Partoclus is completely rewritten. Achilles went mad with anger after the death of Partoclus and swore revenge for his death - not because he was his cousin but because he loved him! In fact the film reverses the whole text - it was Achilles who was the young one (still beardless as Homer puts it) and Partoclus who was older. In trying to understand everything under the lens of our modern understanding of sexuality we undermine the subtleties of ancient cultures. Achilles was not gay - no such term existed then - sexuality was fluid, you could love a man or a woman and still be considered 'normal' though in most cases you loved men when you were younger and went on to marry and have children as you got older, though there were exceptions and they were accepted too. In all new Hollywood adaptations of Greek myths, they tend to subvert this ancient understanding to fit modern terms and kill the context of it all. In 300 we are made to think that the Spartans defeated the Persians because of their ferocity while the fact is that 300 stood against an army of thousands because in ancient Sparta all soldiers were bound together with their lovers who fought bedside them and fought ferociously to defend each other. This is why Alexander wept when he visited the site of their massacre and called it the biggest testament to love that man has ever made.We change history to suit us and make it more comfortable to digest but in doing so we lose out in the wealth of understanding we can gain from their cultures. I hope soon 200 million will be spent to depict history as it was and not as some glorified video game."

","I've watched ""Troy"" again and again and I never get bored. It excites you from the first moment to the last. I believe that all of the actors were superb in every way and they gave their best shot being the heroes in the movie. As always I hardly understand the critics and their way of thinking and to be honest I don't care what other people think of a movie -critics or not. A movie is art, as is a book or a painting and art is always subjective regarding beauty, quality, entertainment etc. Probably there are some different points of view regarding what Homer has mentioned in his Iliad epic poem and what was actually seen in the movie, but that was the director's point of view and despite all, the key conclusion of the poem remains the same. And as other people mentioned here, I really liked the realism in the movie, without any actual presence of Gods. Achilles was like a semi-god in a very human, realistic way. ""Troy"" is another example not to blindly listen to any specific critics of supposedly movie experts (and how can an expert of any kind of art really advise me what I should like and what I shouldn't like?!?), so give it a chance -at least!"

They don't give good rating or write pretty bad thing about it. May be Troy doesn't give the exact historical event occurred, but who knows what really had happened, we just have bits and pieces of information. And why should someone be concerned about the depiction anyways as their is so much to see in this movie and brilliant acting by so many people, the movie is undoubtedly belong to genre epic, truly a best modern historical epics so far.<br/><br/>What I really loved about the director's cut, so many sequences were not in the theatrical version and when I saw then a lot of other things made more sense and now I am even bigger fan of this movie.<br/><br/>I do not have words to describe how huge the movie is in terms of production and design, screenplay, acting, music and especially dialogs.

","Based on the Greek tale, 'Troy' yearns to find success that has bestowed itself upon Gladiator, and it nearly accomplishes that task but yet it falls short.<br/><br/>The story is essentially based on a poem in which two armies go to war because of a woman, not just any woman the beautiful Helen, whose beauty made the God's drool. Troy is a film that tries to invoke the feeling that this is an epic story with great drama but I am unconvinced. The film has a whole host of talented actors yet they all seem to fail in giving a truly remarkable performance, then you have some of the weird accents, it's not entirely English nor American... One of the biggest flaws was Diana Kruger, I found her to be very wooden.<br/><br/>One aspect I did find quite entertaining was the fight sequences, when the fake Achilies goes to war, just a magnificent scene and the outcome...as well as Achilies and Hector's final fight, just brilliantly choreographed. Brad Pitt was probably one of the likable characters a man on the verge of being a 'hero', yet he questions himself and his allegiances with a corrupt King..Brilliantly done. <br/><br/>Overall a satisfactory attempt at bringing forth the tale of Troy, but rather overshadowed by the great Achilies."

","This is kind of a throwback - to the grand productions - like 10 commandments; Moses; Cleopatra..etc. But of course using CGI.<br/><br/>And you have the big stars, the impossibly grand dialogue, the not happening female roles, the war stand-offs, the one-on-one battles. Provided you have to see the extended version with the wandering dog beginning. <br/><br/>I like this and Kingdom of Heaven. So dusty, so macho that it is foolish. But it takes its time - that's the key. Not an impossible Sands of Time or Clash of Titans singly pacing tragedy like those. This has pace. Sure I laughed at some spots. But it is entertaining!!!!<br/><br/>And I like the background music, the detail cinematography. The audacity in attempting to convert a epic poem into some sort of reality.<br/><br/>The ending is kind of Ho-Hummmmmmmm with the Trojan Horse no less.

"StevePulaski","5","1","2","24 November 2010"," T(r)oying with the original story a bit too much
","When making a film based on Homer's timeless Epic called The Illiad comes forth a mass amount of potential. Great story, engaging characters, brutally intense fighting scenes, in depth costume design, accurate historical facts, and one hell of a love story are all things that should be in the 2004 Troy. Pretty much the only thing the film manages to be superior in is the costume design, while the rest of the film is occupied by semi developed, partially false character development, false information, and a poor computer generated army of a false number of warriors fighting to the death. What a letdown.<br/><br/>To be fair, Troy has upsides. The Trojan War is confusing because there are so many characters and you have to pay attention to detail which may be hard if your interest on the subject isn't too high. The Trojan War is a topic of some interest to me, but this movie was something I'd expect to be great and memorable. Sadly, I doubt a good Trojan War movie will come for quite sometime. After this big budget mediocre film I don't think people want to jump on The Trojan War wagon too soon.<br/><br/>In The Illiad, Paris gave Helen, the Goddess of beauty, an apple and took her away from her home of Troy which erupted a war that dragged on for many years. In the movie the same sort of thing occurs, but the nail that seals the coffin is that there are no Gods in the entire film. Sure occasionally someone will say ""May the Gods be with you"", but Zeus, Poseidon, and all the other Gods are never uttered by any character in this entire film. Director Wolfgang Peterson, to my knowledge, never gave a legitimate reason why he chose to make Gods absent from Troy. My guess is the story is already complicated enough and to add Gods in would confuse the average movie goer. Not to mention the fact that some characters personalities are combined into one in this film made for the good old ""composite character"" term so adding Gods to a complicated recipe will give spice no average Joe wants.<br/><br/>Some say it was best to exclude the Gods, but I say that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If you want to make a respectful adaptation you need to follow the original story line. I understand wanting to do your own thing, but when you tackle a monster sized project like this and you want to change things up, maybe you should make YOUR OWN version of the film, how you see it. Don't bring an unfaithful adaptation of one of the most famous stories of all time.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom aren't horrible in the film, but it's almost like their biceps were the true reason for their roles. Of course Achilles (Pitt) is known for his strength and strong fighting skills, but c'mon anymore abs in this film and it's the final Twilight film.<br/><br/>One last small annoyance of the film is the God awful exaggerated armies that consist of mostly CGI. When one watches the special effects bonus features, which are way more interesting than the movie, it shows how the film was made and how the effects came full. Clearly they were being lazy and added CGI armies in last. They used around 150 real guys and then when they sat at a computer screen they cloned the guys numerous times to create mass armies that are unrealistic anyway. If The Trojan War really did have these many soldiers it would be like twice the population of Greece at the time.<br/><br/>For what it's worth Troy is superior with it's costume design, but thats pretty much it. The five stars goes in the regard to some of the actors like Bloom, Pitt, Cox (Agamemnon), and the late and great Peter O'Toole (Priam) who is fantastic in pretty much everything and the costume design. The story could have lived up to be so much more. We could have been delivered a masterpiece war film with engaging characters, lighting fast fights, and a satisfying feel and memorable approach to The Trojan War. What we got was a forgettable, undone collage of rushed effects, and a miserable unidentified explanation to why the Gods are absent. Whoever said ""nothings perfect"" will no regret a syllable when they see Troy.<br/><br/>Starring: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Owain Yeoman, Brian Cox, Sean Bean, Julie Christie, and Peter O'Toole. Directed by: Wolfgang Peterson."
"FilmFanatic03","4","1","2","19 October 2010"," Yet again, another film with the look...but not the quality of acting!
","The only good thing about this film is the CGI effects, and to be honest, even they were not spectacular but they weren't rubbish so i guess i would say the CGI is really good. But the only thing that lets this film down is the hallow Brad Pitt. His character of Achilles is a Greek hero, instead Brad Pitt portrayed him as a cocky, shallow hero in an American accent! Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger were good in this film and acted better than Brad Pitt. The film was quite long as well and if a film not good then it seems long. Its like its between Gladiator and Clash of the Titans (but closer to Clash of the Titans that Gladiator) yet again, this is an example of a great concept put into the wrong hands and the focus can be seen to be put on the look and not the quality of the acting of the film."
"barbara-364","8","1","2","18 January 2010"," I saw the end first... now I've seen the whole film
","This film exceeded my expectations. I loved the recreation of Troy, the Greek ships (the thousand that Helen's face is supposed to have launched) and the full armour of the Greeks and the Trojans. I would have liked more at the beginning... Helen escaping Menelaus with Paris... Agamemnon enlisting the help of his neighbouring rulers and their armies. I also wanted to follow Odyssius home... Sean Bean is superb in the film. I would have liked a little more about Aeneas as well. This film could have two sequels. The Odyssey and The Aeneid. I look forward to them. For me, there were a few anomalies in the film. Helen lacked the charisma I expected... she should really have been stunning. I thought the bloke who played Achilles (Brad Pitt) played him a little moody and brutish for a super-hero, but, to be fair that was probably more to do with the film screenplay and direction than his acting. Because of this, I really wanted Hector to win the fight against him and all my sympathies were with the Trojans. I was quite pleased when Paris avenged his brother! Isn't it amazing that this ancient piece of writing is so compelling and well-described that the scenes in the film agreed with my imagination of them?... including the final flight from Troy. This is definitely a watch-again film... but it can continue... because Homer continued it with the Odyssey and Virgil followed the fortunes of Anaeas... these could make another two or three films!"
"frances59","4","1","2","29 September 2009"," I prefer the original cut...
","My wife and I just finished the director's cut of Troy and we were both greatly disappointed. None of the new footage was remotely interesting, save for the last scene which shows the refugees fleeing Troy after the city is destroyed. Honestly, most of the ""new footage"" was new cuts of old scenes where camera angles, dialog, and minor differences (i.e. dogs and (...)) are actually more annoying than helpful to the movie. The biggest problem however, lies in the soundtrack. One of the reasons that Troy was so good IMHO, was that the score hit the emotional chords so well. Almost the ENTIRE soundtrack was redone - and no way was this done by James Horner. The Achilles theme is gone, the Remembrance theme is barely heard, even Josh Groban's song is gone from the credits. Basically - the entire emotional content of the movie has been altered. I felt like I was watching the same movie (except for the quirky differences noted above) except the soundtrack had been replaced by ""generic war music"" put on random/repeat. I'm out of room on my review so I will just say this - keep to the original film at all costs. This is definitely not worth the double dip, and not worth it for all of the ""new"" footage."
"CherryBlossomBoy","6","1","2","1 August 2009"," To anybody that still wants to make a true ""Iliad"" movie
","In an episode of an Italian comic book series ""Alan Ford"" (a franchise largely unknown outside Italy and former Yugoslavia), a character tells a ""real story"" behind Trojan War. In that rendition Helen was a wasteful woman who led her husband, king Menelaus, to a brink of bankruptcy. When a naive Paris came to an embassy and began flirting with her, Menelaus saw it as a salvation for his treasury and even provided a ladder and the boat for the couple on the night of their ""escape"" to Troy. Paris happily introduced Helen to Trojan court, but once they realized there's no amount that woman can't spend they set to send her back to Sparta. Upon that news Menelaus raised an army and besieged Troy in order to prevent them doing so.<br/><br/>This is a humorous example of what happens when you take a mythological story and try to explain it through the means of common human behavior. Similar process occurred with the movie ""Troy"". The screenwriters chose to omit gods and supernatural influence that is the driving force of Iliad and went for an attempt to explain everything through ancient geopolitics and fight for power between protagonists.<br/><br/>That is perfectly valid thing to do, from a historian point of view, because the legend of Trojan War did have its base on some historical war that took place there. But in that case it's hard to incorporate heroes (portrayed in myths as demigods) and their extraordinary deeds in the story, and heroes and their deeds are crucial part of Iliad and plethora of other Greek myths. Achilles couldn't be the greatest warrior without the help of invisible shield of river Styx around his body, Paris wouldn't have seduced Helen without the help of Aphrodite and Troy wouldn't seem so doomed without Zeus, Athena and Hera determined to bring it down.<br/><br/>Of course, I have put things the other way around here. The Iliad and other stories did come after the actual war and gods were included as a sort of justification for the deed done. And great heroes of the war were immortalized and whatever they actually achieved in it was blown literally to mythical proportions. But, today, to translate Iliad verbatim to a big screen would make an interesting movie and certainly something people would want to see. There already were a pseudo- historical interpretation of the war filmed (or several of them), but never the actual poem and its surrounding apocryphal literature.<br/><br/>As far as the real-life interpretations go, ""Troy"" was quite good and fair. One might say that the screenwriters actually pulled it off. Everything from Helen's kidnapping through characterizations of various protagonists to eventual resolution was quite convincing, even without the presence of divine. Two characters stand out and are given a large chunk of screen time - Agamemnon and Achilles. Agamemnon was rightfully portrayed as a greedy warmongering tyrant (whoever is willing to sacrifice his own daughter for a mere safe passage of his navy to Troy cannot be otherwise). Achilles was also quite on par as a reluctant hero tired of life of constant fighting. His weakness here doesn't come from legendary heel but from his death wish. All in all I felt satisfied with how the script dealt with the motivations throughout.<br/><br/>The movie is largely well executed, the battles and fights spectacular and occasionally surprising, the dialog is often intelligent and poignant. Some things are not so good though. The music concept borrows heavily from ""Gladiator"" - how many times can we hear soothing female voice over a battle scene before it becomes corny? Also towards the end direction falls apart and the epilogue looks both rushed and cheap (as if the production ran out of both time and money). Overall ""Troy"" could have benefited from at least another extra hour and in the end it shows. Nevertheless, what we have here is a good piece of cinema, highly recommendable, better than many would acknowledge and certainly better than many recent movies of the sword and sandal genre. Yes, it's better than ""Gladiator"", so kill me. If anybody makes a new version with gods and powers, it will become sword and magic genre and I will be able to say it's better than ""Lords of the Rings"" in which case someone will kill me for sure."

","Anyone who is familiar with the famous works of Homer knows that his two greatest epics were the Iliad and the Odyssey. Troy is of course and adaptation of the former, and incidentally not my favorite.<br/><br/>As far as casting goes, I think the filmmakers got it right. I was certainly proud of them for getting Sean Bean as Odysseus, my favorite character in the bunch because of his intellect, cunning, and grander scale adventures in the story that follows.<br/><br/>Alas I knew that the movie was going to be a mess of action with some choice dialog here and there with no real understanding of who's on the side of right. After all, it was just a petty issue of jealousy that generated an onslaught of genocide. How is someone supposed to feel watching a bunch of people you know to be doomed or a horde of rivals that are unlikeable? I was really only interested in seeing Troy for the depiction of events I remember from the epic. With some artistic license, they truly got it spot on. I'm reminded of that adage, ""Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."" Whoever came up with that obviously wasn't a Trojan.<br/><br/>In the end I really wasn't cheering for the winning army because of their crafty maneuver to penetrate behind enemy lines. It was all-out slaughter at that point.<br/><br/>My final remaining hope is that through all this, I can hope to see a depiction of the Odyssey that was done as well as this. The technology and talent is certainly available."

","""Brad Pitt picks up a sword and brings a muscular, brooding presence to the role of Greek warrior Achilles in this spectacular retelling of 'The Iliad'. Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger play the legendary lovers who plunge the world into war, Eric Bana portrays the prince who dares to confront Achilles, and Peter O'Toole rules Troy as King Priam. Director Wolfgang Petersen recreates a long-ago world of mighty warships, clashing armies, the massive fortress city, and the towering Trojan Horse."" <br/><br/>Director Peterson does a good job keeping this long, big-budgeted epic rolling; especially, he is good with the chest-piercing battle scenes. The film's thesis; a more plausible, historically, version of the mythological ""Iliad"", is a good one - if only the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt hadn't burned, we'd know so much more about the era Although the film is beautifully produced, the computer generated ""look"" is, at times, distracting; don't look too carefully, for example, at those mighty warships.<br/><br/>During the picture, Brad Pitt was experiencing a second wave of mega-box office popularity; and, while his on screen presence undoubtedly thrilled millions, he is not entirely successful in the ""Achilles"" role. The camera treats Mr. Pitt as a drugstore paperback novel cover boy - with biceps and blond mane prominently displayed. He is obviously trying to essay the role, but Pitt most often looks to be simply posed. Consequently, the usually ultra-sexy Pitt appears almost sexless. Rose Byrne's ""Briseis"" helps, though <br/><br/>The more sexy story involves Orlando Bloom's ""Paris"" irritating big brother Eric Bana's ""Hector"" by taking Diane Kruger's ""Helen"" as his lover. Of the four ""hot"" young leads (if you count Pitt, Bloom, Kruger, and Bana), Mr. Bana comes off the best, with Ms. Kruger edging out Mr. Bloom as the prettiest. Peter O'Toole and a strong supporting cast look as good, if not better, than the stars. Worth checking out, for the spectacle (great art direction/set direction & costume design) - and for Eric Bana's acting one-upmanship.<br/><br/>******* Troy (2004) Wolfgang Petersen ~ Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana"

The script was as good as expected in putting 24 Illiad books into 3 hours to be shown to people who chances are do not know who Homer was. The acting was solid...Brad Pitt was Achilles thru and thru. The Illiad is mainly about Achilles rage, and in that sense it accomplished its deed.<br/><br/>* What did not work: (Besides the changing of the story: Agamemnon, Menelaus, Ajax do NOT die in Troy for example) One of the main points of the story is that MIND is stronger than STRENGTH... Thet it was Odysseus who unravels the frustration of the Greek inability to penetrate the Trojan walls. The Trojan horse is a small detail and because everything is shown as if ti was a 2 week Greek vacation, Odysseus genius and brilliance is lost in the process."

Stop doing it. You are bound to be disappointed.<br/><br/>I would mark Troy down though, because many of the actors attempted shoddy British accents, frankly - being British myself - I would rather they just did American cos they generally are really poor. But this is a minor issue really.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt steals this film for me. He really makes you relate to Achilles and pity him. I was really routing for him throughout the film. He portrays the anger and pain Achilles is obviously feeling excellently and I wouldn't change anything about his performance.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is a worthy addition to the cast but he doesn't really do much for the film as a whole as his scenes are short and he plays the character that everyone automatically dislikes; Paris. At the end he really comes through, and although you kind of hate him for what he does (you'll see what I mean) you begin to admire him.<br/><br/>There are some tear jerking moments so if you - like myself - cry at films a lot I would keep the tissue box nearby! <br/><br/>I can understand why Troy is not a 5 * film, but overall I think it's a really enjoyable film and worth watching!"

","Before I say anything let me say this: Troy was a very good film, one of the best movies in an ancient setting I've ever seen. The battles were very entertaining, costumes were excellent, acting was decent and the story was almost spot on (a few characters met their ends inaccurately but its Hollywood, I'll let it go) my only problem with the movie was, they tried to fit an extremely long story with dozens and dozens of characters, into a film 2 hours and 45 minutes long. The story of the Trojan War, which is a 10 year long struggle, is a very exciting story if you like ancient mythology. The Illiad, which only tells of the ninth year of the war, could be a movie in itself. I would have liked it much better had they done it in a 8-10 part mini-series, much in the same way they did with 'Rome' (which was brilliantly done) This would have allowed them to include more characters (the famous charioteer Diomedes, the rest of the several Trojan Princes, Memnon of Ethiopia and dozens of others)It also would have allowed them to include other parts of the story such as Achilles battles with Memnon and Penthesilea the Amazonian Queen. It could be just me... but I think the story would have been much better done as a mini-series, but that does not necessarily mean Troy, was by any means, a bad movie. <br/><br/>8/10"

The character he plays is believable, a guy who uses his good looks image to make everyone idolize his ego and the ""Larger than life soldier"" that he portrays.

","Troy opened up with some music, a little too heavily synthesized, building up tension between two humongous armies approaching each other. The suspense comes to a halt in an anticlimactic moment, as the all-powerful king cracks a joke. He then persuades his opponent to have their respective armies' best soldier fight each other rather than a more traditional all-out battle to spare bloodshed and gore. This is another anticlimax of sorts, we expected a big all-out fight and now we're not getting one, and now the squeamish people in the audience who don't like to see a bloody battle can feel relief. Within seconds, the next clever plot twist arrives, as we find our hero, Achilles, who we're looking forward to seeing because he's played by A-lister Brad Pitt, is actually missing from the battlefield because he had a wild night of passion and overslept, but he wakes up and goes out to the battlefield, where awaiting us are plot twists #4, that Brad Pitt is not as friendly as we thought he'd be, and #5, that the cocky guy twice his size is really no match for him.<br/><br/>Within five minutes, every trick in the book has been used and while it's unoriginal, those gimmicks might have worked in other circumstances, but here, they felt like a half-desperate attempt to make sure that any and every mainstream viewer would be hooked onto this film. The original story of Troy, just wasn't gonna cut it, the producers probably thought. It's too long-winded, too complicated, these people regularly talk and interact with Gods, who would go for that? So the producers gave us a more Americanized version.<br/><br/>When rallying his troops to war, Prince Hector cries, ""no men, we all love our families, we all love our country, and we all love our Gods"", which sounds just like how the president would address soldiers today, making the audience think, ""oh, I was originally not sure if I'd like this boring Greek story, but these characters are so universal and I can relate to them,"" but the truth is that those characters weren't relatable, because, yes they might have had some love for family or for country, but they're love for their Gods was much stronger and incredibly different than our love of Gods today. Not only did they believe in more than one God, but they weren't abstract beings from an unknown place in the sky, they regularly came down and interacted with the humans, they were recognizable detailed beings with different attributes and they didn't all like each other, not did they like all of the humans equally. In the Illiad, the gods Apollo and Athena are even rooting for the Trojans to win the war and actively help control the turn of events. In fact, Achilles is half-God himself, that's why he can run so fast. These parts of the story were vaguely referenced but ultimately left out to spare confusion.<br/><br/>I really didn't get what the point was of digging up and adapting a Great work of Greek literature of they were going to strip it of it's Greekness. If I wanted to see great special effects, I could have gone to The Day After Tomorrow, but I chose to see this because of the cultural context of this story, where Gods were more numerous and warriors had a different place in society. This is definitely part of a trend that echoes our new global era in politics, where barriers between countries are being lowered and people around the world are discovering they have a lot in common. At the same time, though, our differences in cultures over history should be celebrated too, and it's a more worthless experience when the makers of this film chose to leave out those cultural quirks.<br/><br/>I also think another force in play, which isn't the film's fault, necessarily, is how tightly all the big-budget films are released within one summer. Ten years ago, Forrest Gump opened in the summer of '94 and made 24,000 in its opening weekend, taking the #1 spot, dropped only 1.3% percent the next weekend, and was the #1 movie 6 weekends of that year. Troy, opened only 5 days before a highly anticipated Shrek, which made an eye-popping $125 million by weekend's end. Troy cost 175 million to make, so in order to make its money back it had to attract audiences attentions, and I think the filmmakers were under so much pressure to make that return that they made a safer picture with surefire widespread appeal, which deprived of us of what could have been a great movie.<br/><br/>I don't know how this could be fixed, but it's a clear sign that the onslaught of new summer blockbuster after blockbuster, each one displacing the one before it as #1, is taking its toll on the quality of films.<br/><br/>Sorry to drift into a tangent there, so back to the film. I still gave it 3 and a ½ stars, because once I accepted the Americanized road I was traveling on, I could enjoy the film's dramatic moments, the cinematography and, with the exception of Orlando Bloom, a first-rate ensemble. Homer wrote an incredible story, so it was hard not to be moved, and I have heard an argument that this Americanized version has encouraged viewers to read the book and culturally enhance themselves. I just think that the film, if it stuck to its roots, could have been better."

","Loads of high-adrenaline entertainment that was put together brilliantly on screen in some of the best choreographed battles in cinematic history. Was it just me, or did Kruger have a different accent in every scene? Plus...just a really awful performance on every level, though I think the same applies to Bloom. Other than that I thought acting-wise it was pretty well done, particularly from the beautiful Rose Byrne. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt were very intense and perfectly embodied the legendary soldiers that were superior to entire armies. The film was a little...overexaggerated (which was a good and bad quality, depending on the situation) even when it comes to the grand war that it was and some of the dialogue is too cheesy to stand for the most part. The choreography was beautiful, and I found a morbidly poetic sensation during the invasion of Troy. Perhaps the thousands of soldiers silently charging across the sand gave me this feeling. The ideas of getting rid of the Gods direct involvement and making Achilles an unstoppable badass added a lot to the film, especially in terms of entertainment which seemed to be Petersen's main priority (if it wasn't, then uh oh)."

","It is a good movie, Wolfgang did a great job. I loved the sound effects music and the scenes of war. The actors were all great, but I was disappointed to see Paris and Helen playing secondary roles, the whole war started because of them. I need to go back to Homer to find out if he mentions anything about Paris being a coward. I loved Hector and his wife it shows the greatness of the family when united with love. The human part in this movie was really great for instance even Achillus showed mercy. It reflects also the sinful nature of man who is destined to kill fall despite the good that still resides in him. Its a great movie in showing the conflict between the duty and love, between the honor and love of one's own country on one side and the greed of others on the other side. Between the will of man and his submission to a higher authority (Hector to his father).<br/><br/>NB this the first time i come to our site and its due to Troy because I wanted to know more about this great movie."
"alanhuff","9","1","2","3 April 2005"," An epic like none seen in years.
","I really liked this movie. I'm not a real Brad Pitt fan but his performance here is quite remarkable and he makes Achilles a living, believable, sympathetic character who bears many characteristics of Homer's original -- brooding, spoiled and petulant and with an innate nobility that cannot be denied. Eric Bana's Hector is finely drawn and also worthy of praise and sympathy. He loyally fights for his country and king, defends his amoral, cowardly brother and knows he's going to his death when he faces Achilles but honor demands it. Sean Bean's Odysseus is a gem, as he manipulates Achilles to do Agamemnon's dirty work, not really liking what he's doing but realizing that the future of Greece (not just Agamemnon or any other king)depends on destroying Troy. However, Peter O'Toole's performance as Priam is the best of any in the film. His confrontation with Achilles to recover Hector's body is the high point of the film and then watching it dawn on Achilles what a dishonorable and reprehensible act he has committed is worth the price of admission. The rest of the cast is competent -- Helen is beautiful and so is Paris (as a guy I can't see the attraction of Orlando Bloom though). Agamemnon, Ajax, Menelaus and the rest are portrayed with admirable gusto. The character of Briseis is well done especially when refusing to let Achilles fight over her. The final confrontation between Paris, Briseis and Achilles puts a really interesting twist on the Achilles' heel myth.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a thoroughly enjoyable epic the likes of which has not be seen in a long time. Why quibble that it isn't really the way Homer wrote it (after all, it's called Troy, not The Iliad). It actually presents some interesting interpretations of what may really have happened as opposed to what has survived from Homer after 3200 years. I certainly give it a hearty 9."

I was glad that there weren't many sex scene's and I liked how the director and writer took a story that we had probably studied in school and heard of from time to time and this movie took that story and expanded it. Through out the movie it also explained some sayings such as Acheailles heel. This is a very entertaining movie and it had a story, which you have to be careful with action movies. Sometimes they are solely based on war and fighting. The ending was good and you didn't know how you wanted the ending to end because i think most of us were voting for Troy, but then there was Brad Pitt from the Greeks, who of course you didn't want to die either. I was pleased with the ending and the whole movie. And did anyone notice how fir Bradd is??"

Homer was blind, and he died many years ago, whats he gonna care if they change his story around a bit and into a movie that if he was alive today he wouldn't even be able to see. 2. How do you know that after thousands of years the illiad hasn't changed in several places. Try telling a story to someone and have them pass it on and see how much it changes at the end. 3. This movie is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable movies that I've seen that is at the length of 3 hours. I mean, come on, what other movie can you see that had a man kill a 7 foot body-builder in one stab. 4. If your a female viewer you'll like the fact that it has actors such a Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom, and I your a male viewer you'll like that Helen and some of the other women are quite beautiful. 5.

"FloatingOpera7","7","1","2","24 February 2005"," Hollywood Takes On Homer
","The ancient Greek epic has been tackled on film before. During the wake of television, big sandal-and-sword epics were made to draw back audiences to the movie theaters. Today, big epics are little more than curiosity films. This version of Homer's Iliad is pure Hollywood. There is no accuracy to the original legends and even worse some things have been changed. Brad Pitt makes an unconvincing Achilles- cast simply because he's Brad Pitt, a sex icon. One would have hoped Wolfgang Petersen cast ""The Rock"" wrestler Wayne something or other or Kevin Zorbo who portrayed Hercules in the 90's series. But there are moments when Brad Pitt captures the spoiled, arrogant and military attitude of Achilles. I would say he is doing the best job of the bunch, despite the miscast. Helen as a willing participant in her own abduction is accurate, at least. But she and the other women in the film are simply prizes to be won and objects of beauty. The story is mostly about the men of the age- Achilles, the greedy and imperious prick King Menelaus, Hector and King Agammemnon. There is much license taken from the actual legends. It moves too fast and for one thing Briceis was never a true love of Achilles- simply one of his last ""war prizes"". She kills Agammemnon when it's supposed to be someone else in the original epic, I believe his wife Clymanestra who had taken on a new lover.<br/><br/>Even if the content is glamorized or romanticized, the visuals and cinematography are incredible. The look of the film is great. The big crowd scenes, battle scenes, the city of Troy, the Trojan Horse, the temples with statues of the gods, all very great touches. The gods, though, never interfere themselves with this war, though in the Iliad they were a strong part of the war, even championing both sides. For fans of epics like this this is a terrific movie. Brad Pitt as Achilles is acceptable dramatically, especially in his scene with Peter O'Toole. That scene is the best that both men have done so far. Troy was the more successful of the recent ancient epics, among them Alexander which failed. Making a special appearance as Achilles' mother is veteran British actress Julie Christie, who once portrayed Lara in Doctor Zhivago. This is a very action-packed and even violent film, but at the time it was paired with Passion Of The Christ and so probably no one noticed. But it's a film to be viewed by young adults or mature audiences."
"sweetiesadie","7","1","2","6 February 2005"," To answer who Briseis is
","Kate1148 wanted to know who Briseis is based on. If I remember correctly, she's based on *herself* even though her very small part in the book has been stretched into a full fledged character in the movie. The story of the Iliad is driven by Achilles' wrath. This wrath is directed against Agamemnon and caused by the fact that he took spoils of war away from Achilles and this included Briseis. The difference between the book and the movie is that Achilles doesn't care about the girl in the book (she is his *prize* that he feels he is owed) vs. in the movie where she is turned into a love interest. If I also remember correctly, Patroclus and Achilles are friends not cousins in the book and there is an intimacy implied that goes beyond friendship. This is probably a reason why Briseis was made into what she was, because in the Iliad if there was any 'romantic interest' for Achilles it was probably Patroclus. <br/><br/>I agree that many things in the book have been changed like Agamemnon's premature death, the length of the war, the addition of the Trojan horse, a lot of characters are cut out or their parts are greatly reduced and the removal of the physical presence of the gods (which I think is the largest change). That said, I think this is still a good movie. A lot of liberties were taken but that's to be expected. I understand why some of them were taken for a cinematic version."

Her relationship with Achilles followed the Iliad for the most part (many of the details were omitted, but were not really necessary to tell the story of the relationship).<br/><br/>It was, in short, one of the best epic films to come along in years.

"julie-269","9","1","2","31 January 2005"," fabulous version recreates events that made the myth
","This movie, based on The Iliad, portrays how the Greeks felt and what they believed about their gods as well as there loves, lusts and desire to leave some kind of legacy. One scene accurately depicts the inner conflict a man might have about war, power, destiny Vs home, family, peace. Achilles' mother tells him that if he stays away from this war, he will marry and raise children and be remembered for many generations but if he goes, she will never see him again and he will be remembered...forever. And she is right..<br/><br/>The basic story is that Agamemnon, a king of kings, has conquered many nations but wants more. So when Paris, the younger prince of Troy, steals his brother's wife, Helen, Agamemnon uses this excuse to set his sights on conquering Troy.<br/><br/>He has used the mercenary, Achilles, to fight many battles although Achilles' impudence annoys him greatly. They arrive on the beaches of Troy but Achilles refuses to fight unless Agamemnon acknowledges that his power rests with the lives of his soldiers and, especially, on Achilles so they are quickly turned back from Troy's mighty walls by the archers under the command of Hector, Paris' brother and Troy's true champion.<br/><br/>The priests incite the king of Troy to fight against the Greeks further and this instigates a battle in which Achilles' cousin is killed by Prince Hector because he is dressed in Achilles armor. Achilles kills Hector to revenge his cousin's death and thus, the ultimate destruction of Troy is set in motion, for inside Hector beat the heart of the true Trojan- not the religious king or philandering younger prince.<br/><br/>The invaders pretend to leave a gift for their god on the beach and pull back to hide and wait. The foolish king ignores his remaining son's advice to burn the giant wooden horse and instead listens to the priests and brings it inside to the god's temple. He has unknowingly given the enemy safe passage through the mighty wall and the men inside the horse destroy the archers on the wall and let in their companions to burn and sack the city. Paris flees with the women but he does fatally wound the great Achilles, whose death will finally bring him peace.<br/><br/>The king of Troy, who obviously loves his sons and Troy greatly, always defers to the priests of the gods he worships- and at great price to his sons and his country. To give him credit, he believes Troy has always been protected and honored due to his gods' protection. The movie makes it obvious that he should have given his honor to the soldiers who fought and died for Troy instead.<br/><br/>Achilles shows disdain for the gods and for kings, who he believes sit back and make decisions that cause other men to die and suffer. The virgin priestess who has dedicated her life to serving the invisible gods tries to defend them to Achilles but loses her own inner battle and falls for this very visible and virile man instead. Achilles tells her, ""I'll tell you a secret. The gods envy us,"" and we believe him.<br/><br/>The movie brings out clearly that what the men of Greece believed about their gods motivated them to act the way they did. The soldiers believed themselves to be ordinary men at the mercy of power-hungry kings and the condescending gods. I like the fact that the gods are not in the movie. This makes the movie seem more like what we think was the real story behind the myth of the Iliad than an adaptation of the Iliad itself.<br/><br/>Paris was a ladies' man. Indeed, as Helen tells him after his embarrassing defeat at the hands of her husband, a woman would prefer her man to do as he did and choose to live instead of keeping his pride and dying. A woman cannot hold a ghost. Yet a woman could not be proud of such a man and we do not like Paris much.<br/><br/>Hector was the real hero. A man who loved his family and fought for his country. Even when he knew they were wrong, no matter how many times he tried to warn them unsuccessfully to take another course of action- he was first and up front to fight for them. Having made arrangements for the safety of his family, he fights bravely and dies the true hero of Troy.<br/><br/>And this brings out a point the movie makes very well. Throughout the movie you see ordinary men, soldiers, carving small wooden toys for their children. Guts and glory are not on their minds although they are being forced to fight. They fight because they love their children and their wives and they get through their battles by thinking of the ones they really love, their real legacy. In this way, the movie seems to bring honor to soldiers without glorifying war.<br/><br/>War is not glorious. It is caused by a few and brings grief to many. But the soldiers, the men who fight for their country and their families are heroes. They are not glory hounds who want to be remembered forever but they make it possible for us to live in peace and freedom for generations to come... and so they are remembered.<br/><br/>I hope that this movie will make you want to read the book. The Iliad, is a classic and I'm glad it has inspired yet another generation of men."

","And I thought that the people writing about Halle Berry's ""Catwoman"" were defensive.<br/><br/>It seems to me that we have several camps of critics reviewing this film. Mr. Ebert represents this film as an insult to Homer and a bastardization of a legendary piece of literature. Others complain about the screen time that Brad Pitt has as Achilles. Let's just address these two issues for now.<br/><br/>First, let's admit that Homer's work is based on legend and that most legends have at least SOME basis in fact. I think that Petersen does a pretty good job of filming a story that may have been the basis for the legends: The siege of Troy lasts several weeks, but is soon exaggerated to 10 years. Achilles is the greatest warrior, but is mortal like everyone else and dies in a manner that gives birth to legends about his parentage. The war itself is built on the pretext that Agamemnon is upholding Greek honor after Helen is stolen, while actually providing the excuse he needs to expand his kingdom. What's wrong with that? At least Petersen isn't depicting blue-painted Pict women fighting alongside the men.<br/><br/>Second, Achilles IS a major character. He was a major character in Homer's poem and is a major character of Greek mythology. But I really don't think that he gets that much more screen time than do Hector and Paris. He's egotistical, a braggart, and a vicious fighter, all qualities I would expect in a famous warrior. Virtually all films ""based on events"" must focus on one or two individuals. Otherwise, you end up with ""The Longest Day,"" where all the characters enter and leave in just a few minutes.<br/><br/>Now, I do have some criticisms. Whereas Petersen tries hard to stay realistic about in portraying the basis for the legend, I think he makes a mistake in depicting ""a thousand"" Greek ships. After all, just beaching the ships with minimum spacing between them would take over 4 miles of beach.<br/><br/>I give this film *** out of *****."
"BirdmanT7","Null","1","2","9 January 2005"," ""Troy isn't a story of heroes and villains, its view of human nature, war, anger, and revenge.""
","As we all know ""Troy"" was recently released on DVD, and for those of us who missed it on the big screen (like myself) we really missed out on a great film.<br/><br/>I am now amazed as to why this film got so much negative reviews when it was released?!. It's far superior film compare to ""Gladiator"" which was just awful. Again here on IMDb there are more negative reviews, I really wonder what are you people comparing this film to?..how many films like these are made in Hollywood today?. Troy isn't a story of heroes and villains, of good triumphing over evil, but of flawed, selfish men locked in a deadly struggle in which there can be no winners, only losers. In contrast to Gladiator, which celebrated revenge and vilified its antagonist, Troy sees in the pursuit of vengeance only tragedy and deceit, and its one great occasion of nobility is a heartbreaking moment of shared humanity between sworn enemies. <br/><br/>Maybe the director and the writer didn't or couldn't do Homer's ""The Iliad"" the way it was written. Homer's cast of characters Â— Zeus, Aphrodite, and other luminaries of the Greek pantheon are missing. Offended purists should note that Director Petersen's is not the first recounting of the Trojan War to tell the story from a mortal point of view; Shakespeare did the same centuries ago. No good movie about the Trojan war has ever actually been made, even at the height of Hollywood's sword-and-sandal period. Lots of things can go wrong in a sword-and-sandal picture, and many of them did in Robert Wise's 1953 Helen of Troy, probably the most notable previous cinematic stab at the tale other than TV version of ""Helen of Troy"" which wasn't that bad but still doesn't even come close to TROY.<br/><br/>For one thing, the screenplay by David Benioff retains the basic contours of the established story. That's not to say important liberties aren't taken, but on the whole major plot points are preserved. This applies not just to the two elements everybody remembers, the Trojan horse and Achilles' heel (though Achilles' heel is not actually from Homer), but also to such plot points as the falling-out of Achilles (Brad Pitt) and Agamemnon (Brian Cox) over Achilles' Trojan comfort woman Briseis (Rose Byrne); a critical sequence in which one soldier is mistaken for another; and an eerily topical incident involving the abuse of an enemy soldier's dead body. Just as important, key themes and outlooks common to various stories from Homer to Shakespeare carry over into the film, including a tragic view of human nature, war, anger, and revenge. <br/><br/>Many of the battle scenes are riveting, especially a dramatic early scene involving a spectacular stunt and the bravura showdown between Achilles and Hector (Eric Bana), one of the best duels I've ever seen. The drama is engaging; unlike Gladiator, which expected us to root for the hero, Troy asks us only to appreciate the characters' conflicts and situations. And Peter O'Toole as the Trojan king Priam steals the entire film with one single scene with Brad Pitt' it was probably the most emotional part of the film. <br/><br/>So we can all sit back and complain how bad this film was made and how it failed, and never really take into consideration that for a Blockbuster Hollywood film (which is only focused on making money)this film managed to deliver on both levels. How many films of this scale do that in a year? or in a decade?. We all want Hollywood to make more epic films like these and because of the historic or nostalgic value of it, at least TROY managed to achieve something which is very essential in our time..... war, anger, and revenge..sounds familiar?."

","Before I start my review I must confess that I haven't read Homer's ""The Illyad"", but from what I can gather, the epic poem reads a lot better than this movie. I found TROY very confusing; I think that rooting for one character would help, but you end up feeling pity for Achilles (Brad Pitt), who is portrayed as a ruthless, heartless mercenary, hellbent on being ""THE"" warrior. At the end, you don't feel any sorrow nor pity for anyone...you kind of wish everyone dies, which they eventually do so. The scenery, the CGI fx and the overall acting is OK, although I have my doubts about Brad Pitt's casting...he's just ""too"" Hollywood, if you get my meaning. Still, he gets the job done with a decent performance. Eric Bana does great as Hector. Another miscast would be Orlando Bloom as Paris, Hector's kid brother. I think we've seen enough of Mr.Bloom in other ""Epic"" pictures...his agent should try to diversify his client's movie offers. For a moment, I thought I was going to get a GLADIATOR 2 kind of movie. It is similar (due to the period setting and overall feel), but where as GLADIATOR was wise and had a rapid pace, this one is slow and contrived. Again, I think I should read Homer's poem. Nice movie if you plan to rent a DVD on a Sunday night (by the way, TROY is already out on DVD here in Mexico and NO, it's not a bootleg!!!)7* out of 10."
"kungfu_babe22","Null","1","2","25 November 2004"," The story was all wrong!
","I saw this film as I have studied Classics at school and wanted to see how the film portrayed the war in itself and the various events. I was annoyed by the inaccuracy of much of the film. As a past student of Classics much of my A-Level course was focused on the Trojan War, the Aeneid and plays that told of the characters in this story.<br/><br/>The film itself was directed very well and there were some good actors. It seemed to me that this was just a piece of normal storytelling not a great epic. It most certainly was not a great epic film. As I knew the story beforehand of several of the characters I expected to see what i knew but I didn't.<br/><br/>There were several things wrong. Men die in the story when in fact they left the war unscathed. At the beginning of the film Menelaus is killed. This is untrue as Menelaus left after the 10 years with Helen again after Paris had been killed and Agamemnon did not die in the heat of battle as his wife kills him later on as seen in the play ""Agamemnon"" by Aeschylus after he had returned with the sister of Paris and Hector, Cassandra. She was killed too. Achilles is killed outside the walls of Troy in ""the shade of the Scaean Gate"" by Paris with a poisoned arrow which struck him in the heel (at birth Thetis, mother on Achilles, had dipped him in the river Styx to make him immortal but had held him by his heel so his heel wasn't protected by power) but in the film he was killed inside the city, which was wrong. I did like the appearance of Aeneas at the end with his elderly father Anchises.

Menelaus (Gleeson) is furious. Menelaus goes to his brother, king of the kings Agamemnon (Cox), and demands that entire Greece goes to war with Troy. Agamemnon, who himself long has wanted to annex Troy into his Greece is glad to oblige. So, the greatest army ever seen, including the great warrior Achilles (Pitt) and his friend and king Odysseus (Bean), sets sail across the Egeian Sea. However, Achilles and Agamemnon does not get along and the army of Troy, lead by it greatest warrior, prince Hector is triumphant, for a start.<br/><br/>This is a legendary and classic story put into a movie. So there is bound to be some parts that has to be cut or changed to fit into to the movie format. However, I think they have succeeded very well. The story is coherent, although there are few surprises due to that the general story is well known. The effects and detail are very good. A few scenes breathtakingly beautiful. I have the scene with the armada in mind for example. There are good fights, both man versus man and army versus army. There is love, shame and honor. There is death. The characters are beautiful and the cast is made up of famous actors and actresses. The dialog is not all that bad, even if it sometimes become a little too focused in producing dramatic one-liners. As I see it there are only one flaw, and it is not really anyones fault. Nearing the end, Paris pick up the bow instead of sword in the fighting. This, unfortunately brings Legolas into mind, and it feels kind of out of place. Anyhow, all in all a great epic adventure!<br/><br/>9/10"
"dragon_x","8","1","2","17 August 2004"," An epic story and a timeless human tragedy
","I just saw this movies with some friends at the local cinema and draft house. Maybe it was the good beer or food, but I do like this movie. <br/><br/>The story was epic and tragic. It is an excellent and timeless story. It is vile and violent and gory, but then that is a battle. I thought Achilles was well played by Pitt. I think most people disliked the acting in this film, but I feel it was on the mark. Achillies is the ultimate warrior and lord. He bows to no kings and respects very few of them. He fights because he knows his name will live on and he feels he is above all. He is a better warrior and never met his match on the field. So he is arrogant and at times petty and his voice and actions reflect this. Yet he does find his match, not on the field, but in his tent with a maiden of the enemy and a King with no fear. Achilles heal is not his weak point - it was the realization that 'his king' the Greek King was the lesser of the two and Achillies was not above peace or love.<br/><br/>I would imagine this is the essence of the story and the movie captured this well. Although have not read the books (by Homer) I do like the fact that the producers shorted this war to a few weeks. I think was also the correct choice to have the 'gods' on the side. This makes the story that much more human and real.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS AHEAD *** ;-)<br/><br/>I do think that the acting was good, yet they did not need a lot of acting... you could say it was a bit spartan ;-) I also had lots of Tolkien flashbacks. Of course Orlando Bloom as the masterful bow wielding Legolas and then as the masterful bow wielding Paris seems kind of odd, but then it does follow the story as I know it (both of them). I did not realize Michael Bean was playing a King of Greece or even in this movie. He kept saying brother ... and this was what was said in the extended version of the Two Towers. The movie also cut a lot from the book (much like Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings movies), though I do not think what was cut was important and in fact I think this did the story more justice for today's world.<br/><br/>As for my complaints - I did think some of the other Kings lines were a bit over done and underdeveloped. I do not remember any quotes, but then they were mostly forgettable or expected. They either hit the bar or lowered it. Maybe that is simply because the Greek kings were more warrior barbarians than the King of Troy? Or maybe they could have made the script and acting a bit better on the Greek side.<br/><br/>My final complaint is that they showed plenty of warrior cleavage - mostly Achilles. I realize that the Greeks and many of the ancients were proud of their bodies. They had little modesty and little reason to be modest. It seems odd, however that the women seem more modest than the men... so I think this would have been more realistic to show more of the ladies and women in the film. They hinted here and there, but it was barely a tease. The women were definitely 'supermodel' class with (it seems) few of the hangups and bad connotations. You could say one of the ladies started a war, yet this seems only as an excuse or pretext for invasion. Agamemnon thought he could take Troy - since he never lost before and he had the might of all of Greece... <br/><br/>As beautiful as Helen is in the picture, Hectors wife is more beautiful in different ways. Hector's cousin (Polydora) was the strongest of the bunch - this was mostly a man's war, but she nearly turned the tide and she fought when there was no hope and she fought for peace. This earned Achillies respect and eventually lead to his downfall. Maybe the lack of female cleavage was to keep the ratings where the producers wanted them, but it was a mistake for the movie. Clearly the women and men were both immodest and this should have been reflected :-).<br/><br/>In the end the Trojans lost because of their 'gods'. The princes of Troy advised wisely and correctly (both Hector and Paris) yet the King decided to take the course of this advisers and the 'will of the gods'. The greeks exploited these traits and won. So the Greeks won the war, but it was a costly victory - so costly they may lose their nation.<br/><br/>The story gets a 10 overall. It was not perfect, but I think they did better for our times. Homer had his times, he gets a 9 :) The cast was great - except all the Tolkein flashbacks ... so they get a 9. The acting was OK, better than I expected, but not as good as it could have been. That gets a 7.<br/><br/>Overall my weighted average is an 8."

","When I first saw the poster and read the title, I frowned. I honestly thought this would be a major dive. But when I saw it, I was immediately captivated by the opening lines by Sean Bean, who plays Odysseus.<br/><br/>It was an excellent done movie: emotional, gripping, action packed, romantic...very few humorous lines, but this was supposed to be a serious film, not a comedy. The tension breakers weren't in the lines, but the scenes that showed how these people lived apart from fighting.<br/><br/>I was pleased with Brad Pitt and how he portrayed his character, as well as Eric Bana. Sean Bean and O'Toole did an superb job as well. O'Toole kinda freaked me out in some of his shots and he played a wonderful father when he confronted Archilles for the return of his dead son's body.<br/><br/>I'm glad that the gods were NOT involved in this story. It would have ruined it and have turned it into a comedy. I'm glad they didn't make it exactly according to the Illiad, how they switched some things. They BASED it ON the Illiad, not repeated the poem word for word. <br/><br/>They didn't make Archilles a god because what's the fun in that? The fun is knowing how a man, BLESSED by the warlords, could be so great. They made us see that he was a human that loved just like us (Archilles love for Brisies). It shows us how love for a person makes us do drastic things, things we would usually never do (examples are Paris and his fight against that big dude--sorry, I forgot his name but it's Helen's husband. And Archilles leaving a battle because of Brisies. Priam's love by going into the enemy's territory to regains his son's remains.) We're not supposed to dwell on how different the movie is compared to the book; we're supposed to just sit back and enjoy a movie that was inspired by a battle that happened 3,000 years ago, that most people didn't know of until now.<br/><br/>It takes a lot of talent and ability to make a movie that is incredibly close to everyone's imagery of the book. And I think that Wolfgang did an awesome job of it. Not everyone's imagery is the same, but he tried his best.<br/><br/>I loved Troy, I've seen it twice in theaters and I would continue to see it more and support its grossings if the money in my wallet could keep refilling itself. And credit cards only go so far. <br/><br/>TROY was beautifully written, beautifully portrayed. Some people have complained how they shot the movie, making many grounds shots that rose to look at the walls of Troy and made it look magnificent. And really, that's what Troy was. The walls had never been breached. It was were a man could gain 'immortality' according to Archilles. This movie was letting us see the last of Troy's beauty because after that battle, Troy was no longer a city that had never been breached, it was just another city that came under the rule of another greedy man. <br/><br/>Troy is a movie that shows that humans haven't changed in their ambitions, their love, their greed, their honor and pride. How we haven't changed in making right decisions and wrong decisions, how everything still has a cause-and-effect and how short life really is. They show us how weak the human body is, how beautiful life is because we are doomed. It makes the characters so realistic that you feel as if you actually KNOW these characters. <br/><br/>I was overall impressed with this movie and I really encourage others to see it. It's a lot better than most war movies; this shows the things that happen when the battles aren't being fought. This shows what that these soldiers were actually people, who had families and sons and daughters, families that we chose to forget to make a better movie, because it's easier to see men who we know nothing of die, then to see men that had just carved a little wooden horse for his son die. We're reminded how despite being called different names, having different blood, that we are all the same, that we loved and lived. <br/><br/>Really, go see this movie, it's NOT a WASTE of money."

","The first time I saw this film, I thought it was too long and boring. Too much of actors staring into the horizon & other places, pointless filming of inanimate objects etc.. But on my second viewing, it seemed perfectly rounded, and I really got to appreciate the details in the dramatic scenes, battle scenes and production design. This is one of the few films I have seen that actually got better on second viewing. In my opinion, Sean Bean gives the best performance here, with his fine underplaying of Odysseus. I was on holiday in Greece recently, and I discussed the film with a Greek person. He thought that many details from Homers poem had been badly distorted. The same has been written in many other comments here.<br/><br/>But in the end credits, it says that it is inspired by The Iliad, not copied from it. As for the comments saying that the Greeks take the Trojans by surprise in the film, what is that about? Trojan archers are on the beach when the ships are sighted. Others are sharpening timber and pointing them towards the shoreline as some kind of defense. Hector doesn't know the exact hour the Greeks are coming, but he has definitely prepared the army for battle. I recommend you see this several times, I have seen it 6 times in a theater."

"tjcclarke","Null","1","2","15 June 2004"," Trojan Triumph
","I consider myself fairly well read, but I must confess to never having waded through a Homer epic. Indeed, before last week my knowledge of Greek mythology in general was hazy to say the least. I knew a bit about the Iliad, some bird called Helen, and never looking a gift-horse in the mouth, but that's about it. After close-on three hours watching Wolfgang Petersen's Troy, I am not really any the wiser (aside from learning that the Achilles fellow slept in the buff and Trojan Prince Paris had ongoing facial hair issues). <br/><br/>But that's not really the point of Troy: Hollywood epics rarely let anything as humdrum as historical or literary accuracy get in the way of a good story. I subscribe to the theory that the further back in time you go, the more artistic licence you are entitled to. This one is set in 1200 BC, so Petersen has a fair bit to work with. I went in with low expectations. The reviews were mixed at best  all the usual bleating about wooden acting and pretentious dialogue  but I am happy to report they are all wrong: Troy is a triumph. Actually, they are right about the acting and the dialogue, but I'd feel short-changed if the stars of Hollywood didn't try to affect ridiculous Alec Guinness accents when faced with a project like this. I can also only applaud Sean Bean's decision to make Greek king Odysseus sound like he was born and raised in Sheffield.<br/><br/>As an epic piece of cinema, I can't praise Troy highly enough: Yes it is a touch showy and overblown, but when you put as much oomph into the special effects and fight scenes as this, some extravagance is justified. The key point is that Troy is not simply a straightforward conflict between good and evil. Hollywood has an exceedingly tiresome habit of lionising its epic heroes and demonising its villains. William Wallace maybe had some quixotic notion of freedom, but he was also a savage and an outlaw  watching Braveheart, you'd think that he spent all day skipping through meadows with baby lambs and still found time to end world poverty and find a cure for cancer. <br/><br/>Troy spends no time polishing halos. The characters here are rough-hewn and spiky. Achilles (Brad Pitt) may have smouldering eyes and abs you could eat your dinner off, but he is cold and self-important. He is not interested in wishy-washy abstract ideals such as cultural identity  his legend is all that matters. The Trojan Princes are the opposite. Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) love their country and their people, but these are no saints. Hector's army will stop at nothing to repel the Greek invaders (including sneak attacks in the middle of the night), while Paris does a nice line in wife-stealing. Petersen's one concession to stereotyping is the greedy, power-crazed Agamemnon (Brian Cox in full pantomime villain mode) whose relationship with bolshy star soldier Achilles provides the key conflict of the movie. <br/><br/>Troy is not without its flaws. Diane Kruger is either wildly miscast as Helen or a lot of her good scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. Petersen seems a little puzzled as to what to do with Helen despite the fact that her relationship with Paris is the reason for the Greek invasion of Troy. Indeed, of the female characters, only Briseis (Rose Byrne), Hector's devoutly religious cousin who develops an unlikely alliance with Achilles, has any real clout. Mostly they serve as eye-candy, which is fine as far as it goes, but irritating when it impedes the plot. Main offender is Saffron Burrows, who gurns and squirms and clutches her baby to her bosom, but serves no real dramatic purpose as Hector's wife Andromache. Indeed, the pivotal sword fight between Hector and Achilles which is very close to being a cinematic work of art is marred by pointless cutaways to Burrows anxiously biting her bottom lip.<br/><br/>There is terrific unintentional humour as well such as Odysseus studying a Greek soldier carving a small wooden horse for his son back home, sitting back and stroking his beard thoughtfully. Evidently having devised some fiendishly clever scheme, he eventually looks up triumphantly  all that is missing is a light bulb pinging over his head. Sure enough, moments later, the beach is deserted save one massive creaking Trojan Horse.<br/><br/>Bean may be playing it for laughs, but this movie belongs to Pitt. Alec Guinness impersonation aside, he truly convinces as a (literally) well-oiled fighting machine simply bristling with menace. Much has been made of his body and especially the copious amounts of rippling flesh that is constantly on display, but what really comes through is his sheer athleticism. I don't know if he did any of his own stunts, but hats off to his body double if he didn't. At any rate, his performance certainly left the ladies walking out of the cinema with big soppy grins on their faces and their boyfriends surreptitiously squeezing in their stomachs.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This epic, the latest from director Wolfgang Peterson (Air Force One) tells the widely known tale of Prince Paris (the latest ""pretty boy"" Orlando Bloom, an actor whom has taken parts that only only require him to show his pretty face and do little to no acting) who seduces and steals Queen Helen (the beautiful and semi talented Diane Kreuger) from her husband, the powerful and tough King Meneleaus (Brendan Gleeson, in a convincing and good performance.) Menelaus goes to his brother, the greedy King Agammemnon (Brian Cox, in a hamming and brilliant performance), whom has conquered all of the kingdoms of Greece and orders them all to fight for him and his brother. In truth, Agammemnon uses this as an excuse to conqueror Troy, the only kingdom that has yet to pledge allegiance to him. However, to conqueror Troy, Agammemnon is told that he needs Achilles to fight for him. Achilles (in an amazing and brilliant performance by Brad Pitt) is the ""mad dog or war"", the greatest warrior alive who fights for his own glory, not the spoils of war or the greed of others. Fighting for Troy is Prince Hector( Eric Bana, in his best role to date), the elder brother of Paris and the best hope for the city of Troy. While this film has its flaws, it is still a great movie. The battle scenes are well made and realistic, especially the first one on the beaches of Troy. Peterson is at the top of his game and directs what could be the masterpiece of his career. He utilizes a great script and has picked actors whom, with the exception of Bloom, are at the top of their game. Bloom, it seems, is falling back on his pretty face and nothing else to do a good job in this film. Eric Bana, however, uses much more. As Prince Hector, he draws upon a courage and nobility that serve him very well in this film, showing his character as both a man of action and a decent person. Brad Pitt, however, delivers the role of the film, save for Peter O'Toole. As the arrogant and mighty Achilles, Pitt delivers a knockout performance. He delivers a rebelliousness and courage that is hard to tell when he stopped reading the script and started ad libbing. Peter O'Toole delivers an awesome performance as the wise and noble King Priam, guardian of the city of Troy. Watch for an Oscar nomination from him in this film. Kudos also goes to Sean Bean, whom delivers an awesome performance as the cool and loyal friend to Achilles, King Odysseys. Sean Bean distances himself from the villains he has played in films such as ""Goldeneye"" and ""Patriot Games"", and proves that he is capable of both leading man and character parts. However, the film does have its flaws. Aside from Bloom's acting and some slow moments, the film is enjoyable and worth your money. Bottom line, a good film carried by good performances."

Eric Bana was, in my opinion, PERFECT as Hector, and Rose Byrne was brilliant as Briseis. Sean Bean was also extremely good, but it would have been nice if he'd had more scenes. Oh, and the battle scenes were enough to put even LOTR to shame. Those are the good and the bad things, and now for the ""ummm..."" things.

","Let me just say that this is my first film review so hopefully I don't embarrass myself too much in the process (sorry for the size).<br/><br/>**** Some Spoilers Exist ****<br/><br/>OK, I must admit that I went into the movie having already read some reviews of the movie from this site. Most of the reviews at the time were not very complimentary. The things people were most harsh on were: -<br/><br/>The script  the story line is far too different to Homer's Iliad. Brad Pitt. Orlando Bloom. Diane Kruger.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I really didn't expect a whole lot out of the movie when I went to see it, so it is probably this reason why I actually found it reasonably entertaining (note that I said REASONABLY entertaining).<br/><br/>For the most part the movie kept me interested. The cinematography in parts was very ordinary (so I did find it amazing that some reviewers said they thought it was good!  One person even suggested it was worthy of an Oscar Please!!) And the musical score to be fair wasn't much better. I thought at times when the music needed to be heavy it was light, and when it needed to be light it was heavy (pardon my very simplistic way of putting it!).<br/><br/>The script was terrible in parts  but there was enough in there to keep me interested. I can understand writing out the role of the gods (which in Homer's works were the principal reasons behind the Trojan war) to simplify the whole story, thus appealing to a greater audience. I can even understand why he reduced the size of the war so that it would fit in the one movie (although a two week war is hard to sell as an epic)  but Achilles being in the Trojan horse!!! I had trouble accepting that, and it did leave a nasty taste in the mouth once the movie was over. And the scene when Paris shot Achilles looked as though it was written as an afterthought.<br/><br/>I can just see them thinking 'Oh yeah, best not forget to put in the movie somewhere that Achilles gets shot'.<br/><br/>And as for the actors: Brad Pitt was better then I expected him to be. After reading a lot of reviews I wasn't expecting much out of his performance but I thought he did the job OK.<br/><br/>Eric Bana was fantastic as Hector. You actually felt sorry for him the whole movie knowing he was going to die. You almost wished that script had been modified so that he would live after the battle with Achilles (why not, they changed everything else!!). The fight scene with Brad Pitt was very well done and worth the admission ticket alone.<br/><br/>Sean Bean was also terrific, as where Peter O'Toole, Rose Byrne and Brian Cox (although I read from someone that they didn't like Brian Cox's performance  I thought this is a bit harsh as I found his portrayal of Agamemnon to be very good).<br/><br/>Diane Kruger was not good at all. She is a very attractive woman and not a bad actor, but she was not the right choice as Helen. She doesn't have the look of someone who would entice men to start an epic two-week war in order to win her heart, let alone a 10-year one as in the Iliad. In my mind Helen needs to not only be attractive, she has to be Sexy, and I mean REAL sexy. A woman doesn't have to be drop dead gorgeous to be sexy. Sexy is all about attitude, the way you conduct yourself, the way you walk, mannerisms etc. A real sexy woman makes men's blood boil and makes them do stupid things (like drag you across the Aegean Sea to Troy). Diane Kruger was not sexy in this movie, and I think that the part of Helen needed to have someone who was that type.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom. DAMN!!!! You were terrible! In his defense I don't think the script did him a lot of favors. When I heard him say, 'We can live off the land, I can hunt rabbit' I fell off the seat and just about p***ed my pants I was laughing so hard. Even though Paris was supposed to be wimpy and hated by the audience, I thought his acting skills were the reason that everyone hated him, not his character's cowardness.<br/><br/>As I said though, this movie is worth a look, just don't go into the movie thinking you are about to see LOTR. I would give it a 6.5 out of 10."
"Temper","7","1","2","7 June 2004"," Better than what I expected
","I finally went around to seeing this movie essentially because I was told it had an awesome rendition of the duel between Achilles and Hector, and I wanted to catch it on the big screen. Aside from that, I approached the movie with the expectation that the script was terrible, the acting equally flat, and the Iliad completely butchered. I guess with expectations that low, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie, unlike many of the IMDb critics who seemed to go in with very high expectations.<br/><br/>The one criticism that I must agree with is that the love between Helen and Paris just didn't seem very convincing. Bloom and Kruger had no chemistry whatsoever. But as it turns out, the direction of this movie didn't seem to focus much on Helen and Paris but more on the juxtaposition between Achilles and Hector. Indeed, the script dismisses Helen as simply an excuse to wage a war that Agamemnon was itching to fight. Given that approach, I could forgive the lack of focus on their relationship. <br/><br/>If you sift out all the battle scenes and cheesy lines (which you have to expect from a Hollywoodical epic and what most people pay to see anyway) this movie really comes down to comparing two heroes who have two different definitions of glory. In this regard, I thought the movie was excellent. While I think Bana was a terrible Bruce Banner, he was brilliant as the dutiful, honorable, and courageous Hector that Homer envisioned in his story. In the Iliad, Hector represents the ideal leader and is also a symbol of marital piety, both of which were well adapted in the script. On the other hand, while I think Pitt is generally a good actor, I think he was mis-directed. Pitt certainly did an excellent job of bringing out the arrogance and thirst for glory that represents the petulant Achilles, but did they have to cast him as a clean-shaven pretty boy the entire movie? It just seemed to take away from his credibility as an actor.<br/><br/>Perhaps this movie shouldn't have been called Troy, but instead Achilles, since the movie is really more about him than about the siege of Troy. For example, they completely took out the Judgment of Paris and the character Cassandra. Instead, the movie begins and ends with Achilles; his flaws exacerbated by the virtues of Hector.<br/><br/>While it certainly doesn't come close to any of the greats, overall it was a good film. Peter O'Toole was of course Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean did a fine job as well. I guess the key is to go in with low expectations and you may actually be quite entertained. By the way, the fight scene between Hector and Achilles really was great. Catch it on the big screen if you can!"
"Ronin47","5","1","2","8 June 2004"," Ehh. (**1/2)
","Ehh, the (**1/2) is more a rating for a few select scenes that are pretty awesome rather than the whole, because as a whole, this movie didn't engage me very much. <br/><br/>As Achilles, Brad Pitt isn't bad, but he looks like a surfer and sounds like one when he speaks. Eric Bana is pretty good as Hector, the most sympathetic character in the film. <br/><br/>So two good fight scenes (especially the one between Pitt and Bana), a few good battle sequences, and a very good scene between Pitt and Peter O'Toole. That's the awesome stuff, everything else ranges from alright to dull (and the dialogue sounds like a medieval soap opera most of the time).<br/><br/>
It looks really nice, but in the end it's more exhausting than entertaining."
"rhernandez914","Null","1","2","1 June 2004"," Troy is a very good epic film that could have been great!
","Directed by Wolfgang Petersen <br/><br/>Runtime: 163 min<br/><br/>Troy is a very good epic film that could have been great! The movie sets and battle scenes are grand and reminiscent of other blockbuster movies like Gladiator, Brave Heart and the Lord of the Rings. The movie's scriptwriters take a little too much artistic license in my view and deviate from Homer's The Iliad and other literature about the Trojan War. An example of this is the leaving out of a very important character by the name of Cassandra, who foresaw the end of Troy before it happened.<br/><br/>Much of the story revolves around Brad Pitts character Achilles. Brad Pitt did a credible job but I still had a hard time buying him as the world's greatest warrior. Where is the Rock or Vin Diesel when you need them?<br/><br/>Eric Bana did a much better job of playing the reluctant but great Trojan warrior Hector. I really liked the way he portrayed the honorable warrior who loves his family and still does his duty just like many soldiers have to do today.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom plays Paris who is apparently a better lover than a fighter and starts the whole Trojan War by stealing Helen from the Spartan king Menelaus.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole plays King Priam of Troy with his usual great skill and talent.<br/><br/>Brian Cox does an excellent job of playing the really mean and nasty King Agamemnon. <br/><br/>There are some people that are not going to like this film. It is not a small budget independent film with some weird obscure director. It is grossing way too much money to be 'in' with that film crowd.<br/><br/>The movie misses the mark of being great but it is a very good entertaining movie if you can ignore the changes to the traditional story. I rate it a 7 out of 10."

","What can i say about troy? The action and battle scenes are one of the best we have seen so far, but i think that they could have made a little better the narration, and the story. Everybody knows it's based on the Illiad, but that epopey it's an old one, then we are not accustomed to that heavy and unbelievable ""love"" story. They could have adapted the film to an actual way of thinking, in other words, that war should have been caused, not by a simple love story, but by other causes, like any murder or something related to economy, ando not only the feelings about conquering the whole mediterranean.<br/><br/>I don't like so much the acting of Brad Pitt, and neither of all those close ups of his ""beautiful and whity"" face. I would have liked another actor, more rude, and not so well shaved according to the epoch. The exception is Eric Bana, who can control an army and has a real good looking, and a pair of muscle tits (bigger than some actresses). In the making of, the director says that the fighting were made by themselves, but there isn't nothing new under the sun, because actually everybody make that (Uma thurman, Keanu reeves...)but that is contraposed by the amazing special visual effects.<br/><br/>In conclusion go to see troy because you'll have a very entertaining time, but don't hope it to be the best movie in history. 7.5/10"

Not even the beginnings of a five o clock shadow.<br/><br/>Then his hair. Part of it neatly combed straight back and the remainder frumpled and wind blown. Distracting?

","Troy was okay as a summer movie and it is only a good movie if you judge by summer movie standards. I did go in expecting more substance than say the movie, Van Helsing, because it is based on a much revered work. The characterizations and script lack the depth of a movie like The Gladiator. Nonetheless, it works as a summer movie and occasionally injects heart here and there.  I initially had problems with the casting but everyone did an adequate job.  What is ironic is that is it not Helen and Paris' romance that you begin to care about.  It is the romance between Achilles and Briseis that you really root for.  That was unexpected.  I think Rose Byrne in addition to Eric Bana were the reasons why I stuck with this movie. I predict big things in the future for Byrne and Bana. They have true star appeal. Brad Pitt was better in the role than I expected.  I initially had problems imagining him as Achilles but he pulled it off.  I admire Bloom for taking a role that displays Paris initially as being so weak. I think he did fine in the role. Of course side characters such as Peter O'Toole as the king of Troy was exceptional. O'Toole doesn't even need to say a word, his eyes do all the acting... 7.5/10"
"Dockelektro","7","1","2","3 June 2004"," Clean fun with flaws
","Ok, this story had to be adapted. It was far too epic and super-sized to remain in Homer's pages. To do it, of course they would have to get all the best money can buy, and the results when you see it are as expected: massive sequences, massive sets, amazing sights, amazing visions. But ""Troy"" falls a bit flat specially because of the way the source material had to be juggled in order to adapt itself for a two-and-a-half-hour movie. So, apparently, the gods are dropped in favor of a much more militaristic, ""gladiatoresque"" approach - in the original tale, men fought alongside the gods, which were pivotal to the battle events. Here, men fight for honor, for their homelands, for greed, for courage, for love, but are never aided by some sort of divinity. This makes ""Troy"" little more than an extended battle scene, divided into several set pieces, some amazing (the fight between Aquilles and Hector is an eye-opener), some a already-seen (those rings movies already defined and claimed the massive battle shots we witness here). Of course, as an epic of gigantic proportions it certainly achieves - the shot of a thousand ships sailing to troy is unforgettable. But even if Brad Pitt transpires charisma, and Eric Bana provides a much-needed nobility, this enterprise sounds like little more than Hollywood dollars to the service of popcorn entertainment. Not deep, only fun."
"mtzoanos","6","1","2","31 May 2004"," Thank God Wolfgang Petersen turned down Gladiator
","First things, first. The fact that this movie is not an epic like it should be is entirely Wolfgang Petersen's fault. We are all grateful to him for passing on the opportunity to direct Gladiator - the honor of which was finally bestowed on Ridley Scott. The movie falls short in many respects. First of all, the romance between Paris and Helen is not fleshed out enough to justify the war. Second, most of the actors like Brad Pitt as Achilles, Orlando Bloom as Paris and Diane Kruger as Helen are miscast. Although a good actor, Brad Pitt cannot bring life to the average script like a non-American Thespian like Russell Crowe would. He has the body, the looks and the moves of Achilles but he lacks the passion in his voice. Diane Kruger plays Helen but she also lacks the strength and presence necessary for the role. The script is lacking in many ways too. There are no memorable moments or dialogs that stick with you after you watch the movie as with Gladiator. The music is passable too. There are no musical themes for Troy, the Greeks or the heroes that add to the movie experience and that develop the characters or make the scene. On the positive side, Peter O'Toole and Eric Bana are both outstanding as are some other British actors."
"GroggyLane","Null","1","2","30 May 2004"," Good.. but not Great! Missed potential is the worst!
","I just finished seeing Troy and I was a little disappointed. The acting was good, top to bottom. The action was great!! The potential for epic was all there! Then Hollywood steps in and ruins it as usual. Perhaps one of the greatest love stories ever told, and yet the romance between Paris and Helen just wasn't enough? In the usual attempt to separate Brad Pitt from his shirt, a love story is created for Achilles as well. A completely unrealistic and impossible love story. It makes no sense at all, but gives women a reason to want to see this movie, I guess. Why not just cast Pitt as Paris, or Hector? You get Brad's clothes off with a woman, then get on with the story. That could have made sense. Then Eric Bana could have played the commonly regarded homosexual Achilles. Bloom was a perfect weakling as Paris, the lover not the fighter. Bana was great as Hector and could have been just as great as Achilles. Pitt was the real loser here. He was great, but just in the wrong role. Or what Hollywood turned into the wrong role by making it more ""woman friendly"". <br/><br/>Hollywood, why do you always have to ruin a good story? Why do you always have to spoil a great plot? Why do you have to leave great performances too soon forgotten? Women are smart enough to like a movie because it is a good movie. You give them too little credit and make us all suffer."
"JamesHitchcock","8","1","2","30 May 2004"," The Greek Myths are still Relevant
","Contains spoilers<br/><br/>The great historical epics that were so popular in the fifties and early sixties were one of my favourite types of film, but they all but disappeared from the screen after the financial failures of 'Cleopatra' and 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'. The few examples made in the seventies and eighties, such as the Richard Gere 'King David', have been largely forgotten. The success of 'Titanic' in the late nineties (confounding many critics who had been preparing their 'sinking ship' metaphors in anticipation of its failure) showed that it was still possible to make films on an epic scale, and I recall wondering at that time if this would pave the way for a return of the historic epic. With first 'Gladiator' and now 'Troy', my question seems to have been answered in the affirmative. <br/><br/>Criticisms of 'Troy' for being 'historically inaccurate' or for not slavishly following the plot of 'The Iliad' miss the point. Since the days of ancient Greece, every succeeding age has taken the legends of that civilization and used them for its own purposes, starting with Virgil who took the story of the Trojan warrior Aeneas and used it as a foundation myth for the Roman Empire. This film, which reinterprets the legend of the Trojan War for the twenty-first century, is merely the latest example of this. Historians and archaeologists have long debated whether the story is based on actual events. There is, moreover, no single version of the legend. Homer's epic is merely the best-known version of it, not the definitive one. Homer, for example, merely makes Achilles and Patroclus close friends; the idea (not followed in the film) that they were homosexual lovers comes from later versions of the tale. <br/><br/>Although Homer was himself a Greek, his poem was not simply Greek propaganda. He tried to be even-handed between the Greeks and the Trojans and to show good and bad on both sides. The film, however, dispenses with even-handedness and tells the story from a viewpoint sympathetic to the Trojans. The Greek leaders invade Troy for a mixture of self-interested motives; the romance between Helen and Paris is just a pretext. Agamemnon is only interested in power and wealth, Menelaus in avenging a slight to his honour and Achilles, at least initially, in the selfish pursuit of fame and glory. The Trojans, particularly Hector, are idealised, shown as fighting a just war in defence of their country. <br/><br/>The most prominent theme in 'Troy' is that of love- not just love between a man and a woman, although that is obviously an important part of the story. The film also explores love for one's family, love for one's country and love for God (or, in this case, for the gods). The two most unsympathetic characters, the brothers Agamemnon and Menelaus, are the two who have no love for anyone or anything except themselves. Menelaus does not love Helen; he wants her back because losing his wife to another man is a blow to his pride. Agamemnon takes Briseis from Achilles not because he loves her, or even because he desires her sexually, but simply as an expression of his power. By contrast, the noble warrior Hector loves not only his wife Andromache, but also his country, his family and the gods. The best of the Greek kings, Odysseus, is also a disinterested patriot who loves his wife.<br/><br/>Achilles, the film's central character, is a special case. The Achilles we see early in the film- arrogant, petulant and bloodthirsty- is no more sympathetic than Agamemnon or Menelaus. It is only later that we see a softer side to his character in his grief over the death of Patroclus (in the film his cousin) and his love for Briseis, as he comes to realize that there is more to life than killing people for the sake of one's glory. When Achilles dies we feel a sense of loss; when Menelaus and Agamemnon are killed, this is shown as being their just reward for their villainy. It might, in fact, have fitted in well with the film's theme if Achilles and Patroclus had been shown as lovers, although this would obviously have required considerable rewriting of the Briseis sub-plot. I doubt, however, if either Hollywood or his female fan-base are yet ready for a gay Brad Pitt. <br/><br/>The acting in the film is rather mixed. Diane Kruger looks splendid in the key role of Helen, but she has a struggle to express any emotion in what is all too obviously not her first language. This is unfortunate as the script portrays Helen as a passionate, independent-minded woman, not merely a tool in the hands of men. Brad Pitt also has his difficulties with the even more important role of Achilles. Although he is fine as Achilles the tender lover, he is less convincing as Achilles the fearsome warrior. In his hands the wrath of Achilles seems more like the petulant tantrum of Achilles- one of the film's less happy departures from Homer. <br/><br/>Most of the other performances, however, were excellent, particularly Eric Bana as Hector. Bana succeeds in the difficult task of portraying a good man without making him seem priggish. Hector, who fights bravely in a just cause, is truly heroic, unlike Achilles who is merely fearless. Hector's death in their climactic duel is the one truly tragic moment in the film. His scenes with Saffron Burrows as Andromache are characterised by a gentle tenderness, which contrasts with the more turbulent passion of Paris and Helen; there is a suggestion that it is the former rather than the latter which is the surer foundation for relationships between men and women. Of the other characters, I particularly liked Peter O'Toole as the tragic and dignified Priam, Brian Cox as the cynical and devious Agamemnon, Sean Bean as the pragmatic but decent Odysseus and Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus, the sort of blustering bully who tries to hide his true nature under a veneer of bluff heartiness but who becomes dangerous when crossed.<br/><br/>The battle sequences are well done, even if they do not quite measure up to those in 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Gladiator'. The film as a whole was a worthy addition to the historic epic genre, and an interesting updating of Homer which touched on the very modern themes of imperialism, patriotism, the 'just war', the nature of true heroism, the ethics of revenge and relations between the sexes. The Greek myths still have relevance even in the twenty-first century. 8/10"

This movie lack of 1.) content: the screenwriter choose to ignore the rest of the Troy history and related stories. 2.) Music, most of these kinds of films would have strong music to suit the movie, however, this one doesn't. So, what's this movie good about? The CG, of course. It's an undeniable fact.

"min_G_express","Null","1","2","24 May 2004"," why downgrade all the great causes to love?
","So, couple days ago, exactly the day after the school year ends, I turned 20, not sth. I was looking forward to. Usually, I spent the special day of the year with friends, either in movie theatre or soccer pub, no exception this year, spent the night for TROY. So far, I have hated being 20 here in states, not young enough to do stupid things anymore, but not old enough to do cool things yet. Okay, so, first, for TROY. Epics have never been my favorite, i'm more a weird movie person, movies such as Fight Club, Kill Bill, ChungKing Express just click me right away. But it's funny how it's really every time I watch an epic can I really feel the unlimited power of cinema. <br/><br/>As for the movie itself, I don't even think Troy is that great. The storyline is kinda retarded, I hate the fact that they downgrade everything to the cause of love. The best thing about the Iliad is that you know that human beings are so easily manipulated by the Gods, and the same are doomed too, however, they don't give up, they don't just wait there and be like, yes, let the Gods decide what to do, otherwise, there won't even be this war. They believe in and respect the Gods, but when they are angry, they are brave enough to attack the Gods too. They know their fate, they know they're doomed, but they are men enough to take it, to try everything they can, not trying to change the fate, but to live the most out of the limited life. They look for their personal values under doomed fate and limited lifetime, this value cannot be simplified as sth. like love. I admit the fact that the Iliad is also a fiction that's created by Homers, so it's true that the screenwriter has his right to create a new version, but I just don't like this Hollywoodized storyline. The power of the cinema is that even with disliking the whole story, I cannot resist the charm of the movie itself. The setting is great, this whole copper tune brings everyone right back to 3200 years ago, bring you right into the world of heroes. The costumes and make-ups, man, if you look at how the actors look like in real life and look at their characters again, you cannot help thinking 'wow, that's really like magic', that's the beauty of cinema, it turns imagination into fact. And the music, scored by James Horner, who did Brave Heart, Meet Joe Black and Legends of the Fall and lots of others, the perfect guy for an epic movie. With Josh Groban's deep voice, the theme song is like Archilles' song. The battle scenes are great, especially the fight scene of Archilles' v.s. Hector and the play scene of Archillles with his cousin, As a girl from China who's totally obsessed with Chow Yun-Fat's action movies, it's amazing for me to see how classic a western style fight scene can be. <br/><br/>I think the action guys really find the exact move for Archilles, swift like wind, but strong as giant, he is a LION. I believe that scene will be remembered., just as this movie will not be forgot. As for the characters, I think Brad Pitt's Archilles would be perfect without this little love thing. I love it so much that this movie is so much about the contrast between the two heroes, Archilles and Hector. They're both great men and warriors, yet, they're so different in a way that Archilles is rebellious, angry and ' he is allegiance to nobody but himself', while Hector, just as good as a warrior, he is mighty, responsible, has deep love for his family and country, lives by this simple code'honor the Gods, love your women and defend your country'. But this stupid love thing of Brad Pitt, which I would admit does add some charm to him ( well, there's no doubt that Brad Pitt is just the perfect lover in the movie, he looks sooooo hot especially when he's being a great lover), totally have ruined Archilles character and this contract between the two heroes. I think in a way that Archilles is more like the gods because he fears nothing but also loves nothing, as Odeysseus said 'fear could be a good thing', and Hector, is still a human, he has too many to fear and too many to love. That's why Archilles is admired but Hector is loved by the audience. And Paris, can't believe Orlando Bloom just keeps getting this kinda pretty innocent boy roles, although he does look like it. I guess people generally don't like him in the movie, which makes sense since he's such a coward. But I think it's not fair to Paris, only because the movie is full of warriors doesn't mean everyone was born and trained as brave. <br/><br/>Well, in the poem, Paris was kinda annoying coz he's just like a woman-killer and player, and also, on the field, he appears to be brave until he sees Manelaus, then he hides behind his solders. But they apparently tried to make Paris more pitiful in the movie, in which he is this little pretty boy loved by everyone in the family who has never fought in a war and never seen anyone die. Then, I think there shall be no blame on him that he gets scared in a real fight, after all, he is a LOVER, but not a FIGHTER, at least in the movie. And he does have some courage and responsibility that he suggests the idea of fighting Manelaus himself and refuses to leave when the city is burning. The irony is that both the heroes died, but Paris, killed the greatest warrior ever born and survived. Overall, I think Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole deserved the most for their acting, Eric Bana literally brought Hector to life, coz I don't think Hector would have been that great or at least that touch me if it was someone else. Orlando Bloom had a lot of cheesy lines, but he's the lover in the movie and I think he does well in that. Brad Pitt, Archilles benefits from more of Pitt's good look than his acting, although he does seem to have done a pretty good job. It's a pity that no women in the movie really had any space to develop their characters, after all, this is a war movie, but I expected more from Helen, which didn't happen in the movie. Anyways, It has a lot of weaknesses as an epic, but it's worth seeing, and could be movie of the year if there's nothing fantastic coming out till next year. I like it this way to start my journal in the 20th year with a movie review(well, not really review, I guess)."

Obviously, Wolfgang Peterson & Co. could've done a MUCH better job with the budget they had; what they give us is an uninspiring, flat and soul-less 'epic'...if you could call it that.  Troy just doesn't have the feel that it's obviously looking for.  For all that money and big CGI-cluttered battle scenes, this 2 1/2 hour film failed to move me....and that's a pretty amazing thing to do if one thinks about it. As far as casting goes, the only actors that are worth mentioning are Brian Cox, Peter O'Toole and, especially, Eric Bana, who was just excellent in his role.  Hector was the only character you could really feel for, there was so much sincerity in his acting you couldn't help but root for him.  Now, onto supposed 'star' of the film........<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was just horrible in his role as Achillies.  It was apparent to me as soon as he appeared on screen for the first time that he was just NOT the right person for this part.  NOTHING about him in this movie screamed 'Greek warrior'.  It was more like 'California surfer dude'.  What a terrible casting choice.  He was probably chosen because they were aiming for the summer blockbuster and figured all the females would pay the $9-10 to see Brad Pitt's body.  In that respect they'll probably succeed, but as far as his performance/his ability to help carry the film, he was simply a disaster.  It's a shame that Orlando Bloom still gets work....the boy just CAN'T ACT!!  His Paris moved right up there on my 'Most Annoying Charactes of All Time' list....I wrote the movie off when I saw that he was going to live through the film.  I'm just happy that, after reading another review on here, that his surviving and killing Achillies DID NOT happen the real story by Homer.  And what was the deal with Briseis killing Agamemnon??? Obviously Homer's classic was Hollywood-fied beyond measure.... whatever happened to just taking a story AS IS and putting it on screen??? <br/><br/>
What's so sad about Troy is the fact that all that money was put into it and it still comes out so mediocre.  Nowhere near the prestige and excellence of other war epics such as Gladiator, Braveheart, hell even The Patriot is better!  It just doesn't come off as genuine, you don't feel for any of the characters.  There was no sense of who was good from who was bad (don't know if the story projects this same dilemma), so that made it even harder to feel for anyone on screen.  Troy is just bad all around, some 'summer blockbuster' this turned out to be....pretty trashy movie. <br/><br/>

","Troy is a mixed bag.The battle scenes are truly spectacular and sometimes even rousing.However, Brad Pitt is woefully miscast.He looks more like a midwestern American boy next door than a Greek warrior.I also found the mix of accents in the film,grating from American(Pitt) to English(Peter O'toole among others ) to Scottish (Sean Bean).I would have preferred a uniform accent. Acting accolades go to Eric Bana as Hector(He has the rugged good looks for the part ) and Peter O'toole.Diane Kruger is beautiful enough for one to believe that her face could actually launch a thousand ships. The historical errors in the film were astounding.The Trojan siege lasted 10 years and not a few weeks as depicted in the film.Patroclus was Achilles's lover not cousin and in the end helen actually does return to Sparta back to her husband and doesn't escape with Paris. All in all,it was OK ,and most importantly not boring but I hope Oliver Stone's Alexander would be better and more historically accurate."

","I thought Troy, although not a masterpiece was overall very good. However i think that Pitt could have played Achilles a little better instead of him ending up brooding every five minutes in his arrogance. I thought that Eric Bana was excellent as Hector, revealing a character that the audience could identify with. Although i'm an Orlando Bloom fan, he's already been there and done that with the bow and arrow which was a little bit tacky. I liked the score but at times the wailing voices were over the top, but it seemed to encapsulate the overall mood of the film.

With the possible exception of Paris' character, the acting was extremely fine.

"maitreyee_mishra","Null","1","2","26 May 2004"," WORTH WATCHING?
","I watched Troy today after a long-awaited anticipation to see it; not because I thought I would love itbut because I wanted to see how much I could hate it. As far as I can remember, the first thing that caught my attention was the music- something that was consistently good throughout the movie. The second thing was Sean Bean's familiar voice.<br/><br/>
Overall, I thought this movie lacked consistency in story and in acting. Apart from Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana and Sean Bean, everybody else could have done with a few lessons on acting better. I was shocked to see Orlando, poor Orlando having to play such a pathetic part in the movie. It's sad to see though the guy may have acting talent, he never really gets a chance to show it. But I must admit that I was expecting better emotion from him when Hector was killed.<br/><br/>The movie sort of dragged in the beginning. Things were stupid. The cinematography, special effects, music, Sean, Eric and Peter O'Toole made me stay where I was. I really hated Achilles and sorry to state thisI thought a much better actor could have played that part. Brad Pitt didn't seem interested and committed to what he was doing in the movie. He had this carefree attitude which seemed less Achilles type and more of a genuine feel from himself.<br/><br/>The story lacked punch and interest. The only emotional parts started after Patroclus was killed. Obviously after that there was the death of Hector etc. I can say that part made me cry. The filmmakers were very ambitious for this project, but sorry to say, they didn't achieve what they could have. Petersen could definitely have omitted a few scenes.<br/><br/>Another thing was the inconsistent dialogue. At a few points you're faced with well constructed poetry and in other parts there was anachronistic dialogue! Some lines seemed to have been taken directly from the LOTR trilogy. Even some scenes reminded me of LOTR! For instance when Hector and Paris walk out of Troy for Paris to fight Menelaus, I was reminded of Aragorn and his troops coming out of Minas Tirith to go to the Black Gate. At some points, Troy looked like Minas Tirith (though it isn't white).<br/><br/>
The first two hours of the movie was a sort of emotionless and disgusting, but it became better when Hector was killed. I cried. It was so heartbreaking when he was dragged after death and taken to the Greeks. Achilles seemed to have no heart. If King Priam hadn't come to him that night and begged for his son's body, maybe Achilles would have let Hector lie on the sand like that. I began to hate Achilles and therefore didn't cry when he died. But that was also because Brad Pitt didn't seem as though he was dying (more like he was thinking `When does this movie end?').<br/><br/>
The music was a plus point throughout. I think we could have done without Briseis (if that's the right spelling) and many other parts. Peter O'Toole proves to us again what a fine actor he is, Sean Bean shows his talent again after Boromir, and Eric Bana was brilliant in this movie where I first saw him act.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie 5/10. It surely could have been a lot better (and it gets the high rating primarily because of the three acting talents I have mentioned above). P.S. How do people think that Brad Pitt looks cute as Achilles (yuck!)?"

Everything is false: parts of story that don't exist, other parts twisted until betrayal, main hero characters killed when they were supposed to stay alive and spared when they were supposed to die, the plot completely changed to suit Hollywood standards, a ridiculous love story between Achilles and Briseis, Helen looking double her age, old wise Priam turned into a weepy war geek, Agamemnon and Menelaus (who were supposed to be middle age, nice looking Greek princes) turned into old red-bearded Saxon folks, noble Ajax turned into some kind of brute caveman, war formations that did not exist at the time, completely inaccurate clothing and armors.

He was the only actor that REALLY could bring about some humanity and sincerely emotions to this too much adjusted story. I am not saying that the others actors where bad, more that they so significant played they roles, but Bana really where Hector, and that's a big different!

","If you haven't read the book, well i'm sorry for y'all. So I'm not going to tell the story of the film.<br/><br/>now to my thoughts about how the movie was done. I was interested throughout the entire story, even though I knew what was going to happen in what order and roughly when. It kind've felt like seeing a friend's lover, after hearing everything about him/her (annoyingly might i add) for about a month before you've actually met them. Unlike those times with your friend's new lover (unless they brought a friend), this movie was not boring. <br/><br/>There was not as much gore as I was to expect. After seeing Gladiator's bloodlust and subsequent efforts to follow up on their lead as well as surpass it, I could see it play out as a re-hash of gladiator. no overly drawn out speeches, no over necessary blood explosions. It was tastefully done. <br/><br/>The characters are fairly represented, albeit i am not an expert on Homer. The heros are heroic, just, and fair, you want to root against those who are not. I think that there was too much talk about immortality - i doubt that people were aware of their immortality at that point, or any point in time. <br/><br/>The ""Great Balls of Fire"" scene was very impressive. I was at first curious about the intentions of the armies, but it was thoroughly impressive and unique. <br/><br/>Although I'm not a Orlando Bloom fan (he only has one real role - swashbuckling sword dealing undefeatable hero), i was impressed by his performance. As was I impressed with Brad Pitt as well as Hector. Their duel was pretty memorable, however you could tell from the get go, even if you had not read the Homer's Epic, who was going to win. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd have to give this one about an 8 rating out of 10. If you compare it to similar stories, Braveheart, Gladiator, and the myriad of everything that has come since, it definitely ranks in the top 5, probably the top 3. <br/><br/>I only have one lingering statement to make. The prison shank, was totally sweet."

The movie is not perfect, but that does not matter. I watched Helen of Troy before this movie, and I think this one is better. Perhaps Achilles is much more handsome (Brad Pitt, poor guy :)) than the guy in Helen of Troy, and the wooden horse is much close to the reality. The horse in Helen of Troy is like an out-of-box shining toy. And finally: Helen is not so beautiful at all. So, those of you who didn't see the movie, go now and enjoy it!"

His character was believable and the portrayal of his turmoil was well acted. Brad Pitt shined in more ways than one as the best warrior in history ""Achilles"". Not only did he have a body not easily forgotten but the love story added depth to his character and made him seem the ideal man on and off screen. Orlando bloom who in the past has also shined in movies like ""Lord of the Rings"" was slightly disappointing in this role. He played a coward well yet this made his character less appealing than the others and his acting was let down by the lack of depth in the character he played.

","If you go to see this movie as a classicist, expecting a faithful retelling of the ""Iliad"", you'll be disappointed, possibly frustrated just as those who expected a by-the-book version of ""The Fellowship of the Rings"" were. But-- if you go to see a MOVIE, you'll love it because it's a GREAT one. By now you probably know the approach is historical rather than mythological, a vision of the events that created the legends. Is it better than ""Gladiator""? Yes, it's superior. It's an epic with an ensemble cast so a great deal of ""character development"" isn't to be expected. The sets and costumes are wonderful except where obvious CGI shows up. The cast is excellent, too, even though I winced at some of the dialogue they were handed. How did really out of place lines like ""We may never be here again"" and ""Make your brother proud"" get in there? (SPOILER, SORT OF, FOLLOWS) Shook my head, too, when at the death of Patroclus, Hector and Odysseus give each other the ""Yeah, let's call it a day"" thing and they all just take their spears and dead comrades and go home without so much as a shoving match. Also, Diane Kruger is beautiful without a doubt but not awe inspiring beautiful, something didn't translate to cinema. Some of the ""veteran actors"" chewed that delicious scenery a bit, but Pitt, Bana, Bloom, Bean, Burrows and Byrne (that's a lot of 'B's) carried their roles off as they were meant to be. If Paris and Helen came off as spoiled even sulky teenagers at times, it's because that's how they were intended. Brad Pitt did a great job with a complicated Achilles and Eric Bana as the reluctant Hector was near perfect. Brieses as a Hippolyta-hybrid was necessary and worked, too. ('NOTHER SPOILER) I just wish that Paris hadn't apparently gotten away with Helen, and instead of Brieses stabbing Agamemnon, a line had run at the end that read something like ""Agamemnon got his victory then 'got his' from his wife as soon as he crossed the threshold."" About the eye candy... I love Eric Bana and like Orlando Bloom a good bit, but I don't think you could put any two men on the planet next to a buffed up and bronzed Brad Pitt and have them look good. He portrayed Achilles far better than I thought he could, but he looked like Adonis. This is a far, far better movie than the reviews led me to expect and you want to see it on the big screen."
"Ahsirakh","Null","1","2","21 May 2004"," Troy is a courageous attempt at developing Homer's epic tale into the richly human story that it rightfully deserves to be.
","""The Iliad"" is indisputably the greatest epic of classical Greece; the poem, which runs twenty-four books in length, centers on the mythic hero Achilles and the wrath that consumes him in the final days of the siege of Troy.<br/><br/>Popular misconception of Homer's epic embroils it with the deeper conflict between the Olympian gods which sparked the entire ten-year war, and screenwriter David Benioff could have easily bent to mainstream pressure and created a contemporary ""Clash of the Titans""-esque film where gods and mortals meet in the mother of all ancient battles.<br/><br/>Instead, he wrote ""Troy"".<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it -- ""Troy"" is no ""Iliad"". While Homer made allusions to the existence of gods in what was meant to be a timeless epic, director Wolfgang Petersen's latest screen offering discards any palpable suggestion of divine intervention. Rather, Benioff opts to tell the story closer to what the historical war actually would have been, in order to better flesh out the vivid human elements resonant in Homer's original that were made dimmer by the presence of over-dramatic embellishments.<br/><br/>Achilles, for instance, never once has his heel accentuated as his one fatal weakness, and the notion of his immortality is portrayed simply as a rumor spreading through the Greek army; at one point, he asserts that he would not be clad in armor were he indeed an immortal. His mother, the sea nymph Thetis, is also but an elderly woman who seems to have an affinity for the sea and prophesizes his future commemoration and doom from his participation in the Trojan War.<br/><br/>Playing the film's fearless hero is thespian Brad Pitt, who takes on the intense challenge of showing Achilles' transformation from stony-faced warrior to one who learns to understand love and sympathy, pulling it off with impeccable grace. His solid performance, however, is hampered greatly by the deficient script; a number of the lines given to him are hackneyed and awkward-sounding. Thankfully, as the movie progresses, these lines gradually decrease in time for Achilles' human emotions to surface.<br/><br/>Heading the army on the opposite side of the towering Trojan walls is prince Hector, in an equally stellar performance by Australian actor Eric Bana. The epitome of honor and responsibility, Hector spends much of his time in the film juggling the positions of prince, eldest son, elder brother, husband and commander. Bana manages a man conflicted by his various duties with remarkable adroitness.<br/><br/>Even Hollywood's ""It"" boy Orlando Bloom, whose acting in blockbusters such as ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was considerably lackluster, handles the naïve and timid Paris convincingly, and is especially so in a scene where he cowers, scared and humiliated, at his brother's feet, whimpering for security against rival Menelaus, with whom he is dueling and losing. This streak of theatrical expertise seems to infect the rest of the cast, who portray their characters with as much enthusiasm and skill.<br/><br/>Out of all the elements which pepper the otherwise flawless movie, such as the now-infamous ""Lord of the Rings"" wide-angle zooming shot of armies clashing, the film's greatest downfall would indubitably have to be its soundtrack. The music, especially in the battle scenes, is repetitive and jarring, serving as a distraction to the audience from fully enjoying the wonder that is ""Troy"" -- nothing short of a courageous attempt at developing Homer's epic tale into the richly human story that it rightfully deserves to be."
"psi_fla","Null","1","2","25 May 2004"," Overlong, overstretched, over-hyped  yet Troy is somehow still entertaining.
","Rating: *** (out of *****)<br/><br/>On my way to writing this review, I was about to state that Brad Pitt is Troy's ""Achilles"" heel (boom, boom!) before I realised on reflection that he isn't really that bad as the Homeric warrior. His performance is actually quite typical of the film he stars in  when it's good, it's very good, but when it's not so good, it really drags. With a director like Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, In the Line of Fire) at the helm, perhaps we should've expected a little better.<br/><br/>That being said, Petersen has got most of his priorities right with this epic version of Homer's Iliad. The atmosphere and sets, for example, get few complaints from me, even though the Trojan capital, for me anyway, is unfortunately a little reminiscent of a set from The Return of the King. (That's not the only thing that will remind you of the Lord of the Rings in this film  two LotR alumni, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean, have major roles.)<br/><br/>More on what the film does right and wrong later  I realise that I should bring you all up to speed with the story. (Homeric scholars, be warned  the original story's time period is shortened rather drastically.) Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), brother of the Greek conqueror Agamemnon (Brian Cox), loses his wife Helen (Diane Kruger) after she is persuaded away by the infatuation of Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom). As Paris's brother, Hector (Eric Bana) is only too aware, this damages an already uneasy alliance with the Greeks and thus war is declared on Troy. Aided by the warrior Achilles, the Greeks appear to have the upper hand.<br/><br/>But whose side are we on? That's a good question. In Troy, there's really no side we really feel like rooting for, as such. What we are actually doing is watching a legend unfold, even if it is not unfolding as well as it could have done.<br/><br/>As I've already stated, I have few arguments against the sets & atmosphere, and the same is true regarding the casting. Of special notice are Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole, Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Rose Byrne. Pitt, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger aren't as successful. I probably would have rated Bloom higher had Paris come across as less of a wuss. And yes, shades of Legolas resurface. To be fair to Bloom, I see all of this as more the fault of the writer. As for Kruger, I don't doubt that she's pretty, but she's just not radiant enough. On this evidence, the German newcomer is (I hate to say it) wooden. But again, I'll be fair. The script gives her terribly little to do.<br/><br/>Petersen and his crew don't handle certain sequences very well either. Poor editing in the battles renders them nearly insignificant in comparison to the one-on-one combat fights. (The one between Hector and Achilles is especially memorable.) The occasional bad dialogue is too easy to notice, and James Horner surely could have been a little more restrained with his score during the death scenes.<br/><br/>With less superfluous material, greater emphasis on Paris & Helen's development as a couple and a more consistent showing from Pitt, Troy could have been something really special. In the end it's no more than a solid summer epic. If that's all you want from it, you won't be disappointed  just don't expect it to live up to the hype."

The fight scene, the ships at sea - visual effects and landscapes, were all spot on, its just that i think the story, the myth it wasn't right.

","I am not much into Greek Mythology, but after watching this movie, I was a bit confused about the title of the movie. From the beginning of the movie, it featured Achilles. Even though the story evolved about the young prince taking the kings wife and the Trojan War, the story always seemed to evolve more around Achilles. Don't get me wrong, in my opinion, it was a very entertaining and fascinating movie, but the way the movie was produced, I don't think anyone would have had a problem if it was renamed ... ACHILLES!!<br/><br/>To an extent, it reminded me a little of Gladiator, which in my book is an overall better movie.<br/><br/>Production: The picture was an absolute spectacle ... the costumes were divine and the panoramic view was both heavenly and majestic, especially as the boats were sailing into Troy. The only other problem I had with the movie was that the cameras and angles during the mass fight scenes were too fast. It did not capture the essence of the battles (swords, arrows descending and individual fighting) as they seemed a bit too busy.<br/><br/>Overall, the direction and production was very good. I will own a copy when it comes out on DVD and I bet it will look even more spectacular on my LCD widescreen!"

","OK, lemme first say that I wanted to like this movie. I REALLY wanted to enjoy this movie and hoped it would tell one of the greatest stories ever heard beautifully. Alas, it does not reach its lofty goal.<br/><br/>OK, we start with the cast. Very well cast for the most part, except in one tiny little insignificant character who didn't mean much to the story named Achilles. Well, maybe not that insignificant. Brad Pitt is a good actor I guess, but not for a moment do I believe him to be this afflicted, tortured soul who also happens to be the greatest warrior of all time. Otherwise, the cast is dead on with great performances from Eric Bana and Sean Bean. Orlando Bloom pretty much just plays Orlando Bloom as Paris, the handsomest man in the world who gets his a**e kicked by a big fatty Greek.<br/><br/>If there is one thing you can truly love in this film, it is the special effects. I listened to Roger Ebert's review who somehow thought that because there were so many Greeks and Trojans on-screen at one time that it pulls you out of the realism and reminds you this is just a movie. Wait, what? Ahem, my rebuttal: bulls**t. whatever else you want to say about this movie, it has CGI effects, from the amazing battle scenes to Troy itsef, which are rendered beautifully, though apparently a very large part of the city was actually built.<br/><br/>But in the end, how does the movie really hold up where it counts; I found the dialogue to be, to use the technical term, summermovie-ish. There are a few great scenes, particularly when Priam, the father of the slain Hector, confronts his killer and begs to have his son's body returned. But when Brad Pitt remarks ""It's too early in the day for killing princes"" I almost laughed at the stupidity.<br/><br/>despite its flaws, I still walked out of the movie with a smile on my face, though that might have been because one of my buddies ran into the soda dispenser on the way out. Troy is a good flick for people who want to see lots of men in small pants charge at each other screaming bloody murder, and then commence in the brutal slaying of one another. I enjoyed it despite its misgivings, and will recommend it for the summer lineup<br/><br/>7/10"
"dcobbimdb","Null","1","2","19 May 2004"," Good solid movie. Go see it!
","I've seen a lot of criticism of this movie and even the group of people I went to see it with weren't taken back and all said the same thing 'its okay.' I on the other hand thought it was a good movie overall and give it a 7.5 / 10. So do yourself a favor and go see it on the big screen and make up your own mind as it's certainly not a waste. As far as the movie length it didn't feel too long to me and I thought the CGI wasn't all that noticeable (my two big worries going into it). However after recently reading an article on how it cost 200 million to make the movie and that a decent portion of it went into digitally enhancing brad pits muscles as well as cover up his bald spot, heh. Makes you wonder about the longevity of real actors Could a day come when a digital Brad Pitt could replace the real one?<br/><br/>Anyway, I grew up with Greek mythology and was always fond of it. Being quite rusty though I went into this saying 'Isn't this the one with the wooden horse' but actually I did remember a little more than that prior to seeing it. So unfortunately I knew what was gonna happen in the Hector / Achilles fight, I knew how Achilles was going down, and how the main battle would end. So there wasn't much suspense in my corner for how things were going to play out.<br/><br/>All that being said, I enjoyed the movie. I saw it after downing 4 long islands, so I was a bit sauced up, but I don't think that skewed my perception of the movie one way or the other. I thought that the flow, acting, battle sequences, and digital effects were all done nicely. As far as the story, I did notice that while the characters talked about the gods quite frequently, the directors more or less left the gods (or there actions) out. I guess with this kind of movie, you either have to go one way or another. But in the stories, I remember the gods playing a more active role. There were other subtleties in the movie that if you new the relevance, it would mean different things. For example, the Greeks killing the priests of the temple and p***ing off the gods (was present, but not very prominent in the movie). Nothing was ever really said of Achilles immortal body / mortal heal. He was just kind of depicted as a bad-ass warrior with no fear. So the end scene with Paris and Achilles, they stayed true with the arrow in the heal, but to an ignorant viewer, they wouldn't have noticed the relevance of it being the fatal arrow. Also, I thought I remember there being some special protective significance of the necklace given to Achilles by his mother, so when he gave it away to the slave girl<br/><br/>Having said it was a good movie, I did have a few complains / ideas that the movie could have done better on. From a movie perspective, they did kind of drop the ball on the whole Paris / Helen relationship which only was covered in the first few minutes of the movie. It would have been nice at least from a movie perspective to see something more develop here (struggling love develops in the midst of imminent death). I would have liked to see little more character development of Odysseus, he was a supporting character in the movie, but needed a little more stage time in my opinion as he was a fairly important character. Also Paris (Orlando bloom) didn't get much stage time at all, other than a few crucial scenes, though I don't remember how important he was in the stories. The movie pretty much boiled down to Achilles vs Hector, which is no bad thing. Only other complaint from me was on the music. In my opinion music can totally make or break a movie, much more so than people give credit to. In Troy, I wouldn't go so far as to say that the music was bad, it just seemed like in many scenes the music didn't capture the essence, and hence didn't really bring huge life or power to some scenes. Probably the biggest flaw for me<br/><br/>Favorite scene  Very first duel with Achilles, beginning of the movie. Favorite character  Hector / Achilles being a close second<br/><br/>Final remarks  As I said earlier, go see it. Though I've heard some mixed results, I haven't heard anyone say it was bad. See it if you are into epic battle movies or history or Greek mythology. See it if you like Brad Pitt as he's never looked better (digitally or not). Final thought, I think if the LOTR trilogy hadn't come out, this movie might have had a bit more impact. Problem is how do you shine next to that masterpiece."

It's not really a bad movie, it's just average, and it should have been more. After about the first half hour, the only character I wanted to see on screen was Hector (Eric Bana). I didn't care about Brad Pitt at all and think he could have done a better job.<br/><br/>Once again, it wasn't bad, just not as good as it could have been.

"Kaereth","Null","1","2","23 May 2004"," A huge disappointment (possible semi-spoilers)
","***I'm not posting any actual spoilers here, but I do mention things about characters that some readers may not want to know before they see the movie - along the lines of ""Character A isn't in the movie, but is in the Iliad, and Character B acts like this"". I don't give away any plot twists (not that there are any) or important story points.***<br/><br/>First off, if you like Homer, or are even a little familiar with the Iliad, you'll hate this movie. The scriptwriter plays incredibly fast and loose with the source text - most of the characters aren't in the movie, the timescale is all wrong, events happen out of sequence or don't bear any resemblance to the Iliad - the movie either adds events or misses important parts out; and (most worryingly) the central theme of the Iliad is lost and a tepid love story (which is never convincing) takes its place.<br/><br/>Oh, and there are no Gods in the movie. None.<br/><br/>Petersen's direction is fairly solid, although the editing is remarkably raw at times, with scenes being cut a second too soon (or too late) with frightening regularity and the camera often focuses on the wrong character half way through a scene (Achilles and Briseis are talking, for example, and half way through one of Achilles's lines, the camera focuses on Briseis (who is just sat there not doing anything) and then back to Achilles. It's stupid and irritating, and it doesn't happen just once).<br/><br/>The battle scenes are effective, although nothing on the scale of LOTR, which is surely the benchmark nowadays.<br/><br/>The acting varies wildly - Pitt is dreadful, as is Bloom (although their characters are fairly accurate, if you forgive the scriptwriter's interference). Sean Bean is... well, he's Sean Bean. I can watch the man all day, but he's essentially the same in everything, whether it's Sharpe or Boromir he's portraying. Brian Cox is entertaining, but he's a bit cartoon villainish for my taste - I kept expecting him to start twirling his moustache and tying slave girls to railway tracks. Brendan Gleeson isn't given much to work with, but does his very capable best. It should surprise no-one to learn that Peter O'Toole is the best thing in the movie, but it's not one of his best performances (or his best roles, either). The women are essentially damsels in distress - Helen is quickly reduced to ""oh, it's all my fault"" whining, Andromache is barely seen and we're left with Briseis to be the 'strong female character' that Hollywood seems to feel we need in every movie. Unfortunately, the filmmakers are limited by the character - she's made a slave, kidnapped from the temple of Apollo and so all she can do is be defiant. If Petersen had introduced the gods, there would have been ample scope for the women to be rounded characters, but they didn't, so the female leads are stuck with bland dialogue and window-dressing characters.<br/><br/>Eric Bana, who plays Hector, was the most pleasant surprise for me. I've only seen him in Hulk before this, and whilst he was solid enough, his performance was nothing special. In Troy, though, he fleshes out Hector admirably, defeating the filmmakers' efforts to reduce him to a cardboard cut-out, and as a consequence he's the only character you really care about (as I said, O'Toole's is the better performance, but Priam is only given variations on one line through most of the movie, so there's not much he can do).<br/><br/>This leads on to the most problematic area of the movie. The characters are so badly written that you don't care whether Troy falls or whether the Greeks are defeated.<br/><br/>Having ranted for a while (you may not have noticed, but I'm a fan of the Iliad and this movie bears almost no resemblance) I should point out that the movie looks pretty slick, and the action moves along quickly, so I expect the movie to do well. But the problem is, as with most of the films that Hollywood produces, there's nothing there for people who actually like film as a medium. If you want to be entertained for two and a half hours, and not think about anything, and you aren't looking for a good script, or good acting, or interesting direction; but you'd quite like to look at attractive Hollywood types on the big screen, this might be the film for you."
"thomasmyrup","9","1","2","22 May 2004"," Excellent - More than just big fight scenes - Spoilers I guess
","I really enjoyed Troy and I actually think that it is a better film that Lord of the Rings (LOTR) and a much better film than Gladiator or Braveheart. Films that Troy is often compared to. <br/><br/>Troy doesn't use the old ""revenge plot"" as the main theme as Gladiator does. And the story is much more complicated than the boring ""good vs. evil and good is sure to win"" plot used in many films incl. LOTR. <br/><br/>Instead Wolfgang 'Das Boot' Petersen has created a film that appeals to the mass audience while still having a number of intriguing points:<br/><br/>First, this clearly is an antiwar story. It's not a good vs. evil story where the fighting is necessary for justice to prevail. Instead both sides in the conflict have likable characteristics and heroes. The antiwar theme is also clear at the end of the movie. Nobody has benefited from the war. It has ended as a catastrophe for all. <br/><br/>Secondly, the great hero Achilleus played by Brad Pitt is actually portrayed as rather unlikable and he is unsure what his real purpose in life is. As the story is told Achilleus must chose between the happy but boring family life and the glorious but bloody life of the hero warrior that will give him a place in history. He chooses war, but at the end after meeting Briseis he changes his mind and during the final battle for Troy he is only interested in finding her  which also becomes his destiny. Quite another type of hero than Gladiators revenge driven hero. <br/><br/>All in all a quite enjoyable film with a story line that is both entertaining and thought provoking."
"Ren68","8","1","2","18 May 2004"," Good Film; Could have been great - Lousy Director
","""Troy"" is one of those movies that is enjoyable but frustrating - frustrating because, in the hands of a better director, it could have been magic. <br/><br/>While Wolfgang Peterson delivers a handsome cast, some breath taking battle scenes, and some quite effective CGI, he never fully realises the scope of the story he is telling. Instead he lets an appalling musical score (queue the romantic music; queue the fight music, and don't get me started on the dreadful closing song); some jarring camera work that is more reminiscent of a 70's cop show than an epic; and some truly cheesy dialogue, intrude on the flow of the film. I could swear some of the dialogue at the end of the movie comes straight from an episode of ""The Bold and Beautiful""<br/><br/>But, it's not all bad news, Sean Bean once again manages to turn in a charismatic performance that all but steals the movie, and Orlando Bloom manages the near impossible with his sympathetic portrayal of Paris. (Even if it was a trifle distracting having him using a feather and bow so soon after playing Legolas).<br/><br/>The other great surprise is Eric Bana as Hector! In Australia, Bana is best known for his work as a stand up comedian - I couldn't take him seriously as a movie star - but a movie star he is. He manages to convey a gamut of emotions without saying a word, and the Hector/Archilles fight scene is a show stopper! <br/><br/>Peter O'Toole, Brian Cox, Rose Byrne and Saffron Burrows also give moving understated performances - despite a script designed to wring every emotion from you.<br/><br/>And as for Pitt - though his performance is occasionally off key - the man looks like a God, he moves like a God, I can't think of anyone who could have played the role with anywhere as much style.<br/><br/>I just wish Peter Jackson or Ridley Scott had been behind the camera."

If the writer had found a way to explain the legend from Greek mythology instead of making it a historical movie, I think people would take more away from this movie.

","Almost every time Brad Pitt opened his mouth in fact. He has been very good in some of his movies but he is so badly miscast here, that he unbalances the movie. His fight scenes aren't bad, but after listening to him struggle through the admittedly awful lines he has to say, I found the idea of him as a warrior just as funny as the rest of his performance. He even does a bad Marlon Brando impersonation shouting for HECTAAAAAAH at the gates of Troy. By this stage, I wanted anyone to smack him in the heel, I didn't much care who.<br/><br/>Eric Bana works hard, looks great and is the most attractive character in the movie. At least, he has gravitas and some idea of what he is supposed to be doing. Rose Byrne is another who comes off well. Unlike the 2 actors who play the lovers. They are completely unbelievable, Helen has more chemistry with Hector than Paris. Peter O'Toole has one great scene, the rest is filler. Brian Cox shouts entertainingly. Poor Saffron Burrows is given nothing to do, neither is Sean Bean, who would make a great Odysseus in a different movie. The movie is packed with very good, professional actors but the script is so silly that the performers spend much of their time saying or doing unintentionally funny things. <br/><br/>The battle scenes are OK (the night fight with the fireballs in particular is good to look at) and at least they don't involve much talking. <br/><br/>A movie like this should drag you in, away from the real world and have you off in the Trojan War with them and it does nothing of the sort.

Brad Pitt was well cast as Achilles, sometimes you hate his arrongance and yet your still captivated by his overall presence.

"rogerdarlington","Null","1","2","23 May 2004"," Exciting addition to sword and sandal genre
","Essentially cinema is story-telling in modern guise and one of the oldest and greatest stories of humankind is Homer's work ""The Iliad"" which ""inspires"" this movie by German director Wolfgang Petersen who first came to our attention with a very different film about war ""Das Boot"". The story is much conflated and twisted and Achilles' heel barely figures. Homer would have been unimpressed at the many liberties taken with his classic work and all of us have to suffer a rather dire script and some indifferent acting (except for veteran Peter O'Toole as the aged King Priam) and a strange mixture of American, English, Scottish, Australian and other accents.<br/><br/>However, at the heart of any story of war are the warriors and the battles and here ""Troy"" delivers in some style. Brad Pitt as the running, throwing, sword-wheeling Achilles and Eric Bana as a brave and competent Hector are physically in good shape and their exciting fight sequence is one of the highlights of this 2 hour 43 minute work. Achilles is presented as a very modern hero, arrogant, full of angst, and no respecter of authority.<br/><br/>
The battle sequences themselves rival those of ""Lord Of The Rings"" for the stunning use of special effects and the depiction of visceral violence. Indeed Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean seem to have stepped straight out of ""LOTR"" into ""Troy"", although the few actresses in the movie are generally newcomers, notably former model Diane Kruger as Helen whose beautiful face launches a thousand ships (most of which we see, thanks to the wonders of CGI).     <br/><br/>""Troy"" apparently cost some $185M to make, with filming in Malta and Mexico as well at the studios in Shepperton. It was ""Gladiator"" which revived the sword and sandal saga, but ""Troy"" is not in the same class as that superlative movie. However, if the Hollywood wizards can set up ""Alien vs Predator"", maybe they could conjure up ""Maximus vs Achilles"" - or perhaps fans of this genre should just wait for ""Alexander The Great"" and ""Boudacca""."

Unfortunately, the movie's ""star"" Brad Pitt left a hell of a lot to be desired.  Don't get me wrong.  I am a great admirer of Mr. Pitt and find him to be one of Hollywood's most underrated performers.  His work in movies like Se7en and Fight Club was phenomenal.  However, in Troy he looked like he had been to the ""Joey Tribbiani School of Acting"" as seen in an episode of ""Friends"". Joey explains how he gets his facial expressions, and a couple that he explain are the ""can you smell a fart"" and ""trying to divide 13 into 597"" (or something like that).  Basically Brad's facial expressions looked like a really bad American soap opera actor.<br/><br/>Also, some of the dialogue was bad to the point of banal.  You really wonder how they came up with this drivel.  I've read the Iliad and the Odyssey and I don't remember the dialogue being that awful.<br/><br/>What is truly a shame is that there were parts of the film that showed that Wolfgang Peterson was on the right tracks.

"mharrsch-1","Null","1","2","17 May 2004"," Troy may be inspired by Homer's Iliad but definitely not based on it.
","Here are some of the Pros of the new film:<br/><br/>Patroclus is present and is at least dealt with as a beloved cousin.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Achilles, Hector, and Agamemnon with sufficient homage paid to the questions of duty, honor, and glory rather than the love between Paris and Helen. <br/><br/>The cinematography and special effects were good but, IMHO, not really superior to those used in the USA miniseries ""Helen of Troy"".<br/><br/>There was much more focus on Hector as a loving husband and father as well as skilled warrior and Andromache and Astyanax were nicely represented although I would have treasured a scene of Hector accidentally frightening Asytanax by appearing in his gore-covered armor as related by Homer.<br/><br/>Achilles was far superior to the bald, mindless brute portrayed in USA's ""Helen of Troy"". Even though I personally feared that Brad Pitt was not my mental visualization of Achilles, he actually portrayed a conflicted hero quite well. Eric Bana's screen presence as Hector was also equally riveting (as one of the other film critics pointed out). I liked the actor who portrayed Hector in the miniseries but his part was deliberately overshadowed by the focus on Paris. <br/><br/>Here are some of the cons as I perceive them:<br/><br/>The screenplay had eliminated almost all reference to the role of the divine in the events portrayed. There was no judgment of Paris. The gods did not rescue Paris by obscuring him with fog during his duel with Menelaus. Most of all, sadly, there was no flame-wreathed Achilles standing and shouting out his grief for Patroclus. The only ""paranormal"" reference that I remember was Hector's admission that he had seen his fate in a dream.<br/><br/>Although the Iliad does not mention Agamemnon's sacrifice of Iphigenia, that is one of the events told in the collective Trojan War myths that was included in USA's ""Helen of Troy"" that I found quite poignant and that provided much more depth to the character of Agammenon portrayed by Rufus Sewell. I thought Brian Cox's Agamemnon was rather one dimensional  simply the personification of an individual totally corrupted by power.<br/><br/>I also preferred James Callis' personification of Menelaus to hold more humanity than the brutish warrior portrayed by Brendan Gleeson.<br/><br/>Cassandra and her torment about forseeing the destruction of Troy was totally omitted. I thought this aspect of the story was incorporated quite effectively in the TV miniseries.<br/><br/>Since Iphigenia was omitted, a vengeful Clytemnestra was also omitted. Again, the TV miniseries provided a more dramatic resolution than this movie.<br/><br/>Aeneas was portrayed as a youth. In Homer, Aeneas was second only to Hector in Trojan military prowess. The boy in this movie doesn't even look old enough to have taken part in the fighting and how he was managing to pack his aged father on his back is a mystery to me. He was also too young to be leading a son, old enough to be walking unassisted (Ascanius).<br/><br/>Small spoiler ahead.<br/><br/>The movie makers decided to kill Ajax, in this film just window dressing - a huge man slinging a huge hammer around, in one of the battle scenes instead of portraying his suicide after the sack of Troy, committed because he was not awarded Achilles armor. There has been a lot of discussion about Sean Bean as Odysseus starring in a sequel. This negates the possibility of incorporating any emotional meeting between an unforgiving Ajax and Odysseus in the underworld.<br/><br/>I still enjoyed myself and simply hope that some day someone in Hollywood will have the common sense to film the classic in its original form."

","Although this movie had a slow start, with some awkward introductions of the main characters and clumsy fight scenes (see Pitt's character with his cousin), it really found its footing after the first half hour. I was able to forget my original impression that this was taking us back to old-fashioned epics of the past, and embrace it as a surprisingly complex action movie. Luckily the special effects were brief - I really did not want to see thousands of ships heading across the ocean, or troops stretching across the beach as far as the eye could see. It is possible to make a movie suspenseful without adding bulk through the use of computer-generated effects. Let's get back to the hand-to-hand combat, individual motivations, and schemings of the characters! Pitt's Achilles was refreshingly unsympathetic - the only time I heard complete silence in the theater was when he exacted his brutal revenge upon Hector. Interesting that audiences have no problem with endless bloody carnage in a film, yet are stunned by the ugly reality of the lengths Achilles will go to to prove he is the one to fear, the one people will remember. Eric Bana, as an intense Hector, did a superb job - nice recovery from The Hulk! I will look forward to seeing more of his work. I am happy that the director did not attempt to make Orlando Bloom, as Paris, out to be a strapping action figure. A foolish youth, yes. Brian Cox, as Agamemnon, lends weight to each scene he is in, and makes this whole movie a tad more respectable. I would give Troy a solid 7/10."

Without listing any spoilers, I felt the end of this movie was misleading and reaching, and even a bit cheesy.<br/><br/>The things that I did like were the humanization of Achilles and the depiction of Hector as a great man, not just a hero. The performances of both Brad Pitt and Eric Bana were strong. The battles and fight scenes were also excellent. Of the women, I especially enjoyed Rose Byrne's portrayal of Briseis. Worth the $7.75 investment? I thought it was worth the money, but it's not up to par with other great epics, like Lawrence of Arabia. It is on par with Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra, though I think I enjoyed this historical representation better than Cleopatra. This movie's 2 hr and 50 minute run is mostly story - for better or worse, not a lot of time was spent on pageantry or dancing-girl sequences, though there is some of both.<br/><br/>The screenwriter had a kind of a revisionist view of the dependence on signs from the gods - it makes Priam look stupid when showing him as the only leader of the time who looked to the Heavens for direction, listening to his priests before his sons. I'm sure that the successes and failures on either side of the beach weren't this clear-cut, but then again, this film does not promise to be anything more than fiction and it is just a movie."

Beyond the fact that he was gorgeous, I thought he played Hector well as the moral and reasonable center of the movie.<br/><br/>Thematically, I felt there was an interesting ambiguity to the filmmakers' attitude toward war. The idea of attaining lasting glory through battle was repeated often, but there much less of the glee that Homer displayed in describing the blood and gore of battle. The ultimate senselessness and devastation of war were definitely conveyed at the end of the movie, but we were still left with the idea that a great warrior's name will be remembered long after he is gone."
"praxis18","6","1","2","17 May 2004"," A missed opportunity for true epic movie making.
","After watching ""Troy"" last night, I had mixed feelings at best. I had been looking forward to this latest adaptation of Homer's great epic for the last couple of years. ""The Iliad"" had been my favorite book since I was a kid - I've read several translations over the years, and have also read Homer's ""The Odyssey"", Virgil's ""The Aeneid"", Quintus of Smyrna's ""The Fall of Troy"" (also called the ""Posthomerica""), Aeschylus' ""Agamemnon"", ""The Libation Bearers"" and ""The Eumenides"", Sophocles' ""Ajax"", and Euripides' ""Iphigenia in Aulis"", ""Hecuba"", ""The Trojan Women"" and ""Andromache"" for good measure. These books (along with the now-lost ""Cypria"", ""Aethiopis"", ""Ileupersis"", the ""Little Iliad"" and the ""Nostoi"" of which we have only fragments) provide the complete back-story to the decade-long Trojan War. Finally getting to see a big screen adaptation (with Brad Pitt as Achilles and Aussie hunk Eric Bana as Hector, no less) was certainly an exciting prospect. The last big screen adaptation of ""The Iliad"" was made in the 1956 (""Helen of Troy"") and centred on the characters of Paris and Helen, beautifully portrayed by Jacques Sernas and Rosanna Podesta. Rosanna Podesta looked divine  her face could have launched a thousand ships. The more recent 2003 TV mini-series adaptation, likewise called ""Helen of Troy"", also focused on Paris and Helen. Both the 1956 and the 2003 versions were serviceable, although I disliked the latter version for the number of unforgivable liberties it took with the story of the Trojan War, like having a BALD Vin Diesel wannabe portray a savage, cowardly and irredeemable Achilles.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""Troy"" is typical Hollywood - all pomp and circumstance, blood and gore, with little heart or emotional resonance. ""Troy"" is certainly mixed bag. It is entertaining - there are enough blood and gore to satisfy the blokes and plenty of hunky male flesh (the buffed-up Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, and the lithe and toned Orlando Bloom) to satisfy the ladies. The battle scenes are fantastic, and the climatic fight scene between Brad Pitt's Achilles and Eric Bana's Hector is heart-stopping stuff. If you haven't read Homer, you would probably enjoy it. But if you are a Homer fan, you would probably squirm at the liberties taken with Homer's great epic. In terms of characterisation and back-story development, 2003's 'Helen of Troy' actually did a better job (except for its characterisation of Achilles): you get a much better sense of why Helen and Paris fell in love (and their love for each other was much more convincing than Orlando Bloom and Diana Kruger would have us believe), why Agamemnon hated Troy so (at first, he was merely opportunistic in exploiting Menelaus' distress as a chance to conquer Troy  but the fates and the Gods soon overtake him), and how, despite being a weakling under his brother's thumb, Menelaus is actually a pretty decent man (he was a not a cruel and crude man as 'Troy' portrayed him but truly loved Helen  his honour had to be restored because Paris' act of stealing Helen broke the sacred law that a guest MUST NEVER violate the hospitality that his host has granted  and of course, he survived to bring Helen home to Sparta). And now, for my gripes. There are spoilers ahead, so do not read further if you do not want to know any major plot points in the movie.<br/><br/>1. One of my biggest gripes is the tampering done with Homer's sublime scene in which King Priam of Troy begged Achilles for the body of his son, Hector. In Homer's original, Priam softened Achilles' heart by comparing himself to Achilles' father, King Peleus of Phtia. Once great and noble warriors - both were now old and defenseless men who relied on their sons for love, hope, security and protection. But while Peleus still had hope that Achilles would return from war one day, Priam was devoid of hope since his most beloved son and heir was dead. And Priam had endured what no other man had ever done - kissed the hands of the man who killed so many of his sons. In Homer, it was this appeal to Achilles' feelings for his own father that softened the great warrior's heart. In ""Troy"" however, Achilles' father was supposedly long dead by then, which renders that whole pivotal scene senseless. Achilles' sorrow was stirred by his thoughts of his lonely father waiting fruitlessly for his return  Achilles knew he would be doomed to an early death. Weeping over Hector's body makes no sense otherwise. [Note: Priam actually had 50 sons (and several daughters) with Queen Hecuba and various concubines. Most died during the course of the ten-year war. One son, Helenus, survived the war. Paris died along with the rest, contrary to what 'Troy' suggests.] <br/><br/>2. The Trojan War was supposed to have lasted for TEN long gruelling years. Homer's epic actually covers only several weeks during the ninth year of the war. ""The Iliad"" ends with Hector's funeral, and it is actually other works like ""The Odyssey"", ""The Aeneid"" and ""The Fall of Troy"" that go on to provide the details of how Troy lost the war. And yet ""Troy"" resolved the entire war in a matter of days. In 'Troy', one does not get a sense of how weary and despondent both the Trojans AND the Greeks had become by the end of the ninth year of the war. <br/><br/>3. In one of the final scenes in 'Troy', Paris gave the so-called 'Sword of Troy' to a young stranger named Aeneas who was fleeing the city carrying his aged father. Paris gave the ""Sword of Troy"" to the first Trojan refugee he found? He entrusted the future hope for the Trojan race to an unknown stranger? In the ancient epics, far from being an anonymous refugee, Aeneas was Troy's second best warrior. It was he who fought at the forefront of war with Hector most of the time. It was he who would go on to revive the lot of Trojans by setting up a new colony for the refugees that would later become Rome. [Note 1: When the Roman poet Virgil wrote an epic detailing Rome's origin to celebrate the Emperor Augustus' ascension, he weaved the work called 'The Aeneid', modelled on Homer's 'Iliad', which tells of how Aeneas escaped from the sack of Troy with many Trojan refugees and founded the colony that would later become Rome. 'The Aeneid' also provides a romantic version of how Rome and Carthage came to be such deadly mortal enemies  Aeneas fell in love with Queen Dido of Carthage on his way to Italy  he was commanded by the gods to abandon her and sail on to Italy to fulfill his destiny. Queen Dido committed suicide out of despair, and the enmity between Rome and Carthage was born. Note 2: The 'Sword of Troy' is an artistic license. There was no such thing in the epics. There was, however, the 'Palladium', the sacred statue of Athena that Odysseus and Diomedes stole from Troy - it had been predicted that Troy would never fall as long as the statue resided within its walls. ]<br/><br/>4. In the ancient epics, Patroclus and Achilles grew up together (Patroclus was actually the ELDER cousin) - they were inseparable and were the best of friends. They were probably even lovers (Homer was rather coy about this although the hints are all over the place, and being bisexual was not unusual amongst Greek warriors), which was why the full wrath of Achilles was only unleashed when Hector killed Patroclus. In the 'Iliad', Achilles refused to fight even after Agamemnon had humbled himself by returning Briseis, offering various treasures, and even one of his daughters in marriage, if Achilles would end his sulk and repel the Trojans from the Greek camps. Achilles refused, and Hector came ever closer to burning the ships and slaughtering the entire Greek army. In desperation, Patroclus begged Achilles for the loan of his golden armour  if Achilles himself would not save his Greek friends, Patroclus would disguise himself as Achilles and ride with his much-feared Myrmidon warriors (meaning 'ants', probably an allusion to unstoppable ants with their nasty bites) to fool the Trojans into believing that Achilles himself had come to rescue the Greek army. Achilles agreed, but warned Patroclus to turn back after the Trojans have been driven away from the ships  he must not fight Hector under any circumstances. Patroclus got carried away with the success of his ploy and was killed when he tried to storm the gates of Troy himself. Achilles' wrath was unleashed precisely because he himself caused his beloved Patroclus' death by being so damn proud and stubborn. In ""Troy"", Patroclus was a naive younger cousin who died because he foolishly disobeyed orders. Short of being a completely unmitigated savage, there would have been no reason for Achilles to desecrate Hector's body. [Note: Desecration of the dead body and denial of burial rites are VERY SERIOUS affronts to Greek sensibilities. I did like the small touches in 'Troy' like the coins placed on the eyes of dead bodies to pay Charon, the underworld's ferryman, to carry dead souls across the River Styx.]<br/><br/>5. Where are Cassandra and her dire warnings about Greeks bearing gifts? [Note' Eldest daughter of Priam, Cassandra was cursed with being able to foretell the future but to never have anyone believe her predictions.] Where is Queen Hecuba?<br/><br/>6. The Agamemnon in ""Troy"" is a caricature - the ultimate cruel, corrupt and amoral politician. There is no hint of that most painful of sacrifices that Agamemnon had to make to embark on his war - that very sacrifice that turned him from being merely a greedy and ambitious politician to being a deadly and almost insane enemy to all things Trojan. The sacrifice of Iphigenia, seen so powerfully in 2003's ""Helen of Troy"", should have been in this movie. As should have been Agamemnon's ultimate fate in the hands of HIS OWN WIFE, not Briseis. [Note: In the beginning, Agamemnon, High King of the Greeks, was only making use of Helen as an excuse to expand Greek hegemony in the Aegean Sea. He gathered the massive Greek armada at Aulis to sail for Troy. But the westerly winds that would send the ships on their way to Troy just would not arrive  the Greek armada was stuck at Aulis for months on end. Finally, the High Priest of the Greeks declared that the Gods themselves would not support the Greek cause and send favourable winds unless their High King sacrificed his most treasured possession, his daughter Iphigenia. Agamemnon was desperate  his greed did not extend to sending his daughter to her death  but the other Greek kings demanded the sacrifice because Greek honour must be restored by reclaiming Helen. Agamemnon had no choice but to cave in to the demand. His queen, Clytemnestra (Helen's sister) would never forgive him for the murder of their daughter, and it was she who would hack Agamemnon to death in bloody revenge after he returned from Troy in victory.] <br/><br/>The one bright spot in ""Troy"" is Sean Bean's Odysseus. He's the one character that seems most consistent with how Homer himself would have wanted him portrayed. Sigh ... if I could have my wish, I would take the best elements of all three versions of the Trojan War made so far (""Helen of Troy"" 1956, ""Helen of Troy"" 2003 and ""Troy"" 2004) and combine them into one movie. By all means, watch this movie if you like the swords and sandals genre. But don't go in expecting a faithful adaptation of ""The Iliad"". I can only give ""Troy"" 3 stars out of 5."

"aliaspennylane","6","1","2","16 May 2004"," Needless Destroys The Story
","I just saw Troy... and damn it, I'm confused. I want to love it; as much as I want to hate it. The more I think about it, the more I can't because it's hard to distinguish between the movie and Homer's epic it's based on. David Benioff (the screenwriter) is smart enough to put ""inspired by"" instead of ""based on"" since, clearly this is not the Iliad I love.<br/><br/>Things The Script Got Wrong:<br/><br/>1. Achilles never fought for Agamemnon before the war.<br/><br/>2. Hector never went to Troy.<br/><br/>3. It ignored the Gods and The Golden Apple.<br/><br/>4. The Achaeans and Trojans never wanted Peace.<br/><br/>5. The war takes place over ten years, not days.<br/><br/>6. Menelaus does not die.<br/><br/>7. Achilles dies BEFORE the horse.<br/><br/>8. Upon his homecoming, Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra, and her lover Aegisthus kill him to seek revenge for sacrificing his daughter to Artemis and to gain control of his kingdom.<br/><br/>9. Contrary to popular belief, the Trojan horse isn't even a notion in The Iliad (and is barely mentioned in the Odyssey. The Aenied actually gives the most in-depth story of the sack of Troy).<br/><br/>10. Paris dies.<br/><br/>11. The girl, Chryseis, Achilles falls in love and takes captive is daughter of Chryses, priest of the god Apollo. The daughter is not a priestess nor related to Priam. They mix up this story with the other tale: he fell in love with King Priam's Polyxena (Ploydora in the movie). In this tell, he wishes to marry her and goes to see Paris, who murdered him when they met; furthermore after the sack of Troy Polyxena is slaughtered on the grave of Achilles.<br/><br/>11. The screenplay opts to leave out the meeting between Odysseus and Priam to end the war peacefully. <br/><br/>12. Hector's baby cries because he sees his daddy with the shield on, not because Hector leaves!<br/><br/>13. Sinon is left behind by the Greeks (buried in the sand up to his head) to trick the Trojans into accepting the Horse. It's not Paris who warns of the horse, but the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons, whom tells Priam, ""Timeo danaos et dona ferentis"" (""I fear Greek, even bearing gifts"").<br/><br/>14. The Trojan Horse was a gift to ATHENA!!!!<br/><br/>15. Apollo sided with the Greeks because Chryses prays for his assistance.<br/><br/>16. The Greeks never sack Apollo's temple.<br/><br/>17. Achilles meets with his mother after Agamemnon steals Chryseis away, not before he goes.<br/><br/>18. Hector's wife survives, but his child is thrown over the wall.<br/><br/>19. Helen goes back with Menelaus.<br/><br/>20. Paris does not give Aeneas the sword of the city; moreover they escape because Aphrodite (Venus in the Aenied) assists him.<br/><br/>21. Pyrrhus also called Neoptolemus, murders Priam and Priam's sons in front of Aeneas' eyes. Agamemnon does not kill Priam.<br/><br/>Things They Script Got Right:<br/><br/>1. The hatred between Achilles and Agamemnon.<br/><br/>2. The honor of Hector and his love for country and child.<br/><br/>3. The love between Achilles and Patroclus.<br/><br/>4. The death of: Ajax, Patroclus, Hector, (and somewhat right Achilles).<br/><br/>5. The scene between Achilles and Priam went Achilles agrees to give Hector back and have a twelve-day armistice.<br/><br/>But... the real question still looms? Is it any good?<br/><br/>Yes and no. The worse comparison one could make is ""It's not a good a Gladiator"". Well, Gladiator is a completely different movie. It's more personal and intimate, a rich character driven story with battle scenes sent in Ancient Rome. Troy is an epic, based on the Iliad, the ""first and last real novel"". So, for those expecting to see another Gladiator, you will be disappointed; and you have been misinformed.<br/><br/>It certainly is a beautiful film to watch: the sets, costumes, extras, battle scenes, cinematography, and directing is rich in the Old Hollywood epic. The final battle scene between Hector and Achilles is superb.<br/><br/>The acting is spectacular for what's there. Brad Pitt has received mixed to bad reviews for the leading role, however he didn't disappoint me. True, there where times he was doing some ""pouty-appear to be deep thinking-eyebrow"" acting, which I groaned at (because that is not the Pitt who won me over in Fight Club or suitable for the character). But, in the end, he comes through.<br/><br/>Additionally, as much as I want to hate Orlando Bloom, he was good as Paris. He played him right, as the weak and feeble boy surrounded by men. Brain Cox is deliciously evil (even though he overacts at points) as Agamemnon. Peter O'Toole is simply brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. But Eric Bana might possibly be the best of the bunch, playing Hector as the honorable hero, who loves his son and fatherland.<br/><br/>What Troy comes down to is the script. David Benioff fills it with long-winded superlatives and self-righteousness that doesn't always work. At times there's no momentum and the picture feels like it just stops. But, when it works, it works perfectly and entertains.<br/><br/>If you know nothing about the Iliad, go and enjoy. If you can read it in Ancient Greek, you are warned.<br/><br/>***/*****"

","While I can't give a full review of this movie, if that's what you call it, as I walked out after the first 2 hours of punishment, I will say what I can. Being something of a fan of Greek mythology I was curious to see the adaptation here. I was curious to see if Hollywood was going to score with a good true to life story or if they were going to produce some disgusting hybrid perversion and call it a blockbuster. Sadly, it seems the latter is true. There are few movies I wish to fall asleep during and I was praying for the bliss of unconsciousness while watching this movie to save myself the pain of driving a screwdriver through my head later to try and forget it. The rather unnecessary appearance of Brad Pitt in various degrees of nudity with 1 or 2 women at a time was totally unwarranted. The problem with this film is it told too many stories. After the first hour I was hoping for the big invasion of Troy only to be subjected to another painful hour of Orlando Bloom whining like a sissy, Eric Bana making a very commanding performance, probably the best in the movie, and Brad Pitt naked again for the hundredth time. Into the second hour my hopes were again dashed for the invasion of Troy when dorko (Brad Pitt) in the tin armour has to challenge Hector because he's all upset that his irresponsible kill crazy cousin went off and got himself killed at the hand of Hector. I was only too glad to see the little twerp die. Maybe then I wouldn't have to put up with his redundant whining about being able to go to war and kill. I wasn't sure who needed to be slapped more, the whiny cousin who wants to kill and cries about it from his appearance in the movie to his death or Achilles for dragging him around everywhere. Unfortunately for the special effects team, their army magic had no effect on me. It takes a lot more then that to impress. A good movie to go along with it is a big start. So, in closing, if you're looking to see Brad Pitt half-naked and sweaty acting badly to an intolerable story, and dentist-drill-during-invasive-root-canal-surgery like acting on the part of Orlando Bloom, Troy is the movie for you. Just don't forget to ask God's forgiveness afterwards for wasting that much of your life that could have been better spent watching Facts of Life re-runs. The only consolation I have is that I didn't pay to see this movie and I saw it at half-price."

","The big screen version of the Illiad does not follow the epic novel for page to page. In fact you could say that Peterson revamped it to make it much more realistic and Hollywood. The Trojans (led by Eric Bana) battle the Spartans (led by Brian Cox and Brad Pitt) in a fight over the stealing of King Menelaus's (Brendan Gleeson, looking like Amish again) wife Helen (some model with limited acting skills). Orlando Bloom plays Paris, the brother of Hector (Bana) and the stealer of Helen. War breaks out til few of the main characters are left and then the infamous horse is born. Some may find the flick long, but I feel it was just the right amount. Pitt is the man of the movie, and is solid at best in a role that needed more. His acting skills are limited. Bloom doesn't get much to work with but you do get to see him fire a few arrows. Bana is the standout as the honorable Hector, along with Cox playing the super evil Agamemnon.

","OK, first things first: It is a great movie and I'm certainly going to buy the DVD. And: Forget about the Iliad - it's not there. So just sit back and enjoy.<br/><br/>Having read all those negative reviews in here my expectations were rather low but at the very least I thought I might enjoy all that ""eye candy"" everyone was talking about. So I went and I was agreeably surprised in many respects.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was entirely believable in his role as proud and fearless hero Achilles. Determined to make a legend out of himself. Beautiful to behold. With fascinating fighting technique - I especially liked how he used his shield. And he had some great lines like: ""Go. It's too early in the day for killing princes"" Such noble gestures, delivered with such complete self-assurance. True hero stuff. Great performance - Congratulations !<br/><br/>The second most impressive figure was, in my opinion and to my own surprise, Brian Cox as Agamemnon. He impersonated that ruthless and powerful king so well and with such obvious relish that it was a real pleasure to watch. I actually liked him better than Peter O'Toole's Priam.<br/><br/>Third one to mention must of course be Eric Bana. I DO think that Eric Bana was a very good Hector but maybe not the best possible. Guess it's a rather difficult character to cast - find a compromise between wit and muscles. After all, Hector is the (unheard) voice of reason in all this drama and not just Troy's war hero. An actor like Sean Bean might have added a little spice (though maybe not the muscles...) to a truly valiant and likable but rather boring character. <br/><br/>Speaking about Sean Bean - what about Odysseus? Sean Bean is a superb actor and was perfect for the role. He easily delivered the irony and mischievousness that one would expect of Odysseus. It would be great to see him in the Odyssey. <br/><br/>Everybody is praising Peter O'Toole's performance to the sky and he IS a good Priam. But then he's Peter O'Toole and one would expect no less from him. I don't think that the scene in the tent with Achilles is the best in the film though. (My favourite is the one at the Apollo temple with Achilles and Hector) <br/><br/>I also would like to mention the incredible blue eyes of Vincent Regan as Eudorus.<br/><br/>So what about Orlando Bloom? Being the despicable and cowardly Paris with those inane lines did nothing for his reputation as an actor. A little less empty pathos and a bit more charm would have improved that character no end.<br/><br/>And what about the girls? They were all pretty and all rather unremarkable. Rose Byrne as Briseis had the advantage of a love scene with Brad Pitt (who wouldn't envy her there...?) and a few more meaningful lines than the other women. But all in all they were just decoration. I liked Julie Christie as Thetis though her role was tiny.<br/><br/>The story: Well, it was based on the Iliad but mostly ignored it. Never mind, it's still fun to watch.<br/><br/>Computer graphics: Others said it before me and I have to agree. It was not as good as LOTR. Nothing spectacular and often quite obvious.<br/><br/>Costumes: Now that was a real disappointment. Sometimes it looked like as if they were just wearing some towels or bedsheets. Armour often looked like plastic. What was really, really good: The wigs! All those ppl had great hair :-)<br/><br/>Music: After watching the trailer I expected great music but must say that it was nothing special.<br/><br/>Still, it was very good entertainment: Go see it. 9 out of 10"

"gregsrants","5","1","2","16 May 2004"," Troy falls by the weight of its faults
","Labeled an adaptation of Homer's epic Iliad, Troy is the second of the 2004 summer blockbusters to hit theatres in as many weeks. Unfortunately, Troy ends up being ever the same disappointment as Van Helsing was one week earlier. <br/><br/>Troy is directed by Wolfgang Peterson who is no stranger to the blockbuster genre or the impact of star power within his celluloid vision. The Wolfman was behind the camera for such big screen bonanzas as The Perfect Storm with George Clooney, Air Force One with Harrison Ford and In The Line Of Fire with Clint Eastwood. A director who first took our notice in 1981 with the multi-nominated film Das Boot, Peterson has been consistent in bringing a high level of entertainment to the general masses. <br/><br/>So when he decided on Troy as his next venture Hollywood began lining up to secure roles in what was surely to be a summer spectacle that would whet the appetite of those gladiators and warriors that have been left salivating since 2000's Gladiator. Brad Pitt, Eric Bana (Hulk) and Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) signed up before the contract ink was even dry (Brad even leaving the long limbo'd The Fountain) and lesser known character actors like Brian Cox (The 25th Hour) and Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later) were happy to don metal skirts in the desert heat to help bring this reported $200 million epic to all those who waited for the movie instead of reading the poems. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, plotting the pros and cons after the film, I found more entries in the right hand column than the left. Brad Pitt's chiseled bod gets notice. The set design and location shoots seem authentic, some of the battle sequences are above average and I would be remiss if I didn't mention how good it was to see the blue eyed Peter O'Toole standing stoic among his young protégés. <br/><br/>But unfortunately, that is where my love affair with the film ends. I can't blame the story. A love and war epic where the Trojans are pitted against the Greeks after a young Paris (Bloom) steals Helen away from her husband Menelaus. In an effort to save face and seek revenge, Menelaus then requests the aide of his brother, the ruthless Agamemnon, who has aspirations of world dominance and uses the uncontrollable Achilles (Pitt) to assist him the conquering of nations. Combined, they sail 1,000 ships to Troy in attempts to extract Helen from her new love while writing their name in history for conquering an army that has long defended its walls.<br/><br/>Even typing the story in summary, I am given goose bumps with the potential of the undertaking. But for a scattering of faults throughout the elongated 160-minute running time, Troy becomes as forgettable as each of the hard to pronounce names of its characters. And that's where it is really too bad, for it is not one glaring thing that sinks this aggressive attempt, but rather, the little things that just build up or keep annoying you.<br/><br/>We can start with the dialogue that just doesn't fit in the era it is suggested. When Achilles rages that 'Before my time is done I will look down upon your corpse and smile', I couldn't help but think that the DVD outtakes reel will show the actors breaking up with roaring laughter when the director yelled cut'. Pitt in particular is given enough cheesy lines throughout his screen presence that I honestly felt bad for him knowing how much work he put into his physical appearance and how all I will remember at the end of the experience was that he was not the heroic orator of battle speeches as say William Wallace in Braveheart.<br/><br/>And when there was no dialogue, I was equally annoyed with the musical score. Wolfgang Peterson rejected the original score by Gabriel Yared and I wonder how much worse it could have been than the cross between the Islamic sounds of Black Hawk Down and the tense moments of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan that James Horner put together. <br/><br/>But let's face it, we see the trailers and we expect epic battles and it is here that Troy really disappointed. It is not as if the sequences were not well engaged, it is just that they have all been done before and better. The first battle sequence on the beaches of Troy between Achilles and his men and the Trojans seemed so meticulously choreographed that I expected Fred Astaire to jump in and perform a little soft shoe. The battle sequences that had been done so well in Braveheart and perfected in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, was nothing new in Troy if not for maybe a wider camera angle. Even the speeches before the battles to the troops were hollow and couldn't inspire a kindergarten class to begin colouring let alone ask thousands to lay down their lives for their country. <br/><br/>It has been well documented in the media how difficult this movie was to make. The war in Iraq, various weather mishaps and an injury to Mr. Pitt ballooned the budget and dragged the film on longer than anticipated. The result of these delays may be the reason why the elements don't work as a whole. Some of Pitt's scenes seem rushed and Brian Cox overacts and he looks annoyed as if maybe he was doing a scene months after he had said good-bye to his character. <br/><br/>I expect Troy to be a success with the general public. There are enough male heartthrobs to keep the women lined up and enough expected violence to keep the men holding their hands. It's just too bad they couldn't adapt what was such an interesting story into something that David Lean would rise from his grave to but a ticket for. It is now the second week of the summer blockbusters, and I hope that Shrek 2 is the Trojan horse.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

But the funny thing is back then they made it the other way round: Roland Emmerich made an epic movie (""the patriot"") and Wolfgang Peterson a movie about natural disaster (""the perfect storm""). <br/><br/>Anyway thumbs up and 8/10 for Troy."

This is a tragedy where no one wins.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is probably weakest in his performance, but with Paris being an unmoving character I think the movie conveys even better the pointlessness of war and the worthlessness of the glory that for example Achilles is trying to reach.<br/><br/>The music was probably what bothered me the most and is certainly the movie's low.

But there are some things that rob this movie from a soul.<br/><br/>Let's start with the main actors.<br/><br/>Eric Bana: What a surprise! This guy probably had the best performance of the movie. The role of Hector had some emotions he could play with, and Bana did this pretty good. He had the best non-verbal acting of the movie. Maybe something he learned on the Hulk? At first I thought, why the heck did they cast him as the greatest warrior of Troy? But he had a strong physical and emotional presence. He looked lean and strong and it was nice to see that you don't have to be a cliché'd pretty boy like Pitt or a massive barbarian type to play a convincing great warrior.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt: As Achilles he's supposed to be an 'einselganger' gloryhound but still the audience is supposed to sympathize with him. But I don't know... Something was wrong. He was neither a convincing glory hound or a sympathetic character. Maybe he should have shown more pleasure in showing of his excellent fighting skills or fighting, but he was very stoic. That's my overall critique of Pitt, he's to emotionless.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom: Not that bad a performance as a egocentric, naive boy.<br/><br/>Then the other thing that disturbed me. The music. Come on man... Music is supposed to show the emotions of the moment. This soundtrack was to much of a generic bombastic type. Not very cued in on what was happening on the screen. It seemed like the composer must have thought: as long as it sounds orchestral and big we shouldn't pay any further attention. Not that this was always so, but most of the time it was. It tried to mimic Gladiator's epic classic score, but fails miserably. Not a lot of recognisable themes.<br/><br/>But still I give this an 8. Although the movie lacks passion, it still is a great movie to look at and I'm a sucker for great epic battles, well choreographed duels and swords& armor."
"jon_m_hunter","6","1","2","15 May 2004"," Nothing too special
","Troy was great visually though I've been getting used to these large battles sans guns since LOTR so I've been a little dulled to them. The city of Troy, though very not-historical, was beautiful and portrayed much as we think Ancient Greek places must look. All the boats were very nicely done, though it doesn't look like they are being rowed very hard sometimes. Costumes were very nicely done too, though its hard to tell which side is which mid battle.<br/><br/>I know in the beginning it says ""based on The Iliad"" but I really think it could have been a better representation of the great Greek Epic. It could have used some sweet Gods fighting amongst themselves and aiding the people to clear up parts of the story. They really had WAY more to do with the war than is remotely acknowledged in the film. It would have been difficult to do, but if it was done well-enough, it would have separated this film from others of the style. Paris's love in the beginning also could have been explained 100% better with the whole Hera/Aphrodite story.<br/><br/>Speaking of the little coward, Orlando Bloom's voice is getting just plain annoying. Hes getting type-casted as the little weenie ladies man who is willing to sacrifice the British navy or some great ancient people just so he can get the hot girl. I'm getting a little tired of it. If he wants to prove himself to be a decent actor, and not some teen phenom, then he needs to show that he can do other types of parts. I knew he was Paris, so he killed Achilles (also not the way in the Iliad and also involving gods) but I was rooting for someone to smite the puny wuss. I kept wanting him and his little lame pick-up lines and quips about his true love to get off the screen in favor of Brad Pitt being cool.<br/><br/>Other complaints: Some of the battle clips are really lame. You see like one or two people hitting others in a very fake/unrealistic way. One of the scenes in Agamemnon's ship is simply horrible. Its supposed to be comic relief I think except for the fact that its not funny at all. The Trojan King (forgot the name) is overdone in a few scenes. Achilles's cousin is almost as annoying as Paris.<br/><br/>The good: Agamemnon's thirst for power was very well done. Fireballs rolling down the dunes were sweet. Hector and Achilles fight scene was spectacular. Great great choreography and well acted on both sides.<br/><br/>It was definitely a preview to the big-budget summer movies to come.<br/><br/>Overall - 6/10 - might have been a 5 if there weren't some good hecklers behind me"

","As a Literature Major, it was hard to go to a movie when I knew that it would be based off of one of the most incredible epics ever written. I feared for the accuracy, but told myself that I must see it with an open mind and understanding. While I can tell you now that many things about the movie were inaccurate, I can understand that they were decided upon for good reasons and overall, the movie was a plus.<br/><br/>As a movie fan, I think Troy was exceptional. The action was well choreographed, the visuals absolutely stunning at times, and I honestly believe that the actors were chosen very well for each character. I would like to state now that Eric Bana absolutely stole the show as Hector, I believe. When he was on the screen, you felt riveted and moved by his stellar performance. He managed to bring all aspects of the complicated character of Hector (father, son, prince, warrior, leader, husband, brother) to light and you truly felt for this man. It could have been done terribly in the hands of a bad actor, but Eric Bana really shone.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom were well suited to their characters, and both performed up to expectation, but I fear they were just outmatched by the talent of Bana and the overall better character of Hector. Yet Pitt did a very good job of showing many sides of the angry, troubled Achilles, so you both loathed and sympathized with the warrior. Bloom also brought a bit of sympathy to the playboy-like Paris, who otherwise always seemed a coward and a foolish man. In Troy, he was both, but also you felt pity for his position and Paris seemed like a very simple, young boy thrown into a pit of larger-than-life heroes, and he just could not compete. Bloom pulled that off well. <br/><br/>Overall, the acting was admirable, and I give it a thumbs up."

","Lets go with the bad first: I loved the Greek mythology about the Trojan War, and this movie needed to stick to it more. The screenwriter for this movie was an idiot! Every major Greek who dies, with the exception of Achilles, either lived longer in the siege than they did in the movie, or died at home-whether by violence or old age. <br/><br/>*SPOILER* That little candy-ass Paris needed to die, since he actually does in the myths. He pegs Achilles and dies shortly after. But does the idiot writing the script bother to get that right? No! The whole point of things was that Paris doesn't survive and Helen is returned to Menelaus! *END SPOILER* <br/><br/>Secondly, where were (for starters) Sarpedon and Teucer? They're some of the more essential characters in the Iliad. Telamon and Little Ajax would have been nice to see too.<br/><br/>Thirdly, why do we straight guys have to be subjected to seeing Brad Pitt's naked ass on several occasions and not get to see Diane Kruger (Helen) topless in full detail?<br/><br/>The good: It's still a reasonably good epic battle movie with a great score."
"gilmoure","Null","1","2","15 May 2004"," A quick review
","'ve seen the movie. I rate it a C Minus.<br/><br/>To start with, I prefer the Fitzgerald translation, which is in verse and uses the Greek form of the names (Akilleus, Aias, etc.). This movie was appernetly 'inspired' by another translation.<br/><br/>Traditionally, Odysseus was the one that had to be persuaded to join in the attack on Troy. He even pretended to be mad, by sowing a field with salt, when approached about the war. He was a little too easy going here.<br/><br/>Another problem I have is that Akilleus was a kid when he left for the war (14-16yr old) when he set sail. He gained his rep on the way there, no before hand.<br/><br/>Nestor should have been more ""Back when I was young, we had real men"", etc., yada yada yada.<br/><br/>Sean Connery should have been in this film. He played a great Agammemnon in Time Bandits.<br/><br/>Would have been nice to see about 1000 times more chariots. The chariots were great, however. Might have to try to make one sometime.<br/><br/>Some major story elements were changed. I don't really understand why.<br/><br/>Over all, it's a pretty good flick, if you're just somewhat familiar with the tale. Peter O'Toole played a great Priam. Would have loved to hear him deliver the speech that the player king does in Hamlet (Charleton Heston in Brannagh Hamlit), on the death of Hecuba. That would have been cool. Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana were great in their roles. Wish Bana had gotten the Aragorn role in LotR."

","Well, After seeing this film I can tell you the one thing that made an amazing movie into only a good flick, the music. The music is terrible. Particularly the horrible song during the ending credits. The music of this movie just didn't connect well to the action playing out in the movie. And bongos or what ever drum was used for the climactic battle scene with Achilles and Hector, are not an effective means to convey the drama of the moment. <br/><br/>I don't see what the big deal is about Brad Pitt's Achilles. While there may have been other actors who could do the role as well as he did, he didn't do a bad job. The script could have used a little tweaking, a little less reminding to the movie going public that the Illiad is such a great and lasting work would have been nice. But all in all the music failed to convey the power behind the events, not the actors or the script."

","Yesterday i bought a ticket to go and watch Troy as it was the premiere in the UK and i was really curious to watch this movie as it is a story which i read when i was 10 years old (yes I'm Greek).<br/><br/>The movie was quite what i was expecting regarding the battles the visual effects, the actors, the scenery even the soundtrack.<br/><br/>BUT....!<br/><br/>The story is manipulated in a way that Greece is again looking as if we are somehow a threat to the world or as if we do have history but it is somehow a bad history. I can explain in an other way why they changed the scenario so much. The Greeks in the movie were like barbarians or as if they were the bad guys. Oh yeah the Trojans were very innocent even Hector was a very good guy. Oh Paris managed to stay alive and even more he got away with Helen.. (yeah right). Did i forgot to tell u that depsite Homer stating that Achilles was immortal he could still suffer of injuries in the movie?? Or maybe Agamemnon was killed in the battle and not from his wife when he went back to Greece?? Or Menelaus being killed by Hector?? Where are the gods in this film? Who told Paris where was Achilles weak part of his body (maybe Apollon should be the one, i don't know i'm just guessing)?<br/><br/>
Well i don't know what to say. I don't see the reason for manipulating the truth so much. Who do they think they are anyway? Have they ever read the true story? Or maybe they think they are better than a man who lived about 3000 years ago and he wrote several stories and myths which are still being regarded as remarkable?<br/><br/>Anyway the film is quite good (Brad Pitt fits very good with the role of Achilles) but for god sake present people the truth and not anyhting else.<br/><br/>
I'm very very very disappointed with this film (if anyone is really interested to know the truth read the real story and you'll see what i mean)<br/><br/>Good film to watch if you are not interested in the story part (especially for girls i.e. Brad Pitt Orlando Bloom e.t.c.)<br/><br/>5/10"

I spy the villain from Braveheart!  Wasn't she the one in Gladiator? I always try to give each cast of characters a fair chance to tell their story.  However, this movie was so replete with actors from other movies, that I found it very distracting from an otherwise thoroughly entertaining movie. Of course the cinematography and special effects were breathtaking. Yes, as was Brad Pitt.  The writing was solid and I appreciated the fact that I never noticed a word being used which would have been out of place for the time period (I said noticed).  No one, with the exception of Peter O'Toole, gave an Oscar performance.  However that may be because of the parts themselves provided little opportunity. Lastly, for those of you reviewers bagging on Brad Pitt, give it up. Admit it.  He became Achilles, not Fight Club, not Thelma and Louise.  He was able to shake off the past and make me believe in the story of Troy."

The end is really let down as it seemed to me that they left out a few key scenes that would have rounded the film off nicely. the film takes to large a focus on Achilles and not on Helen and Paris. since they were (aside from the giant greed issue) the cause of the war, it would make sense to have some sort of reflection on how so many people died for the love of 2. but they dont. and it really let the film down."

The cousin, sorry cannot remember her name, of Hector and Paris was more watchable than Helen at her best..battles were interesting especially when the Trojans rolled the bails of hay or whatever they were down the hill into the Greek camp......I found NONE of the Greeks, but Odysseus of any interest......half way thru the film I was wondering if the director intended for me to feel that way??????.......the part about them finding the horse and looking at the leftovers on the beach apparently loaded with plague.....what kind of mind drags a horse, that came from a plague infested camp,into a city???????"

Orlando Bloom was definitely not at his best. I would say that this was a pretty good movie, but considering the budget, it certainly ranks well below other massive epic expenses like Gladiator or Braveheart.

"trevorstacyluke","Null","1","2","15 May 2004"," Travesty of ""Troy""
","In my final year of college I dreamed of writing a screenplay for one of the greatest stories ever told: Homer's ""Iliad"", the poem that inspired me to pursue a degree in Classics. I was drawn in by Achilles, a semi-divine warrior who is dishonored by a lackluster commander, and whose heart-wrenching loss of his closest friend draws him back to the fateful conflict he had sworn off.<br/><br/>Homer's genius was to take disparate traditions and weave them into the unified tale of Achilles' wrath. The failure of Petersen's ""Troy"" is that in trying to capture the entire story of the Trojan War in a single movie, his movie becomes a giant narrative centrifuge, sending various bits Troy-tradition spinning off singly into an incomprehensible oblivion. How does he do it? By trying to glom on to anything the average university-educated viewer, or swords-and-sandals epic buff might remember about the Trojan War, and by not settling on any unified vision for his own film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Though I love the ""Iliad"", have read many translations of the poem, and have read portions of it in Greek, I am also a reasonable movie-goer. My first demand is that I be entertained for the 8 bucks I deposit at the box-office. It wasn't the fact that his movie wasn't faithful to Homer that most bothered me. Rather, it was Petersen's utter inability to make the psychological motivations of his characters believable for the audience, or capitalize effectively on any of the half-clever ideas which did find their way into the script that managed to keep me at a distance for a full 162 minutes.<br/><br/>*Spoiler warning* Here's an example of a half-clever idea: in Petersen's film, Patroclus becomes a young cousin of Achilles whom we first meet when Odysseus comes to recruit a full-grown Achilles. Achilles is training a young Patroclus in fancy swordplay. Benioff chose to replace the older companion with a younger relative, perhaps to play on the topoi of 1) brothers who go to war, 2) the young man who wants to fight before he is old enough, and 3) confrontation with the death of family on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Differences in the Achilles-Patroclus relationship impact the story. ""Troy"", like Homer, has Patroclus confront Achilles in tears, distraught over the loss of Greek life and Achilles' apparent unconcern for it. Whereas in Homer, Patroclus volunteers to fight in Achilles place, in ""Troy"" we are shocked to see Achilles inexplicably charging against the Trojans to be cut down in a premature (for Homeric tradition) duel with Hector. Wow. Anyone who knows the Iliad is in total shock that the story has departed so much from the ""original"", at least for a second, until he or she remembers that Patroclus first takes the field against the Trojans when Achilles refuses to do so. This gesture almost works because of the educated viewer's uncertainty about how far the filmmakers are willing to depart from Homer.<br/><br/>In ""Troy"" it is only when Hector pulls off Achilles' helmet that he (and we) discovers that this is not Achilles at all, but Patroclus. Thus Hector, in his short-lived triumph, faces the prospect of death at the hands of the real Achilles. Unlike Homer, who in Greek fashion does not conceive of narrative ""surprises"", Benioff has given the audience the kind of twist that is suitable for modern movie audiences. Unfortunately we have been given so little material upon which to build sympathy for Patroclus, that the flash of half-cleverness carries no emotional thunder. Petersen's Patroclus is a vacant pretty-boy, who reveals Brad Pitt's weaknesses as a casting-choice for Achilles rather than shoring them up by way of contrast. *Spoiler end*<br/><br/>Other problems: just because Christopher Marlowe penned immortal lines about the ""thousand ships"" Helen's beauty launched, and computer-graphics wizards have the ability to put them to sea, does not make the vision dramatic on the screen. Rather than compensate for the script's lack of real passion or soul, the giant Greek fleet and epic mass of opposing armies accent the vacancy of the film, replacing gaping awe with empty yawns. Also, the art department really falls down in depicting the Greek gods, whose laughable depiction in paper-mache statuary emphasizes their embarrassing absence from the narrative.<br/><br/>Plusses: Whatever one might think of Petersen's and Benioff's choices regarding the characters Agamemnon and Menelaus, I loved the casting of this fumbling duo. Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson pull off the swagger and bluster of this seasoned pair of over-reaching brigands with real aplomb. Saffron Burrows as Andromache completely overshadowed Diane Kruger's Helen, proving that the combination of real acting and a-typical beauty will always trump the picture-perfect, yet vacant beauty of Hollywood mannequins. Peter O'Toole did an admirable job with a hopeless role as Priam.<br/><br/>Biggest gripe: the love stories. Here is where my Homer most interferes with my ""Troy"" experience, though I feel I am justified. Petersen and Benioff turn the doomed episode of erotomania between a serial seductress (Helen) and a beautiful boy-toy (Paris), into a would-be touching romance between a dewey-eyed teenage ""playa"", Orlando Bloom, and the abovementioned mannequin, Diane Kruger, whose forced attempts at real emotion are never quite credible. Then there is the putatively parallel romance between Achilles and Briseis, which is far less believable than the Bloom-Kruger match.<br/><br/>Why is the Briseis-Achilles romance so off-putting? First, in the Iliad Briseis is a prize of war. Achilles refers to her in material terms as a ""prize of honor"", physical evidence of his prowess and achievement on the battlefield. Just as lions and men do not make deals (to paraphrase Achilles' words to a pleading Hector), lions and human prizes generally don't move back and forth between mutual disregard and tender romance in a story covering several weeks (the apparent length of the conflict in Petersen's Troy).<br/><br/>Petersen should have taken his relationship cues more from Homer than contemporary Hollywood blockbusters. Every reader of Homer knows that the single sympathetic romantic relationship of the poem is between Hector and Andromache (if one excludes Achilles and Patroclus, and I am not sure why we should). The lust of Paris and the ownership of Achilles strike the modern reader as negative contrasts to the true family feeling that exists in the household of Hector, Andromache, and their son Astyanax. Oddly in ""Troy"" the same is true, though not by design; Bana, Burrows, and baby are the only group that excite real emotional sympathy, the epic pairings of Bloom and Kruger and Pitt and Byrne, for all their looks, are nothing short of annoying.<br/><br/>Conclusion: as I endured ""Troy"" (and I noticed many people around me checking their watches periodically), there were moments when I was less irritated. I saw stray pins of light poking through the morass of ineptitude, spanning the ages back to Homer. If you know the ""Iliad"", and are curious to see how badly it can be hatcheted yet again by the modern Hollywood movie mill, you might want to check out ""Troy"" on video. Frankly the big screen doesn't really improve the experience enough to justify the extra outlay of cash. If you are the average movie-goer looking for an entertaining diversion, unless your standards are pretty low, I'd say give it a miss. ""Troy"" is not engaging enough to hold your attention for more than half an hour, neither is it bad enough to be amusingly campy."

"amesherway","6","1","2","14 May 2004"," Stiff and over-reaching, but worth sitting through. *spoilers herein*
","Troy was worth watching once but little else. It was not particularly well written; both the dialogue and the plot were stiff and at times seemed fairly irrelevant. This was especially true in the first half of the film. The entire set-up of the abduction of Helen and each individual's motivation to fight the war seemed very contrived and unexplained, and we were veritably bashed over the head with the fight-for-glory routine. Smaller plot points, such as the death of Achilles' cousin, the union of Polydora and Achilles, seemed inevitable and clichéd. My basis for judging cliché is if I can guess it before it happens, it's not original enough. I had several consummated guesses during this movie. It is admittedly difficult to make a 'surprising' movie based off of a familiar legend, so I had no qualms with the large story arch, but rather smaller moments that seemed a little too predictable. I was expecting the visceral aspects of this film to make up for the writing, but unfortunately my hopes were not met. It was visually over-reaching and overdramatic, with far too many close-ups on dramatic eyes and lip twitches and slow-motions of arm swings and leaps. It wasn't bad, by any means; I was, again, expecting it to be visually grandiose. But it tried a little too hard. There were good visual moments, however, like the armada of Greek ships, or the entire fight sequence between Achilles and Hector. The acting was passable; again, referencing the dialogue, actors can only work with what they've been given. Certain actors were nice on the eyes, of course, which again was expected (although [irrelevant as this is, of course] I prefer the lanky psychotic Brad Pitt of Fight Club and Twelve Monkeys). The actresses, I must admit, did not fill their meagre supporting roles as well, with the exception of Siri Svegler, niece of the king. Brad Pitt made a pretty good glory-driven war hero, not awe-inspiring but quite acceptable, and though Orlando Bloom seemed uncharacteristically uncomfortable in his sissy pretty-boy role, he warmed up to it by the end. The real dramatic achievement in this film was made by Eric Bana, who played Hector Prince of Troy marvelously. Mr. Bana was, by far, the main reason I kept watching this film. He carried it all the way to his inevitable (and quite literal) biting of the dust. Sean Bean, in the supporting role of Odysseus, was as excellent as he always is Despite the flaws just described, Troy was a watchable movie. It also seemed to gain momentum as it went on, and whereas I was skeptical and about ready to leave the theater during the first half, I felt a few prickles of tears come to my eyes despite myself during the deaths of the major characters (and really, it was most of them). The set-up could have been better, but the climax was entertainingly reached nonetheless. All in all, not bad; a bit more visual modesty as well as better-flowing dialogue and set-up would have made it far better, but as it is, I give it a 6/10."
"mcaughey","5","1","2","15 May 2004"," Not shirtless enough...
","While the semi-nude Pitt scenes and shirtless Bana and Bloom were nice, it doesn't make up for the fact that the movie was way too long.   Most of the characters were intolerable, save Bana's Hector and O'Toole's Priam.  Even 'hero' Achilles was hard to like because of his frequent ego-trips and treatment of Briese before Agamemnon found her and after his cousin dies.  Bloom's Paris is appropriately whiny and spoiled, so it's more amusing than heroic when the scaredy-cat brings down Achilles.  When Hector and Priam weren't on screen, my interest was gone."
"AJAbalahin","Null","1","2","15 May 2004"," Despite Myself, I enjoyed it...

At a certain point, Paris runs into Aeneas (carrying Anchises, of course) and gives him something. I hope I didn't ruin the moment for the rest of the theater by laughing heartily for about thirty seconds, but at the same time I could not help feeling giddily uplifted by the same abuse of the traditional story.<br/><br/>First, a word on the sets and costumes.  When staging the Homeric world, I think one only has two choices: 1) stage it as reflecting Classical Greek culture (architecture, costumes, weaponry of, say, Periclean Athens), i.e. contemporary to the audience of the Iliad we are most familiar with; or 2) to go out all hog and stage it as reflecting Mycenean Greek culture, i.e. contemporary with the events remembered however distantly in the epic itself.<br/><br/>This movie mixes the two styles, Classical and Mycenean, usually with infelicitous results (though often not unpretty). The bricolage that the movie inflicts on the Trojans is fascinating:  there is everything from Egyptian colossi to intricate jewelry that I thought odd until I realized that they must echo the gold in Schliemann's hoard.<br/><br/>For novelty's sake, I'd prefer a Mycenean rendering:  wouldn't a real Mycenean-looking Iliad be a salutary defamiliarization?  If we want to modernize the epic, why don't we bring in what modern scholarship has discovered -- that Paris (Alexandros) may have actually been a historical figure, the Alaksandush mentioned in Hittite records as a troublemaker in western Anatolia?<br/><br/>To get on to some weightier matters... the movie has an anti-religious subtext, I think, one that hardly squares with the mindset of the epic itself.  Except for Achilles' mother, the gods, so prominent in the Iliad, are invisible and mute.  Even Hector voices skepticism in the gods even as he affirms how he has always honored them.  There is an implication that decisions made out of piety (above all the decision to bring in the Horse) are always mistakes.<br/><br/>Oddly for a secularizing reading of the Iliad, it recasts the heroes, including most egregiously Achilles, in a quasi-Christian mode more appropriate to the ""Chanson de Roland.""  Achilles weeps, feels pity and remorse, etc. -- he is also chivalrous when it comes to the ladies.<br/><br/>That brings me to the subject of Patroclus.  I pretty much expected a Hollywood movie to refuse to touch with a ten-foot pole the gay romance at the heart of the epic.  The movie makes him a ""beloved younger cousin"" to Achilles and, at least to my taste, cast someone who is hardly as lustable over as Pitt, Bana, or Orlando (which by every rights Achilles' lover should be) -- though maybe the make-up people deliberately deglamorized the actor in question.<br/><br/>That being said, the death of Patroclus is still what sets Achilles off and the way they plot that it still is plausible within the logic of the film itself.<br/><br/>I guess that sums up what I feel about the movie itself:  it works on its own terms.  I don't know if it is better to come into the movie with less rather than more acquaintance with the Iliad itself.  One might enjoy the movie more if one knew nothing of the epic, but then again if one knew nothing of the epic one would miss out on a lot of the comic relief the movie does unintentionally offer.<br/><br/>Still, I must say much in the film was genuinely awesome and moving.  The way the Achaean army swoops down on the city at the end truly filled me with terror, horror, pity, and an infinite desolation at the thought of how little we have changed in 3000 years.  I thought of all the innocents, floods of fleeing refuge-seekers, dying in burning Warsaw or Berlin."

","This movie never knows what it wants to be when there is casual reference to a gang rape that is supposed to be taken seriously because Achilles truly loves her and you think she is being it comes off funny and the audience laughed. It would be like laughing when they killed william wallaces wife in braveheart.<br/><br/>The music was also kind of campy and then serious and battle like it just did not seem to work. The actors played there roles well but the director was never able to pull it off.<br/><br/>Then why he decided to compress a 10 year war down to two weeks is is beyond me theres was to express time in a movie. Helen was taking back by meanlous in the book, Agamenon survived insteaad of getting killed by his war bride but I guess Petereson never plans on directing Electra. I am not some one who thinks that everything should be the same but the main points should atleast reflect homer especialy that noone survived and babys were thrown from the walls.<br/><br/>In the end its just a mediochre movie but if you are an illformed person our ignorant of basic greek history and mythology you will like it.

If not for Brad Pitts performance this movie would have been a total flop. Short sided directing caused this movie to be the real disapointment. I was also suprised that this movie fell away from the original tale. The battle scenes were decent. the battle between Eric Bana and Brad Pitt was extremely good (the best scene since The Last Samurai).

However all of them have something special, something that makes us not to think about them just like another epic  movie and Troy has it too. What is it? I'll say just two words: Eric Bana. Hector has nothing to do with the dull Bruce Banner, when he appears on the screen he eclipses all the other actors, including Brad Pitt who seems furious not for death of his cousin but because Bana is stealing him the prominence of the movie. The sequence in which Hector kills Melenao is the most powerful moment of the film."

"Scorching","8","1","2","15 May 2004"," Pretty nice film
","Looking at the numbers associated with this film in a magazine, made me ponder a lot about this film as I entered the cinema today to watch the film. That's TWO HUNDRED MILLION in dollars the production budget for this film depicting the epic as written by the Greek writer Homer. A huge amount of which or $17.5 million went to Brad Pitt's pockets. That's 200 million reasons to love it or just as many reasons to hate it. That's still a lot of money to produce one film even in this day and age of films costing millions of dollars. That makes this film either an expensive instant classic in the mold of Lord of the Rings trilogy or Waterworld.<br/><br/>Another figure to look at is 162 that's how long this film is in minutes. Again to me this seemed a little too long at first, which depending on the, merits of the film can either seem like a breeze or be just be pure torture.<br/><br/>Coming into the film I knew very little of the plot line of the film as I have not had the privilege of reading Homer's work, just the basic elements as seen in a few reviews and summaries of the film. I got to say I'm quite glad that this was the case as this meant that I had a virtual 'clean slate' regarding the details of the story and this lead to me having a feeling of heightened sense of anticipation as the scenes slowly unfolded. My only gripe from this is I wish they had explored more on the development of the relationship of Helen and Paris before the war as well as more time during the Trojan horse scene. It would also be rather hard for me to comment on whether the filmmakers did a good job in converting the book into a film as I have yet to read Homer's work.<br/><br/>I actually found the casting quite refreshing as I was able to see some of the legends of the screen like Peter O'Toole interact with the stars of today like Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and as well as the emerging stars of tomorrow like Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger. I think the acting was good enough for most characters nothing great. I sort of found the acting of Kruger a little too raw for the role. Perhaps it's because she was nervous or she was just too inexperienced at this level. Perhaps we can see a better display from her in the future as I have heard she has a few more movies in the future. <br/><br/>I thought director Wolfgang Petersen did a good job in setting the mood of the film with the breathtaking cinematography. I especially loved the exterior shots of both the Greek and Trojan armies marching against each other into battle. The costumes and props were also looked quite good. I thought the film score though was a little average at this point nothing very much to talk about. <br/><br/>Overall it was a pretty solid film with a lot of good points and was well worth both my money as well as the production companies."

A sword gets stuck in someone's skull for crying out loud. What is it with Orlando Bloom and bows and arrows? He shot them in the Lord of the Rings trilogies, and now in this movie. I thought his character in Troy def. made him out to be a coward. Little wimpy boy had to resort to his bow and arrow, and he contributed the cause of the entire conflict and battle. Anyways, just my 2 cents."
"livewire-6","Null","1","2","18 May 2004"," Homer for Peterson, strikeout for Pitt
","I was originally going to call my review ""Razing Helen, or Greece is the word"", but instead I chose the title that best summed up the film.<br/><br/>Peterson's Trojan war is waged not only on the battlefield, but in the minds and hearts of men. It is a war of ideas, and indeed a meditation on war itself. Why do men fight? Some for love of country, some for adventure, some for immortality. ""Troy"" also addresses the role of religion in men's lives. Some characters in the film honor the gods, others do not. Achilles goes so far as to say that the gods envy men, because human mortality means that we must live each day to the fullest, as if it were our last. And if death is our lot, at least we can avoid oblivion, ensuring that our names live on by golden deeds.<br/><br/>Peterson revels in the carnage and mayhem of war, but the film is at its best when it focuses on hand-to-hand conflict between characters we care about, not just nameless, faceless soldiers in armor. It is also fascinating to see how war was waged in an era where cavalry had not yet superseded infantry and artillery.<br/><br/>Not everything works in ""Troy"". There are some laughable moments and awkward dialogue. I found myself gathering wool at times. A shot of Helen gazing over the parapets of Troy reminded me of Evita on the balcony of the Casa Rosada. During Brad Pitt's big scene with Peter O'Toole, I half expected Pitt to hiss, ""Give me the Aquitaine!"" And the burnt, charred pillars of Troy made me think of Twelve Oaks, the Wilkes' plantation in ""Gone with the Wind"".<br/><br/>Peterson's ""Troy"" is not entirely faithful to Homer's epic poem. I was disappointed to see several characters end up on the cutting room floor. Women in particular are not very much in evidence. Where, for example, is Priam's queen, Hecuba? Or Cassandra, the truthsayer whose dire prophecies the Trojans failed to heed? Or Iphigenia, sacrificed to the gods to obtain fair winds for sailing? The only real heroine of the film is Briseis, virgin priestess of Apollo (until Achilles comes along).<br/><br/>But also missing in action is the male character of Laocoon, crushed to death by a sea serpent for warning about ""Greeks bearing gifts"". Odysseus (Ulysses) might as well not be there. He seems to have been included only as the author of the stratagem that ruined Troy.<br/><br/>Pretty boy Orlando Bloom plays Paris. If Christopher Marlowe were living today, he might have written, ""Was this the face that launched a thousand computer-generated ships?"" Unfortunately, Paris is such a wimp and a coward that Bloom has little to work with.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is a disappointment as Achilles. Somehow, he seems totally out of place. I think he simply has the wrong face for the role. He is no longer a ""Troy boy"", but is looking old and haggard at 40. Perhaps Peterson wanted his Achilles to look war weary -- a hero for the postmodern era. Who knows?<br/><br/>Brian Cox's Agamemnon does little but bluster and get red-faced as a tom turkey.<br/><br/>The true male stars are Eric Bana as Hector, and the venerable Peter O'Toole as Priam. They alone deliver dialogue that rings true, and Priam's plea for the body of Hector is truly heart-rending.<br/><br/>Peterson fudges the ending of the film. Agamemnon does not die in Troy. Rather, he returns home to be butchered by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover. But that's another story.<br/><br/>Alas, poor Troy is fallen! But, thanks to the miracle of celluloid, we'll always have Paris. Oh, and among those fleeing the flames of Troy, with his elderly father Anchises, we see Aeneas, hero of Virgil's ""Aeneid"". Is there a sequel in the works?"

","I'm not sure about the wisdom of casting pretty boy Pitt as Achilles. Though Pitt is extraordinarily talented, as in Snatch, Legends of the Fall, he was not formidable enough to be a legendary Greek warrior. The scene in which Achilles is training his cousin with wood practice swords look so much like the neighbor kids playing around.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with the scene where supposedly Achilles and Hector face off in a battle and everyone stands around to watch as if it was an after school fight in the apple orchard.<br/><br/>I was impressed with Eric Bana's Hector and enjoyed his moments on the screen.<br/><br/>However Orlando Bloom is another pretty boy who was not convincing. I will always fondly remember him as Legolas.<br/><br/>One enjoyable part for me was that I found myself cheering for both Hector and Achilles and was torn by their climatic finale.<br/><br/>Summer eye candy, popcorn munching, sword and sandal epic that, though not great, is light years better then Van Helsing."
"joker-4","8","1","2","18 May 2004"," Modern look at the Classics: clumsy, rugged yet grand.
","Like the sacrificial ox burning to honor ancestors, TROY pays significant homage to the epics that have come before. For a 21st Century Hollywood Machine production on one of the Classics, and taking into account how LORD OF THE RINGS totally spoiled us when it comes to such adaptations, TROY doesn't fare too poorly. Perhaps a little clumsy and rugged at times, especially in the editing, but the well-done casting is able to polish a bit of grandeur onto the epic.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen, along with screenwriter David Benioff, present not only a digestible rendition of Homer's poem crafted for the youth of today, but also craft the film as being historical fiction. Gone are the gods' roles and involvement and even Achilles' supernatural origins are obtusely dismissed. Brad Pitt's sculpted Greek form, however, puts him as close to gods as anyone on this mortal plane as his legion of worshippers will attest to. <br/><br/>TROY definitely slants to tale to show favor for the film's namesake kingdom. Peter O'Toole, in a much-needed award-winning role, plays Priam with benevolence and wisdom although with perhaps a little too much naiveté when it comes to the gods as opposed to the always- enjoyable Brian Cox's warmongering Agamemnon. Eric Bana's Hector is a warrior family man while Pitt's Achilles is indifferent, and even bored with battle and only fights to preserve his name. Even Helen, who leaves her rabble-rousing husband Menelaus for love and sanctuary in Troy, comes across as being innocent. Only Odysseus, skillfully acted by Sean Bean, comes across as a Greek who knows his place and station and merely wishes to survive. And if surviving means constructing a horse from the boat's lumber, so be it. After all, he has a date with Sersei and the Cyclops later on. <br/><br/>Of course the ultimate question is will TROY live on in eternity like Achilles so desperately sought after or will it be dismissed like the setting sun over the Aegean sea?"

","Yes I said it. When a movie you anticipate has you anticipating for more and you're still pleased...well thats perfection to me. I felt like a kid watching Star Wars or Indiana Jones for the first time. It was fun and that's how I took it.<br/><br/>Hollywood managed not to screw this one up. Instead, they let Mr. Peterson do his job. <br/><br/>Why this movie is a winner with me is quite simple. Its mass and its production was quite impressive. For an epic picture done on this scale including the CGI, cinematography, and the intensity of the one on one combat scenes was more than adequate for the occasion. It entertained me. That's what movies are made for and considering its 165 minute span, I wasn't bored once.  <br/><br/>Another reason why this movie was such a hit was due to the performances. Every actor convinced me of their role but it was both Eric Bana and Brian Cox's performances that stood out for me. You could tell every actor wanted in on this project and was proud. Every actor and actress gave their best.<br/><br/>
 As for Brad Pitt being considered a miscast, I had to see for myself. Its a shame when critics try to ruin a motion picture for you based on their prejudices. I would have missed another great performance out of Mr. Pitt. The dialogue was a bit challenging but he made up for it with the fight scenes and his charisma for the character. <br/><br/>I did feel the connection between his former role as Tristian in ""Legends of the Fall"" with the Achilles role. The expressions, the rebelliousness, the physical demands. He did good a job. Why all the down talk? He still brought in the dollars. Brad Pitt just has it like that. <br/><br/>Is it worth repeated viewings? I waited till the following Monday to see it again. However, I learned my lesson with the Matrix Trilogy burnout.

"Floris-4","7","1","2","13 May 2004"," good, but it could have been great (possible spoiler)
","Wolfgang Peterson has achieved a remarkable feat in getting together a cast that suits the books original characters perfectly. Bloom, Kruger, Pitt and O' Toole are excellent choices. They all manage to bring across the dilemma's that even Homer's flat characters face. However in displaying the personal intrigue on the one-hand and the battles on the other Petersen tends to lose focus, resulting in a rather two-hearted movie. The combat scenes would have been impressive enough to stop anyone from noticing a few years ago. But this is 2004 and we have been spoiled with battles scenes in The Lord of the Rings (1,2,3), Gladiator, etc. Scenes that would have carried a movie have been reduced to backdrops, because they only serve to tell the story not to amaze the viewer. This point has been lost on several directors and, regrettably Petersen is amongst them. The visuals have been taken care of quite admirably, but the auditive part of a movie-goer has been poorly served. The music is unoriginal. It tries to amalgamate the scores of the movies I mentioned earlier, which all underline the ""been there, done that"" feeling I got. Furthermore the dialog is often appalling. Especially Hector text mixes the artistic, poetic Homerian verses with a more commonplace war-rhetoric. I feels like a Shakespeare adaptation done by George Bush' speechwriters.<br/><br/>Finally: The movie is loosely based on Homer (and Vergil): do not expect an adaptation that follows the original very closely.<br/><br/>If your going to watch it: your in for a good time, but you might leave feeling a little bit unsatisfied.

"daniel-kopenetz","7","1","2","13 May 2004"," A nice blockbuster suffering from an awful adaption of the ""Iliad""
","Ok, I looked forward to this movie for months. No I must say that I´m a little disappointed. The movie itself was a solid blockbuster, nicely made and with a supreme cast. But if you know the ""Iliad"" you know how to make the story even better. (Originally) 10 (!) years of Trojan war decreased to a few weeks. That automatically has the effect of harsh story-jumps and is creating lenghts while explaining all the new problems emerging. Additionally, the ""Iliad"" is a divine story and the Greek gods take part in that war themselves: Achilleus is not killed by paris, but by a goddess who takes position for Troy and is raged about the desecration of Hector´s corpse. The priest Laokoon tries to warn not to pull the horse into the city and is killed by Poseidon´s sea snakes. I think these would have been nice story kicks which should have been brought in. But although if one decides to avoid divine influences the film does simply not reach the original tale. Good that there were also positive surprises like an amazing Hector (Bana) who totally convinced as honourable prince of Troy fighting for ""patria"" and family."
"spottedreptile","Null","1","2","13 May 2004"," Not great, but not as bad as critics make out
","Let's get the bad out of the way first:<br/><br/>Brad Pitt IS miscast. It's a shame, because this major mistake takes away a lot of the film's power and ability to move the audience. I'm not sure why Peterson wanted Pitt, but what he got was Brad Pitt cast as Brad Pitt. You never forget who he is, and he's simply too much modern SoCal in this ancient story. I'm also not sure why the storyline focuses on him as he doesn't have the wherewithal as a character or an actor to make you care very much. And when you have nearly 3 hours to wade through, this lack of a powerful core and heart leaves the film seriously weakened. Comparisons with Gladiator and its hero are inevitable and not very flattering.<br/><br/>
For at least the first hour, the film wanders along without any sense of purpose or direction. Dialogue is stilted and unsure, sometimes to the point of laughability, the score follows along with the same uncertainty and you find yourself wondering when the story is going to begin.<br/><br/>
And if that is not enough, Petersen keeps whacking you over the head with the words ""immortality."" This I found the least forgiveable: as if Mr. California wasn't enough, our director keeps reminding us that this story happened aeons ago, and you, dear reader, are in the 21st century. Well, I know that. I just wanted to forget for a couple of hours and immerse myself in the past. But Mr. Petersen wouldn't let me. Bad man.<br/><br/>Ridley did this a lot better.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that Petersen was being very clever doing the CGI because ""it was in broad daylight"" and Peter Jackson did his battle scenes at night in the rain, so there, one up for the boys in the horse. However, it didn't stop Wolfgang from pinching holus bolus from the LOTR trilogy anyway. At least Sean Bean didn't get to reprise his Boromir death scene in this movie, but Someone Else does it in his stead. Cheap. Even the score started to sound like Howard Shore.<br/><br/>My pet beef: Where was Cassandra? Where was the feeling of cosmic irony, that all this could have been averted if humans had only not acted like humans do, and listened to the woman? The gods knew their humans well enough to let them just be themselves and laugh over the inevitable results. The gods do have the final laugh, but it seems Petersen doesn't care.<br/><br/>
Even more annoying is the way Achilles get his well-known fatal injury, but the prophecy is never foretold, so the impact is lessened. In fact, it's almost as though Petersen is afraid of dealing with the gods in this film apart from paying them lip service through cheesy dialogue every now and then. Maybe he thought we wouldn't get it. Maybe he thought he couldn't pull them off. Whatever the reason, it weakens the characters' beliefs, culture, and therefore our involvement.<br/><br/>The good parts of this film are some well-played roles: Peter O'Toole is splendid as the old Trojan King Priam, his scene with Achilles is wrenching, and Pitt lifts for it accordingly. Eric Bana plays Hector with restraint and dignity, and brings back some balance to the film. He certainly gets a better grip on his character than Mr. California. Orlando Bloom channels Legolas a fair bit, especially with the arrows, but plays his role well as a snivelling weakling and the younger brother of Hector whose passion for Helen snowballs the whole fiasco. Diane Kruger as Helen is pretty but forgettable, Rose Byrne makes the most of her scenes as the invented character Briseis, and Brian Cox makes a fairly satisfactory Agamemnon. Sean Bean was refreshing and reliable enough as Odysseus to make me wish the film had been about him more and Achilles less. Now an Odysseus sequel, hey Ridley . . .<br/><br/>The second half of the film is much better than the first, and it all gradually seems to come together at the end and I left feeling I'd quite enjoyed it overall. It's just such a shame that there are enough major flaws to put it into the 'almost but not quite' category. However it's not a waste of 2 hrs 45 minutes. I didn't feel I needed to ask for my money back.<br/><br/>
My score: 6.5 out of 10. Half a point for the horse, even if it wasn't in The Iliad."
"wabus44","7","1","2","17 May 2004"," Flawed Epic
","This almost $200 million dollar epic is loosely based on the 3000 year old classic the Iliad.  The question has to be asked of those who spent the money is what planet do they live on?  They had to be sitting around with the screenwriter and director talking about how to make the film.  One bright spark said, `You know, that Homer guy is a bit old fashioned.  His story is alright but after 3000 years it has gotten a bit stuffy.  We can do it better than some old Greek guy.'  Hmmmm.  Not good judgment.  If the story worked for 3000 years, why change it?<br/><br/>Anyways, things meander about in earnest but plodding fashion until we finally get to Troy (Ilium).  Brian Cox chews up the scenery as a pretentious Agamemnon, the High King of the Greeks. Brad Pitt does well as the egotistical but fatalistic Achilles.  The real star is Eric Bana as the tragic Hector.<br/><br/>For some reason, the 10 year war is condensed to a couple weeks, detracting from the epic Troy strives to be.  In that time, the classic confrontation between Achilles and Hector plays out.  This is the heart of the film and it works very well.  The satellite characters don't work well, and at times come off very awkwardly.  There are no Gods or Goddesses personified and so major characters who were heavily influenced by same are axed as well (eg. Diomedes).<br/><br/>Overall, Troy is flawed by a misguided attempt to rework an epic story.  The central theme of the two heroes works very well, but even that is somewhat muddled by story changes.  The cinematography is first rate, it has a forgettable musical score (another flaw, all classic epic films has a memorable theme), but it also has pretty cool battle and fight scenes.  The violence and blood is not too graphic, but it is a bit too long for younger viewers and there is some brief gratuitous nudity.  Fans of the Illiad will be disappointed, but Troy is worth seeing for those who like epics in spite of its flaws."

This spoiled every single great moment in this movie, and led me to cover my ears frequently. Brad Pitt is great expertly conveying Achilles boredom with the endless battles he is forced to fight, because there is nothing else he can do.  His first fight should surely go down as one of the great fights of the year second only to his fight with Hector. Peter O'Toole is a cert for an oscar nomination, especially considering most people assumed he was dead. Oh and for all those reviewers the Thousand Ships Helen launched, those were the ones the Greeks sent over to get her back.

","TROY (2004) *** Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Sean Bean<br/><br/>There are movies of epic proportion, and there are epics; this movie tries to be a movie of epic proportion based on Homers epic  The Iliad. Sadly it fails.<br/><br/>Certainly its eye-catching, there's plenty to look at and lots going on, but when you cut through the glitz, when you look for the acting', TROY runs out of steam.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole, though brave to take on such a role at his age, delivers a performance worthy of a television soap opera, not a massive budget `block-buster'. His performance alone damages the film almost beyond redemption. Not since Jeremy Irons, in his role as Profion in `Dungeons & Dragons (2000' has such over-acting been forced on a paying audience. Then there's Brian Cox, usually a quality actor in every role I've seen him in, yet the megalomaniacal delivery of his role as Agamemnon is even a bit too over-the-top for such a famous sociopath. <br/><br/>One of the questions I found myself asking, even after leaving the movie, was this `Can Orlando Bloom actually play a role other than Legolas? And if so, when is he going to start? <br/><br/>Kudos go out to Brendan Gleeson who gives a solid performance and demonstrates his versatility in yet another role. Sean Bean continues to demonstrate why he's in such high demand, but the real star of this movie is Eric Bana. Relatively unknown (at least in North America) prior to his role in `Hulk (2003)', Bana steals the show with his performance as Hector.<br/><br/>
Brad Pitt, typically, is spot on with his performance, and should not be discounted as the Lead. His solid portrayal of the chaotic Achilles makes up, at least in part, for the shortcomings of others. <br/><br/>The fight choreography is spectacular, the score is breathtaking and the costuming and props are stunning. It's quite likely they'll get Oscar nods in these areas and stand a good chance at winning. Sadly, however, I'm sure the academy will consider O'Toole for a nomination just because he's been in the game so long. The prospect of that reviles me and if he were to actually win an academy award, where Ian McKellen failed to garner one for his role in `Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001)', my faith in the entire voting process for the Oscars would collapse once and for all.<br/><br/>Of course I'm sure the film will take in massive box office receipts and won't disappoint many, but given the hype I was expecting a lot more. At least the DVD will allow you skip over the many, many skippable sections.<br/><br/>
The only way you could get me to see this film again, in a non-matinee/cheap day setting, would be to sneak me into the theatre in a giant wooden horse."

","This movie is very well done.  I went into this movie skeptical that there would be a new spin on this often told story.  This movie is grounded by excellent performances by Peter O'Toole, Orlando Bloom, and Eric Bana (who I was not impressed with in Hulk).  As for Brad Pitt, he is good but his nonstop ""do I want to fight or don't I"" dialouge gets tiresome as the movie goes along.  This movie takes great liberties with previous accounts of the story.  The Trojan War lasted more than 10 years, yet the movie does not have the feeling of passage of time.  It feels like days rather than years pass by.  Also, who lives and who dies and when has been changed around.  I don't know the actress who plays Helen, but she is very beautiful and comes across as a sympathetic character.  That may be why parts of the movie have changed.  I highly recommend this movie.  8/10"

","As a fan of movies that utilize the big-screen and digital sound experience to the max...I couldn't help but like this movie.  The sweeping vistas, the epic battles, the sharp treble of iron clanking on iron.  This is why we pay $50 for admission and popcorn these days for a night out at the movies. <br/><br/>
Having said that, it's still nice to see a movie in the theatre that you can walk out and say--""man, that would be just as enjoyable on my 27"" Sony at home"". <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Troy doesn't quite cut it there.  Eric Bana and Peter O' Toole give fabulous performances as Trojan royalty battling their own wisdom--a father<br/><br/>who still believes in help from the Gods and a son firmly grounded in reality. Unfortunately, everyone else -- including Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom -- either suffers from bad acting or a bad script...and we find ourselves not giving a damn whether these primary characters live or die.<br/><br/>Troy was much better than I expected, given the marketing idea to cast only<br/><br/>Hollywood's current crop of sexiest leading men, but still falls short of being a classic (such as Return of the King).  Although the story is somewhat grounded in history (the origin of the term Achilles heel, the famous Trojan horse scam), the special effects, costuming and cinematography needed to be complemented <br/><br/>by a more enriching story and characters to truly rank amongst the top epics<br/><br/>Hollywood we've seen so far.  8/10."
"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","1","2","16 May 2004"," Average
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Every few years there is one of these big Hollywood films which attempt to gain ""Epic"" status. Their numbers have increased over the years, but that doesn't necessarily make them all good. ""Gladiator"" was amazing, ""Lord Of The Rings"" was just as good, with ""Troy"" it feels like they've taken aspects of those other titles and produced a mediocre copy.<br/><br/>We all know the story of the Wooden Horse Of Troy, the love between Paris and Helen, etc etc. This film covers that sort of range moving from the beginning of the Trojan War through to it's climax. Ultimately though, there are one or two serious errors.<br/><br/>Firstly I'd like to confess that I'm not a master on Homer's story. I know the basic details of it, but I couldn't have told you who killed who or who was primarily involved. All I tend to know about the story is the motivation for war and the outcome, so I'm not even going to pretend to appreciate how accurate this film was. I've heard criticism for it's lack of mystical involvement, but all I can think of is that they went more for the historically accurate than the mythological alternative. I've heard some person doesn't kill some other person, that's more fair as a point of criticism, but at the same time, this is Hollywood and they wanted to round off things perfectly. One problem which I do have however is that they condense a long war into what seems like two weeks. This just feels wrong. Next thing you know and the Second World War will be being reduced into some sort of 2 day border scuffle.<br/><br/>Aside from story accuracies, the other problems with this film are how it drags towards the end (but that was necessary it feels) and Orlando Bloom. Whilst I watched this film and found myself drawn to Eric Bana's Hector, Orlando Bloom as his brother Paris was absolutely awful. I'm sure Bloom is a really nice bloke and if the guy develops a complex due to the millions of condemnations he seems to be receiving, then I feel sorry for him. In the end though it's through his own doing because he really is weak in this film. Whilst Bana was magnificant, Peter O'Toole as Priam (their father) was quality, even Brad Pitt performed well at times (but far too inconsistently). Compared with those three and a good supporting cast, Bloom just was foul. I could repeat myself over and over again in criticism of Bloom, but it would probably be deserved, he really is that bad.<br/><br/>On a plus note, one thing this film had always planned to deliver, and which it did well, was violence. From the offset this feature contains countless dead people, and the CGI Men have once more outdone themselves.<br/><br/>So basically, ""Troy"" is very mediocre. Whilst the special effects are impressive and certain actors are amazing, at the same time it is let down by their costars weak performances (Diane Kruger as Helen is also poor, but that feels more due to the script than her acting ability) and a plot which was doomed to cause a bit of drag towards the end. By all means go watch this film, but don't expect a masterpiece."
"shoolaroon","Null","1","2","16 May 2004"," terrible adaptation - go back and READ the Iliad.
","It's very sad reading some of these comments to realize how generally uneducated most Americans(in particular) are about the classics or they would realize how badly Wolfgang Petersen has treated this story. WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>He has compressed the siege of Troy which took about 10 years, if I remember correctly, into a time period of seeming a couple of weeks.  There is no sense of the passage of time at all.  Several important characters such as the prophetess Cassandra and Priam's wife (and mother of Paris and Hector) Hecuba, are missing completely.  Others are unemphasized in their importance like Ajax, who seems to be a miss placed Hells Angel in his brief appearance, or over emphasized like Briseis.  Important events in the story are actually shown incorrectly.  Menelaus was not killed during the siege, he actually left Troy - WITH HELEN.  Helen didn't escape with Aeneas to any river anywhere - she went back home ultimately with her husband. Moreoever, Paris did not just steal Helen - he stole most of Menelaus treasure as well!!  These are just a few points - this movie is so inaccurate on so many levels.  <br/><br/>Petersen deliberately got so much wrong in the name of creating a spectacle and manipulating plot points and it didn't do him any good.  THe movie is visually splendid but lacking in soul and depth and texture. It's plodding and one doesn't ultimately care about almost any of the characters.  There is virtually no humor in this movie at all, nor any of the little incidents that epic filmakers of the past put into their movies to make the text more accessible - like interchanges between the ordinary citizens of the city, some event that shows how the men have bonded in some way other than war.  I have to comment on the ""music"" in this movie as well - the wailing is extremely annoying, repetitive and totally unnecessary - it does not create a mood other than extreme irritation. <br/><br/>The one exception to this dreary failure is Brad Pitt's portrayal of Achilles.  I was quite surprised and didn't think him up to it.  I had forgotten Fight Club apparently.  Pitt is masterful - a superb performance that totally nails the character.  This is perhaps the best performance I have seen all year (in mainstream films).  However, I missed the first minute or so of the opening credits but I don't believe that Petersen ever explains why Achilles is so fearless - it's because he is literally invulnerable except for a small spot on his heel.  He knows he can't be killed and very unlikely that anyone would find that spot (and indeed, Paris does literally with the assistance of the god, Apollo in the Iliad).  This is a major factor that creates the main character's psychological make-up and it's left out!<br/><br/>I would give this movie a solid 2.5 out of 4 ONLY for Brad Pitt's performance and for the staging and cinematography.  If you want to see a big epic, the old ones of Spartacus, Ben-Hur, etc. are still the best.  They have hearts and souls and characters one can care about - not just impressive digital cinematics."

Achilles never really gets a scratch on him even though he is in the thick of a battle full of spears and swords, never mind that he is not revealed to be the son of a Goddess or wearing armor forged by the Gods.

","I won't post any spoilers but the body count ignores who is really dead and who is still alive at the end of the story, as well as leaving out a few characters that would have added a little more dimension.  However, Peterson might have been looking to avoid making this film any longer, knowing the average attention span in this 21st century.<br/><br/>Having said that, the actors in this film give their all and most of them do an excellent job.  Possibly because a few of his lines are rather silly, Orlando Bloom gives an accurate portrait of the naive Paris who never considers the ultimate consequences of his actions.  He's a perfect contrast to Eric Bana's Hector, who is both wise and noble beyond his years.  He is truly the most admirable character in the film.  <br/><br/>Brian Cox's Agememnon is the least admirable, of course.  His greed is the real reason for this war; Helen is only an excuse, a pretext.  He is a barbarian in the proper sense of the word.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's Achilles is definitely a loose cannon and a bit of a wild card in the story.  His performance is on point, making Achilles the flawed hero that is a key element to the outcome of this tale.  Of course it must be also said here that Pitt is now in his prime; he has never looked or sounded better.  <br/><br/>For me the one major disappointment in this film is that Sean Bean's Odysseus should have had a bit more screen time.  Personally, I would love to see him star in a production of The Odyssey.  This would have to contain the supernatural elements that were absent from this film."
"thenatureboy","8","1","2","15 May 2004"," A Great Greek Tragedy
","If a Tragedy is making the wrong choice at the wrong time, then the characters in this fine movie have lived (and died) through one.  For example:<br/><br/>1) Taking Helen to Troy 2) Defending Paris 3) Attacking the Greeks at Night 4) Taking the Horse into the City<br/><br/>Of course, all of these decisions were made by Trojans, which makes you wonder if they didn't bring it all on themselves in this movie... but I digress.<br/><br/>Although Brad Pitt's acting was a little cardboard, his character is basically a characterization.  Hector, being much more human and fallible, came across more as a person - which didn't help him much in his fight with Achilles.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were tremendous.  The line between C.G.I. and live action is more blurred every day.  I couldn't point out any obviously bad graphics (unlike the ""burly brawl"" in Matrix Reloaded).  I would have liked more of Sean Bean - but Ulysses was always a very interesting character anyway.<br/><br/>P.S. to Wolfgang - could somebody remind Orlando Bloom that we are in the Hellenistic Age - not Middle Earth - when using the Bow he morphed into Legolas..... All I needed was an Cave Troll to come up and smite the Greeks.<br/><br/>Final Tally - 8 out 10 - with a probable 9 or 9.5 for the inevitable DVD with added scenes."
"artzau","8","1","2","14 May 2004"," Not bad but it ain't Homer
","Brad Pitt is an amazing actor.  He brings an intensity to the character of Achilles that lends itself well to the Hero's hero.  Eric Bana's Hector is likewise heroic, albeit much more stoic in his heroism.  Brian Cox is wonderfully sleazy as Aggamemnon and Brandon Gleeson is a likewise villainous Menelaus.  Sean Bean is wonderful as Odysseus as is Peter O'Toole as Priam...but the story... Hmmm.<br/><br/>Depends what you want.  If you like Hollywood costume drama in a love cum tragedy setting with flashing swords, whizzing arrows, spears through the heads,with flashing moments of well-formed naked bodies writhing in the sack like snakes, then, hey.  This is your film.  If, on the other hand, you're a classicist who knows the myths backwards and forwards, you might want to check out some of the classics.  But, they all fudge the myth.  We know Aggamemnon was killed by his wife Clymnestra, who was Helen's older sister, BTW, Menelaus wasn't killed by Hector and... well, you know. <br/><br/>
So, movie fans.  It's worth the price of admission and does have some good moments.  It ain't true to Homer but, so what?  None of the great epics are true to the originals and when they are, they're usually a bust."
"Exile-Inc","9","1","2","14 May 2004"," Fulfilling in every sense.
","Someone previously mentioned that it really was a pity that they condensed 10 years of fighting into 3 hours of film. However, despite whatever the condensing left out, Wolfgang Peterson still left audiences with a good basic core of a movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself doesnt feel like 3 hours, with battle scenes and dialogue aptly balancing each other out. The viewer never feels dulled down with morals or the vast knowledgeable meaning of life, and vice versa, is never overwhelmed by the fighting that occurs over the span of the film.<br/><br/>The battle scenes themselves are enjoyable and believable enough. They dont push realism to the extreme with blood spattering the camera and Brad Pitt coming out of the fight looking like Mel Gibson from ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot,"" covered in blood, intestines, grey matter and anything else they threw at him that would stick, and yet they still capture the raw feel of foot soldiers of two warring nations running by the thousands into battle. Likewise, almost none of the combat (save some certain extremely accurate spear throws) ever feels staged or unrealistic.<br/><br/>The director also does the film a favor by balancing the sides out with screen time, and at the same time, not assigning a good guy/bad guy role to either side. Sure, you definitely get the bad guy vibe from Brian Cox, however Brad Pitt's Achilles still has you rooting for Greece at the same time, while Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom keep your hopes alive that Troy will not fall to the advancing enemy.<br/><br/>All in all - the cast, plot, direction, action, and feel of the movie definitely all lend themselves towards the making of a good film and enjoyable movie to watch. The 3 hours it takes to portray the story seem to fly by as well, provided you dont drink too much soda, and make you leave the theater feeling entertained and fulfilled by a good movie."

"reviewsbyjeff","Null","1","2","13 May 2004"," Another Epic
","This film starts with haunting music reminiscent of the eeriness of `Black Hawk Down'. James Horner, who started his musical career on the piano at age five, has delivered the notes on such great films as `A Beautiful Mind', `Braveheart' and my favorite action film of all time `Aliens'.  Horner's work in `Troy' echoes the greatness of his previous work in its depth and originality.<br/><br/>Troy is an epic in all respects of filmmaking. Of course, given its $175 million budget, one would hope for an epic film.  Troy has thousands upon thousands of extras, incredible special effects, massive fight scenes, all playing out on a background of stunning scenery from Baja to Malta.<br/><br/>The cinematographer is Roger Pratt, who has a very diverse film background. He has been behind the lenses for the Monty Python film `The Meaning of Life,' along with the great 2001 film starring Johnny Depp, `Chocolat'.  I thought he got it just right in the fight scenes and missed the mark during the conversations.  Pratt or the director fell in love with the close in shot, having started the scene from a distance.  <br/><br/>This type of film isn't really to my liking.  While most people loved the film `Gladiator,' I did not. I also didn't really like the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy. So if you liked those films, then you will likely enjoy `Troy' for its enormity of film scope.  It has conflict, love, loss, hate, anger, lust and lots of fighting.    It's simply a matter of taste, as I covet films with a tad less predictably, like the 1986 blockbuster `Aliens'. <br/><br/>The dramatis personae are really well placed here. The cast includes: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Peter O' Toole, Saffron Burrows, Sean Bean, Julian Glover, Julie Christie, and Tyler Mane.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was ruggedly handsome and does a laudable job as Achilles.  In his first starring role of this type, he is star-like. The ladies will most certainly find his rocked-up body easy on the eyes. He is a charming, good-looking bad/good guy, depending on how you view the film.  He appears in multiple scenes with very little covering his Jennifer Aniston.<br/><br/>
Eric Bana of `Hulk' fame is also very good as the Troy hero Hector.  I found his character the most realistic.  He matches his rugged good looks with strong character presence.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom, the latest teenage heartthrob, plays Paris, plays a smarmy little wife stealer (although I can't blame him for stealing Helen.)  Diane Krueger, a beguiling beauty whose exquisite being might be worth starting a war between men and countries, portrays Helen.  <br/><br/>Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson are familiar rugged faces that fill their villainous roles to perfection.   Julie Christie, as the mother of Achilles, looks as old as ancient Greece.  I also found Peter O'Toole's wide-eyed portrayal of Priam the King of Troy a tad weird. He does have one memorable exchange with Mr. Pitt that carries the day, though. <br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen directs this fabled fight for Helen; his past credits include `The Perfect Storm' which I thought was extremely forgettable.  He really doesn't do anything here to make me like this film.  I simply felt the movie was to long and far too predictable.<br/><br/>One memorable moment is during the closing credits we are treated to what will most likely be a pop hit called `Remember' sung by the very talented Josh Grobin.<br/><br/>There are lots of positives to this blockbuster but none that make me want to give it a high viewing recommendation.   If you like the elements of which I wrote above, then rush out this weekend for 2hrs of 46 minutes of Brad Pitt."

","I just saw the Troy and I think that Brad Pitt as Achilles is enough good in it. Some critics says that he is the major mistake in the casting but I don't agree with it. The other players fills their roles properly specially Erica Bana and Brian Cox. The scene of meeting of Peter O'Toole and Brad Pitt is by my opinion the strongest in the movie - maybe is connected with the fact that I also have two sons. Overall I think that Troy will be definitely one of the best movies of this summer which is as usually filled with popcorn and politically correct movies. Homerus maybe don't like the absence of gods in it, but I agree with David Benioff that war is more human that a god thing. I rate it 9 of 10."

","I admit, I never read the whole Illiad. It is one of those great stories few filmmaker dare to make into a movie. You have a horde of characters, ten years of horrible war, twists and turn with every phrase. So Wolfgang Petersen, a once great director, decided to rewrite the story. it is the story of how the the gods play with man and how man's own hubris is bringing him down (the motto of all Greek tragedies), but rather how man cause his own downfall. This is fine, you take the gods out and some of the characters, but why doing it so poorly? why the plot so weak, the greatest war in its time and it is fought out in 3-4 days? How come the Trojans fall for the horse trick? The reasons given do not hold any water. The battle scenes are unrealistic, this is not LOTR and not Braveheart of Henry V. The Greeks rarely used archers in large scale and only used short bows! The first battle scene is an ancient times Private Ryan's Omaha beach scene remake - stupid. The fighting scene between Achilles and Hector looks bad, I don't know how the ancient Greek fought, but it was surely never done that way. Why casting Orlando Bloom as Paris. Sure Mr. Bloom is a pretty face and brings people to the cinema, but he has no charisma. Brad Pitt is also a very bad, two dimensional Achilles, I can't see him leading Greece most fearsome soldiers into combat. Even Peter O'Toole can't save the poor cast. I give it 5/10 out of pure pity (should have been 3/10)"

","Being a Classics student, I was looking forward to a modern adaptation of one of the texts I have studied, and eagerly awaited Troy's release. It appeared to have it all - beautiful scenery, strong warriors, and a fantastic and ancient story. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Although you can't deny the actors all look very pretty, and the battle scenes are well choreographed, I began to doubt the film within minutes of its opening.<br/><br/>To begin - the lack of gods. This is perhaps the film's biggest flaw. You may want to pick realism over fantasy, but the myth is not real, and as such, by taking out the gods all the characters' actions are meaningless. There's no reason for them being there. You could argue that the lack of gods allows focus on the warriors, but the warriors have their incentive to fight from the gods.<br/><br/>Second - the end. Obviously, the villain is Agamemnon in this story, and as such he has to be killed. This does however slightly contradict the fact that Agamemnon is killed by his wife Clytemnestra. And Helen in the myth does in fact return to her husband.<br/><br/>Of course, myths were constantly changed throughout time, with different spins for different purposes, but I feel that this production's complete and utter raping of the Iliad, which it dares to reference it as being the film's basis.<br/><br/>All in all, you may enjoy Troy for what it was, an unusual twist on an action film, or an excuse to see Brad Pitt's arse, but frankly, I left the cinema disappointed and frustrated with yet another Hollywood bastardisation of a classic. If you want something of any intellectual merit, then read the Iliad."

","Achilles in this film is portrayed as a bit of a simpleton, easily influenced, self centered and shallow. His motives for fighting remain rather vague too. He does not like Agamemnon but still plays the role of champion when called upon, albeit sulking like your average zit-faced adolescent. Furthermore he's reluctant to go to Troy, but when Odysseus and Achilles' mother speak of 'the great war' and of the tales of heroes that will be told for thousands of years to come, he's suddenly convinced he has to go.<br/><br/>At Troy his main concern is whether his glorious acts of war can be seen by big enough crowds. His first display of military genius is to embark on the heavily defended Trojan beach ahead of the rest of the Greek fleet. Some might argue this knack for being outnumbered and desire for getting impaled by your opponents arrows is a sign of misplaced arrogance bordering on a self-destructive nature. Others will disprove this by stating the man knows he's invulnerable, well almost. Of course any sane man wouldn't be jumping for joy to be in this Muppet's army, but not in Petersens' film, no they love it.<br/><br/>So after Achilles has virtually single handedly claimed victory, and established a beachhead, desecrating a temple in the process, he miraculously still has a Myrmidon army left. Finally the promised war on Troy can really start, without Achilles that is, because Agamemnon has taken away his Trojan priestess/house-slave/lust-object Briseis whom the Myrmidons had taken hostage. <br/><br/>The Trojans meanwhile have assembled their army. They've done this outside their walls, considering Troy is famous for it's huge and seemingly impenetrable walls, this is a bit silly. Luckily the Greeks, who by the way haven't really brought or built anything to breach these walls, are also outside these walls, so a good fight can start. <br/><br/>Paris proves he's a bit of a wimp and Agamemnon shows his small military vocabulary shouting 'charge' and not soon after 'retreat'. The Trojans decide to attack the Greeks one more time. This attack reunites the shattered Greek forces, who counter and hold the line, losing Patrokles to Hektor's sword in the process yada yada yada. Achilles kills Hektor, wooden horse, Paris kills Achilles, Agamenmnon kills Priamos, Briseis kills Agamemnon(!), Troy burns and the Greeks win.<br/><br/>Petersen tries to find a balance between myth and reality and fails. He randomly chooses bits and pieces from the Illias and apparently turned to other material, Cassandra comes to mind, as well. The bombastic Hollywood approach doesn't leave much room for myth. The corny dialogue and frankly some of the acting performances as well, keep the characters from becoming real people."

The Trojan Horse is not in the Iliad but instead in The War at Troy. Quintas lived around the same time as Homer. The mistakes in this film are almost endless. They forgot about the Amazons, They forgot about Memnon. They forgot that Achilles never makes it into the walls of Troy. By the time The Trojan horse is built, Paris is supposed to be dead. Brieses is supposed to be one of the many women that Achilles captured when he sacked the Isle of Lesbos. She became his wife. About the only thing they got right was Achilles character and that was it. In my opinion, the only way the entire story of Troy could be properly told is through an extended miniseries. I had this movie and decided to get rid of it because I just couldn't stand some of my favorite literature being mutilated that bad. In my opinion, if they only wanted to give credit to Homer's Iliad, than they should have ended it with Hector's body being returned to Priam and the peace treaty that followed, no further."

","Notwithstanding the debate over historical accuracy or artistic license in a classic tale, this movie stunk all on its own in and of itself. It was surprising to me to see such glowing reviews of this thoroughly lame duck, which haphazardly pieces together elements of what the movie-makers were hoping would be high-drama, epic themes, romance, poignant tragedy, and dazzling action. The individual parts, at times, had flashes of the above, but the whole utterly lacked that crucial intangible: damn good story-telling (it usually comes down to the writing, editing, direction). What emerged was occasional highs (relatively speaking) in action, cinematography, acting, drama; but they're so interspersed with sheer drivel that you just end up rolling your eyes A lot... And although the characters of Achilles n Hector are compelling figures (in literature AND in the movie) their titanic clash and tragic struggles of honor (which are the major impetus of the movie) are ultimately diluted by the mind-numbing stupidity of the characters around them. Helen's character, for example, was written as just a vapid, frivolous girl who's only claim to oxygen was above average beauty, inch-deep allure, and an even shallower personality. She is supposed to be THE reason two powerful cities, its strongest, most noble warriors and the countless lives of two apparently worthy peoples are going to be devastated. They needed to do a better job of making her someone you'd actually give a crap about, let alone fight for. They failed miserably. Paris (orlando bloom) was even more idiotic. Watching this sniveling, whiny, cowardly, do-nothing plunge everyone into total war, death, destruction and be ultimately REWARDED for kidnapping a queen, uncaringly starting a war, spinelessly ducking his personal battles, running around witless the entire movie n then escaping the burning city n carnage, with the girl, to supposedly start anew as a better leader (yeah right!) was just too much to bear. This is not epic, this is not poetic; the only thing tragic here is that someone failed to make the storyline 1% as epic as the budget of this disappointing dud of a movie"

But I had hysterics (laughter I mean) whenever he appeared. Orlando Bloom - well, I like him a lot as a personality but the poor man had to act a complete wally and I can't tell whether he could have done better with the part or the script was so bad he hadn't a chance.

","When will Hollywood learn that if its not broke don't fix it! So many times great books and stories have been defiled and defaced beyond recognition by film makers thinking their improving on the original. The Famous story of Troy and the Iliad has lived on for nearly 3000 years, yet in their infinite wisdom Hollywood decided to 'improve' it. I was left bitterly disappointed but the final product, it has no soul and the changes to the events leave a bitter taste. A strong cast cant make up for the lack heart and tension, whilst Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom are woeful as Achilles and Paris. It's the character of Achilles who takes centre stage yet Pitt has none of the gravitas of Russell Crowe's Maximus, instead he just furrows his brow a lot like he's taking a dump. There's no room for the interfering God's and memorable character's such a Diomedes, they have all been cut out for a typically turgid Hollywood romance between Achilles and slave girl Briseis, BORING!!! Despite quite an exciting showdown between Achilles and Hector the other fight scenes are totally uninspired, if only Ridley Scott and directed this! Hats off to Sean Bean who makes an excellent Odysseus, sadly he is not given nearly enough screen time that he deserves - one can only hope an Odysessy film is made with him in the lead role. The film's music is terrible and grates after a while. A musical score can raise a film this one does the opposite, why Gabriel Yared's original score was scrapped is a mystery. The finale is just damn right sacrilegious! Talk about a Disney ending!Obviously screen writer David Benioff had no real consideration for the legend of Troy because all the key events have been changed so there can be an upbeat ending. The less said about the song accompanying the credits the better, Rambo: First Blood anyone? All in all a movie that had the potentially to be a classic but ended up a rather average affair. Hopefully in the near future someone else will attempt at bringing this amazing story to the screen and do it justice."

","I am a big fan of both historic costume drama films, and the Iliad, so I was curious about Troy as soon as I heard about it. Then came the reviews, followed by the bad word of mouth. So I avoided it in the theaters, and waited until it came out as a rental.<br/><br/>Man I am glad I didn't pay $10 for this turkey. This was awful, not boring, not trite or predictable. It just plain stank. The dialog was wooden, and you could see the actors just giving up and not caring anymore. The balance and wealth of characters in the Illiad was stripped down to cardboard caricatures.<br/><br/>I don't mind a retelling or new interpretation of the tales, Naomi Wolf's Cassandra is a great example of how a new classic can be rebuilt from the old, but I don't understand the choices behind Troy. It's like Shakespeare, you have a ready built screenplay for you. You actually have it easy.<br/><br/>Instead, the makers of this film had to alter it and experiment, but not in any cohesive way. Achilles is played as a cynical glory hound, and Agememnon a political manipulator. Great ideas (not original but hey- it's a movie), but they are executed in such a poor fashion, that it's ludicrous. ""Realism""? , as the previous reviewer attests, well, realism if you like cliché filled dialog. Realism stripped of the powerfully emotional personal moments that abound in the Iliad. Strip the gods from the Iliad, and you still have many great moments, some of the best in all literature, but even these were ripped asunder, and made into corny scenes with silly music. <br/><br/>the film's attempt to make any statements, artistic or otherwise, are never sustained. We could have had a story arc with Acilles and Patroclus dying in his own quest for glory. Nope. Hector fighting a rush to barbarity. Nope.<br/><br/>The film has 2 redeeming features- Sean Been as Odysuess, a small king having to play along with the big fish, and the scene where Hector chooses his bond of brotherhood over the rites of combat. But that's it.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for a sand and sandals epic, save your money and go watch Gladiator again."

The filmmakers didn't care at all.<br/><br/>They ripped apart the story. They made a pile of papers on each paper one of the many characters in the story. And a pile of papers with events. And a pile with dates on which those events took place. And of course a pile with places where the events took place. OK, shuffle each pile, independently. Now, take the top paper of each pile and combine those. At the end, some piles will still contain some papers (I guess a lot of characters will be left over), but of course those can be thrown away. Put these combinations in chronological order. Then, shuffle a bit to create the idea of flashbacks. Write a film script around this mess.

","If a director is going to make a historical, or legendary, movie and most important, one of the first and most known literally pillars of western civilization, he has a responsibility to stay somewhat true to the story. Particularly if this is the only way of historical/literary information for most people.<br/><br/>In Troy, Petersen deviates so much that he just made an insult not only to the Iliad, but to the Odyssey and to Aeschylus and Euripides tragedies (Trojan Women, Agamemnon, etc.). These works together with the Aeneid of Virgil make up the complete Trojan legend. To mention some, Briseida has a protagonist role which not corresponds to the legend. According to Petersen, she kills Agamemnon; in fact he is murdered by his wife Clytemnestra upon return to Mycenae, along with Andromache (Hector widow). Contrary to the movie, Hector did not kill Menelaus. Menelaus took Helen back to Sparta. Hector did not kill Ajax; they finish their duel with reciprocal respect, interchanging presents. In the movie, the coward Paris lives happily with Helen, while really he is dead by the arrow by Philoctetes. An important and key character like Diomedes is totally missing. Achilles was killed one year before the fall of Troy, not at the war end, etc., etc., etc.<br/><br/>I did not touch the gods intervention, whose role in the Iliad are essential, to avoid further dilemmas and criticisms. Completely absent in the movie, with the exception of Tethis for a short and irrelevant participation. <br/><br/>Even if we concede 'some' deviations from the original work, the characters portrays are so weak and disappointed that they do not reflect the deepness and courage of the heroes and warriors, as explicitly presented in the Homeric Chants. In general, the movie is superficial, lacking driving force, especially from acting. Short dialogs, reduced to minimum expressions. Take just as example the romance between Paris and Helen: Helen-last night was a mistake; Paris-and the night before?; Helen-I've made a lot of mistakes... This is proper of lousy melodramas. Battles are shot without essence and a notorious difference between Pitt and his stunt is presented along the 'drama'. The only exception may be Peter O'Toole (as king Priam), whose role may be adequate and who by chance, follows a more precise role as per the legend. <br/><br/>Some of my worst 3 hours wasted life-time. The movie is disappointing and bad reference for the subject. I should learn from the Perfect Storm."

That was the only high point of the film.<br/><br/>Otherwise the acting was poor. Achilles looked like John Travolta when he returned in 'Pulp Fiction' - bloated, wooden and past it - though, to be fair, John Travolta acted in 'Pulp Fiction' the hammy posturing of Brad Pitt was, I think, the worst 'performance' he has produced yet.<br/><br/>The wooden horse itself is a discrace, poorly cobbled together and ugly. Silly mistakes are made - a huge speech explains how important treating the dead properly is to the Greeks, next thing we see a beach littered with bodies left to rot in the sand by the Greeks. Helen of Troy has a peculiar accent that jars and they keep mispronouncing Menelaus' name. Statues all appear wearing loincloths (something only prudish Hollywood would inflict on them!) and made out of poor plaster so it just takes a knock and they fall into powdery bits. It's like an old low-budget B-movie. Don't they know that they made statues out of marble then?<br/><br/>The siege of Troy lasted 12 years - this film makes it appear that it is all over in less than a month.<br/><br/>Watch the DVD of 'Helen of Troy' instead - it manages the time properly, has good acting, an excellent horse and doesn't go on and on with the battles (in this film they are treated like car chases in Hollywood films - something to fill in hours of time with no thought or dialogue needed).<br/><br/>This film should have gone straight to video with a health warning."
"mrivero","1","2","7","15 May 2004"," Truly disappointing, total lack of vision or creativity
","I understand that directors take poetic license and fill in the details of major events to fit their vision of such events. The battle of Troy may have never happened, but as far as the Iliad is concerned (this being the source for the myth of Achilles and Hector), the director completely altered the story, the timing of events, and what the characters stand for.<br/><br/>This movie accomplishes nothing other than to force people to write negative comments about it. We know that epic battles can be depicted with ease given today's computer animated graphics. As a matter of fact, Lord of the Rings, all three of them, has better epic battle scenes and the fight choreography is believable and entertaining. In this movie Brad Pitt has a ""Kill Move"" that looks straight out of a Nintendo game. <br/><br/>The acting was not so bad, but the best actors were in secondary roles, Peter O'Toole (Priam) and Brian Cox (Agamemnon). Brad Pitt (Achilles), Eric Bana (Hector), and Orlando Bloom (Paris) fail to truly depict what the characters stand for. But, it is not their fault they were given roles and scripts written so poorly. <br/><br/>The Iliad has survived thousand of years because it is a beautiful story, full of heroes and with exciting events. It is almost impossible for someone to come even close when making a move based on the Iliad. But, a decent director would take the major parts of the story, and add subplots and details that are not intrinsic to the story but that add beauty and perhaps another dimension to it. Wolfgang Petersen set out to destroy the Iliad and the myths on which the story is based. The gods are as important to the story as the humans (in fact they too fight one another and against humans). They were not only completely removed from this movie, but also any reference to the gods was made with derision, and they were always wrong. This is a movie for the atheist! <br/><br/>I could not leave the theater because I had to drive people back home. However, the last 30 minutes were a torture to watch. The movie deserves to be seen, but only as a guide of what not to do when making a movie based on a great tale. This movie is not worth a penny. Wait until a friend buys or rents the DVD and then borrow it.<br/><br/>Sex sells, so it seems. This movie has plenty of shots of Pitt and Bloom semi-naked. This could be a good move since many women would pay to see them nude. However, Brad Pitt may fit the physical description of Achilles but not his psychological profile. Same goes for Eric Bana. Truly epic films include EPIC actors. Though I cannot think who would be a good fit for Achilles, Russell Crowe would have been a great Hector."

Even if you didn't know the story, Hector's long goodbye tells you what is to follow.  The director's awkward cut to young Paris as he practices with his bow and arrow tells you what's to come.  It's just poor, hold your hand, storytelling.  I did like the set up of both the Achilles and Hector characters.  When they meet in battle, you really don't know whom to route for. After that battle, the film degenerates into a depressing mess that really seemed to turn off the audience that I saw the film with.  The rather large crowd even seemed dejected as they walked out of the theatre. I couldn't blame them because, although well acted, this movie left me feeling very unsatisfied and I can guarantee that I won't be watching this movie ever again."

","Troy has a lot in common with Lord of the Rings in that it's an epic saga. A lot happens in the film. Characters are allowed to become dirty. They get scratched up and they're allowed to get scars. There's a certain realism throughout the film which makes it easier to identify with the characters. Horrible but not too violent. True to life but accessible to me. I was expecting it to be a little corny but it wasn't. Instead I was captivated by how similar people were thousands of years ago to today.<br/><br/>Unlike LOTR, however, the big battle scenes are done even better. In LOTR there was so much mass combat (similar to the end fight in Star Wars II) that I simply couldn't take it all in. And it's difficult to identify with a mob. Troy keeps it personal. In the big battle scenes we're usually following one of the main characters.<br/><br/>Similar to Thirteen Days, every scene is careful to state the characters goals and the reasons behind all the tension. So despite all the intrige I found the film easy to follow. Great acting, especially great costuming and sets. Fantastic. Most of the scenes weren't overly melodramatic... except Orlando Bloom's scenes, the only negative aspect of Troy I can think of. The chemistry of his character's various passions didn't work for me.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>    -- Action film buffs, you'll be fine even if you don't pay attention to the plot<br/><br/>    -- Drama buffs, this one's better than Gladiator.<br/><br/>    -- Anyone curious about Greek history, this one's worth your time.<br/><br/>I'll give Troy a perfect 10 out of 10, sort of a bonus 9."

","Let's face it. There are actors who are movie stars and there are movie stars who can act. Forget Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall - those are legends and shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath but Brad Pitt?! He's a movie star through and through and reckon he's not a bad actor but he pales in comparison to the others in this movie - Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom and most of all Eric Bana. All it took was (spoiler!) for that one scene with Peter O'Toole to display his lack of acting credibility. He didn't achieve international acclaim playing a substantial role - all he did was show off his abs in 'Thelma & Louise' and he was there! Yeah, fine actor alright. All he needed was to do sit ups every night.<br/><br/>The one who truly excelled in this movie was Eric Bana who showed ferocity and tenacity in his role as the older more responsible brother out to save his nation and younger foolish brother. I had just watched Orlando Bloom in his comic turn in 'Pirates of the Carribbean' so I was pretty surprised he could pull it off in 'Troy', which backs up my claim that he's an actor cum movie star. I'm just sorry Brad Pitt got all the attention and no credit was given to Eric Bana who gave the movie some sort of dignity amidst all the glamour of the blonde movie star.<br/><br/>All kudos to Wolfgang Petersen but perhaps his hands were tied in the casting process. I mean the days of making epic movies like 'Cleopatra' and 'Spartacus' are over for the very reason that those were days when the big movie stars, even Elizabeth Taylor, could command an audience awed by her sheer beauty and acting abilities. Kirk Douglas didn't just flash his dimpled chin to make 'Spartacus' into the masterpiece it was - he had to act and he could. Unfortunately, in the world of commercialism and utter nonsensical movies, people like Brad Pitt can star in a ridiculously expensive movie like Troy and get away with it. With the recent failure of 'Alexander' starring another similar-abled movie star, I hope the studios will learn that a pretty face is not enough to make a movie into the success that it could be. You need real actors who can really act and hold their own against greats like Peter O'Toole and not be totally overshadowed and killed just by sharing one tiny scene with him."

I hope this is not a spoiler because it is taken form a long time ago written poem but, Menelaus killed by Hector? Achilles killed by Paris inside burning Troy? The Hollywood idea of making always good and bad guys in a movie is what stinks most out of this movie. The historical fact and truth is that the Troyan War was nothing more that an economical war for the control of the Mediterranean commerce and trade. Hell, Troy was just another Greek city. It was getting pretty mighty and the rest of the Greek cities in Greece and elsewhere in the Mediterranean coasts were not very happy about it. That's in plain words. Helen, was an induced pretext, sort of speaking. Who knows, maybe she played with Paris and had the rest of the Troyans fall for it. There are two versions of her fate after the war: she was reunited with Menelaus and they lived together happily ever after in Sparta and the other is that Menelaus ""took her for a ride"" one sunny day never to return. I liked the special effects and the CGIs though."

","The epic story of the siege of Troy, one of the oldest tales of the civilized world, was the basis for a return of the big budget sand and sandal epics of the Fifties and Sixties as the big studios were spending tons of money on films to make them bigger and better to compete with television. It's as spectacular as anything that Cecil B. DeMille did without the 19th century Victorian prose that his scripts were laced with. In fact it's better because DeMille did not have computer graphics available to him.<br/><br/>One of the criticisms I hear about the film was that it was not comprehensive enough in terms of telling the whole story. To tell this whole story would require a lengthy mini-series and this was made for the big screen. If a two hour and 40 minute version of the story constitutes a Reader's Digest version of same, than so be it. The basic parts were covered and the errors are purely in the interest of editing.<br/><br/>Brendon Gleeson is King Meneleus of Sparta and he has a lovely young trophy queen named Helen played by Diane Kruger. Paris the son of King Priam of Troy is on a diplomatic mission from his city state which is across the Aegean Sea and in what is now Turkey. Orlando Bloom as Paris who is a rather shallow and callow youth, takes one look at Helen and she him and the chemistry gets going. He sneaks her aboard the Trojan ship before word is out and she's in Troy before you can say cuckolded.<br/><br/>Of course Meneleus ain't taking this lying down and he gets together with the rulers of the other Greek city states and they put together a D-Day like invasion and the siege begins. Although you wouldn't know it from the film, it lasts 10 years and that's really the only fault of the film. But again it's in the interest of editing.<br/><br/>A lot of the success of the invasion depends on the legendary Greek warrior Achilles and his elite guard called the Myrmidons. Achilles is played by a bulked up Brad Pitt and it's one of his best performances. Although my favorite role of Pitt's is in Seven Years In Tibet, this one is cited by his many fans in saying that Brad's come of age as an actor and not just a pretty face.<br/><br/>The climax is the famous fight between Orlando Bloom's brother, Prince Hector of Troy and Achilles. Hector slew young Patroclus played by Garrett Hedlund who was in Achilles armor and Achilles is out for blood. It's a no quarter match when Achilles slays Hector and with it a lot of the hopes and dreams of Troy. Hector is played well by Eric Bana<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when King Priam goes out on the field to claim Hector's body and meets Achilles. Priam is played by Peter O'Toole and I'm surprised O'Toole did not get yet another Oscar nomination for Priam in the Supporting Actor category. Achilles the disillusioned warrior because he sees the greed and rapaciousness of the Greek kings and Priam the heartbroken but still proud ruler of Troy who has to see his duty through meet and gain a mutual respect for the other. This scene between Pitt and O'Toole is the best in the film by far.<br/><br/>Reading the ancient text by Homer, the Greek Gods play significant parts in the drama. Here they are acknowledged, but make no presence in the film. It's a most secular story indeed and is criticized by some for that reason, but I find no fault with it.<br/><br/>The best reason to see Troy is to awaken an appreciation of the classics, especially among the young. If this Reader's Digest version of Homer's epic, inspires someone to do just that, it will be well worth the budget."

","As a student of history I had high hopes for this movie; however, experience has taught me that anytime that Hollywood gets their paws on a fine story they have to spoil it with their preconceived notions. So I was prepared for that factor. Normally I don't agree with the critics; however, for once they were right on the money as far as this movie was concerned. There were some fine actors who shined forth and I enjoyed their performances; however, over all it was dull, dull, dull, dull. I'm extremely glad that I didn't waste the money to see it in the theater and I'm thrilled that I didn't waste the money to add it to my collection sight unseen. If you want to see a movie about Troy you are better off watching Helen of Troy. Homer's Illiad is a fantastic tale that was butchered. One of these days someone is going to film a movie that will be a credit to this wondrous story. I doubt it will be out of Hollywood after viewing this film."

","With the amount of money and resources that Troy had available there is no excuse for such poor quality. The Direction and Screenplay were lousy. Director Wolfgang Petersen, who has a wonderful move direction history, filmed this movie as though he only intended it to be formatted to fit a regular TV screen. Much of the grandeur of the letterbox format went totally unused. I also found the liberal use of digital effects to border on the absurd at moments.<br/><br/>The screenplay, being the adaptation of an epic that has lived through countless lifetimes didn't even have to be that wonderful to win me over. However, I found most of the characters tolerable, in there roles, at best. Casting was horrendously flawed. People no more looked their parts than Grace Jones could pass for Snow White. Since when did the Greeks look more like Celts and Vikings than Greeks? Generally speaking the Trojans looked more appropriate than the Greeks but it was still not great.<br/><br/>The only moment I found powerful in the whole of the movie was when Priam (played by Peter O'Toole) was appealing to Achilles. O'Toole was able to take that moment and make it meaningful."
"jiujitsu_jesus","8","2","8","26 January 2005"," Look beneath the surface
","I need not introduce TROY as I have done in the case of many other movies- it is, without a doubt, one of the best-known and most controversial Hollywood films of the year. Everyone knows, by now, that this is a de-mystified adaption of Homer's Illiad, the story of the war between the confederacy of Greece and the proud city-state of Troy as the result of one man's greed. In addition to this, most people have heard the critics denounce this film as a load of flashy, badly-written, poorly-acted garbage; there have also been arguments, from a group of die-hard fans, that TROY is a monumental achievement and deserves an Academy Award. Personally, I found it to be an immensely enjoyable and well-conceived movie with a lot of potential, but with a number of serious presentation flaws that were in enough, in the eyes of many, to pitch it into the fatal depths of mediocrity.<br/><br/>To begin with, the premise for this film is an excellent concept. Director Wolfgang Petersen has attempted to accomplish something truly wonderful here - to refresh, revitalise, and give a believable human face to the epic of the Illiad, which has tragically come to be considered by the general public as nothing but a mouldy old manuscript you have to read in Ancient History class. The scriptwriter has masterfully transfigured the original tale of gods, monsters and supernatural warriors into a gripping historical drama laced with heroism, intrigue and romance. The story's moral scenario has been adeptly conveyed in TROY - the concept of a struggle between nations, beyond good and evil, where the actions of a few individuals may fatally affect the lives of thousands of others. This is a concept that many scriptwriters of recent times have failed to coherently convey, and TROY is to be commended for all of the above.<br/><br/>It is in presentation, however, that TROY fails as an epic film. The art direction and cinematography, while all very spectacular, feels tiringly familiar, and is not presented with any particular creativity. The music is grating and repetitive, and again sounds somewhat rushed. But worst of all are the lead actors. Yes, you know who I'm talking about. Don't get me wrong- Brad Pitt is a capable actor who's put on some good performances over the course of his career. But his reputation will doubtless suffer from his performance in TROY, which is about as uninspired and wooden as they come. Diane Kruger, who plays Helen of Sparta, is of roughly the same standard. Eric Bana is an appropriately emotive Hector, but is not altogether convincing as a Greek prince.<br/><br/>Although they suffer from the woeful performances of their leads, the supporting cast is surprisingly capable and convincing. While Peter O'Toole has been described by critics as the only decent actor in the entire production, I believe Brian Cox, Rose Byrne and Brendan Gleeson also performed exceptionally well. Even the typically robotic Orlando Bloom is convincing in his role as the selfish, impetuous young prince Paris, and he even manages to enhance the film somewhat, giving the somewhat confused Eric Bana a bit of room to manoeuvre.<br/><br/>As a footnote, a character whose overall significance has been overlooked by many is Sean Bean's Odysseus. The balance of the war, and the story's pivotal moral decision, ultimately rested with him, he being the only character appropriately placed and wise enough to perceive and understand all sides of the story. Furthermore, in this character - and in this actor- lies Wolfgang Petersen's hope to redeem himself for the divisive TROY. If he could make an adaption of Homer's Odyssey, perhaps presented in a psychological, rather than a fantastic, vein, he may finally receive the recognition he deserves for such a magnificent concept as this movie's. Tragically, a half-baked cast and mediocre presentation have held TROY back from the greatness it deserves. 8/10."

The sets are dull and uninteresting. Troy looks like a giant sandcastle.<br/><br/>2. Brad Pitt is absolutely terrible. I think I got what he was trying to do; I think I understood that Achilles was meant to be arrogant etc, but his performance was stilted and just generally pretty crap. He made Achilles seem a bit of a f*nny.<br/><br/>3. Why does Hollywood always insist on giving Greeks Scottish and Irish accents?? This is really off-putting, perhaps because I'm Scottish it made some of the characters sound like my dad.<br/><br/>4. Where did all the wood come from? 5. Paris needs a slap. I don't like Orlando Bloom anyway but he just played the part of a simpering wee ninny in this.<br/><br/>6. That bloody music!!

It is not an adaptation - it is a pitiful attempt to get more money! In Homer's book the divine is above all, gods watch over the people of the world and control them. Gods are above all. And in the book is told the story of the greatest battle of all times - between men, between gods. In this movie - a renegade warrior (Achilles) stands against the gods and stands between the victory of Greece over the undefeatable army of Troy.<br/><br/>I prefer the fairy-tale manner, the manner in which Homer told the story - not the political and factological interpretation of the book. Looking at it in that way this is not an adaptation of the book - it is purely a historical movie, spoiled by Americans, hungry for action and show!<br/><br/>This is the proof that no longer good movies are made in Hollywood!

For the life of me I can't understand why every remake of this story has the writers wanting you to like Achilles. This guy is a megalomaniacal killing machine, not the warrior fighting for honor. His sole reasons for going to Troy at all is fame and ego. He wouldn't have fought at all (due to a dispute with Agamemnon) if Patroclus hadn't been killed. Patroclus who (in the poem) he sent out with his armor on to fool Agamamnon. Achilles is a bad guy and everyone tries to make him out to be noble and heroic. 4.

He lack Russel Crow's ability to convey emotion without the use of dialogue. A&E television made a mini-series of Troy that was much better.

"divaclv","4","2","9","8 June 2005"," Trojan Bore
","Long ago, Euripides wrote a magnificent play called ""The Trojan Women."" In it, he reveals what happened after the Greeks snuck into Troy via that wooden horse and sacked the city--the women who mourned the dead even as they were taken as slaves, the children murdered for no crime other than being born to the wrong parents, the cruelty of war and man, and the enduring power of the human spirit. Though thousands of years have passed, it remains a drama every bit as powerful and relevant as it was when it was first performed.<br/><br/>I was thinking about ""Trojan Women"" a lot while watching ""Troy""--not because Wolfgang Petersen's movie evoked the same emotions as Euripides' classic drama, but because I couldn't help but think of how much the movie failed to accomplish or even reach for. This is epic-lite, a bunch of decent battle sequences interspersed with soap-opera dialogue which tries in vain to convince us that some of these characters are worth rooting for or against.<br/><br/>""Troy"" is a de-mystified, toned-down version of Homer's classic epic ""The Illiad,"" which in and of itself isn't entirely a bad thing. You want to do the Trojan War without all that intervening by the gods, fine. You want to change it so at least some of the characters don't meet with a fantastically tragic death, I can play along. But for mercy's sake, let me at least care what happens one way or the other to the characters, okay? As everyone who's sat through their high school lit class knows, the Trojan War gets sparked off when Paris (Orlando Bloom) decides to make off with the Spartan queen Helen (Diane Kruger, pretty but lacking the je-nes-sais-quois that would help us believe she's capable of inspiring this sort of passion). Not surprisingly, this annoys her husband Menelaus, who immediately applies to his brother Agamemmnon (Brian Cox) for help. The war-mongering Agamemmnon has wanted to get his hands on Troy for a long time, so he takes up Menelaus' cause, rounding up the usual gang of mythological heroes, including Ajax, Odysseus (Sean Bean), and Achilles (Brad Pitt).<br/><br/>Achilles gets the most screen time during ""Troy,"" which is one of the movie's biggest problems. The lead character of a film doesn't have to be perfect (in fact, it's best when he/she isn't), but they at least have to be interesting or appealing enough that we care about them. Achilles isn't. He comes off as a violent, self-centered prima donna who doesn't know how to do anything other than kill people, and is played by Pitt with such smug blandness that I was rooting for him to injure that heel and get it over with. This is probably not the reaction Petersen was hoping for, and it doesn't help that Achilles is one of the few characters to inspire any reaction at all. However, veteran actors Cox and Peter O'Toole as Troy's king Piram make the most of their situation, and Bean's too-brief turn as Odysseus is done with such charm and cleverness that I wanted the war to be over with so I could follow his equally epic journey to get back home.<br/><br/>There are some good fight scenes in ""Troy,"" both between individual characters and between armies, but they are not enough to hold interest. Petersen may have tried to condense the ten-year siege of Homer's epic, but it still ends up feeling about that long."

In my opinion, this omission would be tantamount to leaving out Patroclus, Achilles's cousin, from the story. The latter played a similarly small but vital role in the plot, and he was included in the movie.<br/><br/>Cassandra was the clairvoyant virgin princess of Troy dedicated to Apollo, whose prophecies were never believed, but always came true. She warned that the Greeks were inside the Trojan Horse, and she even tried to burn the horse itself. Her objections, if heeded, would have changed the narrative, perhaps averting disaster entirely.<br/><br/>To have her strong objection, in both word and action, to admitting the Trojan Horse into the city reduced to a couple of lines spoken by Paris is, in my opinion, detrimental to the entire otherwise excellent production."

"TheMovieDiorama","6","1","3","28 June 2018"," Troy relishes in lavish epic battles and set pieces but has all the depth of blood-soaked sand.
","Having seen the theatrical version, I thought to give the director's cut an opportunity at winning me over. Totalling at a gargantuan 196 minutes, the additional 30 minutes of swords and sandals certainly justify the elongated runtime. But alas, even with all the blood and guts, it's hindered by a lacklustre screenplay. Loosely based on Homer's epic poem Iliad, depicting the Trojan War and the sack of Troy, which happens to be Homer's second poem Odyssey. A war of powerful greed, lustful pride and embellishing love, the Trojan War is one of the most famous wars in Greek Mythology. Director Petersen manages to convey the central theme of immortality through vivid battles and ultimatums, with little assistance from Benioff's screenplay. The sheer lack of characterisation, particularly from Paris and Achilles, resulted in a monotonous story about honour. There was no emotion. Understandably it is a period war epic and so the sprawling battles take precedent, and they are entertainingly violent. But when so much time is spent establishing these characters and the relationships between them, you would've thought some emotional resonance should've naturally transpired. Acting was functional, mostly focusing on the physicality of their roles, with Pitt and Bana being the standouts. The duel between Hector and Achilles remains one of the most engrossing battles put to film. The inventive sword and shield choreography was outstanding. Despite having wealthy mythological source material, Benioff managed to make several changes that lead me questioning particular choices, especially condensing a decade long war to a mere week or two. Being a fan of Greek Mythology, I found it difficult to believe certain aspects. Some characters died when they shouldn't have, romances bloomed that didn't exist. Yet, for mainstream audiences that are uninitiated with such backgrounds, this remains a well paced action epic with visceral violence and a solid cast. Just don't expect an honest translation of Homer's poem."

","I know, I know, I worked in history, the Iliad is a classic...yadda, yadda, yadda. Don't worry I'm not going to hate on it for historical inaccuracies and I won't hate on it for really not following the story.<br/><br/>I mean, it's Hollywood, historical accuracy can only go so far for entertainment reasons and, well, the real Iliad reads like, well, like rape porn. There's a reason you only get the abridged version in school and a reason that you'll never see an accurate unabridged version on the big screen...unless Paul Verhoeven is attached to direct.<br/><br/>I am going to hate on the film though. Brad Pitt looked great, kudos to really trying for the Greek God look. Unfortunately that doesn't really make up for a poor performance. We know he can act, we've all seen it before, but he just did the action movie phone in here and that took away from the film as a whole.<br/><br/>I wouldn't blame him though. Wolfgang Petersen is really at fault here. The Iliad is one part history--in the Jewish Biblical sense, one part super hero book, and one part sex.<br/><br/>He cut the sex.<br/><br/>And the rest he couldn't exactly get a grip on. He went for classic epic ala Ben Hur instead and that's not really the Iliad. It need the surreal godly pantheon to keep it interesting and fantastical and he cut the bulk of that for more realism and, well, and it failed.<br/><br/>The result was a boring film that was trying to be both melodrama and action pic. The reality is that the Iliad is only a melodramatic classic because of age. In reality, well, it's an action/adventure tale of supermen and gods that inspired people like Alex the Great. Approaching like a classic work of art just, well, it just makes it long and boring.<br/><br/>The action was there, but done in a choppy half-hearted way, as if Petersen wanted to rush it as fast as possible to get to the melodrama and make the film an epic as modern lit saw it and not, well, the Homeric adventure poem it always was.<br/><br/>It drags until the end with understated characters that are nowhere near the demigods they are in the poem...and then falls flat at the end, killed by too much realism."

"HelenMary","7","1","3","29 November 2013"," It does Homer justice, I think
","This is an epic film based on an epic poem, and it is well told. There is much that is missed out and much that they've used license on but it works well and in terms of Hollywood is brilliant. Brad Pitt is superlative; beautiful, his physical presence on screen is domineering and like a ballet-dancer in the fight scenes. This is one of his best roles, and I imagine one of the most challenging; especially with all the leather mini-skirts he has to wear! It's not brilliantly acted, by all the characters, a little hammy, but in terms of CGI/SFX, production, direction and general cinematography it is superb. I would have liked to see 'grey-eyed Athena' in the film but the gods and that aspect of the story were missed out completely (except as reference, of course). As spectacle the film rivals the old Hollywood epics such as Quo Vadis and Spartacus for scale and also modern greats like LOTR.<br/><br/>There's lots to get your teeth into in this film; action, romance, history, good storyline and tragedy and you don't have to be a ancient Greek historian to follow/enjoy the film although you are likely to know the end given that everyone knows the story of Achilles (don't they?) The Set Design and Costume were great; just the right amount of modernity but suitable historical reference. However, it is Hollywood and you can't get away from that, but it's the kind of Hollywood like Anthony and Cleopatra, with wide angles of whole ancient cities, and a massive cast of extras which is just great to watch. I loved the score - the ancient style of chanting and singing. There's some awesome ""bullet time"" (Matrix) slow-mo action in the fighting which will take your breath away - and some of the action is graphic and bloody but it's not so bad that it's offensive and as it's all in keeping with the era and genre and apposite to the story.<br/><br/>The film makes me want to read the book again. It's not a perfect film and will never be a great classic, and the dialogue is a little confused, but visually it looks good and is an enjoyable watch if not taken too seriously."
"skadi-beorh","Null","1","3","24 August 2011"," Sanctity of Life
","One of my most loved films is the recent Troy directed by Wolfgang Petersen. This work touches me profoundly, for in the pivotal scene I watch Achilles in all of his power, and bathed in the praise and glory which has come to him because of its cultivation, kneel and fall over the dead body of the equally valorous Hector, as if to shelter him from any more pain or humiliation. In deep travail the nearly indomitable Hellenic hero lies mourning not only over the loss of a peer, but over his own flagrant and egregious profaning of the corpse which would have been allowed a heroes' burial were it not for his own hubris. Here in these saddening moments, and with copious tears, the broken heart of Achilles beckons knowledge and, in a sense, also invites beauty into his perception; the beauty that was the dynamic Hector, perhaps, but living memory can be sweet. Tempered by his wrenching anguish, the renowned Greek warrior becomes a whole person imprinted not only with strength of will, but with both knowledge and beauty revealing to him a place transcending his former experience; a place unmistakably marked with the ideal of sanctity of life an ideal not easily heard, and easily forgotten, when quest for power is undertaken by the soul not tempered first by love; by serving."

","The movie is an adaptation from Homer's Illliad. Unlike ILLIAD, where the Gods play an important role of influencing the war and the heroes, this film has downplayed the role of the Gods.<br/><br/>Though there are several deviations from the Illiad, the essence of its characters is sustained. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Achilles is commendable. The war scenes are breathtaking. Eric Bana is at his usual best. These two actors have carried the movie on their shoulders. <br/><br/>Some of you might get annoyed for this movie's deviation from the Greek Mythology. But if you could forgive this mistake, you will find that this movie is worth watching. Many people have tried to make a movie out of The ancient Greek myth and if you compare all those with Troy, one will appreciate Wolfgang Petersen for his effort. Making a movie of a long forgotten era is not an easy task. i shall give a full 10 for this movie."

It is hard to decide which 'side' your on because it shows the whole thing from points of view of people on both sides which not a lot of movies do. There definitely isn't a distinct 'good' and 'bad' guy in this film but thats one thing that makes it so brilliant! The film is very emotional at times yet always very believable.This film is especially for people who enjoy films about love and war and if you enjoyed gladiator then you will most certainly love this.

"shanebeacham","8","1","3","22 December 2009"," Theatrical Version VS Director's Cut
","I've seen two versions of the film Troy, starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Peter O'Toole. The first version I saw was the cut that was released in theaters at 162 minutes. Many people hated this film, but I don't understand why. I found it to be very entertaining. The acting was decent, despite some weak moments of dialog. Eric Bana was great, Peter O'Toole, who's not even in the film that much, is one of the more stand out characters, along with Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean. Brad Pitt was great in this film, and he makes the character of Achilles much more of a flawed character rather than just a god like warrior.<br/><br/>The action was very fun to watch. Some of it felt a little PG-13, but that didn't bother me too much and I had fun watching them. I was mostly impressed with Beach of Troy Battle; there were some things we haven't seen before, and it was very fluent and you could tell what was happening, which is more than I can say for ""Alexander."" I also liked that the film was more realistic than ""The Illiad"" which this film is based off of. Like I mentioned, Achilles is more a flawed, selfish character rather than a god like man that can only be killed by an arrow through his Achilles tendon. I also liked who they didn't have Greek Gods used during the war scenes.<br/><br/>Now I did have a problem with some of the acting, especially from Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, and-gulp-Brian Cox. Some moments of the movie were just ridiculous and reminded me of 50's epics. But still, I had fun with it, and it stands as one of those fun movies that I own on DVD.<br/><br/>Theatrical Cut: 7.5/10 Now when I heard there was a director's cut out, I instantly went out to get the movie. The director's cut adds a little more than a half hour of additional footage, the running time now at 196 minutes. Normally director's cuts nowadays just add back in a minute or two of gore, sex, and nudity. And while Troy does do that in some ways, it adds much more than that.<br/><br/>This version of Troy is in some ways a lot better and in some ways it isn't. The one problem I faced with the Director's cut was the way the music was edited. Sometimes they edit it in the wrong places, and it feels like the director's cut rather than full version of the film. And also the acting is re edited and it sucks, especially from Brad Pitt who ruled in the theatrical cut.<br/><br/>Having said that, the director's cut is much better than the original. The color tone is much more beautiful, the story is longer, the sound design is epic.<br/><br/>The thirty minutes added give us more character development, especially from Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean. You get a sense of why all these characters are fighting and what their motives are.<br/><br/>The film also adds a great amount of graphic violence. The theatrical cut had some graphic violence, but it still remained as something twelve year old kids could go see. The director's cut changes that, and now what was once a thin cut across the throat is now a gaping wound with lots of blood and gore. There is also a decent amount of nudity and sex added, but it isn't a gratuitous as the violence. It is merely there for some historical accuracy (people did sleep naked), and to underscore one or two love scenes.<br/><br/>The director's cut is more flawed then in the original, but it still feels like better. I like both versions of the film and I give them both the same rating, 7.5/10. Troy overall is a flawed epic, but still entertains you enough to forgive it's faults."

","Let's not care too much about how accurate it is to the myth (probably very little) and enjoy it for its own merits. If you want a big budget pseudo-historical movie with epic battles (although far from the best), gripping duels, charismatic heroes, tragedy and romance, this should fit the bill nicely. I very much liked the twists (although there's one anybody should already know ;) and the characters who, surprisingly for this type of film, were for the most part multidimensional and not without their flaws/redeeming factors on both sides of the conflict. It's just too bad that the gods were mostly evacuated from the story (with one possible exception) but then it might have hurt the rest of the character development too much. I was entertained and somewhat impressed despite my initial misgivings. It's worth renting or purchasing<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"
"lewis-51","9","1","3","21 January 2009"," magnificent!
","I just watched this movie in its entirety last night. Over the last several years I've seen parts of it on TV and was always impressed, but now that I've seen it all, I have to write a comment.<br/><br/>This is a stunning, magnificent movie, perhaps the best war movie I've ever seen. The only better one I can think of is ""Saving Private Ryan."" The acting by Brad Pitt is awesome. Eric Bana is excellent too, as are, really, all the supporting characters. There are no bad portrayals. There is no bad dialog.<br/><br/>I will skip over complementing the battle scenes, but, yes, I agree with other posters, the battle between Achilles and Hector is marvelous, and many other ones are very fine.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of the ancient Greeks all my life and have read several translations of the Iliad and Odyssey. This may sound like heresy, but this movie is better. The writers have wisely dropped the parts of the Iliad that would be difficult to translate into a film for modern viewers. They have put aside parts of the Iliad and brought in scenes from the Odyssey and other traditions. It is amusing to read the reviews of some people here who complain that the result is not ""historically accurate."" Oh come now. Surely you don't think the Iliad was historically accurate? It's a myth! The truth to be found in myths is not historical accuracy. <br/><br/>The net result is that the movie captures the feel of the Iliad for me. Brad Pitt's Achilles is absolutely perfect. The scenes with Priam in his hut begging for the body of Hector, and the earlier scene with his mother before he leaves for the war, are marvelous. This is no comic book or super hero version of Achilles. This is real.<br/><br/>One of the finest short exchanges I've ever seen is with Achilles and Briseus in the hut. ""When does it ever end?"" ""It never ends.""<br/><br/>The only reason I don't rate it it a 10, but only 9, is because inherent in the story is the semi-divinity of Achilles. While that adds something wonderful, it also makes it slightly less relevant to ordinary human life, though you can say that on the other hand it thereby symbolizes parts of human life.<br/><br/>In any event, a magnificent achievement all around. Clearly a performance and embodiment of Achilles and the ancient Greeks that can never be surpassed. Way, way superior to the movie ""300"", which is full of comic book characters."

","Troy is a LONG three hours of uneven spectacle. Alas, with better editing and pacing, this would have been a good movie. Even so, its definitely worth a watch, at least on DVD/television. While I initially hated Brad Pitt's Achilles, a second viewing has convinced me he played his role deliberately in such a ""non-heroic"" manner, in order to add to the anti-war sentiment of the film. Peter O'Toole is magnificent, and deserved more screen time. Eric Bana is the most sympathetic character in the film, which suffers as a result of his departure. Sean Bean is also decent. The fight scenes are a major disappointment, specially in the wake of the popular 'Lord Of the Rings'. Only Hector and Achilless' one on one fight leaves an impact.<br/><br/>Overall 6/10"

I believe all the parts were very well casted, although nothing spectacular. This movie will stick in your mind for a little bit, although it is not something that will stay in your mind forever. The plot was not very complex, but solid without many loose ends. The action is what made the movie, the plot helped, but overall the war scenes are what made this movie. If you have already gone through all the other great titles like this one, and you want to watch one more this is still a great choice. Although it may not be as memorable as the ""epic"" 300, it is still something very entertaining to watch."

","The cinematic quality of the film was good I suppose but I don't approve of all of the changes made to the story when ""The Illiad"" was a good enough story to last thousands of years. The movie was good as long as you don't have a passion for Greek mythology.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with it is that many people will now believe that the Trojan War was just like the movie. There should have been a disclaimer that said that the movie was LOOSELY based on Homer's The Illiad. The fact is that there are some very important characters and events that were not included. I also didn't approve of the portrayal of Paris, not because of Orlando Bloom, he is a very talented actor and should be recognized as such, but because of the way the script was written. Paris was an arrogant, selfish prince who didn't care about the consequences of his actions."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","3","2 December 2007"," The (more) realistic approach
","For better or for worse, this doesn't feature any of the gods of the myth. In fact, it apparently takes steps to eliminate the mythical aspects from Homer's epic poem... again, not everyone is going to like that. So this is a realistic(somewhat... it *is* Hollywood) retelling of the much-disputed story. Technically speaking, the film is good. The production values are rather high. The cinematography and editing are both quite skillful, and the epic shots covering the mass armies and locales are well-done. The acting is great, all-round. The story is played around with, details changed around, to fit the film they wanted to make. This tells both the story of the fall of Troy, and the stories of the people(though perhaps more the men than the women) on both sides of the conflict. The film will appeal to both genders, us men can look at all the war scenes, and the women can look at Pitt and Bloom bare-chested. The action is fairly accomplished... the camera-work, editing and choreography are all reasonably well-done. There is intensity in the fights and war scenes. There is some sexuality in the film. There is also violence, which I thought was the right choice, to not water down scenes of war(ones that may have actually been fought, no less). I don't know that it was ever gratuitous or over the line. I suppose this is a good watch for those who don't want the gods and other mythical elements(I won't say ""the story"", because I don't know that this is particularly accurate, in fact, all I've heard indicates the opposite to be far closer to the truth), and/or those who want to watch action set during that period. I recommend this to those who fall into the aforementioned groups, but any historians may want to steer clear, as well as anyone else looking for an account that sticks to the known facts closely. 7/10"

","Historians in truth, do not really, really know what happened in Troy, other than what they decide that they have read is true. That being said, I liked this movie, I liked how this movie did surprise me, I will see this movie again. I think that both Brian Cox (Agamemnon) and Brendan Gleeson (Menelaus) cast as brothers are very strong, these two hold well. Personally I think Eric Bana's (Hector) acting shows great talent in this movie, as he out performs his peers. Orlando Bloom (Paris) he was cast rightly, as the young prince of Troy. Then there is Mr. Pitt, sorry. So then there is Brad (Achilles). A lovable warlord, who fights for the right reasons, his own.

"TheCajunPhoenix","8","1","3","29 September 2007"," Troy is Worth a Watch in Spite of Flaws
","'Troy''s best parts revolve around the showdown between the pragmatic Hector (Eric Bana) and the conflicted Achilles (Brad Pitt). Then they first meet, you can all but feel the adrenaline rush between them. The deal is, Orlando Bloom doesn't quite bring his portrayal of Paris to the level it deserves to be. Something is wrong if you can't take your eyes off the nipples of one of your main characters, as is shown when Paris and Helen (Diane Kruger) share their last night before Helen goes to Troy with Paris. Andromache (Saffron Burrows) is only featured in a handful of scenes but demonstrates quiet courage during the siege of Troy. Aeneas(Frankie Fitgerald) doesn't really belong here. Achilles trusts three people on his quest for immortality--Patroclus (the cute-as-a-button Garrett Hedlund), Myrmidon veteran Eudorus (the intense Vincent Regan), and Ithaca's King Odysseus(the charismatic Sean Bean). What sucks is Menalaus (Brendan Gleeson of 'Braveheart' fame) never really gets his revenge on Paris after their swordfight leads to Paris getting his butt kicked. Brian Cox's Agamemnon is hell-bent on completing his empire by conquest and consolidation of his rivals, but he's not a clearcut antagonist. I hink he hits the ideal mix of raw power and the will to win. Peter O'Toole is touching as the somewhat trusting King Priam, and his interactions are amazing. It's heart-wrenching to watch Priam's interaction with his sons and when he reunites with the captive Briseis(the feisty Rose Byrne)after facing down Achilles. I like Achilles's interactions with Odysseus the best because Odysseus is one of the few people who defends Achilles's best traits after Agamemnon decides he likes Briseis as well. He functions as a confidante who guides Achilles away from the edge of the proverbial cliff. Whereas Achilles is a fighting machine, Odysseus might be the original 'Cerebral Assassin.' The toy wooden animals are a mirror bookend--Hector's wooden lion and a Greek soldier's wooden horse--for the fate of Troy after the swordfight between Achilles and Hector out of vengeance for Patroclus's fate. Garrett Hedlund is literally a babyface who has no business picking up a spear and shield Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom weren't the best picks for Achilles and Paris aside from their sensual appeal. Achilles's liaison with Briseis does only a minimum of storyline advancement, and Paris comes across as a nervous 16-year-old kid on his first date. Does 'Troy' deserve its own sequel? I think it does, and it would be amazing to see Sean Bean's Odysseus in the sequel--nobody else should be considered for this multi-talented Ithacan monarch!"

I thought the theatrical cut of Troy were OK, no more and no less. But the director's cut made it so much better. Adding a little nudity, quite a bit of blood and gore and a bit more character depth made this film one of the best and most intense I've watched this year. The battle scenes are better, the characters more likable and more fleshed out and overall the movie feels more epic.

"aspf2224","Null","1","3","24 September 2006"," Petersen's Lost Opportunity
","It's funny how your expectations of a movie can reflect how you like it. Word of Mouth for ""Troy"" had been negative, so when I finally sat down to watch it I wasn't expecting much. It didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>""Troy"" is a retelling of the Greek Legend in which Paris, a Prince of Troy, seduces Helen, the wife of the King of Greek Sparta and brings her to Troy. The Greeks gather their Army and set siege to Troy, eventually overcoming the city. We've all heard about the Wooden Horse. Mercifully, Director Petersen doesn't spend too much time on this, instead concentrating on the aspects of the Legend most people won't be familiar with.<br/><br/>Where he fails is in the characterizations. He is restrained by needing to be somewhat faithful to the legend. Nevertheless, most of the characters are so profoundly stupid that you can't sympathize with their plight. Indeed, within fifteen minutes you've decided Troy *deserves* to be destroyed. The Greeks are so unlikable you watch the movie with no stake in either side.<br/><br/>Trojan Price Paris (Orlando Bloom) is a self-pitying impulsive womanizer. Helen (Diane Kruger) weeps that her adultery with Paris will see many deaths, but beyond weeping doesn't do anything about it. Trojan King Priam (Peter O'Toole) is a one-dimensional fool who repeatedly declares ""The Gods will protect us"" and thinks nothing of risking his city so his son can get a bit of nooky. It's an indefensible position, but a good actor should be able to carry this off. O'Toole fails. O'Toole alternates between fatherly smiles and the stunned Goldfish. He makes stupid decision after stupid decision, to the point you the viewer are grasping for your imaginary short-sword and muttering ""Someone kill him already."" Normally I like Brad Pitt, but he is miscast as Achilles. Even with his weight-lifting for the role, he looks too puny to be an epic hero. He doesn't look like a soldier; anything but. He doesn't look like he'd last five minutes on a real battlefield, certainly not one as physical as this. Yet he's *supposed* to be this epic warrior of Legend; perhaps even a demi-god. It just doesn't work. Not only is he unconvincing physically, but his acting here has to be his worst. His battle rally to his troops as his ship hits the beach has the rancor of a Tuperware Party. David Benioff's script doesn't offer Pitt much either; His character is stupidly inconsistent. His motivation is supposed to be a lust for fame, but spends most of the time acting like he couldn't care less. Too many holes and inconsistencies.<br/><br/>The only spark in the cast is Eric Bana as Hecktor. He looks and acts the part of an Epic Trojan Hero. He also has the benefit of being the only one who gets to say ""Maybe this is a dumb idea..."" You have to wonder why, in a city as large as Troy, no one else questions whether Paris' humpy-humpy is worth dying for. Bana does utter a line to try and convince us this hole in the plot has been covered, but it doesn't work; ""We fight for our country (so let's overlook my brother slipping it to King Menelaus's wife)"" There were some good actors in the cast, but they were wasted. Sean Bean does nothing but wander up to Achilles every thirty minutes and says ""Come back and fight."" There are good performances by some of the supporting actors in bit roles, but the script gives these so little time they're wasted.<br/><br/>Much of the Benioff's script doesn't make sense. It has many of the characters doing stupid things without giving you a convincing rationale as to why. Sure the actual characters in the actual legend did stupid things too, but the script fails to give us the ""why"". In one of the stupidest scenes, when Hecktor accidentally kills a 16 year old boy in the middle of a big battle, everyone stops, looks sad, cries and agree ""No more fighting for today."" Amid the carnage and all the other young men dying, this makes no sense. Neither does Achilles reaction.<br/><br/>What saves Troy is the fighting scenes and special effects. These alone make it watchable. The production qualities are generally good, and the Mid-Atlantic accents adopted by the cast work well. (Amusing Idea: Redub the movie in Greek Accented English.:-) One thing that doesn't make sense; despite being a war on the hot shores of Modern day Turkey, no one breaks into a sweat or ever gets dirty. Much of this movie looks like a soap commercial.<br/><br/>By way of contrast, I'd like to direct you to David Gemmel's own rewrite of the Troy Saga. He's written two books in a three part series about the Trojan War, the first being ""Lord of the Silver Bow."" So far Gemmel has introduced us to most of these characters, and they're far better than Benioff's script. Bit players such as Andromache (little more than a walk on in Petersen's film) come to life. Gemmel's Priam is much more interesting King. Behind Gemmel's Priam is a scheming, devious mind. Behind O'Tooles Priam is simply a perpendicular piece of cardboard.<br/><br/>Petersen's Troy is a lost opportunity, floundering on a poor script and a miscast Pitt. He is more Paris than Achilles, and perhaps not even that.<br/><br/>My Rating: 2 out of 4 stars (for the fighting).<br/><br/>I suggest you read Gemmel's ""Lord of the Silver Bow"" for a much better story. Petersen's version doesn't do it justice."

Not near enough Sean Bean, no use of Diomedes as a character, AND FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE, LLAMAS!!!! No kidding LLAMAS skittering through the panic shot as the alarm is raised (Those long-venturing Acheans must have had some really dandy trade routes). Then 10 years are compressed into one, Achilles sneaks into town in the Trojan horse long after he died, Agamemnon, (a nice portrayal here as well) gets killed by Briesis rather than Clytemnestra back home and Menelaus gets his from Hector, instead of ""falling in love at the sight of golden Helen's breasts"" and taking her home. Come on, didn't anybody read the book? And what's wrong with the gods showing up from time to time? The Greeks thought they were there and played roles in the war. Divien intervention doesn't mean they had to get the Ray Harryhausen treatment to make use of them. Peterson didn't have to have them visible at all, just the effect of their action. So now we get a half-good treatment of the war at Troy. Now the opportunity to do full honor to the Iliad is likely gone on the multi-million buck budget for this under-performing epic shortfall."

You could see the internal conflict in his eyes as he anticipates a war which he feels is needless. Peter O'Toole was also excellent - making the character an extension of himself and also displaying his screen presence. On the opposite spectrum was Achilles (Brad Pitt). Pitt played him like a whiny, self-absorbed, conceited a$$hole. I don't think he was written that way. There are many scenes where Pitt is disinterested and it shows.

I'd be willing to say that half the film was nothing but battle scenes. Although this is a personal preference, I just don't find this type of stuff entertaining at all.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the characterization (or lack thereof). There wasn't any character development, although the writers no doubt were limited by the constraints of the original story.<br/><br/>Although ""Braveheart"", on paper, is much the same type of film, it was entirely entertaining, I think because there was so much more of a story to hold the film together."

","The movie Troy has some entertaining parts and Eric Bana does a nice job of playing Hector, but don't mistake this for anything close or faithful to the original story. As noted in the trivia/errors section for this movie, a number of characters die in the movie that survive in the poem (at least until later times), much of the equipment and battle techniques are wrong, and the core of the Achilles character is totally wrong. In the Illiad Achilles is vain, powerful, proud, and given to fits of anger and intense jealousy and hurt feelings. The movie attempts to show this by having him fly into a rage when his war prize is taken by Agamemmnon. Achilles is supposedly upset by this because he has some kind of deep feeling for her. In the poem, it is quite clear that he attached no particular importance to her other then as a prize he has won in battle. He is enraged when she is taken not because he loves her, but because it is a loss of face in front of the men to be upstaged by a king he feels is unworthy of the title. There is no love interest plot line(unless you want to suggest a homosexual one between Achilles and Patrocolus). I understand that the writer/director had to condense a lot of material, but a lot of these changes just don't make sense. The Illiad is not a poem about war. Otherwise, it wouldn't start the narrative nine years into a ten year siege that we also don't see the end of. It's about human passion and emotion and becoming more human, as well as telling an entertaining story of conquest and battle. It was the action movie blockbuster of its time but still had 1000% more heart and humanity then the adaptation. Whoever wrote this movie may have read the poem, but they clearly didn't understand it. Some nice acting, but a poor job of translating the story to the big screen."

","It's no surprise that this film was set up with female audiences in mind when they cast Brad Pitt as the lead role. Complete with golden locks and a surfer's tan, Pitt plays Greek hero Achilles. ""Troy"" is the modern day re-creation of the Trojan War. For those unfamiliar with mythological history, Achilles was the mightiest of the Trojans in the war, suffering only one weak spot, his heel. The film brings this and other common legends (the Trojan horse ambush) together with an expensive budget to back up fight scenes similar to ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"". Unfortunately, ""Troy"" carries on unrelentless and seemingly oblivious to the staminas of the audience (runs just under three hours). The later half represents a weak pulse to a dramatic conclusion, which quite honestly was something of a let down.

Unfortunately, neither predispositions were enough to rate this movie higher than ""fair."" <br/><br/>To say this movie was based on The Iliad is, well, acceptable in so far as the characters and events are historically accurate, but other than that it's not a very genuine adaptation. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Achilles was bland, and his acting was as monotone as Ben Stein's voice.<br/><br/>The action sequences should have been and could have been much better had they not been done with an overtone of utter blandness. They just didn't have the same spirit of large, grandiose battles like we've seen in Gettysburg, Braveheart or Gladiator.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom was a cowering simp in this movie, and if that was his intent for his portrayal of Paris, then he nailed it quite nicely. Otherwise, the movie would have been better off without him.<br/><br/>The film's only saving grace was Eric Bana's portrayal of Hector and Sean Bean's depiction of Odysseus.

Brad Pitt is perfect as the anti-hero superman, you really believe he is invulnerable. Some of the other casting leaves doubts, Eric Bana although acting well seems to slight to be Hector. Helen fails to convince that men would go mad for her beauty. The 10 year war is condensed into a few weeks, and towards the end of the film increasing liberties are taken with Homer's history.

Brad Pitt proves, as he did in ""Seven"" and ""Sleepers"" that he's no mere pretty boy. His nuanced portrayal of Achilles in ""Troy"" is a powerhouse turn. Eric Bana (Hector), Brian Cox (Agammemnon) and Brendan Gleeson (Minelaus) give strong support. As well, Sean Bean breaks type, rendering a measured, thoughtful Odysseus. Peter O'Toole is magnificent as Priam. Had Peterson reigned in the schmaltz and stuck to the hard, driving economy that fuels this sprawling saga, ""Troy"" would rate 11 on a scale of 1 to 10.

","I had very high expectations for Troy. Why wouldn't I. The Battle of Troy is the one story that has overcome time and lived for over 3000 years. The epic battles, the powerful characters, and most importantly, the beautiful women. To be brutally honest, Troy fell short in every aspect. If there was one thing that could have saved the movie, it would have been the battle between Hector and Achilles outside the Trojan walls. I was expecting a ten minute battle, a sequence that would have done justice to probably one of the greatest battles of ALL TIME. It didn't. It was unemotional and simply lacked creativity. To venture from the battle and discuss casting, Brad had his moments. He comes across as a hard brute, exactly what he should have been. It was not until half way through the movie, where his emotions started peeking through, that I began to enjoy his performance. To me, he just seemed distant and not in the moment. On the other hand, Peter O'Toole, the king of Troy, was AMAZING. My favorite sequence was when the Trojan Horse was brought into the city and the Greeks began to burn Troy to the ground, and the camera cuts to Peter O'Toole looking over it all. That shot had a lasting impression on me for the rest of the film (which was about 4 minutes), and only Peter O'Toole could have pulled it off. AMAZING job."

","Brad Pitt stars as Achilles in this re-imagining of Homer's Ilyad.<br/><br/>Despite the source material the film remains an unashamedly crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster, taking liberties with the original story in order to create a more dramatic screenplay. Although purists would rightly take issue with the rewriting of an ancient myth, there is no denying that the final result is impressive.<br/><br/>Troy features some of the most sustained and dramatic action sequences yet seen on screen. As well as the mass Lord of the Rings style battles, utilising computer graphics to display epic tussles between the Greeks and Trojans, there are several equally exciting duals between the principal characters.<br/><br/>This is a film packed full of star names, including Orlando Bloom as Paris and Brian Cox as Agamemnon. Perhaps the most impressive is Peter O'Toole as Priam the king of Troy. The moment when he contemplates the annihilation of all he holds dear is incredibly poignant, and demonstrates that this film is more than just an excuse for a lot of dramatic action.<br/><br/>Troy doesn't present a clearly delineated struggle between the forces of good and evil, and this makes it all the more intriguing. While Brad Pitt is the hero for the Greeks, most of the other stars in the film play Trojans, and so neither side is simply portrayed as a faceless enemy horde.<br/><br/>There's no denying that the film flags slightly in between the battles, and the fact that it takes so many liberties with its source material mean that it can't be recommended unequivocally. However I think it's somewhat harsh to criticise this film for its anachronisms, and believe it should be appreciated for what it is, an enjoyable historical blockbuster, which delivers on its promise of epic entertainment."

I don't wish to criticise James Horner for his efforts as he had one of the shortest time spans in history to do a film score, but Wolfgang Petersen's decision to scrap Gabriel Yared's score which, judging from the trailers, had potential was possibly one of the worst decision's in his career. As Empire magazine puts it ""Portentous Synths (check), ethnic wailing (check), morose love theme (check) - until the end credits ballad really does the damage"" (sic).

","Watched Petersen's Troy more than once during flights to singapore and back... Why I did, i'm still asking myself.

The acting credits and caring for belongs to Eric Bana's Hector, in fact, he's the only guy in this movie who seems to be not a complete a*****e. He's taking care for his people and beloved ones, giving the greatest sacrifice. Hope to see more from this one... Pitt comes second, with a distance, having a hard part walking on a thin line between mass murderer and hero looking for the meaning of his existence. Still, in this adaption, achilles appears to be a disturbed kid superstar with talent for killing people, fallen into the wrong hands of a greedy manager. Was this the guy Homer wrote about ? Bloom does nice work as the horny boy Paris, pathetic little brother of Hector, causing all the trouble we get to see and lots of people get massacred for. Semi-solid acting from others. Some disappointment was good old Peter O'Toole playing the somewhat Creutzfeld-Jacob-infested king of troy... he has seen betters days and done some real epic movies long time ago.

"Robert_duder","Null","1","3","2 December 2004"," Hollywoodized Epic Tale!!
","Having been a great fan of Greek History, and Ancient History in general it was with great anticipation that I watched Troy. I was by no means disappointed and no one else should be either. This is not a historically accurate, perfectly depicted retelling of Homer's amazing historical tale of Troy and Achilles but rather an Epic, beautiful story made to impress with the highest dollar to rake in the box office dough. Sure the aspects of history are there but they were aiming to tell a story and Hollywoodize with beautiful faces, amazing battle scenes and an unlimited budget. Although I don't believe Troy cleaned up at the Box Office it has everything in place to be a blockbuster. <br/><br/>Having recently seen Alexander, a very historically drawn out, slow film not made to impress but rather be as accurate and controversial as possible I know these are two extremes and it seems as though movie goes are too fickle to enjoy either one. Alexander was ""boring"" ""slow"" and ""too realistic"" and Troy was ""glorified too much"" and ""big name actors ruined it."" There seems to be no pleasing movie goers for the Greek films. <br/><br/>Troy is the story of Sparta and the impending peace they are making with their long time enemy Troy. A Greek city of amazing military power, culture and knowledge. The sons of The King of Sparta, Hector and Paris are in Sparta to affirm the peace treaty. Unfortunately Paris is madly in love with, and having a passionate affair with Helen, the King of Sparta's sister in law. Paris convinces Helen to return to Troy with him envoking the wrath of her husband upon them who then turns to his brother the King to wage the largest scale war ever known to man on Troy. Sparta enlists the help of Greece's greatest hero, a man said to be immortal and son of the Gods Achilles played by Brad Pitt. Although Achillees feels no ties to the Spartan King, for the sake of glory and power he goes to Troy to help wage the battle. <br/><br/>Pitt as the lead character and the immortal hero Achilles does a great job of being a leading Hollywood man. He won't walk away with any Oscars for this role nor should he and it's far from his greatest performance but it's good and he does what he was meant to do for this film. He's cocky, and vain, and conceited and has the look of a man who believes he is immortal. He womanizes, falls in love, and is a bloody ruthless killer all in one swoop and pulls it off flawlessly. Pitt is a great actor but he also fills the shoes of the film maker who wants a sexy leading man. Eric Bana is perfect also as the hero of the other side Hector who leads his men with valiant, and strong character. Orlando Bloom continues his epic roles coming out of Lord Of The Rings series and Pirates of The Caribbean to play a much more modest and meek character but a handsome lover in Paris. Bloom must really be an expert bowman as he gets to flex his bow and arrow yet again in this film. Diane Kruger who was also good in National Treasure this year makes another decent performance as the especially lovely Helen in which this war is started over. Brian Cox also adds a flair as Aggamemnon the king to Sparta. He makes an excellent villain of sorts and a believable King. One of the highlights in the film that really does add the true acting flair to this film is Peter O'Tooles roles as King Priam of Troy. You can't doubt O'Tooles acting credibility who has been around for decades and certainly knows a thing or two about Historical Epics. He adds an emotional and wonderful performance to the film.<br/><br/>The Battle scenes and cinematography showing Troy and Ancient Greece and the scenes at the end with The Trojan Horse as brilliantly filmed by Wolfgang Peterson who has done some of my favorite action films. He knows how to make a blockbuster. The battle scenes are gory and well shot and there are plenty of them in this film something Alexander sadly lacked. <br/><br/>All in all I don't think this movie disappoints. It may not show historically what everyone wants and it may stray far from Homer's Illyiad in it's story and certain facts but there is nothing wrong with basing something but not following it exactly. That gives us the opportunity to be pleasantly surprised. I would only suggest that more of a focus on Helen and Paris who really were the cause of this war would have been nice. It seemed as though the greatest war known to man lost it's reasoning somewhere there. Nonetheless this will become a popular film when hitting DVD I have no doubt and for good reason. It's extremely entertaining and still manages to fall in at almost three hours. Bravo to them.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I have been an avid movie fan for almost 40 years, and ""Troy"" is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever seen. I am a fan of not only the ""what happens"" in a movie, but all the things that come together to make a film enjoyable -- acting, direction, lighting, scripting, music, effects, etc. The reasons that I enjoyed it so much are far to numerous to list in a short review, so I'll just touch on a few that stick out in my mind.<br/><br/>While the movie did occasionally deviate from Homer's Iliad, I am not aware of any changes that did not MAKE IT A BETTER MOVIE. By their very natures, movies and books have their own strengths and weaknesses, and what is effective in one format is not always presentable in the other. I think that David Benioff did an admirable job of presenting the story of Achilles in a way that remained true to the ""core concept"" of The Iliad, making only those changes that were necessary to keep the viewers' attention and move the story along.<br/><br/>I cannot say enough about how blown away I was by Peter O'Toole in this movie. His passionate rendition of King Priam was definitely the emotional apex of the film. I will be both surprised and saddened if he does not receive an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor at the next Academy Awards presentation.<br/><br/>I overheard a friend say of the movie that he thought Brad Pitt's performance was ""wooden"". Maybe it's just me, but I didn't see it that way at all. I saw it as a effective portrayal of a truly driven man who was almost psychotically focused on his craft -- battle -- and fairly oblivious to anything else.<br/><br/>In the weeks before its release, I often wondered how ""Troy"" would deal with the actual appearance of the Trojan Horse. How realistic would it be, given the rudimentary nature of the materials and abilities of the era? I give Wolfgang Petersen a perfect 10 for that image -- I don't see how it could have been done better.<br/><br/>There's lots more: Good to great acting in many cases, a piercing, memorable score, excellent pacing throughout the film, and the wonderfully simple yet effective use of yellow tinting that gives the entire film a subliminal sense of antiquity.<br/><br/>What ""Troy"" brought to mind to me is Zeffirelli's ""Hamlet"" (starring Mel Gibson in the title role) -- a film that effectively brings a piece of classic literature to the general public in a way that they can enjoy, understand and emotionally connect with. Major Kudos to everyone involved -- this is a MUST SEE flick!"

","i wanted very much to watch Troy since i watched the trailer. in fact i don't know the complete story about the Trojan War. As i heard from many comments that Troy was narrated from Homer's Iliad so i purchased an electronic version of the Iliad and spent almost 10 days reading it.<br/><br/>at last i went to watch Troy with some friends. I was amazed, this is nothing the Iliad. what's the problem with some people and some critics, this isn't the Iliad, this is the Trojan War so we can't fail a movie just for not matching the original text.<br/><br/>in my viewpoint, the movie was about the Trojan War and the Iliad was the only written text available so the makers of Troy used the Iliad as their original raw material. we all know that the Iliad started with the tenth and last year of Troy besiege and finished with the death of Hector but the movie goes far beyond.<br/><br/>i admire the talent of Wolfgang Petersen, he made a movie, another version of the wellknown Iliad. Maybe Homer created the Iliad from nothing and Petersen created his own version, who knows?. In fact this movie deserves the money spent on it because without its special effects it would be nothing. Some say that it was easier for Petersen to make the movie this way, i mean giving up all the Gods, the events we didn't see in the movie but i say that it was very much harder for him to change it into this form. In fact it was more convincing, i mean who cares about Gods and myths in such a movie. many people would love Troy just for being Troy even if they know nothing about the original story.<br/><br/>there were some scenes that really were familiar, others needed some explanation. for example the scene when Odysseus is accompanied by some warriors to ask Achilles to participate in the war, doesn't it remind you of ""Mission Impossible 2"". one other scene, when Achilles is holding Briseis after the fall of Troy and Paris launches his arrow into Achilles' heel, he seems to lose power and die. many friends of mine were amazed by that. Does a hero like Achilles die because of an arrow in the heel, they needed some explanation from the Iliad to accept it, maybe through the movie someone had to mention that Achilles was invulnerable to wounds through out his body except his heel.<br/><br/>any way the movie is a master piece of Wolfgang Petersen who saved it in many twists especially that the dialogue was so naive. consider watching it muted, that will change nothing.<br/><br/>while Brad Pitt and Eric Bana were a real heroes, Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom did nothing just looking very naive and silly, they never looked in love.<br/><br/>Troy will never meet your expectations whether high or low. It has both..."
"RLent-1","5","1","3","17 August 2004"," Not bad, but not the Iliad.
","I might have liked Troy better if I knew nothing about the Iliad.  Troy is not an adaptation of the Iliad, it is based only VERY loosely upon it.  This movie just uses the names.  Without giving away spoilers, some characters that are major in the Iliad are given very short shrift here.<br/><br/>It's an OK movie if you can watch it for what it is, and understand that you are NOT watching a movie version of the Iliad.  This movie comes about as close to the Iliad as would a Xena version.  It does provide entertaining spectacle, and hopefully people will become interested enough to learn about the actual legends."
"mjensen-3","4","1","3","12 August 2004"," ""I expected another Ben-Hur, but I get trash""
","Wolfgang Peterson spends 170 million dollars to turn our heros into boring Greek gods.  Brad Pitt(Fight Club) is a great actor, but the demension he tries to ad to his character Achillies, the more he fails. What we don't know is that Achillies was in love with his cousin, and when his cousin dies, Brad show's no emotion, he just wimps.  Orlando Bloom doesn't really do anything, in fact his whole career is not doing anything. In ""Lord Of The Ring"" he doesn't do anything, but he showed that he cared for his friends, and the girls loved him. But there is no acting in this movie, just action, action, mindless action, to be honest with you, the real actors are Peter O, Toole and Eric Banner.  But thats not saying much, but Peter does save the film in some odd way.<br/><br/>""Troy"" has ended up like ""The Alamo"", same situation, and with the same outcome, the audience is sick and tired of war films, especially with no accurate details of what happened.  In ""Lawrence Of Arabia"", the film is driven by silence, acting and beauty, but then again David Lean was a genius, and Wolfgang Peterson did only one good film(The Perfect Storm).<br/><br/>What a dissapointment. *1/2(out of 4 stars)."
"kevnar","Null","1","3","4 August 2004"," The Critics are idiots
","Okay first things first, if you've read any criticisms of this movie whose chief argument is that the movie makers changed the original story, go ahead and disregard them like so much chaff in the wind. To those critics all I can say is, why do you even bother going to movies if you seem to idolize books so much? Keep your nose in the books and us movie-lovers will keep ours turned to movies. Comparing the two is always going to be apples and oranges, unless you feel like going to see a movie that ends up being two weeks long.<br/><br/>Such criticism are more based in the critics desire to brag about their vast knowledge of the source material anyway, rather than any problems they had with the movie as a movie, in and of itself. Go brag to your fellow egg heads and leave the rest of us to enjoy the movies that are made from these classic stories.<br/><br/>Having said that, I'll get to my comments on the movie itself. It was a great movie. I've seen it twice. <br/><br/>The movie had a great story. Whether it followed the source material or not is really irrelevant. The characters moved and changed. The plot twisted and turned. Actions had consequences, which led to more actions, which built and built to an intense conclusion. I found myself actually caring about the characters, even though they were people from 3 thousand years ago, they were still human beings. It was everything a good story is supposed to be.<br/><br/>The acting was nothing to complain about either. There wasn't a single actor in the entire movie whose performance took me out of the movie's world. There wasn't even a single moment on screen that did that.<br/><br/>The battle scenes and special effects were cool too - very intense and entertaining, and isn't that what we go to movies for in the first place? The sets and costumes were impressive as well. All of these things worked together to create a world that I had never seen before.<br/><br/>My only criticisms really were the fault of the theater I'd gone to see the movie in. The sound was atrocious, burbling like a 1950s classroom projector through the whole thing, and a couple of idiots' cellphones went off and they actually answered them and started talking right in the middle of the movie. (Honestly, if theater owners can enforce a ""no outside food or drink"" policy, why can't they force people to check their cellphones at the door or something?) <br/><br/>All this is beside the point though. Troy was a quality production which I will no doubt purchase on DVD when it comes out."
"Juni78ukr","9","1","3","10 July 2004"," Best big budgeted movie of the year so far
","Well, Troy is a very good movie. Possibly it's not an absolutely great masterpiece, but I think it was the best film what I have seen this year. It's a great epic but not exactly Gomer's epic. The screenwriters have changed changed many things but all of them were reasonable changes. This is war of heroes, not of the gods. not of gods. Wolfgang Petersen brought to the movie his point of view of war. War without right and guilty sides but war with kings-warmongers and ordinary soldiers who die on the battlefield. Whatever reason for it, war is absolutely horrible thing. And the Helen is just a cause (like it happens in many modern conflicts). Obviously many people were disappointed with Petersen's view of Homer's masterpiece but his Troy is reasonably adopted for modern viewer and much more realistic as an ancient war. That's quite memorable and unusual for Hollywood that Troy is almost free from clichéd stereotypes and dramatic elements which we can see practically in any Hollywood's product. <br/><br/>I heard that many people were complaining about acting but I really can't understand them. It was very good, particularly for such a large summer movie. Whatever people say there are no miscasts and all the actors did a good job creating memorable characters. Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom are good as Achilles, Hector and Paris respectively. The first one is so much impressive as the greatest hero of all time (obviously he had to work so hard to reach an agreement with his character) and at the same time he is only a human. Eric Bana finally delivered the best performance of his acting career (though I don't think that means too much) as Hector, a real hero of this war, who only wants to protect his homeland and family from invaders, the strongest and most likable movie character. Among the supporting characters worth to mention excellent performances of Peter O'Toole (Priam) and Sean Bean (Odysseus). What about Helen can ask you? She's not the point. The point here is a cold reality of war, it's senseless and absurdity, a courage of people who become heroes. Finally all that is reinforced with terrific, exceptionally wise and memorable dialogs (thanks to writers and everyone involved). The battle scenes as all above mentioned are excellently shot and performed, dynamic and realistic. <br/><br/>Overall, an excellent epic movie, wrongly under-appreciated by movie critics, which instantly must become a classic. I also want to notice that practically all people who dislike Troy were complaining not about movie itself but about changes in immortal Homer's story. First of all it was just inspired by the poem and was created for us, not for Homer's contemporaries and Peterson's view deserves all the credits. I hardly can believe that all these people wanted to see the gods playing in dirty games with human fates as a part of the story. <br/><br/>My rating - 8,8 out of 10. Between A- and A. Excellent piece of film-making all the way. <br/><br/>Sorry for my bad English."
"dung_rat","8","1","3","7 July 2004"," By no means bad...but flawed
","I know Troy has already received a slew of bad-to-mediocre reviews by the press here in the UK but, for me; I found it hard to truly dislike this film. That's not to say that it's not carrying its fair share of flaws.<br/><br/>Granted that Wolfgang Petersen has done some terrific work in the past and is an accomplished director and Troy is no exception. True: perhaps more time should have been spent making the film as historically accurate and authentic as possible to Homer's text. Surely a few historians/classicists wouldn't have gone amiss, either. Yet, to get a film as close to the sheer scale and majesty of Homer's work is surely a near-impossible task; surely no 3-hour spectacle could truly achieve this?! In that respect, I wasn't too agitated that some details were ignored and others were just poetic license. Maybe more attention could have been paid to The Gods' whom play such an integral role in the ancient poem.  It would seem that Petersen was happy with what had been re-written and then set about his work.<br/><br/>The acting is a mixed affair, ranging from great - Peter O' Toole, Brian Cox and Eric Bana; to satisfactory  Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean (who looks like he wasn't going to burst out laughing while delivering some of his lines!). Bean, I also feel could have maybe disguised his northern accent a little bit more, as could Brian Cox! Some of the lines that these guys had to deliver ranged from heartfelt to pure, unadulterated cheese which, in turn, leads to some heavy bouts of over-acting; not so good.<br/><br/>The battles scenes are superb and well paced. Of course, the obligatory links with LoTR have now been drawn but to see ancient battles on such a large scalewith spears, shields, bows and some impressive swordplay is a great visual experience. I was very impressed with the duel between Hector (Bana) and Achilles (Pitt). It's not overly gory but there's enough action to keep most people on their toes. The score is appropriate but not as strong as it could have been.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say that the film is well-paced given its length and rightly deserves a place in the annals of the great motion picture epics'. There's no ambiguity contained in the story but it did get a little boring constantly hearing about how heroes' took part in the Trojan War simply to gain their name and reputation in history; Achilles being the epitome of this and Petersen never seems to tire when alluding to this notion. Perhaps Troy is just a little bit more slow-burning that some other epic classics'. 7/10"
"dougandwin","9","1","3","6 July 2004"," Not historically right, but Oh! what a spectacle
","Critics can clearly argue with the rights and wrongs of the story in its depiction of history, but the film as sheer entertainment is brilliant. Though it lasts for nearly three hours, it did not drag at all, and the cast was extremely good, with particular emphasis on the part played by Peter O'Toole - as always quite brilliant.  Brad Pitt as Achilles played his part very well, and I felt his acting has improved considerably over the years. Eric Bana was really the star performer among the leads, and while he had some fairly ordinary lines to say, he did so with conviction. Bloom as Paris was passable, with not a lot to do for most of the movie.  The ""Trojan Horse"" sequence was well done, but seemed to be over a bit too quickly as it was after all supposed to be the real climax to the story.  All in all, a very good spectacle that did not disappoint from an entertainment viewpoint."

","I thought this movie was worthy of all high marks it received. The producers and everyone who worked on this movie did a bang up job on it. It does follow the Iliad but not to the letter.. if they did that the movie would be 7 hours long. Yes I have read the Iliad and when I saw this movie I was wondering what they were going to leave in and take out. Again, I say they did a GREAT job. And the lead cast.... what a cast! Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, and Brian Cox just to name a few very well acted and they all fit their character. Sean Bean, a seasoned actor and did a great job as Odysseus.

"heat95pd","9","1","3","2 July 2004"," Truly an epic
","With so many attempts at re-creating the bronze age mythical war between the Spartans and Trojans, this film had the biggest budget by far, $200,000,000. Director Wolfgang Petersen (THE PERFECT STORM, IN THE LINE OF FIRE) brings Homer's ""The Illiad"" to life with the summer epic film, TROY, starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom.  Brian Cox, Sean Bean, Peter O'Toole, Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne, Brendan Gleeson and Saffron Burrows round out the stellar cast.<br/><br/>In a nation overcome by war, Greek King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) seeks power over all of Greece.  Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), King of Sparta, resides with his beautiful Queen Helen (Diane Kruger) who, unlike Agamemnon, strives for peace with neighboring Troy. After both Sparta and Troy make a pact of peace, Prince Paris of Troy (Orlando Bloom) falls in love with Helen and brings her back to his homeland. The two Greek kings set sail along side 1,000 ships with one fighting for honor and one fighting for power.  Achilles (Brad Pitt), who is regarded as the greatest warrior in the world, fights for the greek army while still holding disdain for the cruel Greek King.  The weight of the Greek army falls upon Achilles and his Mermidans.  On the other hand, the Trojan army is led by Paris' brother, Prince Hector (Eric Bana).  Hector is an honorable man who has served his father, King Priam (Peter O'Toole), well through many battles.<br/><br/>Eric Bana and Brad Pitt give magnificent lead performances with Peter O'Toole dominating the supporting role.  O'Toole deserves a best supporting nomination.  Fight choreography, direction, acting, set design, costume design, and score all deserve praise. Great film. A+"

","OK .. I am a history buff and have read The Iliad, therefore I admit I was kind of dubious about going to see this film.<br/><br/>However, as a film ""INSPIRED"" by The Iliad, it was a worthwhile rendition. Achilles is arrogant and Mr Pitt managed that.  Paris was a coward, and Mr Bloom, again, had that spot on.  Mr Bana played Hector very well.  But with all characterisation, it is how the actor thinks the historical character would act.  We all have our own thoughts on how the character should act, but it's down to the actor and the director.  Yes, the gods should have been involved and there were many characters missed out.<br/><br/>OK, there were huge flaws in the whole thing, but to have created the film ""BASED"" on The Iliad would have been a more huge undertaking than The Lord of the Rings - the war lasts 10 years, and therefore a lot of time when nothing was happening .. trying to precis it into a 3 hour film takes some doing .. somethings have to be left out and there does have to be artistic licence.  <br/><br/>I think when they decided it would be ""INSPIRED"" by The Iliad, they just took the backbone of the story and not the flesh and skin, and therefore should be enjoyed as a mere shadow of The Iliad.<br/><br/>For pure enjoyment factor, I give this film 8 out of 10.  For the historical factor, probably 3 out of 10.<br/><br/>But remember, it's only ""INSPIRED"" on The Iliad :)<br/><br/>Bobb"
"ParadoxialCircumstance","7","1","3","28 June 2004"," A Well Made Epic
","Troy is a near-accurate representation of Homer's ""The Iliad"". This film starts off pretty well, but the various changes in location and focus on characters is very jumpy in the first half hour. After that, the film settles down to two points of view, those of the Greeks and the Trojans.<br/><br/>Another vague point is the hero of the film. Achilles is the intended tragic hero of the Iliad, but I found that throughout the film, we don't seem to learn enough about Achilles to truly feel great emotion for him. I was more sympathetic to Eric Bana's character Hector as a family man and man of honor.<br/><br/>This film has great special effects, but lacks slightly in the character development area. I give it a 7/10."
"ingvild_sorensen","8","1","3","28 June 2004"," Wonderful entertainment!
","As the sucker I am for historic movies, I had really big expectations for Troy. Well, besides for the fact that Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom has leading roles... I was a little afraid that it would be too much ""watch Brad's sweaty boody"" and that kind of stuff. <br/><br/>Well... it was a lot of sweaty Brad Pitt, but I guess it was okay. I think Brad Pitt did a real good job. Pitt played the anti-hero Achilles very convincing, in a way that we both had to love him, and hate him... Bloom was playing the prince Paris, who steals the beautiful princess Helen (Kruger) home, and starts the war. I think Bloom plays him well, but I really don't like how the script is showing him. I've read the book, and I actually think Paris should have been more heroic, not the sissy he is in ""Troy"". Eric Bana is playing Paris' older and much more heroic brother Hector, and he is Marvelous! He is like the Greek dream I waited for him to be.<br/><br/>All over, the movie Troy is a killer. Great war scenes, drama, love, heroes, death, friendship, hatred, revenge, battles, power, tactics, and the fight between good and evil. It has what a good movie needs. It delivers the goods!"

"high_rollin2-1","7","1","3","24 June 2004"," A Truly Wonderful Film!
","This movie is amazing. The film moves with such a wonderful pacing and the action is awesome. That battle in front of Troy is such a wonderful spectacle. I just loved it. I think a lot of people are hard on this movie, and it's unjustified. It's an action/adventure epic that promises a war story with big battles, and that's exactly what it delivers. Some people say that the acting is bad, but it's not. And even if it is, why should that matter? Acting isn't exactly supposed to the be the strong point of this movie. It's the spectacle that is the attraction, and the spectacle in this movie is amazing. Why is that so hard for people to accept? Acting and story isn't everything. Anyway, the story was great IMO. There's a scene where Hector kills somebody, and the twist in that scene really surprised me, and the following scenes are amazing (Achilles learning of it, and then the fight between Achilles and Hector... wonderful!) I loved the Trojan Horse as well. Very well done. And the invasion of Troy was awesome. I loved everything. This sword and sandal epic is very entertaining. Don't expect great acting, and you won't be disappointed. And don't expect ""The Iliad"" from it either. If it was supposed to be ""The Iliad"", they would have called it ""The Iliad"". But they didn't, they called it ""Troy"", because it isn't ""The Iliad"". It's pretty simple! There's also an amazing scene in this movie, which has very good acting from Peter O'Toole, and also Brad Pitt. It's a very memorable scene, and quite powerful. I've never seen such a great performance of ""grieving father"" before.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie exceeded my expectations. I went just expecting to see a bunch of great action scenes with good CGI. What I got was a bunch of great action scene with great CGI, and also a couple good scenes of emotion, and some good tension as well. Not to mention a great epic feel, and some good twists in the story. I liked it very much, and it deserves much more than what it's getting from the ungrateful audiences that films have today. This movie is great.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Arpi_K","Null","1","3","23 June 2004"," Average blockbuster
","Seeing the flaws in this movie is much easier than seeing anything else.<br/><br/>1. It was long, 2. the computer graphics werent that good, 3. & the acting was horrible. Brad Pitt was acting more like a cartoon character with his silly facial expressions, & his accent was terrible. In my opinion an actor's looks shouldnt matter as much as his/her performance this applies to both Pitt & Kruger who i think were the main causes for the negative reviews. Another thing I found the plot very weak. Paris & Hellen didnt look really ""in love"" i.e. (from the movie point of view) no reason for war, why Priam kept Helen, why Achilles was fighting, why did anyone in the movie bother to do anything? So for such a long movie it could've been ""related"" to the original Illiad. 4. Another thing that really annoyed me what kind of idiots does Peterson thinks us? the whole war, gathering armies, going to Troy takes one year. PLEASE!<br/><br/>Did i like this movie? yeah well i didn't ""hate"" it there are really great talents Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole, Saffron Burrows (perfect acting), and Rose Byrne.. the battle scenes are nice...

"alphaville-1","Null","1","3","22 June 2004"," Pitiful sword-and-sandals epic but not Homer (Spoiler)
","It's odd that given the production cost of this film no one involved seems to have actually bothered reading the work it claims to derive from. Of course one expects the wooden horse to appear even though this does not feature in the Iliad. What one does not expect is to have Achilles leaping from it - Paris should have shot him long before the siege ends, an event predicted in the Iliad and referred to in the Odyssey. The killing of Agamemnon by Achilles is a ridiculous embellishment that could only have been produced by someone with a complete lack of understanding of the Iliad and associated post-Homerica such as the Orestaia. Worst of all is the slaying of Menelaus by Hector in order to protect Paris: Menelaus returns (with Helen) after the war; both feature in the Odyssey.<br/><br/>This is a hugely disappointing film whose only redeeming features are the acting of Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean. I had hoped that a director of Petersen's ability would be capable of delivering something superior to the stilted 1956 version by Robert Wise, which at least has the merit of being reasonably faithful to its sources: it is quite a remarkable achievement to have generated something worse."
"Axel-9","7","1","3","19 June 2004"," Enjoyable, but could've been so much more substantial
","I really enjoyed Troy for the most part, but it's severely lacking in places and there are big problems caused by some of the changes to Homer's text.<br/><br/>Actionwise it's spectacular. Wolfgang Petersen's direction is perfunctory at best (imagine what a visionary like Peter Jackson or an action expert like Ridley Scott could've done with the material). The scale of it all is so great though, that such a problem doesn't impact too greatly on the entertainment value. There are literally thousands of warriors on screen slugging it out, and because so many real people have been used, there's no way of saying who are real extras and where the vfx begins. The fights aren't as dynamic as Gladiator's (the first of many times where I feel the need to compare the two) but there's plenty of punch and scale to it all. It's at it's best during the one on one moments, especially the Achilles vs Hector duel. There's an almost balletic quality to the way it has been choreographed, it's certainly not shot to look like your average bit of gladiatorial violence.<br/><br/>In between action sequences the characters and plotting are diverting enough. Peter O'Toole especially gives proceedings a genuine gravitas as Trojan King Priam. Eric Bana does a very good job as Hector, he's got a good screen presence about him and there were moments where I felt genuinely moved by his performance, in his defense of Paris, his final night with his wife as he holds his baby son and his final march down to face his doom. As some have mentioned Orlando Bloom is very much his standard self, but it seems right for the role he is playing, Paris is after all a legendary ladies man. I never particularly got the feeling he was in love with Helen, but there scenes together did enough to suggest it to me. Diane Kruger's Helen is similar to be honest, nothing stand out, but it's functional enough to move the plot along.<br/><br/>And what of the much talked about Brad Pitt. For me his portrayal of Achilles is at times hopeless. He's fine at the physical stuff and during the stroppy Achilles phase he does well, but the moment the role calls for any amount of emotion it goes to pieces. His reaction to the death of Patroclus his cousin felt like a whiny kid who'd just had his new toy taken away. And here's where the Gladiator comparison really does Troy no favours at all. You compare Pitt's feeble attempt at emotion to Russell Crowe's powerhouse display as Maximus. You want a broken man driven to revenge, take a look a Crowe, we've got rage, sadness, tears, the man even gives us snot. The scene where he collapses to his knees upon finding his family murdered says it all. OK maybe it's a bit harsh to compare a guy reacting to his cousin's death to a man who's just lost his wife and kid, and the diversion from Homer here doesn't help much either, seeing as Patroclus was Achilles's 'dear' friend, but come on he's practically untroubled by it all. Seeing as Petersen has set out to make a Gladiatoresque film, rather than giving us Homer's rich mythology, such a scene is vital and I thought it failed. Any scene from there onwards Pitt struggles, as he also does in showing passion for his lover Breiseis. That's a love that feels superficial, he might as well have won her in the lottery.<br/><br/>Anyway I could go on about Pitt's performance all day, suffice to say he may as well have been in a coffee shop with Jennifer Aniston, which is probably my main problem with his casting. He felt to contemporary, not 'dirty' enough to play such a role, nor hard enough.<br/><br/>Mention must be made of the music. James Horner is quite frankly a hack of a composer, something I've thought since Titanic, which was pretty much his score to Braveheart with a few extra bits. This is heavily pilfered from Gladiator, so we get the chanting melodies for sad scenes and the big chords for the battles. The difference being that Hans Zimmer has talent and produced something that felt fresh. The lyrical beauty of Lisa Gerrard's vocals is hoplelessly ripped off, especially as they were often used to score the more abstract moments of Gladiator, while Troy is very much a by the numbers movie.<br/><br/>Anyway for a film I'd still rate seven out of ten, I've been heavily critical of it. It is entertaining, which for cinema is very important to me. This was supposed to be a contender for film of the year though, an Oscar hopeful, and it doesn't live up to that. Even if it hadn't been hyped so heavily, it would still be a waste of a great piece of Greek mythology. Troy has very little to do with the Illiad at all, except for containing the same characters. Stripped of the sense of adventure and the fantastical aspects this is a generic sword and sandals picture. People who haven't read any Greek lit, try for a moment and imagine the Lord of the Rings movies being based entirely around Helm's Deep and Pellenor Fields and you have some idea of how Troy has been adapted. I just feel they may as well have written an original script if this is what they planned to do. As a sword and sandals picture it pales next to Gladiator, as well as the older precedents Spartacus and Ben Hur. As an adaptation of The Illiad it's greatest crime is that we will never now see it as it should've been, on screen. Oh well it diverted my attention for 2 1/2 hours at least."
"vicorecruit","8","1","3","18 June 2004"," Two words: Hit and miss
","These two simple words is enough to describe ""Troy"". There are many points and ideas that make this movie great and enjoyable, But it did miss some key points which make it less memorable and become a ""classic"".<br/><br/>First the pros, the greatest thing in this movie is actually the casting. Most of the major role is well casted and played their role very well. Eric Bana as Hector, Orlando Bloom as Paris and Diane Kruger as Helen, all of them look believable and played with a soul. Peter O'Toole as Priam and Sean Bean as Odysseus, although their little screen time (if i didn't count wrong, Sean Bean only got less than twelve minutes) are the greatest supporting role and make this movie much more depth than it should have. Eric Bana got a class A performance as prince of Troy, a warrior who love his brother, his city, and his wife and kid. Orlando Bloom give us the idea what the Paris of Troy should look like, although his emotional scene is the weakest. Diane Kruger was a surprise. She was absolutely gorgeous, and it is very important to make the audience to believe that the war of Troy is to fight for her. The reason why she was a surprise are that, her performance is the first half was great, a sad girl in love with Paris, the second half she was awful, There is no emotional you can feel from her. I almost forgot she was in love with Paris when she give a special look before Hector left the city. The second reason are credit to the makeup department. She was......normal, even unattractive in other film, while she is the gorgeous woman in this movie......WOW<br/><br/>I personally have no common over Brad Pitt. If you found a problem at his performance or Achilles, it will be the problem of the directing and the script. Of course his acting here felt short when compare with Eric Bana, Sean Bean or even Peter O'Toole.<br/><br/>The war scene, well, everyone will compare it directly with Lord of the rings. To be fair, it did have its great moment, some even better than LOTR. However it feel short of something, something had done in LOTR and make it success. Again is the problem of the Directing and the script.<br/><br/>It's time for those cons. While overall the movie is interesting, the director have no intention to put you in a position for you to help one side, it's like whether which side win, you simply don't care. This lack of emotion from the audience is the weakest part of the movie. The director put an equal share of screen time with the side of Troy and the side of Greece. As a result when two side are in a battle, you do not care which side will win that battle or who will die at the end. It also had a basic problem: Everyone knows the result. Of course this problem is more obvious with LOTR but Peter Jackson handled it very well. Wolfgang Petersen pay very few attention to this problem, and make the ending quite weak.<br/><br/>It is all just general opinion about this movie. At the end it may found that this movie is not bad, quite good actually, IT JUST NOT SPECIAL. Overall it is a movie that provide you enough entertainment as a summer (blockbuster) movie. Personally I will buy the DVD, despite all its flaws. It was fun seeing other movie with great battle scene other than LOTR."

","Troy was an excellent movie, with a stirring score that put me in the right frame of mind for the movie in an instant.  James Horner is brilliant and doesn't disappoint here.  I cannot wait to buy the soundtrack. For the first half of the movie, I was in hysterical laughter.  The script they wrote!  The lines, the melodrama, the incredible farse on real emotion! However, when people started dying inevitably, since it is a war film, I started crying. I thought that Brad Pitt's acting was better than expected, and the talent I was most impressed with actually was that of Eric Bana, playing Hector, and Rose Byrnes, playing Brisaeus.  I was surprised because I had not heard of either of them but they definitely made the movie as far as acting goes."
"ak_stinger","Null","1","3","2 June 2004"," Fine summer fun, worth the price of admission
","I love ""Troy"". It doesn't want to be an Oscar contender; it doesn't want to be a Cliff's Notes version of ""The Iliad"". What it wants to be is good summer fun and it does that beautifully.<br/><br/>The film belongs to Eric Bana's Hector. It's a true testament to what a good actor can do in a well-written role. Orlando Bloom has received some criticism for being wimpy and dramatic in the role of Paris, but that's exactly how Paris is supposed to be characterized. The fact that Bloom portray Paris in that way and still gain understanding and a little sympathy for his actions from the audience speaks volumes to his ability as an actor.<br/><br/>He just needs a role that will let him shine.<br/><br/>The Greeks were admirably portrayed as well. Sean Bean is smooth, charming, and smart in his portrayal of Odysseus. The little amount of screen time he got is a crime. Brad Pitt stretches his acting muscles admirably (anyone who claims Brad Pitt can't act is going on zero or limited exposure to him at his craft and/or is operating under the shallow assumption that anyone who looks that classically handsome can't act). I just don't recommend he make historical epics like this a prominent feature in his career.<br/><br/>The women were a bit disappointing. Diane Krueger has the physically characteristics it takes to play Helen, but none of the talent and charisma to be believable. Saffron Burrows is moving but underused as Andromache. Alone, Rose Byrnes gives the movie a strong female presence. Her spirited yet tragic portrayal of Briseis leaves me wondering what she could have done in the role of Helen, which she was originally considered for. The presences of Hector and Paris' mother Hecuba (whose revenge against the Greeks for her family's fate was so terrible that even today her name is associated with evil witchcraft) and their tragically prophetic sister Cassandra are sorely missed."
"Victor Field","Null","1","3","6 June 2004"," ""When does it end?"" ""It never ends.""
","David Benioff's screenplay for ""Troy"" is supposedly inspired by Homer's ""The Iliad."" I assume that's Homer as in Simpson - except that when ""The Simpsons"" did their look at Greek legend it hewed somewhat closer to the originals (I'm serious). And it was also a lot more interesting.<br/><br/>While Benioff and director Wolfgang Petersen deserve credit for not painting one side or the other as outright villains, it has the effect of reducing any emotional involvement - already minimal thanks to how the characters are drawn and played. Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole supply some true strength as Hector and the king of Troy respectively, but Brad Pitt is just not right as Achilles, coming off more like David Beckham playing at soldiers, the fight scenes notwithstanding. But even Mr. Aniston is better than Orlando Bloom as Paris, who's too drippy to even talk about, so let's move on.<br/><br/>When the characters aren't talking and just letting the fighting speak, the movie's okay, but some strong battle scenes do not a movie make, especially if said movie takes so many liberties with its source (the way the Achilles heel reference is worked in just does not wash - it's as if they wanted to keep it ""real,"" and the whole Achilles-made-immune-by-the-River-Styx thing didn't fit). And Diane Kruger is not only no actress, but also isn't the kind of woman you can see men killing each other over, looker though she undoubtedly is. (If Warner Bros. was looking for a woman believably hot enough to cause a war and with the right look to boot, they could have cast Monica Bellucci or Jessica Alba - the latter wouldn't have been that much more out of place than Mr. Bloom.)<br/><br/>In an interview with the London 'Evening Standard,' Petersen said that this is not ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and he was right - ""The Lord of the Rings"" was an epic movie (OK, three epic movies) that felt cinematic; ""Troy"" is a movie that feels like a bad 1980s miniseries, especially with the DOA dialogue. Never truly involving, saddled with a James Horner score that isn't even close to what Gabriel Yared originally wrote (before it was thrown out after complaints at a preview), and seemingly going on forever, the overall effect is to make you long for another look at ""Spartacus,"" ""The Ten Commandments,"" or any episode of ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" set in Greece. Or, indeed, ""The Lord of the Rings."""

","This is a hard film to judge and from many of the comments and reviews I have read I know I am not alone.  I went into the movie on a lark, expecting I probably would not like it.  Some of the lines are bad and they could have been easily corrected.  Bloom is miscast, though I do not think he does that bad of job. Pitt always surprises me -- I expected not to like him or take him seriously, yet I was impressed.  As far as the story, yes a lot of little things are wrong, but I think they got the big things right.  So powerful is the myth that it comes across effortlessly (everything seems to be scaled up from Homer by a factor of 10.)  The pacing is solid, the action sequences are superb, and Bana, what can one say?  Almost<br/><br/>steals the show, he does, no mean feat given the actors he is up against. As of this movie, he is a major star. And Diane Kruger as Helen is just gorgeous.  In the words of one critic, she<br/><br/>might not have launched a thousand ships, but easily a few hundred.  In short, the film works.  I can understand why some people didn't like it, but on the whole I definitely think it is worth a look.  You might be pleasantly surprised."

","When Ulysses travels to the Underworld, he meets Achilles' spirit and says: ""As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by all of us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are here you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it so much to heart even if you are dead."" ""Say not a word"", he (Achilles) answered,""in death's favour; I would rather be a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of kings among the dead;..."" (Odyssey Book 11) I always perceived that Achilles' regretting his decision that he strove for glory and 'immortality' instead of leading a peaceful and anonymous life as one of the key messages in Homer's works, and a surprisingly modern one.In my opinion this message should have been included in the film which already has some anti-war notions. Instead of having Achilles' say in a V. O. at the end of the movie that people would remember the Troian War in a thousand years (sure we all know that), he could have said exactly what he said in the Odyssey. That would have given the film more depth and meaning.<br/><br/>In the whole, I think the film better than some critics suggested. Despite some hokey and clumsy dialogues and lack of narrative momentum, it has some touching moments and is visually stunning. As the makers said that the movie was inspired by Homer, there took great liberties with regards to the plot. It may be justified to leave the gods out, but since they were the driving forces behind many events, their absence made it difficult to tell a plausible and coherent story."

While half of the performances fall short of anything Hollywood like, O'Toole picks up the pieces and gives an amazing supporting role as King of Troy. The role of Paris and Helen both fall short with hardly any substance or character development. Paris gains no interests nor is he anywhere positive, Helen is nothing but ""skin."" No substance besides 3 seconds of nudity that make up her entire being. The movie may fall short with story, but like Homer's version, you have to like the genre to enjoy the movie.

","****CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS****<br/><br/>Well ladies, we certainly get some serious eye candy in this one! :) Eric Bana, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Brad Pitt. Running around in skimpy armor, togas & skirts no less! <br/><br/>Got that out of my system, so let's move on...<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I just don't understand the comments about Brad Pitt's stellar (or phenomenal as some have put it) performance as Achilles. To each his own I guess, but every time he opened his mouth, I just cringed. I suppose it's not entirely his fault, though. Too much emphasis was placed on Achilles to begin with, which, in turn put Brad on screen too often. True, Achilles was a major cog in the Greek war machine, but he certainly wasn't the ONLY one. Brad Pitt just irritated me to no end...he was overly moody in his portrayal & gave no life to the character. As someone else said, in the end he was Brad Pitt as Achilles...not Achilles.<br/><br/>Other actors did a far better job with their roles in my opinion. Eric Bana blew me away with his portrayal of Hector. I think he captured the essence of the Trojan hero perfectly. He truly was Hector...not simply Eric Bana attempting to play Hector.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole was another stroke of casting brilliance. I just wanted to reach through the screen & hug him when Priam begged for Hector's body. I also wanted to pummel Brad Pitt, I mean Achilles, but that's another story.<br/><br/>As to complaints about the movie not going strictly by the book, well that's Hollywood for you. Look at the LOTR trilogy. Much was left out & some rather inane garbage was added. You have to cut unless you want a 5-hour film. Still, they probably should've included the sacrifice of Iphiginia (although, that would've totally ruined the Hollywood demise of Agamemnon). It's what was ADDED to the film that probably made many mythology/Trojan War buffs cringe. For instance, Hector killing Menelaus?!?!?! Even more absurd was Briseis' murder of Agamemnon! Or, what about the fact that both Paris & Hector's infant son live?? Helen escapes to the hills?!?! Again, I guess that's Hollywood's prerogative.<br/><br/>I think the fact that the gods & goddesses were left out isn't overly horrible. It did serve to emphasize Hector's point when he asks his father, ""and how many legions does the sun god command?"" Still, there were 2 key instances where the presence of a god or goddess was required. 1) Aphrodite saved Paris from Menelaus after he is defeated in single combat and 2) Poseidon sent his sea serpent to kill the Trojan prophet who warned, ""be ware of Greeks & the gifts they bear).<br/><br/>I realize I'm just nitpicking. Really, aside from Pitt's performance, I think it was a wonderful movie. I really hope they decide to go forward in the story & make the Odyssey (with Sean Bean as Odysseus, of course).<br/><br/>Apologies for the length & thanks for letting me voice my opinion."

"laurana75","Null","1","3","28 May 2004"," The Epic Tale of Bronzed-God Pitt (minor SPOILERS)
","Where do I start? Do I start with all the short skirts and the burnished bodies (and that's just the men)? Do I start with a bland Helen that doesn't really look like she would launch a thousand ships? Do I start with the fact that the film, loosely based on the Iliad, proves to be very loosely based on the Iliad? Let's start out with the fact that Iliad-lovers could start to picket this film with all the liberties that it had taken with Homer's great epic. For one, people who shouldn't die end up dying, while some people who were killed off in Homer's opus live on. The story unfolded quite well, although parts of it were a bit dragging. The best thing for me, however, was taking out all the gods and goddesses. Granted that the immortal bickering was the majority of the fun of things but a war movie-cum-heroic epic seems better off this time without immortals playing the soldiers like chess pieces (anyone remember the wonderfully cheesy Clash of the Titans? I loved that movie, though). Troy now takes on the flavor of a historical--albeit overly dramatic--account that was later added mythological spice by Homer.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom fan that I am, I was quite apprehensive that he was playing the spineless Paris; however, he has been able to create more depth for the character in that there was a realization, and a transformation. Depth was also created for Brad Pitt's Achilles' character, for which I have conflicting emotions. He doesn't really come out as particularly heroic, just vaguely troubled. And quite promiscuous, too. Pitt plays Achilles with what seems to be a gnawing sense of insecurity that he is trying to hide behind the fame and glory of war. It doesn't really hide the fact, though, that Brad Pitt seems to be bigger than Achilles, at least in this movie--we cannot get over that this is Brad-bronzed-god-Pitt and his character seems to suffer for it. This begs the question though--who else could have played the greatest Greek warrior if not Brad Pitt, and held his own in this movie? A lesser actor (icon) would probably have been eaten alive by the others in the cast.<br/><br/>The great O'Toole portrays Priam quite well and one of the best scenes in the entire movie is when he implores Achilles to return the beaten body of his son. (""Ah Brad, that there's what we call acting."") Sean Bean also turns in a solid performance as the level-headed and smooth-talking Odysseus--they should shoot the Odyssey with him, it would be quite interesting. Brian Cox is rightly menacing and calculating as Agamemnon. My favorite character in the Iliad, though, remains my favorite character here--Hector, Prince of Troy. Eric Bana is subtly effective as the doomed prince, conveying a stalwart nobility and honor that seems to be lacking from most other characters yet also being fearful of his impending battle with Achilles.<br/><br/>It is quite entertaining--there are sword- and spear-fights, there are great balls of fire, there are love scenes, and the wondrous Horse. The mano-a-mano fight scene between Hector and Achilles is worth re-watching. There is requisite action and drama, there are pretty girls and prettier guys. There is a clash of cultures--the conquering Greeks with their brash king and their shining, temperamental hero Achilles; and the more laid-back Trojans, with their god-fearing king and their pensive hero Hector. And, yes, there is a lot of man-kissing and hugging going around. I am especially touched by the portrayal of the brothers Hector and Paris--which is nonexistent in the Iliad because there they were not brought up together. Paris plays the perfect bumbling little brother foil to Hector's noble older brother; and although his little brother has helped launch the war that will bring their doom Hector, after an initial fit, stands resolutely by his side, until the death. His unfaltering love for country and family are part of what brings about Paris' own transformation; and ultimately seals his fate as the most admirable character in the movie (as he was, IMHO, in the Iliad).<br/><br/>There is an inherent problem in the production, though. I cannot place my finger on it--It may be the script, vacillating between being stirring and dragging. It may be that there was no sense of pathos, really, and no stirring emotion brought about by war and killing--but then that could just be desensitized me talking. It may be a lack of imagination in the filmmakers that is visible at times.<br/><br/>In any case, it's regulation Hollywood summer fare. There is something to be said about the views on war, though: the movie suggests a permeating melancholia about war--how war is sometimes waged on the pretext of something other than the actual reason (note that Helen's abduction merely gives the power-hungry Agamemnon his chance to sack Troy), how families are affected by war (cut to the haunting face of Saffron Burrows' Andromache), and how the greatest soldiers are sometimes the most troubled. There are also some points on religion, and Achilles' hubris. It may be a trying-hard epic mooching off an actual epic, a mean feat of over-acting by Brad Pitt, and quite dull in some parts; but it is quite a bit more than just a great movie for the summer. I suggest (for the girls especially) watching it twice--the first to ogle at Brad, Orli, Eric, Sean, etc., and the second to actually watch the film. Both instances would be quite popcorn-worthy."

","""Troy"" is an epic in name only. As a cinematic version of the story from the Iliad, it is an epic failure. Perhaps there is a strong adolescent interest to observe Brad Pitt. Such a presentation only makes the audience more interesting than the product on the silver screen. There are magnanimous scenes with the Trojan warriors at battle frequently enough to bore even the avid war film buff. The most astounding fact about this movie is the presence of Peter O'Toole as the king of Troy. His role is such a B movie is depressing to say the least. It is a waste of a fine actor, and one would only hope that he does not repeat this mistake. Brad Pitt has gained a substantial amount of muscle to portray Achilles. He gives an adequate performance, but it is not a memorable film. In fact it is difficult to find kind words for the epic mistake."

","I love historical epics even when they aren't historically correct, because history is narrative anyway. But thats a whole other topic....back to Troy. This movie was played up to be big, and to be honest, it could have been better.<br/><br/>Firstly casting. I think Orlando Bloom was wrong in this part and his character was annoying. Helen of Sparta, supposed to be the most beautiful women ever, was really quite plain. I was expecting breath taking but she was really nothing special. Eric Bana as Hector was uncomfortable in some parts and was clearly outshone by Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was perfect in the role and I don't understand all the fuss on the IMDb boards about him being miscast, not only was he visually stunning (I have to mention how extremely buff he is, certainly worked hard to get that warrior body) but made Achilles the definite star, a complex and much less shallow character than he could have been. Dominating and imposing in every scene he featured in, Achilles made this movie.<br/><br/>In the hands of Wolfgang Peterson this movie became simply a Hollywood blockbuster, whereas it could have been a more memorable accomplishment in more skilled hands. The fact is, it was okay, but not as brilliant or moving as other similar movies (eg Braveheart or Gladiator). Too much emphasis was put on special effects, the fighting armies looked like they came straight out of Age of Empires (sidebar: i love that game)and the Greek fleet was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Real armies are possible and god I wish directors would fork out the extra money to have real people in real scenes, I loved Emperor and the Asassin because all those extras were real, it can be done. This movie cost 200 million to make and i think the money could have been better spent, less on famous actors and more on details. Look at Lord of the Rings and what they did with their huge budget. I love attention to detail and the quality of a movie is in the details. <br/><br/>But hey don't get me wrong i loved the movie. Little bits of humour were tasteful and light, the acting was overall pretty good, but what was the best was the love story between Achilles and Briseis. It softened his character and added some honour to his vicious nature, as well as being ten times more interesting and believable than Paris and Helen. Perhaps its because I'm a romantic at heart, but still I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is a history fan, because it wasn't that bad."
"zaknafein","3","1","3","15 May 2004"," Very, Very disappointing
","It has been a long time since I've been so disappointed with a movie. I am a big fan of Homer's Illiad, but I am not that sort of fan who always thinks the book is better than the screen adaptation. They are two different sort of art. But, in this particular movie, the adaptation was disastrous. They changed the story completely. I won't get in details in order to avoid spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it yet. But it's horrible. The story doesn't match the poem in almost NO aspect. Love stories which didn't exist, ppl who didn't die (and, come on, there was no need to kill even more characters than the poem itself describes), events which didn't occur in the book, several AND important chronological mistakes, just to name a few... The characters are not well depicted, most of them are shallow (specially the greeks), the movie doesn't even try to avoid the recourse of good x evil, in a history which dind't have these sides v well defined. There are several gaps in the story told in the movies, and, which is worse, things happen and we can't find a cause-effect link. There are a lot of ""deus ex macchina"" recourses during the movie, which can spoil any screenplay, specially a bad one such as this. It is certainly one of the worst adapted screenplay ever! The direction is not good... The figurine is not accurate and the actors, though a great cast, simply do not show good performances, there is no one I can make an exception of. All in all, it was a GREAT disappointment, and will be for anyone who watches it, specially, I am sure, those who, like me, were highly enthusiastic about this story reaching the screens. It would be better if it hadn't. It can be considered, at most, a mild action movie, with some war in it :) never an epic, and never a well-done movie. Quite unfortunately...<br/><br/>Roberto"
"creightonhale","3","1","3","19 May 2004"," A conventional, tedious film
","As soon as the Warner Brothers logo had disappeared, the lines of words appeared. I knew immediately we were in trouble: any epic film that begins that way (and amazingly followed by oral narration) in this day is lacking in any kind of imagination. (Didn't Orson Welles show others a less conventional way to begin way back in 1941?) The next scene promised much: two armies lined up and ready to face off. But it delivered little: Achilles jumping into the air and stabbing some beefcake twice his size. And the rest of the film continues along these lines: unfulfilled promises and tedium. <br/><br/>The biggest mistake the filmmakers made (other than paying Brad Pitt too much money for very little talent) was to exorcise the gods and goddesses from the story. To do so meant that the poetry had to be exorcised too (and there is no poetry, either verbal or visual, in this film). And since there is no poetry, there is no emotion, or at least none of any sincerity and certainly none that the audience can be moved by. All we're getting is the story without the emotional resonance and intellectual depth. Stripping the story of the gods and goddesses also makes the mortals look much more foolish than they would normally seem.<br/><br/>Another poor choice was to simplify the women and to have them played by ""former models."" The myths and plays make a point to show the emotional devastation visited on the women of Troy by this stupid war (which seems to last maybe a month in the film; I think a philosophical point was being made by having the war last ten years in the text). Of course, the filmmakers took out two of the most important female characters: Cassandra and Hecuba. They are the most emotionally effected. But, we still have Helen and Andromache, both looking gorgeous, even as Troy burns down around them. (The chemists who created makeup back then must have known something ours don't: how to keep makeup from running.)<br/><br/>Both Brad Pitt and Eric Bana are failures in their roles. Neither registers much sincere emotion. (Pitts reaction to his ""cousin's"" death verges on the comical.) Pitt cannot see beyond his own self-love and self-adoration, while Bana seems totally lost about how to react to anything. He's stupefied. And they both slur their words. If these Hollywood pretty boys (unfortunately, Orlando Bloom - the most effeminate of today's actors - complete the triumvirate) are the best we can do in the way of heroes, we need to stop trying to make such movies. Peter O'Toole? I just felt embarrassed for him.<br/><br/>So, why did I give this as much as a vote of 3? The sets do, indeed, give us some idea of what Troy (if it actually existed as seen in the myths) would have looked like. The costumes are pretty good too."

Add big battles, sex, special effects and a notional wave at reality and you can find the downpayment on a few more Roads to Glory.<br/><br/>This approach to film making can be justified in that it can raise the spirits of the masses. Not just in the U.S.  Bollywood, for instance, puts a smile on the faces of millions of Indians living in poverty. Back in the U.S. of A., it rallied spirit of troops for WWII and gave hope to the worried families back home that there was hope somewhere Over the Rainbow.<br/><br/>For today's fattened (if artistically impoverished) viewers, movies such as Troy feel like a too-good-to-miss extra large helping of Death by Chocolate when we're already too sated to move.

Brad Pitt's immaculately oiled body is nearly every woman's fantasy hero as the valiant, sensitive, warrior-supremo Archilles. Orlando Bloom is Paris, tender but useless, adorable (if morally bankrupt) and with a make-love-not-war brigade expression (ie don't fight wars, you big pussy, just cause them by stupid, hedonistic indifference.) His love' of (dumb blonde) Helen is the nominal excuse for the war that launches a thousand ships and results in the sacking of Troy when she is swept off her feet by Trojan Paris from her nasty Greek husband. Helen, after a few nothing-to-do-with-me moral disclaimers, becomes the role model fro every female that aspires to an over-inflated ego.<br/><br/>The credits mention the story is related to Homer's Iliad, but apart from name dropping and iconised events from general mythology such as the Wooden Horse, there is little of Homer's genius or subtlety, just as there is little that is identifiably Greek. There are many American and British actors prancing about with swords and overblown histrionics, making little or no attempt to disguise their accents, mannerisms or the fact that they are film stars. Within these parameters however, there are some enjoyable performances, particularly Peter O'Toole as the worthy King Priam, struggling to do the right thing for both his subjects and his offspring, and whom Achilles respects more than his own power-hungry king.<br/><br/>
Excellent use of computer generated graphics means we can have convincingly enormous armies in epic battle scenes, and the pacing a story are sufficiently well constructed to entertain us for nearly three hours.<br/><br/>
For anyone who found Lord of the Rings too fantasy-laden or Gladiator too bloody, Troy may well be the ideal Saturday afternoon family entertainment. Nothing wrong with a bit of harmless fiction after all . . ."

","The movie is the best so far for 2004 and I suspect it will be till the end. The fight between Achilles and Hector is one of these that we will remember for a long time and the music is well written for the movie. Despite being a good movie I would like to add some historic facts that are distorted in the script. Achilles was an immortal son of an ancient goddess and had a weak part in his heel. Paris with an arrow killed Achilles after he killed Hector and not inside Troy. The siege lasted 10 years and not such sort time. Agamemnon was killed by his wife when he returned to Greece for sacrificing his daughter before the war to the gods in order to blow winds and leave the Greek ships the port. The story of his death is another known ancient Greek drama. Finally Helen was forced to follow Paris to Troy and didn't love him according to Homer. Although there are many more inaccuracies the director did an excellent job with the costumes, ships and the environment. It is a great movie to watch but not to learn the historic facts as were said from Homer. I strongly suggest the people who saw the movie and liked it to buy the real story on a book."
"wrytir","Null","1","3","16 May 2004"," All about the bling bling
","A possible minor spoiler or two.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen's 'Troy' is to 'The Iliad' as Kubrick's 'The Shining' is to Stephen King's novel. If you can somehow dissociate the movie from the classic poem on which it is ""based"", 'Troy' is certainly not a bad outing, but three flights below ""epic"".<br/><br/>'Troy' was long, stilted, and infinitely more about the profit than the story. As a movie, you are treated to some solid A-list and B-list stars mixing it up ... a sure revenue draw to kick off the summer season. As an adaptation, if you are familiar with the legend, you will leave wanting, but entertained nonetheless. <br/><br/>Acting. Since this effort was all about the immortal glory of Oscar nods, let's start with this. Petersen's vision reduces 'The Illiad' to a battle of man vs. man. Mythical characters are rendered as exceptionally brave, cunning or ruthless humans that one might conceivably encounter in the present day. <br/><br/>'Troy' yields one of Brad Pitt's best performances as the nearly invulnerable Achilles. As a great warrior, he delivers, thanks, in no small part to his personal trainer. The contentious dynamics between Achilles and Agamemnon, and Achilles and Hector are well-played by all involved. <br/><br/>Eric Bana was a convincing Delta in 'Blackhawk Down', and here, portrays a compelling yet subdued Hector, the victim of his own palpable sense of honor. <br/><br/>Brian Cox's Agamemnon personifies the power-meets-greed archetype and does a convincing job. Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus deserved a bigger (or longer, at any rate) part. The great Peter O'Toole is the perfect benevolent uber-father, King Priam of Troy, though I couldn't help sharing Achilles' revulsion at perceived hints of creepiness.<br/><br/>And, so we come to Orlando Bloom as Paris, the younger brother of Hector and, no doubt, the most vilified, unsympathetic actor in this endeavor. In all honesty, he delivered a poor imitation of Peter Hanly's Edward, Prince of Wales in 'Braveheart'. In his defense, Bloom's failure was as much a fault of the script as his erratic, overreaching delivery.<br/><br/>As for the ladies ... I try to avoid pre-press as often as possible so as to preserve at least a moment or two of personal surprise. That said, I was eager to see who was cast as the face that launched a thousand ships. In this aspect alone, Diane Kruger did not disappoint. Beyond the first six hours, er ... 40 minutes, though, she regressed to her initial purpose -- one-dimensional scenery. Similarly, Andromache, played by Saffron Burrows, added initial depth to Bana's Hector as his wife and the mother of his child.<br/><br/>Throughout the long afternoon, however, she evolved into an unforgivable caricature. <br/><br/>Greek and Roman mythology is permeated by strong female characters, a concept lost on Petersen's direction and David Benioff's script. The only redeeming female role is that of Briseis, played by Rose Byrne. Her role succeeds, in this film, in clinching the transformation of Pitt's Achilles from half-god into pure human, a deviation, again, from 'The Illiad', but an apparently intentional plot device by Petersen. Looking forward to seeing Byrne in future projects.<br/><br/>As for the other legends, I'll address two. Sean Bean's Odysseus was remarkably well-developed (and well-acted) given such little screen time. It would have been nice to see more of his character. Ajax (Tyler Mane), on the other hand, was given no more than a single nominal mention, a single fight scene establishing his prowess and the requisite loss as demanded by Homer. For as much as Petersen/Benioff left out, they must have owed Mane a favor to keep his celluloid presence off the cutting-room floor. <br/><br/>Choreography. This was essentially a Pitt-Bana celebrity death match. The actors' dedication and training in preparation for the individual fight scenes was impressive. I always wondered what mortal combat between two men, two spears, two shields and two swords would truly have looked like. This idea applies not only to Pitt-Bana, but to the rest of the one-on-one scenarios. Sorry, neither 'Gladiator' nor any predecessor quite did it for me.<br/><br/>The CGI in the mass formations is well done, but has truly passed the point of being trite. As a truly ""visual"" person and student of history, I enjoy seeing the great battles, fictional or not, represented on the big screen. Seeing the armies clash, however, is somewhat less intense than seeing the armies form, the expectation of what is to come, the true drama. In this aspect, Troy succeeds, as the Greeks pour over the hills en route to the fortress. The mass collision of might comes off as anti-climactic.<br/><br/>Where 'Troy' and 'The Last Samurai' (reference my review) fail, 'Gettysburg', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Braveheart', the assault on Helm's Deep and even 'Gunga Din' succeed. <br/><br/>I did have a small issue with the work stoppage surrounding the Hector-Patroclus encounter. That this could be resolved, followed by two of the mortal enemies ""calling it a day"", their armies dissolving into the safety of their encampments was about the biggest leap of faith I can imagine given the masses of men supposedly involved. I mean, imagine the warriors at either end of the conflict. <br/><br/>[The Greeks] ""Hey! Stop, guys! We're all going back to the ships for dinner!""<br/><br/>[The Trojans] ""Gentlemen! Back to the fort. Hearty meals and good lovin' tonight!""<br/><br/>[All, in unison] ""Um ... sure, okay. See you tomorrow, you (invading/entrenched) heathens.""<br/><br/>Screenplay/dialogue. As a movie, if you aren't a history nut -- with an obligatory interest in classic mythology -- like myself, it is entertaining. Acting, on the male side, is all you'd expect it to be given this line up. For the female side, the three ladies were attractive for sure, but distracted from the story at this level. You can forget very quickly that this war is the result of Helen leaving Menelaus. <br/><br/>Benioff earns a well-deserved Razzie for this one, and Petersen should be reprimanded by the studio execs for misallocating funds. I couldn't do it better myself, but I guarantee that another talented director could have included more of the myth in the retelling than Petersen did, given what this budget and this amount of celluloid allowed. Two(?) location sites, a soundstage and half a story is all he could muster? Seriously?<br/><br/>As an adaptation, I had major issues with plots and dialogue. I am no longer familiar enough with the minute details of 'The Illiad', though I did identify a number of the glaring errors. I leave that task to others. While I enjoy most attempts at adaptations, I understand the limitations of time, attention span and talent (on both sides of the camera) that destine them to inevitably fall short of the original.<br/><br/>Still, $200 million and nearly three hours should have yielded a more respectable effort. <br/><br/>Finally, it is only the ring of familiar, ages-old, larger-than-life names that allows the viewer to overlook the serious discrepancies. <br/><br/>Conclusion. I liked the movie for what it was, but not what it tried to be. In the end, Petersen attempts to bring the legend, the myth of Homer into the 21st Century. 'Troy' strives to be 'LOTR' in scope and 'Gettysburg' in terms of sympathetic characters on either side.<br/><br/>The absence of the gods, most of the original supernatural elements and a much-lacking representation of the epic poem reduce this film to a spectacular gang fight a la S.E. Hinton's 'The Outsiders'."
"alvarez8621","3","1","3","15 May 2004"," What was that!
","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Homer, and I thoroughly enjoy The Illiad and The Odessey, and Troy simply did not match up.  When the story is thousands of years old and known around the world you would think that the movie would follow the storyline, but it didn't.  The wrong people die, the wrong people live and the ending is wrong.  How can you tell Troy like that.  Now if they want to make the Odessey they would have to cut out alot.  I went into this film very excited, an amazing cast and a brilliant director... but it failed my expectations in horrible fashion.  If they cut out the gods they should have cut them all out, including Achillies' mother.  They made Agamenmon the clear cut bad guy, when there was no clear cut bad guy... not to mention the fact that he died!  Paris was supposed to die and not get Helen and she is supposed to go back to Sparta with her husband, who didn't die at the beginning.<br/><br/>If you are going to tell a story, tell it right.<br/><br/>1/5"
"ducksr","7","1","3","19 May 2004"," Decent, thanks to Eric Bana's great performance.
","Troy is mainly about the warrior Achilles, played by a mediocre Brad Pitt, and the battle between Greece and Troy, but it is also about vengeance, love, pride and sacrifice. The acting in this movie is not great, but some actors deliver fine performances. This includes Eric Bana in particular, but also Brian Cox, Rose Byrne and Sean Bean. Brad Pitt is good most of the time, but he delivers some of his lines badly. I usually do not like Orlando Bloom's acting, and sadly this is no exception. I enjoy most of his movies, but he is by all means no great actor. The battle scenes and the special effects are good, but the movie is missing something. It leaves you satisfied, but nothing more. It's pretty clear that director Wolfgang Petersen wants something more with this movie, but he seems a bit unoriented and confused. But the movie is still very entertaining, and it is by all means no bad movie. To put it another way; it's worth a look or two.<br/><br/>7/10 - Could've been better if certain things were changed."
"philip-1","3","1","3","15 May 2004"," A Wasted Effort
","Troy is an impressive movie in many ways, but it could have been sooooo much better.  It doesn't achieve what Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy does by integrating action sequences, excellent cgi effects and a good script in a satisfying manner.<br/><br/>The culprit here is the script.  It's mostly soap opera drivel. The opening sequence in which Achilles squares off with a brutish Mr. Clean clone is not worthy of a serious effort; it's cheap and stupid! Paris's first dialogue with Helen is even more painful:<br/><br/>""Last night was a mistake,"" she says.<br/><br/>Really poetic, huh!  Maybe that's why Orlando Bloom and Diane Krueger have ZERO chemistry. The script makes Agamemnon and Menelaus into utterly cardboard villains and it kills whatever Brad Pitt could have done with the equally cardboard Achilles.<br/><br/>It's a shame the script does away with the gods in the story, but that would probably have meant making two or three movies.  What's more unforgivable is the absence of the strong female characters in Homer's epic; Cassandra, Hecuba, Klytemnestra. What's left is the wimpering Andromache and Briseis misinterpreted to a comical degree. Helen, who supposedly is the catylst that causes all this, is a cipher in this treatment. It's also a shame the good performance of Julie Christie as Thetis is wasted on one scene. Surely a flashback showing her dipping the young Achilles in the river Styx would have explained his one spot of vulnerability.<br/><br/>The action sequences are impressive and the cgi effects are quite good, if not on a par with the best.  The cast is very attractive physically, but most of them are defeated at every point by the shallow screenplay. The two that survive the best are Eric Bana's elegant, human Hector and the great Peter O'Toole's tragic Priam. The only scene in the movie that reaches any emotional height is O'Toole's scene with Pitt in which he pleads for the return of his son's body. Here the screenwriter found some poetry and depth.  If the entire movie had been written this well, it would be a classic.<br/><br/>Most of the rest of O'Toole's performance is speant in the ridiculous viewing stand that the Trojan's built for their royal family to watch battles or whatever else goes on on the front lawn!<br/><br/>Brian Cox's Agamemnon particulary suffers from the inept script. He is forced to be a predictable and dull villain. Orlando Bloom is a similar causualty although I find it hilarious that many of the national movie critics have criticized him for playing Paris as a cowardly, vain, callow youth. That's exactly what Paris is; it's the writing that is bad; not neccessarily Mr. Bloom.<br/><br/>I also think Wolfgang Petersen is a coward for purposely distorting the homo-erotic features of ancient Greek society. Patrocolus is Achille's cousin in this treatment, rather than his friend, soul-mate and sometimes lover.  We only see Patroculus practicing swordplay with Achilles.  It is erotic in it's own right, but that's as far as Petersen goes. In fact, he makes sure that we see Pitt sleeping completely nude with women several times in the movie, lest he turn off the typically brutish, straight homophobes that would likely buy tickets in droves for this movie. Don't educate these schmucks; cater to them.<br/><br/>So, yes, it's at least an enjoyable popcorn movie.  But with the money poured into this project, it might have been truly great had they trusted Homer's original a bit more and perhaps made two or three movies that would have adequately covered the epic story. They thought Peter Jackson wanting to make multiple movies was doomed to failure and he laughed all the way to the bank!"
"matthilt","3","1","3","15 May 2004"," Not a cure for narcolepsy
","This is not so much a bad movie, just an incredibly boring, average movie. Wolfgang Peterson has taken the story of the greatest battle of the ancient world and with consummate misdirection manages to fill about 2 and 1/2 hours of screen time. I hold the onus of the phoned in performances squarely on the shoulders of Herr Peterson because I distinctly remember most of the principle actors in very engaging roles before. Not one of the characters commands the interest of the moviegoer and the dialog is so flat I found my self laughing out loud at the over-the-top musical cues in the background.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the movie is not epic. More than half of the time is taken up with dialog and establishing shots reminiscent of a spaghetti western. Leone fans out there, don't let this perk your ears up. Rather than highlighting the tension of three killers staring each other down in a cemetery at 10 paces (as per Leone), the close-ups in Troy highlight the tension of two armies of pikemen 500 yards apart waiting to decide if two guys will duel. The only sense of epic is an oft repeated shot of a fly-in pass of the city of Troy (or the Greek fleet or the army, it's the same shot). It was a big screen version of a Pan and Scan trick.<br/><br/>The short of this, wait about 6 months until this comes to cable, the film will play equally on the small screen. Don't run the risk of catching it in the theater; it might leave you too sleepy to drive home."

I want Hollywood back, the real Mc Coy, not that sort of expensive, useless and easy-to-forget motion pictures.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention Brad Pitt, who as Achilles is simply a joke.

","The characters are all too sincere, too noble (with a single exception)and therefore neither believable nor particularly evoking of our sympathies. They remain one dimensional and leaving us with little to root for or care. Brad Pitt, I believe, was badly miscast. He seemed to mumble throughout the movie as if ""take one"" would be good enough to fulfill his contractual agreement.<br/><br/>It's not a completely horrible movie. The sets are spectacular; but then we've already had our breath taken away by the Ring Trilogy, so this will work well for young teenage boys who eat this stuff up like some new video game.<br/><br/>The voice that is missing, in my opinion, is that of Homer. Without him, the story loses its poetry."
"BigGuy","5","1","3","15 May 2004"," Slightly better than the critics say
","The biggest problem that most critics have with this movie is the casting of the male lead characters.  I totally agree as far as Achilles (Brad Pitt) is concerned.  Brad Pitt just doesn't have the presence or acting talent to pull off this role.  Emotional turmoil looks like constipation and his speeches just don't have impact.<br/><br/>Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom were actually good choices for the brothers Hector and Paris, they even looked like they could be brothers.  Bana plays the strong, noble relatively quiet type, and Orlando plays the smarmy pretty boy.  I just wish someone had taught Orlando to shave the joke of a mustache.  I am sure it was supposed to make him look like a young man trying to be a full grown man, but it just looked silly and was distracting.<br/><br/>One big problem I had with this movie is the exaggeration of the numbers. They could have saved a ton of money on CGI by actually showing only 50K greeks and 20-30K trojan soldiers.  Instead they had to carpet the hills with fake soldiers, closer to 500K than 50K.  Also, although the large battle scenes were well done, it came across as the great toothpick battle. Personally, I would like to see a battle scene that shows some sort of tactic other than my army charges your army.  I suppose the Myrmidons forming an armadillo counts, but that was very brief and more of a skirmish.<br/><br/>Other than that the movie is about as expected.  A bit too much of the sappy dialog and speeches, but there is no getting away from that in today's hollywood."
"departed07","Null","1","3","14 May 2004"," Cool Movie!
","Unlike Van Helsing which was pointless and not a lot of fun. Troy on the other hand, I found it more superb. Not since Gladitor has there been a grand epic of action, realistic battle sequences and honor for these characters. Brad Pitt heads the all star cast as Achilles, a warrior that can never be stopped. The whole summary of the film is that Paris(played by Orlando Bloom) has had a secret affair with Helen(played by new comer Diane Kruger)that her King Menelaus played by Brendan Gleeson doesn't know about and during the sail to Troy, Paris's older brother Hector(played by Eric Bana) must protect his brother. With Menelaus in a rage, he tells the Greek King Agamemnon played by Brian Cox to sail to Troy and start a war. This movie is about honor and the cost of love.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to any movie fan or to anybody who enjoyed classic epics from the Kirk Douglas film Spartacus, to Mel Gibson's Braveheart or Russell Crowe's Gladiator."
"keypusher","3","1","3","3 May 2004"," A movie that fails to work
","I saw a screening last week.  The actress who played Briseis attended, for what that is worth.<br/><br/>The movie is a disappointment.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Eric Bana do not convey the greatness of their characters, Achilles and Hector.  Bana, slightly goggle-eyed, looks like a scared teenager in council with his father and Troy's elders, not the rock on which the Trojans rested all their hopes of survival.  Achilles is a hard character to play, because in the Iliad his obsession with honor and standing, his pride and selfishness (he prays for the Greeks to be defeated to avenge a slight from Agamemnon) makes him very unlikeable to a modern audience.  The Greeks nevertheless revered him, because he was more like a god than a man -- stronger, faster, more deadly, even more handsome.  Pitt has the good looks and conveys the unlikeability, but not much more. (Wow, is he built, though.  His body looks computer-generated.)<br/><br/>
The plot is not well-structured.  The events in the Iliad occur over just about 40 days in the tenth and final year of the war and are almost exclusively concerned with the rage of Achilles, which causes  him to first leave the battle (with dire consequences for the Greeks), and then rejoin it (with disastrous consequences for the Trojans).  The movie, by contrast, tries to tell the whole story of the war -- the event that starts it, the marshalling of armies, the Greek landing, Trojan retreat, Trojan advance, Achilles and Hector, the Trojan horse, etc.  Among other things, the filmakers have to shrink the Trojan War from ten years to, by my count, 17 days (which includes a 12-day truce).  Much worse, the movie repeatedly builds (or tries to build) to an emotional peak, then drops down and drags for a while, then builds again.  There are only so many emotional peaks a movie can carry its audience along for.  After a while you just want it to end.<br/><br/>The large-scale battle scenes are impressive, but they suffer by comparison to those in Lord of the Rings (Peter Jackson has made it pretty difficult for directors of epic movies for the forseeable future).  I saw ""The Passion of the Christ"" recently, which I think cost about 1/5 as much as ""Troy"", but nevertheless made me believe I was seeing first-century Jerusalem.  This movie, by contrast, never makes me believe I was seeing ancient Troy.  (I am not talking about period details.  The statutes and architecture are too modern and there are coins, which didn't exist then, but that doesn't bother me.  Homer also has many anachronisms in his epics.  But he nevertheless manages to convey an overpowering sense of a distant, ancient age of heroes (the Trojan War (if it happened at all) took place hundreds of years before Homer's time (if there was a Homer).  This movie just doesn't do that.)<br/><br/>
A number of supporting actors are better than the two leading men.  I particularly liked Peter O'Toole as Priam and Orlando Bloom as Paris. Many of the characterizations depart from those found in the Iliad.  There is nothing wrong with that, as long as the new characterization works.  But in some important cases it doesn't.  I don't care very much about the movie's Patroclus, and I don't get the sense that Achilles does either.  If you know the Iliad, you know that is a very serious shortcoming indeed.  If you don't know the Iliad, you'll still feel how it hurts the movie.<br/><br/>I love Homer, and I had hopes for this movie.  I don't think my expectations were excessively high -- the Iliad and the Odyssey are two of the greatest things ever written, and it's probably impossible for any movie to do them justice.  But this movie doesn't even come close."

","My first review, but Troy is so bad it moved me. Without hesitation, I must say that TROY is the worst movie I've seen in years. It was a 7 day rental...took me three sessions over 5 days to finish the 3 hour digital army engagement. My wife and I finished watching only to see if the girls and the little boy escape the city through the secret tunnel as the Greeks plunder Troy. We see them enter the tunnel...and ...and...we don't see them again!!! Did they make it out to the other side? Were they captured, tortured, beheaded? The acting is horrendous. Someone should tell director Peterson that just because he CAN digitally create an army of 500,000 troops and a navy of 200 sailing ships, doesn't mean he has to. Way over done. I like Brad Pitt and ""Helen"" was worth going to war over, but this movie should be banned."

","Not too many months ago I watched 'Helen of Troy' which shares the mythical story with this movie, 'Troy.' Both are long, at almost 3 hours, and both are done in a grand style. This one appears to have spent more money, and has a greater number of ""name"" actors. I liked both about equally.<br/><br/>Whether one likes a movie of this sort depends on why you take time to watch it. If you want a lesson in Greek Mythology, it is better to read some books. If you want to be entertained with good acting, and realistically bloody battle scenes that are quite drawn out, then watching 'Troy' will do it for you. There's nothing new here, the story remains basically unchanged, the presentation is unique.<br/><br/>Brian Cox is really good as Agamemnon of Sparta, who hungers for more power and agrees to attack Troy not so much to get his brother's stolen wife Helen back, but to expand his power base. The biggest name of this movie of course is Brad Pitt as the fierce warrior Achilles. I like Pitt as an actor, but I didn't really think much of his role here. He played Achilles with some sympathy, as the scene where he cared for the Trojan girl after the soldiers had been inappropriately man handling her.<br/><br/>Helen was played by a relatively new face, Diane Kruger who reportedly put on a few pounds for this role to look more in character for a beauty of that era. I thought she was a very good Helen. Eric Bana was good as Hector the prince of Troy, who fought bravely before being defeated by Achilles. Orlando Bloom played Paris, the cowardly younger brother of Hector who stole Helen and brought on the war. However, near the end when Achilles was fighting a couple of Trojans inside the city walls, while Troy burned, it was Paris' arrow that pierced the heel of Achilles.<br/><br/>This movie did not have to be so long. The battles were shown in all the gory detail possible, and there were fairly long scenes where not much was happening. Still, for fans of the genre, a worthwhile movie."

","I was so looking forward to seeing this movie since I love this period in history, but I was so upset after seeing it. Watching this movie was like someone took a great movie and then cut out all the good parts and added in a whole bunch of crap to make it fit the standard Hollywood formula to make an extremely long movie that sucked. <br/><br/>You can pretty much summarize the whole movie as, they go to war, random women get in the way because one of the main characters could get hurt when there are thousands of other men dying all the time. Then they stop the battle because someone accidentally killed the wrong person. Women get in the way again until the end when its a Dues Ex Machina-athon and things just get completely unrealistic so that everyone can be happy that the bad guys died and everyone has resolve, so the audience can go home happy and not have to think about the movie ever again. Its a total insult to the intelligence of anyone who watches it."

"phenomynouss","2","2","11","23 December 2005"," Terrible film.. only given two stars because it looks like it cost some money
","When I first saw the preview, I thought ""What a fantastic idea!"" movies about Ancient Greece seemed rare to me (not being a fanatic, or knowing of the older movies)<br/><br/>I knew once the movie was over that it was very poor... and it took me a few more viewings to realize how horrible it was.<br/><br/>First off, the music is all middle-eastern sounding. I realize Troy is in western Asia-ish (like around ancient Pergamum and such) and such, but come one, this music sounded like a day in the deserts of Arabia. More suited for Kingdom of Heaven or Hidalgo.<br/><br/>Historical accuracy? You'd find more of that in a nervous Christian book about procreation. Agammemnon and Menelaus are portrayed as fat greedy pricks interested only in themselves, the Trojans portrayed as noblemen and upright in every way (even Paris, who in mythology, was a sly prick), and Achilles as a moody dick! He's stubborn and arrogant and stuck-up and very very rude, like when he told that poor boy in Thessalonica, ""That's why no one will remember your name"" when the boy said he was afraid of the Thessalonicans or something. The battle which was supposed to be 10 years, seemed to last less than a month, with most of that time being the 12 days they gave peace for Hector's death! In the entire movie, none of the characters change in appearance---Peter O'Toole's Priam looks on the verge of death, without any change, Agammemnon doesn't gray, no one changes in what is supposed to be 10 years, and the way the movie passes makes it seem like each passing day is just that; one passing day. Agammemnon and Menelaus survive in mythology, yet both die in this movie, probably because they were the ""bad guys"" in the film.<br/><br/>This is a big one: Mythology. This movie seems to spit in the face of mythology, use Homer's book pages as toilet paper for their crony ass, and then throw up venom on the sheer ""coolness"" of the legend of Troy. The legend of Achilles being immortal and his only weakness being his heel is defecated upon, when Paris shoots Achilles through the heel, we think ""OMG! the legend! His heel is his only weak spot!"" hence the term ""Achilles Heel"" meaning our weakness... Then Achilles gets shot five times in the chest. -.- So to the average viewer, who knows nothing about Achilles's legend, what do you think kills Achilles, a shot in the heel, or five shots in the chest?<br/><br/>That plus the callous way in which the director--through characters like Hector and Achilles and such--seem to treat the Gods like crap, and doesn't portray their influence at all (in mythology, they have LOTS of influence in the battle), as opposed to say Alexander, which isn't supposed to have God influence, but shows hints of Zeus watching over him (the Eagle). The Trojans constantly claim the Gods are on their side, and the pompous way in which they say it seems to make you envision the director going ""Pfft, what jackasses! believing in the Gods of their time, HAH! Jesus Christ our lord and savior is the only God and THEY should've known that! So they die for their heresy! DIE DIE DIE!"" A bit of an exaggeration on my part, but that basic idea.<br/><br/>Another big problem is something that also messed up the game Warcraft III. It is TOO HERO-BASED. In the movie, so much emphasis is placed on heroes like Achilles and Hector, that the armies pretty much play absolutely no role at all in the movie! It doesn't matter that the Greeks outnumber the Trojans 2 or 3 to 1, they absolutely can't win without Achilles!!! It doesn't matter that the Trojans are defended by epic walls and the best archers in the world, they can't win without Hector!!!<br/><br/>All in all, a very poor put-together movie, with a kind of stubborn negative and childish mentality towards the ways, beliefs, and customs of the times, pretty much re-writing the legend of Troy to make it more sell-able to dumb audiences who want to gawk at Brad Pitt naked (yes, he's naked several times for no real reason) and the amount of men they can cram into one shot. The acting is wooden, and hearing Achilles whine and sass like a snotty teenage girl just irritates, the characters are portrayed all wrong, the Gods and the Myths aren't just ignored---they're subliminally cursed and treaded and defecated upon. The legend was torn open, the parts the director liked picked apart, and made more Hollywood-friendly to be commercialized."

","I was quite intrigued when I first decided to see this movie, the first thought that struck my mind was that it would turn out to be a horrible misrepresentation of the original story and that it would bring shame to the cinema world. Little did I realize that once I saw this film, my opinions of movies would change altogether, I no longer judge films just by advertising or hear-say or other people's opinions. I now judge films on there over-all value to the cinema world. I definitely need to point out that this movie is definitely worth its weight in gold as far as its worth to the cinema world, the beauty of the film was literally inspiring, the drama was neither tear-jerking or flooding with emotion that you just get sick. The drama unfolded like a film noir love story, only the fact that it was not portrayed by two ""star-crossed"" lovers, but by actual countries. That to me at least deserves a 8+ rating in any vote. However the amount of action and cinematography was enough to make the strongest get teary-eyed with its gorgeous point of view. So, overall the movie is worth a lot to the movie world and by far the only thing I can say I didn't like about the film is the way Pitt was defeated, I mean sniped by an arrow by a punk kid that wants love in any form available. Tsk Tsk.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie by any means necessary, I would also recommend buying the DVD as well."

","I have just seen Troy and I have noticed big mistakes, at least from what I remember learning in school. Even though the movie gives you a rough idea of mythological Greece, which is good enough for the typical American idiot, there are still inaccuracies that are obvious had the director only had the knowledge!! Since they have already been listed in number on this website, I will only name a few: the Trojan War lasted ten years and not a month; Achilles is killed with a single arrow in his heel; Agamemnon and Menelas are not killed during the Trojan War but far later: Agamemnon was killed by his wife Clytemnestra, and Menelas lived happily with his wife Helen. But this might have been too much for the American to understand, especially being killed by a single arrow to the heel, they wouldn't understand that!!!"

Where was the classical mythology that was passed down from generation to generation? The heroes were bigger than life in these stories and all we got was a little fancy knife work. I was very disappointed by the lack of development in these areas. But I suppose it is to be expected because it is a lot of story to be crammed into one movie."

","Well, this movie had a lot of hype, and in some ways really delivered. The battle scenes were well done and exciting. There wasn't too much fast moving camera so you could at least follow the fight scenes a bit. The overall feel of the movie was enjoyable and the movie did what it set out to do. It made you love the characters they want you to love, feel sorry for the appropriate ones and hate others. All well directed.<br/><br/>For the most part the cast was excellent. Eric Bana and Brian Cox really steal the show as Hector and Agamamnon respectively. Brendan Gleeson was also superb as Menelaus. Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Garrett Hedlund, and Peter O'Toole put up respectable performances. Another borderline scene stealer was Sean Bean as Odysseus. Brad Pitt however was utterly unpleasant. While I'm sure some ladies liked how he looked, he was the only misfit in the movie and was totally out of place in his role. Unfortunately this really wasn't so much a movie about Troy as it was about Achilles, which meant a lot of unpleasant scenes with an actor who wasn't holding his own. This alone almost ruined the movie, but the shoulders of Bana, Gleeson, Cox, and Bean were able to make this a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>Now, while this doesn't detract directly from the movie, it isn't a very exact representation of the Illiad. People die at the wrong times, the wrong people live, and basically it's simply a movie inspired by the Illiad. I won't go into specifics as I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't viewed it, but be prepared that this isn't the Illiad by Homer.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're interested, you should see it. You won't regret viewing it, but I doubt it'll be on too many people's top ten lists. It certainly could have been with a better actor for Achilles and following Homer's thoughts a little closer."

"Billylkbrooke","8","1","4","24 April 2018"," A convincing and compelling adaptation of the Iliad
","I want to begin here by saying I have been watching this film for many years, so I have a degree of nostalgia when I watch it. I have also read the Iliad, and studied it extensively so I am familiar with its story and themes. It is with this in mind that I believe 14 years on that Troy is a film worth watching, if not for its complete accuracy to the tale it depicts, then for the compelling themes it explores. <br/><br/>Like all depictions of the Iliad tale, Troy begins with Paris whisking away Helen to the legendary city Troy, whereupon they are soon followed by the Greeks. War ensues, that the Trojans begin to win, but the death of Hector begins the final act of Troy's inevitable fall by Odysseus' Wooden Horse plan. The story is well known so the film, instead of leaving the story ambiguous, wisely establishes in the dialogue a sense of impending doom that has you hoping against the odds of history that the city might survive.<br/><br/>This is well done, and many of the finest actors of the film, with Peter O'Toole and Eric Bana playing Priam and Hector, adding weight to the inevitability of Troy's doom. All great stuff. This similarly purveys the vast battle sequences that thrill with their grandeur but provide enough gore, and are followed by compelling dialogue of war-weary warriors, that we get a feel of the senselessness of the fighting that strongly resembles Homer's storytelling. Odysseus' dialogue, skillfully delivered by Sean Bean, is particularly strong on this part, urging Achilles to stay in the fight so that the Greek soldiers can return home to their wives. Many lines throughout the film deplore the spilling of blood made necessary by the hubris of the Greek rulers.<br/><br/>Agamemnon is truly well portrayed by Brian Cox, who delivers an ego filled portrayal of a power-hungry King who refuses to be in the wrong when he argues with Achilles. Similarly Menelaus delivers a chilling line of how he wants Helen back ""so I can killer myself with my bare hands"" landing home how these leading Greeks are only here to rent their ego and enhance their power. It is a chilling commentary in a way on the shortfalls of masculinity and how wars are so often led by men who care only for their own power and image. This is especially why Troy is so close to Homer's prose, because these moments really capture Homer's critique of the senseless, barbaric Trojan War.<br/><br/>The music of James Horner also adds to this sense of sorrow and anguish, as his score slowly declines from the grand horns of Achilles' early theme to the wails of female vocalists. The music during Troy's sacking is especially humbling, as the anguished trumpets that blare reinforce a horror in the audience as Troy burns on screen.<br/><br/>However, this is by no means an entirely successful film. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Achilles is unfortunately bereft of subtlety, as he fluctuates between the face of a hero and of an angry maniac. I did not really enjoy Homer's Achilles either, mainly because he is described as a man prone to sulking, consumed by his own self importance, Pitt's depiction fails to incite any compassion for his point of view. His story arc involves falling in love to reveal his human side, but Pitt fails to compellingly show his humanity in any other way than killing Agamemnon's followers rather than Trojans, which isn't really a great way to show character development. Paris similarly is displayed with a low range of emotions by Orlando Bloom, but as he appears less, and is less vital to much of the middle section of the film, I haven't really got much I can say about him. <br/><br/>This last part is a shame because Peter O'Toole gives an astounding performance as Priam, and Eric Bana delivers a wonderful act as the tragic hero of the story. There are many great performances in this film, and the script is generally quite good, but it doesn't quite reach its highest levels because Achilles and Paris, very key characters in the story, fail to provide any impact in the audience in either their actions in the story or their fairly bland portrayals.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the themes portrayed, the visuals and many other great performances (James Cosmo as a Trojan general is a special delight!) makes this a film worth watching, and worth enjoying. I recommend it, but am disappointed that it could have been so much more."
"dustypicieux1","8","1","4","11 June 2011"," Where are the Oscars???
","Historians are sharply divided on the question of whether or not the Trojan War actually occurred - and if it did, which archaeological site is actually Troy. Discoveries made at the beginning of the 21st century provide new evidence of several armed battles in the right area at the right time - but definitive proof is hard to find, due largely to the historical practice of constructing one city on the ruins of another. Homer's Illiad (and other similar epics depicting the Trojan War) were written hundreds of years after the Trojan War supposedly occurred, and are of little use in determining factual historical events as they included many mythological elements: gods such as Apollo, Zeus, and Hera were central characters in the story who drastically affected the course of the war by killing and/or saving individual people during the conflict. The producers' decision to eliminate all mythological elements from the story gives their film an air of historical authenticity not present in the original works. The best epic in decades."
"BertEmke","8","1","4","18 February 2010"," Fine performances by Peter O'Toole and Brad Pitt
","This movie was better than I had expected. It works well as an action film, but it also has some convincing moments of genuine human feeling. The meeting between King Priam, played by Peter O'Toole, and Achilles, played by Brad Pitt, is touching. I just finished reading a fine novel based on that incident -- ""Ransom"" by David Malouf -- and it was easy to picture O'Toole as the grief-stricken king.<br/><br/>Also, the one-on-one confrontation between the Greek king Menelaus and the Trojan prince Paris, played by Orlando Bloom, was refreshing because it portrayed Paris as a coward. This was true to the legends about Paris, but I was surprised it made it into the movie.<br/><br/>My recollection is that ""Troy"" was treated pretty harshly by the critics when it was first released. I don't understand why."

"padraig1971","6","1","4","24 December 2009"," not a bad film, but takes too many liberties with the story
","This is not a bad film, but I was disappointed that so many liberties were taken with the story. For a start, the action of the Iliad happens in the tenth year of the war, whereas from watching the film you would think that the whole war was over within a few weeks. Menelaus and Agamemnon are both killed in the film, whereas we know from Homer that Menelaus returns with Helen to Sparta, where Odysseus's son Telemachus visits him in the Odyssey; as for Agamemnon, he returns to Mycenae, where he is killed by his wife Clytemnestra's lover Aegisthus. In the Iliad Achilles chases Hector around the walls of Troy three times before killing him - this is completely left out in the film. Aeneas is much too young; he should be in the same age range as Odysseus and Ajax as he is one of the foremost Trojan heroes. Some quite major figures are totally absent, e.g. Hecuba, Cassandra, Diomedes. The scene where Priam supplicates Achilles for his son's body is a major disappointment - in the poem, this is the emotional climax of the work, while the sack of Troy, though clearly fated and inevitable, is not explicitly described. The ending of the film completely changes the emphasis, and the crucial meeting between Priam and Achilles loses most of its force. It's entertaining enough as a film in itself, but I would have preferred a more accurate version of the traditional story that has stood the test of time for nearly 3,000 years."
"Sisiutil","6","1","4","13 September 2009"," Entertaining but flawed
","I should preface my remarks by stating that I am basing them upon the director's cut rather than the theatrical release.<br/><br/>Troy is an entertaining thrill ride that ultimately turns out to be--for the most part--emotionally hollow. This is disappointing, because the story of Troy is one of the first great stories and deserves better treatment. <br/><br/>The action sequences in the film, to be sure, are exciting to watch, whether it's the seamless integration of live action and CGI in the large scale battles or the intricate choreography of the one-on-one fights (Achilles' duel with Hector is, as expected, a highlight). But action alone doesn't make a good movie (as we've been trying to tell Michael Bay for years).<br/><br/>Fortunately, Troy also benefits from some good performances, especially from its two leads, Brad Pitt as Achilles and Eric Bana as Hector. Pitt deserves a lot of praise here; he spends most of the movie playing a character who is largely unsympathetic. Achilles treats most people around him with contempt. However, partly because he's Brad freakin' Pitt, but also because he's a talented actor, Pitt manages to make us feel there's more to Achilles than how he appears superficially.<br/><br/>Bana has the easier part as the respected leader and family man, but still gives Hector a lot of depth. He and Saffron Burrows were particularly affecting in their scenes together. Peter O'Toole is also quite good as Priam. His scene with Pitt, where he begs for the return of his son's body, is the highlight of the film in my opinion; it brought one of the greatest scenes in literature to life and was one of the few truly affecting moments in the movie. And Sean Bean, as usual, shines in his few moments as the under-used Odysseus.<br/><br/>However, while Troy is largely rescued by its epic battles and solid performances, it never achieves or even comes close to greatness. The film is weighted down by many problems. The Paris/Helen love story is difficult to pull off, especially since it's almost impossible to avoid portraying Paris as selfish and callow. It doesn't help that he's played by Orlando Bloom; while Bloom is a talented actor, he seems to have largely outworn his welcome from movie-goers. Another problem is the two-dimensional portrayal of a villainous, power-hungry Agamemnon. Brian Cox can chew scenery like no one's business, but he's capable of so much more.<br/><br/>>SPOILER ALERT< <br/><br/>The biggest problem, however, is that at the end, the writer and director took the cheap, predictable, Hollywood way out. The reason why the story of Troy is so powerful and long-lasting is the devastating impact of the war on nearly all of its participants. Consider: in the legend of Troy, Paris dies, along with all of the Trojan royal family; Ajax goes crazy and kills himself; Helen, after being forced to marry another Trojan prince, is captured and returned to Menelaus; Andromache's infant son is thrown to his death from Troy's walls, then she becomes a slave and concubine of the son of the man who killed her husband; Odysseus is condemned to exile from his home for 10 years... you get the picture. And don't get me started on the sorry fate of some of the characters who were left out of the film, such as Hecuba and Cassandra.<br/><br/>Compare that to how lightly everyone gets off in this film. The only Trojans who die are the grey-haired ones; in an all-too-typical and cynical Hollywood rewrite of the legend, almost everybody who's young and pretty gets to live. Yes, Hector and Achilles die, but they were warriors and so it was more or less expected they would. As a result, the war, bizarrely, appears to have had very little impact on anyone, and that robs the film of any emotional resonance. <br/><br/>The overall message of the legend of Troy is that while there is glory and honour and heroism to be found in times of war, there is also tragedy and brutality and death--and that the worst suffering often befalls innocents with little or no connection to the fighting. That message is completely lost in this rather shallow film, and that's unfortunate, perhaps even tragic, because a story this epic deserves much, much better treatment."
"courtneysarah429","9","1","4","20 April 2009"," An Underrated Epic
","I have heard such terrible things about this movie, primarily from my family. Although the 2000 epic Gladiator staring Russell Crowe very obviously paved the way for Troy, I found this movie to be entertaining and original.. Not being fond of Brad Pitt as an actor (or in general) I had my doubts regarding his ability to portray such a character. My views on him have changed and I am convinced that he is one of the greatest actors of the time. Pitt was able to portray a large array of emotions during his performance. When Achilles(Brad Pitt) and Briseis(Rose Byrne) are first shown on screen together the audience sees a romance beginning to emerge. Their conversation, to be frank, was quite sweet and made me smile. The two lovers haven't many scenes together but the few they do share are worth remembering. Eric Bana played his role of Prince Hector quite capably and also deserves recognition. My heart went out to him when he said farewell to his wife for the final time.<br/><br/>The scenes of romance blended well into the movie. The battle sequences as well as the special effects are absolutely fantastic. About fifteen minutes into the movie the viewer is presented with a scene of ships sailing across the Aagean Sea. After watching the special features it is revealed that many of those ships are computer generated. You could have fooled me. In spite of this movie not being at all historically accurate the overall plot is intriguing and kept me thoroughly entertained. Because there is no such thing as a perfect movie I give Troy 9/10 stars. Good job to Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Rose Byrne for three stunning performances. This movie is underrated and does not receive the praise deserved."
"sjm_maloney","4","1","4","31 January 2009"," Below average fare
","Very interesting to see the previous review from 'Leontion', the comments on validity versus Homer's epic and subsequent texts are enlightening and should be of interest to anybody who wants to judge the storyline of the film against historic texts. Having said that the fates of both Agamemnon & Menelaus in this film are surely not a common interpretation from any age? A Cassandra cameo would surely have raised a smile or two as well.<br/><br/>However I would prefer to judge this as a film experience, and in this respect I feel this is at best an average movie. Dialogue is poor, characterisations are two dimensional and direction & camera-work during the 'epic' scenes is average to say the least.<br/><br/>Brian Cox & Peter o' Toole are simply going through the motions and add much less weight to the film than their acting talents deserve.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are poor, relying on scale via CGI, with overall tactics again (like many other films) relying on 'chaarge!!!' rather than any approach that may tax the viewer with complexity. Choreography of the individual duel scenes again lack drama and finesse, particularly the scene between Hector & Achilles which had far too many cuts to 'audience' and lousy continuity.<br/><br/>The orchestral score (a specialist area of mine) was particularly poor for a film of this budget; varying between bland arrangements and sub-standard emulation of Lisa Gerrard (think 'Gladiator') style vocalisation in the 'poignant' sections.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film, and will not watch it again. On a level which I cannot defend with facts, I feel that realism aside, and from my own study of the classical world, the Spartans would have smiled and approved heartily of the manner of their portrayal in 300; in Troy neither side would have enjoyed their representations."

Peter O' Toole is pretty good in his role as the king of Troy, as well as Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean. The plethora of secondary characters are only as strong as the scene they are in, and there's a lot of drag in this film, making it feel like it's taking forever to get to the inevitable climax. Orlando Bloom (who must be in his thousandth role as a guy with a sword/bow) is miscast as Paris, more so than Kruger.<br/><br/>The writing is fairly decent. The film has moments where it seems like it has come to a halt with all the dialogue that takes the plot almost nowhere, which dumbs the quality down. The battles are very good, though Wolfgang Peterson seems to go crazy with the camera as we get sweeping shots of the vast armies -- when the action unfolds would've been more appropriate for us to view the vista of soldiers. This film is too in your face for it to be taken very seriously. As for the romance (upon which the film is basically centered over, and not the various skirmishes) the scenes between Paris and Helen come off as lame, and the very little screen-time of Hector and his wife make us care little for the characters. The film as a bad ending, in that hardly any of the characters get a fitting conclusion if they haven't already been slaughtered in the destruction of the city of Troy.<br/><br/>The battles, as aforementioned, are actually better than I thought they were going to be. While the only gripe I could have is that this film is bloody, which when adding too much blood to battle (and in such a realistic fashion) can make one feel uncomfortable, unlike the brutality in Gladiator or the later 300. This could've been a very good PG-13 film.<br/><br/>James Horner's score is uninspired and dull. From the lackluster heroic theme for Achilles, to the overbearing moaning over the carnage, this is just one cringe-worthy score. There's no evolution of themes over time during the movie, nor is there any real complexity in the composition.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a war film full of clichÃ©s to make it fit in with the blockbuster-seeking audience to which it is being released. Our heroes have been modified to superhero in their abilities and cunning, and our women have been reduced to the shrieking damsels in distress. Nothing really new or innovative is in this film, making it just one big budget production over a story with the most predictable ending. Worth a watch for mindless entertainment, and nothing more."

","I am not complaining about the direction scenery acting etc, its all about the story. The brave and the finest dies without a reason and a coward immature prince goes away unharmed, thats not justice to the huge money being spent on TROY. The way Brad moved in the movie, it was awesome, Hectar was also impressive all that hurt me is the role of that coward prince named PARRIS. On the other hand film is worth watching. The fog of war, the styles of action, its an awesome war movie. I think Nathan jones had very small part, they could increase his part because he is more than a human being. he is a monster. It is always good to see such a warrior in a movie for longer period of time."
"panache2005","4","1","4","17 March 2008"," Disappointed.
","When Troy first came out, I wasn't old enough to see, but really wanted to. As the movie came in and out theatres, I begged my parents to let me get it off PPV (no), or rent it (another no). Even after I came of age they wouldn't let me see it. One day, when they both left, I discovered my chance when it was playing on AMC. It started out okay. Brad Pitt was hot and quite built as warrior Achilles, but I didn't really feel he put a lot of effort into his character. He seemed bored throughout, and more intimidating in a hunky lifeguard way then in a dangerous soldier way. And I was so disappointed with the women they cast! Diane Kruger as Helen wore so much eye-liner, in some scenes her left eye looked drastically larger than her right (also, eye-liner wasn't supposed to have been invented yet). The love that Brad Pitt and the skeezy Priestess share is cheesy, and so unrealistic (who falls that passionately in love in two days?). Orlando Bloom gave a valiant effort as Paris, but I couldn't help but feel that his character came off a little spoiled and wussy. I suppose the only actor I felt fulfilled his role was Eric Bana, who played Paris's older brother. Despite the hot actors, the intense battle scenes and the amazing sets, I felt bored, because a) I knew what the outcome would be--who didn't? and b) the acting quality was more like rent-an-actor then lets-pay-millions-of-dollars-for-an actor.<br/><br/>Skip it. See ""Spartacus"" instead."
"harrypfanmcc","2","1","4","2 March 2008"," How did this get past the experts?
","When I heard that a movie was being made about the Trojan War I said, ""Finally! With all the new technology out there, this should be great."" I even rejoiced when I heard of the casting because I wanted to see what these actors would bring to their iconic characters. Then I saw the movie...<br/><br/>Alright, this movie was an absolute disgrace. The large shots of the battle sequences were visually stunning, but the acting was questionable. Brad Pitt could have done so much better. He could have easily played Achilles and played him well, but he lacked the intense rage that defines Achilles. The Iliad actually opens Book 1(entitled ""The Rage of Achilles"") with the phrase ""Rage- Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles"" {as translated by Robert Fagles}. Brad Pitt simply fell flat and made his character too vulnerable. Orlando Bloom did a decent job of playing the passive Paris, until he got into the part at the end with the ""sword of Troy"" and all that Hollywood invention. The only real actor whose performance I enjoyed the whole movie was Sean Bean and Odysseus. He did well as portraying the hero as wise, intelligent, and unwillingly present at the war. His speeches which open and close the movie were also very poignant and reflected some of the values of the Ancient Greeks. The rest of the cast simply did not even live up to the names of their characters, which was quite disappointing considering their wonderful reputations as character actors.<br/><br/>Now for the plot. I have been criticized by some as being ""too meticulous"" when it comes to movies based upon classical stories. Granted, this spawns from having heard these stories since I was two(my grandfather is a retired Classics professor), but I also just want to see these wonderful stories done correctly. This movie basically took the stories of Homer, Virgil, and countless others, ripped out the pages, burned the spines of the books, and said ""Let's make a movie."" The gods are not at all mentioned as real figures in the story, which is ridiculous because they influence practically everything. Various characters who survive the war (in the stories) die (i.e. Menelaus, Agamemnon). The deaths of characters occur incorrectly (i.e. the deaths of Ajax, Patroclus). Achilles is killed too late in the movie(he died before the creation of the horse) and his reasons for dying are different. In the original stories, he died while talking to his Trojan love interest, Polyxena. This brings up the character of Briseis in the film; she has been created from three different Trojan women (Briseis, Cassandra, and Polyxena). It was just ridiculous to try and combine three completely different personalities into one person. Finally, in this film Paris lives (he was killed by Philoctetes in the original story) and Helen escapes Troy (she returns with her love, Menelaus in the ancient texts). These changes drastically impacted the outcome and thus completely destroyed the story.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie fails to deliver solid entertainment. The spotty performances and plot changes simply produce what had the potential of a great film."

","The Motion Picture is something of a Delemma.There is nothing in its place in society if you will that should provide for anything more than an illusion which as far as illusions go well an illusion is just that,an illusion! That doesn't mean that there nothing worthy of mentioning but it may not as such be the kind of mention that is customarily associated with the writing of a review about the dilemma that such as this illusion provides for.There is more here than merely an illusion at work but something of a calculation as to the place that the motion picture,perhaps this motion picture but irregardless the motion picture and its marketing have benefited from.This particular motion picture entitled ""Troy"" provides the backdrop of a time past with perhaps a few thousand years to account for, but nonetheless a time past appears as having been eclipsed in this motion picture entitled ""Troy"".The siren,like the voice echoes through out the film with some very dramatic if subtle themes being developed while the film goes on and a historic and valuable part of Ancient Greek History unfolds.It is suggested in the films credits that the backdrop of Homers,""The ""lliad"" as well as ""The Odessey"" are at the source of the story telling ability.""The Iliad"" for arguments sake is merely about the last year or so in an event that for a time was thought never to have happened.The cause as to these doubts had as much to do with ability to place these events as it did in the events actually occurring.It further can be suggested that Homer was thought more to be a story teller than a teller of the stories of history.The general opinion was that Homer exaggerated events and this of course lent a inability to believe in the story in its entirety or even at all.The dilemma then resurfaces because one appears to be as unreliable as another and as yet we are but in the year 2007 while these events were said to have occurred sometime prior to AD.The film opens with a wide open landscape,beautiful virtually untouched beaches and a narration as to the end of time and the beginning of the timeless and eternal quest for immortality.This perhaps as best as it can be authenticated was a preoccupation of the then pagan(worshiping of many Gods-or perhaps no God at all,or no religion)Greek Society.It is worth mentioning that the motion picture attempts to tell the story of ""The Trojan War"".The attacks by the Greek Army was virulent with devastation and ruin accompanying the ultimate cost to Troy with its defeat.It is a very tragic tale of a verified youth,whose royal blood was no less kin to the ""King of Troy:King Prium"",this youths name was Paris.It has been generally established that indeed this impetious young man made a conquest of the another rivals wife in whose name bore the burden of ""Helen of Sparta"" and like the film states sparked this terrible conflict.Hector,the older brother to Paris was to far along the route back to Troy when he was advised by Paris that there was a guest on board which he was concerned about.This was to happen while they sailed for Troy when it was then revealed to Hector that his younger brother Paris had been unfaithful.This created one hell of a mess and the on board conversation between Hector and Paris was a useful if not portent of a disaster unfolding.Though this is mentioned after the fact, this unfaithful relationship was underway as the two countries which had been rivals more so than enemies,though enemies to be certain,now there was to be discord that added insult to injury as they(Helen and Paris) loved while the countries celebrated a peace.Truly this was a disaster!The approaching doom was sealed when she did not return immediately and a tremendous armada of ships and men,some 50,000 strong set sail for the beaches of ""Troy"".The Truth as to events about to unfold was that many heroes according to Greek Culture were to die including AJAX,Hector,Achilles,Paris.With the sacking of ""Troy"" Achilles authored a kind of revenge by desecrating the Temple of Apollo,one of the many Gods that the Trojan people worshiped.They also killed un-armed Priests as they prayed as well as taking captive those that prayed.Achilles was thought of and even today he is considered the very mightiest of warriors and was blessed by the Gods.He was there greatest warrior with a select band of very skilled men in his personal elite force of mamodens.The film is authored by Heroes whose frames and fierceness are only seconded by there loyalty to there King and their country.The battle scenes are engaging and mightily told as camera work with computer animated graphics make a modest amount look like many many thousand,from men to ships.It is done well.The music is very good with a theme song that will echo if you will as the story unfolds,entitled ""Remember"".The Greeks of that day had rituals which were observed when there dead had to be removed from the battlefield.It is a moving moment a dramatic detail that there was more at stake here than merely the fighting of a battle.It was the honor,the duty of every Greek man to provide a witness unto Greece herself in his duty as a warrior.It was no joke it was for real and indeed this sacking of Troy was brutal stuff.With the tolling of the Bell from Troys watchtowers along the beach,they warned of the impending peril foretold now approaches with unmistakable certainty.The horizon filled with the promised armada with Achilles landing on the beach first.It was a big time fight and one which both morality and honor were a part of the taking of life.It is these themes that are interwoven into the very telling of the story of ""Troy""."

"Doylenf","7","1","4","11 August 2007"," Spectacular battle scenes dwarf the human drama...Brad Pitt miscast...
","The biggest flaw in TROY is that BRAD PITT, while looking more buff than ever and obviously having trained for the battle scenes with a personal trainer, is a disappointment as Achilles. He pouts his way through the entire role like a petulant child rather than a mature man who wants his name to down in history as a great warrior.<br/><br/>When pitted against an acting giant like PETER O'TOOLE his lack of charisma in the role shows badly. Furthermore, he's simply miscast. The film needed someone who could give gravitas to the role. In old Hollywood, it's the sort of part that would have been ideal for someone like GARY COOPER.<br/><br/>Everyone else fares a lot better. ERIC BANA, PETER O'TOOLE and SEAN BEAN are excellent, while ORLANDO BLOOM struggles to make the role of Paris come alive. He's at a disadvantage every time he shares a scene with his brother, ERIC BANA, as Hector. Bana gives the kind of intense performance that Brad Pitt never achieves. Nor does DIANE KRUGER bring more than a beautiful face to the role of Helen of Troy.<br/><br/>But the film itself is glorious to watch. There's spectacle galore for each huge battle scene and some of the human conflicts are well staged, although most of them seem dwarfed by all the lavish sets and costumes. There's stunning realism to all the battle scenes but the highlight is the way Bana and Pitt fight a duel to the death.<br/><br/>James Horner has composed a marvelous score, full of exotic color and adding a lot of texture to the overall drama.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous, especially all of the outdoor shots showing the vast landscape populated by a vast army (thanks to CGI) and the fleet of Trojan ships nearing shore.<br/><br/>Summing up: Enjoyable view of ancient times, but purists will object to all the changes made in ""The Illiad"" on which it's loosely based. Fans of action films will get their money's worth."
"chrichtonsworld","5","1","4","27 February 2007"," This movie is not that great
","It has been some time now that I have seen this movie. But this movie was the topic of a big discussion I had with friends of mine. We were comparing ""Alexander"" and ""Troy"". Most of my friends hated ""Alexander"" but loved ""Troy"". This to me is just a mystery. I admit that the production value is high and ""Troy"" looks epic. But that is all. In my opinion ""Troy"" isn't epic. It has some major flaws. Most of the characters were uninteresting. Orlando Bloom as Paris (brilliant in Lord of the rings) fails miserably as to portray the handsome and brave prince. Brad Pitt looks lost. And I don't like how they handled the legend about his only weakness (his heel). Because in the movie they don't explain why shooting arrows in his heel will kill Achilles. In the Iliad (from Homerus which describes the Trojan War))they gave the reason why this was his weak spot and would have made much more sense if they just mentioned this fact in the movie. Because historians are still debating if the Trojan War really happened I assume ""Troy"" is based on the myth. And therefore I missed a very important and most interesting part of the Trojan War being shown or told in ""Troy"". The reason for Paris to abduct Helen of Sparta. (The war sprang from a quarrel between the goddesses Athena, Hera and Aphrodite, after the goddess Eris (""Strife"") gave them a golden apple with the inscription ""to the fairest"" (sometimes known as the Apple of Discord). The goddesses went to Paris, who judged that Aphrodite, as the ""fairest"", should receive the apple. In exchange, Aphrodite made Helen, the most beautiful of all women, fall in love with Paris, who took her to Troy.) How could you leave out this part,it would have made ""Troy"" so much better. The director's take on this story as if it all had really happened is a bit of an insult. I mean the whole Trojan horse fairytale,who would fall for such an obvious trap! Give some credit to people in those days. The action also wasn't very exciting. It certainly doesn't even come close to the epic battles in ""Alexander"" (which is based on historical facts). The only real positive thing is Eric Bana as Hector. He was convincing. Overall this movie wasn't exciting enough!"

The screenplay was also good and scenes looked very clear which is a huge plus because I have a thing with being able to see whats supposed to be happening.<br/><br/>So if i thought all that was good why a 6?

"JuguAbraham","6","1","4","24 July 2006"," Will the real Wolfgang Peterson please stand up?
","Even though I am fervent admirer of Wolfgang Peterson's TV film in German ""Black and white like day and night"" made in 1978, his later films including his ""Das Boot"" and ""In the line of fire"" and ""Troy"" lack the ingredients of superior cinema. In the 1978 film Peterson came up with a brilliant performance from Bruno Ganz that will be etched in the memory of any film-goer, backed up by brilliant indoor shots.<br/><br/>If someone thinks Troy is a great effort, they ought to compare the 1956 ""Helen of Troy"" (directed by Robert Wise) where the late Stanley Baker's Achilles was powerful though not having any penchant for reflection. Baker's Achilles was all brawn. Pitt's Achilles had the brooding hero shifting from the philosophical to the flippant, never letting the character develop to evoke sympathy for his fate, a character who knows his future actions (that he has to kill Hector in only in public and thus gain eternal fame). Pitt's and Peterson's Achilles taunts the gods and kings but is silenced by a woman. Peterson had a great opportunity to develop the contradictions in the character, but chose instead to truncate the useful scene with his mother (Julie Christieshe is good even in such brief appearances) that could have been developed further.<br/><br/>I have read that Peter O'Toole did not appreciate Peterson's inputsyet O'Toole is the saving grace of the film (a film where Paris kills Achilles by shooting arrows at his chest rather than his Achilles tendon!). So was Nigel Terry whose stage voice stood out in stark contrast to the other actors. For me, O'Toole, Christie and Terry were the saving graces in an unremarkable filmunless you judge a film solely for its stunts and special effects.<br/><br/>Peterson did make a great decision to enhance the appeal of the film by employing the singing talents of Tanja Tzarovska. But why did Peterson and screen-playwright David Benioff tamper with Homer's work to make Achilles one of the Greeks who entered Troy in the belly of the horse? That's totally out of character. Achilles was not a man who would adopt such tactics. In the original epic, Achilles dies outside the ramparts of Troy by an arrow shot at his heel.<br/><br/>Even though most of his recent films have been lack-luster, I believe the Peterson who made ""Black and white like day and night"" is a talented director. I wish the real Peterson will stand up in the future and not be swayed by big budgets and studio pressures and deliver decent cinema as he used to decades ago."
"mrforgetful","7","1","4","9 July 2006"," Lets make epic stories not so epic
","An apparent trend in the year 2004 was to demystify popular stories and make them more down to earth. This ended up working pretty well in King Arthur, which claimed to use historical accuracy and fact as a storysetter, but as far as Troy goes, the end result was quite disappointing.<br/><br/>If you are unfamiliar with the Iliad, there is interaction between the gods as well as mortals. Everyone and everything is incorporated into this massive battle for power and glory, but started by love. There are heroes on both sides of the battle, and the reader is meant to cheer for both sides and witness the pain and destruction of dramatic battle.<br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>Wolfgang Peterson decided not to incorporate the gods at all into the story, instead focusing on the human characters. Not that they aren't interesting or anything, but the story has so much more to offer. Getting rid of the gods and their endless drama with each other really downsized the scope of the situation. To put it in perspective, lets say they tried to do the same thing with Lord of the Rings. The movie would be more to the tune of ""yeah there's like 12 orcs coming over here. Maybe we should shoot them or something."" Meanwhile, the ringwraiths would really be the brazillian soccer team in disguise and the rohirrim would slide down the hill in their rocking horses. Oh yeah, and the whole Trojan war deal was shortened from 10 years to a couple days.<br/><br/>The whole tone of the story just seemed downplayed. Odysseus said little of his homeland of Ithaca, Ajax played about as important of a part as an eating utensil, and there was no urgency or indecisiveness about Achilles' situation. They mention his little prophecy, which is kind of an important deal, once, and really don't come back to it at all. It should have been one of the main themes of the story. And remember how there should be like 2000 Myrmidans? You know, like the best warriors in the world that turn the tide of the battle? There's like 40 of them. And the greeks most desperate hour, when they must resort to building a wall out of their now unneeded ships to shield them from the Trojans, is nonexistent in this particular motion feature event.<br/><br/>Besides for restraining the grandeur of the original story, the movie itself stands on its own I guess. The sets are nice, the acting was good for the most part (except for a horribly miscast Brad Pitt as the brooding and effectively emo Achilles). Orlando Bloom is perfectly wimpy and stupid, and Eric Bana is genuinely heroic and the all around good guy as Troy's Hector. And there were some nicely choreographed sword fights. The script lacked a little but there weren't any lines that immediately struck me as just godawful.<br/><br/>If you're just interesting in a swords and sandal epic, then watch this and you shouldn't be disappointed. Don't expect a Gladiator. If you're expecting Homer's Iliad at its greatest splendor and epicity (is that a word? it is now...), then watch something else. Just recreate the battle with dinosaurs on your bedroom floor. It'd be more spectacular."

","As one of the thousands of people in the world who have actually read Homerus' Illias and Odyssee I must say I am concerned about the future when it comes to historical movies. 'Troy' is one of them films that has been made for the benefit and the cash only, of what once was an original but great movie is nothing left. Although the great list of actors that are to be praised, this movie is a total rape of the original story, molded into a blockbuster with the target to raise money, not to educate. Despite very good shots, nice conversations and remarkable special effects, there are several things that just aren't right. Like the death of Ajax and Achilles. As we all know Achilles was killed by an arrow in the foot, but during the Trojan War, not in the end. The death of Achilles drives Ajax insane, or at least his desire to inherit his weapons. Also characters like Breseis, Paris (!) Athena (who isn't there at all), and Helen are completely different according to the great writer Homerus. The love between Paris and Helen seems very down to earth, but yes, Gods are involved, and i haven't seen any of them. Also Iphigenea and Klytaimnestra are completely out of the picture, although they are the beginning as well as the ending of the story. Don't get me wrong, it isn't a bad movie, it's just a failure if you compare it with the 'real' story. It's a shame it's called 'Troy', for it could be any epic war if it wasn't for the wooden pony to cut in..."
"uleekoko","5","1","4","29 December 2005"," The Gods
","A quick response to the review that applauds the way this movie depicted the Greek gods and their relationship, or lack thereof, to their human counterparts. If you have actually read and studied the Illiad you would know that Hector would never question or doubt the power of the gods. This movie was made in the modern mode of thinking; that gods are intangible conceits created by human consciousness. In the Illiad, the gods, Apollo, Athena, etc., are just as real as the men of Greek and Troy. They take shape, take the form of certain characters, speak directly to the warriors, and most importantly control the actions of the characters that drive the story. So, instead of applauding this ""new"" more realistic take, I think the film makers did us a disservice by not being ""realistic"" to the original story. These heroes did not think and behave the way we do today. It would have been much more interesting, like Homer's original is, if they were true to the story. And while Achilles states in the opening scene that he is not invincible, his mother is depicted as a sea-nymph, which, she was and, which, while not exactly a god in Greek mythology, is still immortal."
"echozdog","6","1","4","7 September 2005"," Shell of a tale....
","Well Homer it's not. There is no way you can make a movie and not cut 80% of Homer tale. If you didn't the movie would be days long. But you don't have to change things around to make it shorter. This movie makes the war weeks (or less) long where it took 10 years, with all kinds of twists. Achilles doesn't ride in the horse (but I guess you can't kill Pitt off before the end). No reference to Odessus's 10 years to get home (yes it's another story, but a reference was expected). Cutting the gods completely out of the story was OK, yet I liked the story where they are involved. They could have shown Achilles being dipped in the river Styx except for his heal to explain his dying. But I'll take a ""This is how it really happened"" take on the movie. It works OK.<br/><br/>As for an action movie it's OK. I'm really getting sick of scenes that you know are CGI just because there is too much stuff (e.g. 1000 ships). The battle scenes are pretty good. It's no Gladiator though.<br/><br/>The acting was all over the place. This is Pitt's worst yet. I think this is due more to the director than to Pitt himself (e.g. See 12 Monkeys). Eric Bana does a great Hector and Bloom turns in a pretty wimpy Paris. Peter O'Toole seemed he like should retire. He walked through the movie like he wanted to be somewhere else. Although I never would have guessed I'd see a movie with a Brad Pitt and Peter O'Toole scene.<br/><br/>On the whole it was a fun watch. 6/10 (+6 for the action -4 for Pitts acting). Those thought provoking stares into the sunset were really bad."

Um, did the folks who made this movie READ the Illiad? The original story is so much richer, more tragic, more heartrending. It seems that in trying to clean this up and make it a vehicle for The Brad, they've taken the heart out of the story.

Cox's hollow Agamemnon, Pitt's doomed killing machine, Bean's world weary Oddyseus,Bana's nobility and especially O'Toole's pained and tortured Priam. As for it being untrue to the book - far from it, the film contained all the right bits and only ignored the boring stuff like the Games and unnecessary characters like Idomenous and Diomedes.

I watched the entire movie over two days.<br/><br/>In one interview from the Special Effects CD, Brad Pitt says, ""Brutal"" over and over again to describe the rehearsals and training for the movie. This just reinforces my belief that actors have no idea what ordinary people put up with on a daily basis. Moreover, I suspect Brad Pitt was the perfect choice to play Achilles as that character was also a self-centered person.<br/><br/>However, I do think that the writers made a good choice when they only had the characters refer to the gods, instead of having the so-called gods appear themselves (i.e., shades of Steve Reeves).<br/><br/>One part of the film that I thought could have been better was the banquet scene in Sparta. It looked like an orgy, very unlike what would have taken place and the food was far better than what the Spartans really ate. In fact, one quote that has come down in history is from a Greek, visiting from another city state, who after having eaten supper with a Spartan family remarks, ""Now I know why the Spartans are not afraid to die."" I guess what I hated most about this flick was the way they rewrote the Iliad to kill people off in the war when they didn't die until post-Troy, and to kill people off in the burning of Troy long after they were dead in the Iliad. If I was Homer, I would sue.<br/><br/>But then this is Hollywood... Don't forget to read the book."

What bothered me more was just how poor the film was. The only reason it got a 3 was some of the later battle scenes were fun to watch. But, and it's a big ole' but. The acting was terrible. We (yes more than just me) were so close to turning it off, we were was so bored. I couldn't care less about the characters, they were all so two dimensional. OK so they didn't spend three days introducing themselves and their family history like Homer intended, but there is no excuse in taking out the boring bits and replacing them with the most dull acting. Normally I quite enjoy a Brad Pitt film, but this is him at his worst. I really would not recommend paying money to see this film, a real turkey."
"joegerardi-1","3","1","4","7 February 2005"," Shlock and Hollywood hype...
","Okay, let's get the mistakes out of the way...<br/><br/>1- Breseis did not kill Agamemnon. In fact, she went back with him to Greece as his wife.<br/><br/>2- Melenaus did not die. He and Helen returned to Greece.<br/><br/>3- Helen did not go willingly to Troy, she was kidnapped by Paris.<br/><br/>4- Paris did not survive the Trojan War.<br/><br/>5- Agamemnon did not kill Priam. Neoptolemeus (Achilles' son) did.<br/><br/>6- Achilles brought 50 ships of 50 men - 2,500 total - with him, not 1 ship and 50 men.<br/><br/>7- Patroclus was Achilles' friend, not cousin. In the battle where he was killed by Hector, he was there under the direction of Achilles, and was actually given the armor by Achilles himself.<br/><br/>8- Ajax was not killed by Hector: they battled to a draw, and in fact, wounded Hector.<br/><br/>Need I go on? Troy is another attempt by Hollywood to manipulate the audience. Similar attempts recently - like King Arthur and Pearl Harbor - all end up being lesser movies because of it.<br/><br/>Why does Hollywood continue to rearrange history, film errors as fact, and present them to the public? Do these ignorants think that the stories they present are more exciting than history itself? It seems to me that Hollywood does themselves and the audience a disservice when they change things. I guess people agree, as these movies all tend to lose money, as people stay away in droves, with the exception of Titanic, but there we have a chick flick, so there is the romantic story overshadowing the disaster.<br/><br/>Let it never be said that Hollywood won't change whatever they like, in order to grab more of the viewing public's money, and pass it off as history. Hopefully, as the bottom dollar continues to erode, they'll get back to doing it correctly, and realize that the writer is a lesser hack than the notables of history."

","Fascinating, how lots of decent people involved with this train-wreck didn't help it get over the finish line. This was more like a bad cartoon than an epic movie. I'm sure the studio believed they would capitalize on the success of historical epics, most recently Gladiator. What they failed to remember, as most of these boneheaded studios nearly always tend to, is that you need a script that tells a good story, and everything else gets attached to that.<br/><br/>But they decided to focus on Brad Pitts pecs instead of the richness of the story. The music sometimes, like when Achilles was shown on his island fighting with his cousin, reminded me of a spaghetti western. And all those beautiful people everywhere, geez, made we want to be an ancient Greek. I was truly impressed by everyones perfect manicures. Wolfgang Petersen has had some great accomplishments, as well as few stinkers, but this one has to be the biggest dud of his career.<br/><br/>Better luck next time"
"dac287","8","1","4","18 January 2005"," A Good Solid Epic
","As the title says this is a good solid epic. This is not a great film, but still a fine film.<br/><br/>There are many complaints about this movie, most of which I do not understand. It was not trying to look like ""Clash of the Titans"" or ""Hercules"" the TV series. It tried to take a very stylized but ""real world"" approach. That meant gritty and gory violence, but a very epic and ""Old School Hollywood"" feel.<br/><br/>Now it was not as good as some of the movies of old it emulated (Ben Hur and Sparticus for examples) but it was still very good and better than this year's other swords and sandals epic, Alexander. In favor of a strong narrative, and not to turn out weak like 2003's mediocre ""Helen of Troy,"" director Wolfgang Petersen and screenwriter David Benioff mercilessly cut through Homer's Illiad. What they came up with was a strong film.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Achilles (Brad Pitt) as the greatest warrior of all time and his battle within his soul for peace. Yes, he is a glory hog who only fights for himself and his name's immortality (he even chooses a short life with fame over a long life without it), however he tries to amount to something more before his time is spent. He is also the key figure of greedy Greek King Agemmemnon's (Brian Cox) assault on the nation of Troy. This is a retaliation to Prince Paris of Troy (Orlando Bloom) stealing Sparta's Queen Helen (Diane Kruger) from the Spartan King, Menalaus (Brendan Gleeson).<br/><br/>What follows is an epic war of blood and loss on both sides. But the heart of the film is the characters. Though this is no character study, and none are extraordinarily deep, each character is interesting in their own regard and worth following. The most tragic being Hector (Eric Bana) who is forced to lead Troy into war because of Paris, Hector's selfish younger brother. He ends up bearing the brunt of Paris's lust when he faces off with an invincible, proud, and vengeful Achilles. Like the city of Troy, Hector bears the brunt of what Paris has done, and faces his (and Troy's) destruction in a tragic ending (which also involves a large wooden horse).<br/><br/>There are some drawbacks in this film. The score is not James Horner's best. Also, Brad Pitt as Achilles leaves something to be desired, yet this is a good old fashioned swords and sandals epic with a great supporting cast including Peter O'Toole as King Priam of Troy and Sean Bean as Greek King Odysseus. This movie may not be thought-provoking like Gladiator, but it is still a very entertaining, powerful, and stunning piece of cinema fluff. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes ancient world war films or a good enjoyable action/light drama movie."

","Watched Troy on DVD last nite, and was thoroughly impressed. Of course, this was just coming off of seeing ""Alexander the (Gay) Great,"" so pretty much any movie I watched after that will seem like an epic film - maybe I should re-watch Gigli now, with new eyes! *cough* Troy features a top-notch cast, including Peter O'Toole (one of my personal favorites.) Brad Pitt shines in his role of Achilles, demonstrating his ability to convey different emotions. I am always impressed by an actor who is able to play more than one type of role. Within Troy, you see Achilles the warrior, but also Achilles the loyal lover. You see him ruthlessly waste a whole Trojan battalion, but demonstrate compassion in sparing a man's life because he has a son.<br/><br/>In summary: Troy features excellent cinematography, a stirring soundtrack led by James Horner, a gripping plot, and a heart-wrenching, yet satisfying conclusion. Definitely worth watching - my rating: 8 of 10 stars."

","The previews made this seem a (yawn) CGI special effects movie, but instead it narrows its focus to concentrate on various relationships against the background of war: brothers, cousins, lovers, parents, friends. Some of the dialogue is beautifully poetic, and the sets and costumes are stunning. A short documentary on the DVD made me appreciate the group battle scenes.<br/><br/>It's been DECADES since I read a Cliff's Notes Iliad (our class had to read the Odyssey instead) and so the ending had me scratching my head because it didn't match what I thought had happened. Lo and behold, artistic license was taken with the fates of some major characters, but it was done to add to the completeness of the movie and create a satisfying whole.<br/><br/>I'm a big Brad Pitt fan, but will admit that in some scenes he seems to be sleeping his way through. (That's okay; I can watch him sleep for hours.) In others, though, he does extremely well, and his battles (without stunt doubles) are spectacular. But it is Eric Bana, Sean Bean and Peter O'Toole who outshine everyone else.<br/><br/>Iliad purists may rant, but this movie is sending me to reread (or read without Cliff's Notes) the original material.

""Troy focuses more on Troy's point of view and makes the Greeks look like the bad guys. This is not historically correct. Although the film is entertaining it lacks major film musts. There are endless scenes of action sequences in which unbelievable Hollywood stunts are preformed. There is no character development whatsoever creating me to feel nothing for any of the characters.

","For those who had no difficulty believing that an underground organization focused on overthrowing oppression would want/need Keanu Reeves' MIND to save the world, ""Troy"" will overwhelm you in much the same manner as shiny new bling-blings at the mall.<br/><br/>It would be amusing to comment on the enormous number of ""reviewers"" here who readily admit to never having read Homer's ""Iliad."" It stops being funny when it's clear that the film did not merely leave them uninspired to do so, they're rather proud of having no intention of reading it.<br/><br/>When it comes to writing about movies, if you're going walk that walk and talk that talk, sooner or later you're going to be asked to know what you're writing about. When that happens, it's not a good defense to cite that since the director of ""Troy"" obviously didn't read much of the original material or understand it very well, why should you?<br/><br/>""Troy"" trivializes mythology the way Disney trivialized ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" It's an epic all right; all the money spent is there to be seen. But what was it for? So you could look at Brad Pitt's impression of Tom Cruise's acting style? (He should have chosen a better example for himself than the old ""Cut to shot of Pitt shaking his hair; medium shot of Pitt posing heroically; cut to close up of Pitt looking far off, deep in thought."" You can piece together a performance out of that confetti, and it makes less demands on someone with presence but not much else.)<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole, Julie Christie, and a host of good actors show up threatening to bring some class to the proceedings, but the makers of ""Troy"" were even less interested in class than they were in depicting the essence of ""The Iliad,"" which, after all, laments the waste of lives during war and asks us to reflect on our notions of heroes.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is blonde and athletic again in this picture, but he doesn't possess the spirit of what makes a hero. He's just the rough ""good guy,"" Achilles dumbed-down for the I-hate-to-read crowd so they won't have trouble figuring out for whom they're supposed to root. Diane Kruger's Helen is comely and since she's one of the five or six only women around town we are less likely to wonder why she's such a catch.<br/><br/>""Troy"" is like an expensive Steve Reeves movie where the dubbing was synchronized.<br/><br/>Having said that, there does remain one truly thought-provoking element of ""Troy"" and that is how the film makers could manage to expose square miles of naked male flesh so often but omit every homosexual overtone or reference in an ancient Greek myth. Now THAT is something to ponder."

And why not end the movie with a voice-over telling us what happened AFTER Troy fell, to put the story in  its historical context. This was another wasted opportunity.

The only reason I gave a 3 to the film was Eric Bana as Hector. I also was quite disappointed that all of the mystical background was left out : the Iliad is as much a story of gods than of humans and with modern effects this could have given some depth to a film that otherwise consists of a series of battles with some acting in between."

The armies were OK although the sound of the marching was not even close to the actual scene were extras were plodding their way to the castle walls. No blood to be seen on Pitt after 3-4 arrows pierced his leather suit fired by the nancy boy who couldn't act to save his life.<br/><br/>I was full of hope only to be let down.

Orlando Bloom was his usual wooden self, and Peter O'Toole could think of nothing better to do than simply bulge his eyes. Passable showings from Cox and Bana could not rescue the flick. A total lack of character development made me utterly ambivalent about the outcomes to any of the protagonists.<br/><br/>Could it have been any more transparent that the producers simply aimed for Lord of the Rings IV/Braveheart II with a touch of Pitt-perving thrown in? The musical direction was almost identical, the casts simply a merger, though here the battle scenes and choreography were totally uninspiring.

Eric Bana and Brian Cox share a bit of that load giving powerful performances.<br/><br/>Also in my opinion the climax of the film is the scene where Achilles calls for Hector and the thereafter fight between them, a scene that has created cinematic history as the atmosphere created is nerve tangling making the viewer think that he is actually there. Pure good job done there!!!<br/><br/>The films has a few drawbacks as it tries to tell a story that would make a multi-episode TV series in just over 2 hours and some deviation are made from the book Iliad which are deemed necessary.<br/><br/>Its drawbacks however are not enough to overshadow its greatness so unreservedly I will give Troy a 10/10."

Peterson offers some of modern cinema's most spectacularly photographed battle scenes with the unreal flyovers and other various techniques used when creating the thousands of soldiers do battle, but somehow manages to drown out the amazing characters covered in this material taken from The Iliad. Surprisingly the much criticized Brad Pitt in the role of the worlds greatest warrior, Achilles, holds well, with his darkly sensual performance overriding any believability coming from such a small frame and pretty face. Other main characters also blend in well with the roles they were cast in, even the usually laughable Orlando Bloom had the perfect lover-boy/wuss role at his disposal so as to not completely shatter the involvement of the viewer trying to take this questionable cast seriously. Overall, Troy was an awesome sight to behold that lives up to the historical weight thrust upon this battle, although not without compromising some of the more character driven material in favor of wide-eyed, though repetitious battle scenes."

No one else knew how to dance. <br/><br/>The only other oddly distinguished battle character was a grizzly large guy, with a long handled hammer as his weapon, that I supposed to be Hercules.<br/><br/>The music was unsteady and often needlessly schmaltzy.<br/><br/>Overall this film, despite having come from brilliant source, is entirely uninspired except for Brad Pitt's dancing."
"emnizzle_18","4","1","5","30 July 2006"," Snore!!!!!
","Okay, sorry to disagree with those willing to be blinded by the flash of this movie, but I just tend to like movies that have plot...maybe that's just me. I guess everyone who said that Troy was the best movie of the year only saw one movie this year- it is not epic and not worth owning.<br/><br/>Okay, so this Titanic-wannabe tries way too hard to be something grand and memorable. There is not near enough plot to sustain this movie for 3 hours. I was so bored and had to make myself try to stay awake during it. When I saw it in my hometown theater, there were 2 intermissions- which probably saved my back from crippling pain. I lost my entire night to this snoozer, and I'm very bitter about it. <br/><br/>The movie was fantastic visually- the scenery and cinematography was nothing short of amazing. However it was lacking in storyline- something I generally appreciate. Orlando Bloom proves himself to be pretty but very lame, and Brad Pitt proves to be his usual stone faced, buff acting. I was left very unsatisfied at this ""masterpiece"". <br/><br/>I guess this is a good movie for a day when you seriously have nothing to do for quite a while, and are trying to take a nap."
"Slack_Er","5","1","5","22 December 2005"," The problem with ""Troy"" is that the dudes are better looking than Helen of Troy
","You know you have problems when the actress picked to play the most beautiful woman in the history of the world is probably only the third comeliest person on the set. I read that the director originally wanted to make Helen of Troy an unseen character. Brilliant idea! Calling someone the ""most beautiful woman ever"" is a concept that works great on paper but falls flat on its face in a motion picture no matter which actress you cast. So anyhow, seeing as it was a genius notion, naturally the studio trashed the idea. That should have been a warning sign to everyone that this movie wasn't going to work. Another red flag should have been the decision to cast Brad Pitt as the supposed renegade Achilles who commands vicious armies, yet the guy looks like he hasn't been in a fight in his life. At least Orlando Bloom is cast as the wimpy androgynous prince. And what exactly is the point of this movie anyways? It begins with a background narration about how men have always desired to perform brave feats that keep them in the history books, followed by Eric Bana's character preaching to his little brother how he thinks too much of idealistic fantasy, not reality, when it comes to war. Meanwhile, you the viewer, wonder if the writers, actors and filmmakers of this ""epic"" have even set one foot in a boot camp of today's modern army because of their starry-eyed view of war. If you're going with the huge CGI-enhanced battles, grab ""Lord of the Rings."" If you're up for compelling ancient history, check out ""Gladiator."" This movie should be one of those flicks you randomly catch on HBO, and nothing else."
"nifelhem","5","1","5","9 October 2005"," I want a Greek as Achilles!
","Even if the movie was a bit too long, it was quite entertaining. The fighting scenes were awesome, especially the man to man combat scenes. The director did a good job with the mythological elements; removing the gods and turning the myth into history. For example: Achilles is pulling out all the arrows but not the one in his heel, and that explaining why everyone thought he was immortal anywhere else. That's cool! And that's what saves this movie, that you actually can believe this happened once. That it isn't just entirely fiction. Hell, it COULD even been a GOOD movie, had it not been for one particular actor: Brad Pitt. I have no problem with any other role, Hector is VERY good in fact, but Brad Pitt is simply WRONG! He has'nt got enough energy or spirit! It isn't only because his acting, but his appearance also. Look at him, no Greek look like that! He's blond, and so is Helen of Sparta!! It is horrible that the two most beautiful and godlike characters in the movie has to be blondes. I don't know why, I'm blond so I should be flattered, but instead it makes me sick! I'm glad Orlando Bloom got a supporting role, because he hasn't got the experience to play a major role. He does his part very well in fact. I enjoyed his fight with Gleeson, I think it was the best part in the movie! Another character that I felt wrong was Sean Bean as Odysseus. I don't understand!!!!..there must be lots of great Greek, Turkish or Macedonian actors, but instead they take actors that Pitt or Bean, that does not look Greek at all! The movie does not feel genuine or real if the actors can't fit into the environment. But i guess that's the only way to get teenage girls to a movie like this, is'nt it? YUCK!"
"mib456","6","1","5","12 July 2005"," What's wrong with the original myth?
","I really do not understand why Hollywood felt the need to change the story of the Trojan War, to make it more and at the same time, less tragic? What is wrong with making an EPIC war, last an EPIC time span? Why have Achilles live past where he did in the myth? Why did he need to survive the FATAL Achilles heel shot, long enough to die as all leading men die? For a movie, based on nothing, Troy is not too bad, but as a movie based on a centuries old myth, it pretty much stunk. And we wonder why our kids are failing in the schools? Because a lot of them base their studying on what they get from movies and TV shows, instead of books."

","I'm a graduate student of Economics. I love action and drama movies as much as other kinds. I chose Troy to view for the night and sleep well. Great cast, good director, expensive film makers, all the best thing that I consider. All baseless and not exiting.<br/><br/>Based on the decisions made by King of Troy attacking Greeks when they already retreated and gave up it made the King of Troy who is for the good of the people a bad personality. Achilles decision deciding to fight with Hector was baseless. A man with integrity and wisdom just don't fight because he killed his beloved cousin which Achilles new it was an accident that Hector thought it was him. Their decisions of attacking Troy in the end part after 12 days were baseless. Achilles turns out to be a bad person because for the fact he admires the king of Troy and join them in destroying Troy. I had to stop continuing the movie from climax since it is frustrating. I became upset that all good men had to die because of baseless decisions."

It is not a movie to see if you don't like action and romance films. Brad Pitt really did a great job as Achiles, his acting was one of the best I have seen him do, he really must of have been training for month to get that control of the sword and that ""great"" body. This movie might not be as pleasant to you if you don't like a 90% action movie and 10% drama movie. But if you go rent a movie and you see that troy is available then i really recommend it."

To me it was just Hollywood heart-throbs packed in a historical film. <br/><br/>It starred Brad Pitt as the legendary warrior Achilles (man, did he work out for this role!), that newly tight muscular body, you may wonder why many girls came to watch the film. He acted well Brad Pitt, this might earn him an Oscar nomination. Keep dreaming mate!<br/><br/>Eric Bana definitely cannot take on serious roles, because when I was in the cinema with my sister, we kept remembering his days as a comedian and couldn't help laughing because he was trying so hard to be a good actor. His portrayal of Prince Hector was brilliant no doubt despite my continuous giggling during the film.<br/><br/>Prince Paris played by (old-school honey)Orlando Bloom. He is a little boy in compared to the acting skills of Brad Pitt and Eric Bana combined and for a treat we even got a reference to the character Legolas from ""Lord of the Rings"". Because Paris uses a bow and arrow.<br/><br/>There was one scene I wanted to be the best, but it was only seconds long. The supposed love scene between Briseis (Byrne) and Achilles (Pitt), my only criticism is that it could have been longer and even more steamy.<br/><br/>Anything else? Well I recently bought the DVD and there's nothing much on it to satisfy any movie nerd's desire. But they did have a hall of Greek Mythlogy where you can learn about the Gods.<br/><br/>To end off, what was wrong with it? Despite millions of dollars down the toilet and not enough to focus on, mainly that it was plain overrated.<br/><br/>Well if you're a big fan of Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom, go and watch it. <br/><br/>Thank you"

","This movie is so bad that I kept looking for the little guys at the bottom of the screen, for I was sure I was watching an episode of ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"".<br/><br/>I cannot begin to describe everything that is wrong with this film. Others have already done so many times over. Please read Roger Ebert's review - he nails it on the head but is still much too kind. This movie is boring, too long, and has virtually no redeeming qualities. <br/><br/>I NEVER walk out of movies, no matter how bad they are. Last night, while watching ""Troy"", I was tempted. In fact, the desperation, confusion, and uncertainty in my trying to decide whether to leave at about the 45-minute mark was more moving and involving than anything in the film! Alas, I stayed, and hence lost 2:40 of my life and $7 of my money (I used a pass).<br/><br/>Never mind whether ancient Greeks should be introspective (although if you believe in anything Julian Jaynes said, they probably even COULDN'T do so), this entire production was a waste of time. I can't even imagine anyone watching the dailies and thinking, ""yes, that's good"". This movie makes ""Gladiator"" look like the best movie ever made, simply because it succeeded in bringing an ancient civilization to life. After watching ""Troy"", you will have no clue as to what life was like in ancient Greece.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Eric Bana do a decent job with what they are given. The young woman playing Achilles' Trojan ""love-slave"" (I forget her name) gives perhaps the only really great performance in this movie. Peter O'Toole thinks that going bug-eyed somehow conveys some emotion, and Julie Christie is virtually unrecognizable. The woman playing Helen of Troy is not nearly beautiful enough and is a terrible actress.<br/><br/>Save your money. Save your time. PLEASE - you are now warned as I was not fortunate enough to be. Rating: 4 out of 10."
"nigelchatfield","4","1","5","1 June 2004"," Lacked vision
","I've just come back from watching ""Troy"" and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't actually much good either.<br/><br/>The whole movie lacked vision in my view - the director (Wolfgang Peterson) seemed a little out of his depth and ill at ease with the material. The movie has a fine cast who unfortunately struggled with a poor script. My wife particularly enjoyed Brad Pitt's performance (for reasons other than his vocal delivery) while other good performances came from Peter O'Toole, Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Eric Bana, excellent in the role of Hector.<br/><br/>After the movie, I couldn't help but think another director (an obvious choice would be Peter Jackson) could have done so much better. I also found the CGI tiresome - whereas techniques have improved, CGI for my money still looks like CGI. The sweeping shots of computer generated armies and battlefleets were not impressive and added little to the movie. For students of Greek history, any resemblance to Homer's ""Iliad"" is purely co-incidental.<br/><br/>I'm pleased that I saw the movie - I just wished I'd waited for the DVD."

","If I were given the chance to change a single thing in this movie it would be firing James Horner. As if his reputation had no base. Where is the unwritten rule of all great movie scores, especially the ones from movies of such magnitude - you gotta have a theme brother. Where's the theme in ""Troy"", where's the feeling that something either epic and heroic or evil and malicious is happening on the screen. All we are treated with are female vocals that sound strangely familiar-oh wait, could it be similar to the great score from ""Gladiator"". ""Troy"" doesn't hide similarities with the latter, sadly they only make it look cheaper and without its own soul, but still, if they copied elements why not copy them right. In this aspect ""Troy"" is very much inferior to Scott's Oscar winner, it lacks in the actor's performances(only the two kings show the stuff that great actors are made of-kudos to Peter O'Toole and especially especially to Brian Cox who singlehandedly made every other actor in his scenes look like a good one, decent at the least), visual effects, cinematography, the works. It has nothing going for it that will satisfy a movie freak like me. Sure, those 3 hours went by pretty quickly, and Orlando Bloom even showed some hints of acting in him(the boy is truly awful in his scenes with Helena), Brad Pitt managed to make his hair color look authentic for a while, and Eric Bana didn't sound and feel like a Russel Crowe imitator all of the time, but the feeling that ""Troy"" could have been one of the better movies of 2004 remains-sadly!

It takes itself too seriously, and so do people. The Iliad is a difficult read, and people would rather watch this movie. Of course, many classicists can take solace in the idea that they can test their students in some pretty cool ways to see who actually read it.

"odysseus-6","1","1","6","17 May 2004"," woefully lacking, utter rubbish in fact
","Contains Spoilers!!!<br/><br/>firstly i should say that i know the story of the iliad and its associated plays and poems very well. i know the iliad by homer, the aenead by virgil, the orestia by aschylus etc etc. you don't need to know these stories before you see the movie. i am also a fan of gladiator even though i know it's inaccurate and it is just a remake of the fall of the roman empire. that didn't stop me enjoying that movie. <br/><br/>if i was to give troy a grade it would be 5 out of 10 for entertainment value (not as good as gladiator) and it would be 3 out of 10 for its literary and historical value. its treatment of the original stories stink just about as bad as anything i have ever seen. i wish the liberties they took had been in order to inject something greater into what remained, but everything still felt flat and never really took off. it never really ever even approached the level of a masterpiece and that is a real shame.<br/><br/>the battle scenes are without question fantastic, though there are not as many as you would expect, and the special effects are by and large seamless with the actual landscape. the music was very dull and forgetable and the camerwork was for the most part very good. <br/><br/>brad pitt has an amazing body and i think he is an excellent actor but in troy he seemed uncomfortable in the role and that surprised and disappointed me. peter o'toole was an excellent priam and his scene with achilles was tremendous. hector was played by eric bana and he really surprised me. the role of hector is very close to the original, and despite the fact that hector was physically bigger in the stories, eric bana really made up for his lack of stature. he was a wonderful hector. Paris was played by orlando bloom and he played a coward very well indeed, he surprised me too considering. the lady playing helen i don't remember but i didn't find her either very attractive or very good and she doesn't even appear a the end of the film, she's lost from the story completely! sean bean who i usually don't like played one of my favorite Greek characters, the wily odysseus he was okay. vigo mortensen is the prefect odysseus, but bean also surprised me. the man playing menelaus was completely miscast, but on purpose it seems, and agammemnon was good. <br/><br/>the movie starts with agammemnon at war with thessaly and achilles fights under his flag and wins a duel with thessaely's best. this sets up that achilles hates agammemnon who is a war monger, it's a love hate relationship true to the spirit of the original. since it's ironic considering achilles is the best warrior and lives for battle. achilles wins and Greece is united for the first time. this is not historically accurate, Greece was never united as such, but it will do for the movie in place of complicated explanations. <br/><br/>then we go to a peace banquet at argos which in the movie they call sparta since it's the same place. the banquet is between king menelaus and his wife helen and Paris representing troy with his brother hector. this is the first deviation from the original because before it was aeneas, who was second to hector as a Trojan general and went on to found ancient rome. but in this movie he doesn't appear except for one line at the end, and Paris doesn't even know him, odd for the cousin of king priam! <br/><br/>Paris woos helen, hector covers for him, and when they leave, helen is smuggled out because she doesn't love her husband. i should say here that is all wrong too. originally menelaus was called away to his grandfather's funeral on crete, and Paris and aeneas then looted menelaus's vaults and took women (plural) as a prize. menelaus was also young and had been chosen by helen herself and after the Trojan war they got back together and had other adventures, but in this movie menelaus is a fat old bully. this makes the Trojans look better i suppose but it's a distortion and not a pleasing one. <br/><br/>so agammenon decides this is the perfect excuse to go to war to get troy for himself. however, if you have ever read herodotus you will know that the greeks had been undergoing many attacks for decades and the in actual fact this was the first time in history that the greeks collectively had had enough and decided to fight back! so that is all wrong.<br/><br/>the greeks go to troy once odysseus has convinced achilles to fight, that was a good scene, with achilles practicing fighting with his (now cousin) patroclus. patroclus's treatment in the film mirrors the motives in the original so it was fairly entertaining. patroclus comes with him and wants to fight but is not ready. <br/><br/>the greeks arrive at troy and a ferocious battle takes place and a priestess is taken captive, trophy for achilles. this is all greatly condensed but done very well and is very exciting. we meet ajax who is known as the equal of achilles. in the original ajax after all the years of war goes mad when his friend achilles is killed and commits suicide. in this film he barely know achilles and is killed by hector in the first few minutes! ajax was the character with the soul but in this he's a big oaf. that disappointed me greatly but there was more to come. <br/><br/>in the original the greeks decalre that troy can save themselves if menelaus has a duel with Paris, but Paris is pressed into fighting bby hector who is furiosu for his brother starting this war, and Paris is a coward. in the movie it is Paris who asks for the duel, and again he acts like a coward and tries to run away halfway through. but because it is him who asked for the fight it makes the Trojans look nobel again when they're not! menelaus goes after Paris, and now hector kills him! so menelaus who for three thousand years has always got his wife back, now doesn't! this is so stupid and also forgets that it was a nervous Trojan archer called panadarus who fires out of nerves that starts the next battle. <br/><br/>the greeks take a pounding which is very exciting and they must retreat. the Trojans breathe a sigh of relief and at dawn they attack and try to burn the ships (with bizarre flaming balls, i don't know where they got that idea from) achilles refuses to fight for agammemon so patroculs wears achilles armor into battle and hector kills him, this sends achilles into a frenzy and the most gripping duel takes place between achilles and hector and he drags hector's dead body around in the dirt. this part of the movie is more or less just like the original and is the best part because this is the only part of the movie that seems to work for everyone in the audience.<br/><br/>what is missing completely however is the sense of futility that occurred during the Trojan war. in the originals, every time the greeks thought they had won, more reinforcements would arrive to help troy. amazon warrior women and the black memnon with his ethiopean forces, but this is all completely missing. in the film instead cuts to the end of the story, priam rightly gets hector's body back from achilles, and achilles grants him 12 days for funeral games, but now the film does its own story again and the greeks use this excuse to build the horse as an offering to the gods for their ruse.<br/><br/>in the original odysseus had managed to get inside troy and desecrated their temple to pallas-athena, a horse called the pilladium. the Trojan horse was built as a fake apology to the god for their safe trip home. in the film it's an offering to poseidon. it makes no odds, but it's annoying.<br/><br/>anyway the greeks get in and torch the city, but agamemmnon, who in the original went home and was murdered by his wife ina fantastic play, in this film gets killed! Paris does kill achilles with arrows, but who knows if he goes off with helen, she disappears completely from the story.<br/><br/>with the story annoyances to one side, i did not like how the film was directed or written, many parts had very hammy dialogue and the way it was directed was very cheesy, gladiator dealt with the cheese much better than this film does. i did like the battle scenes they were excellent, but it was very obvious that many of the actors also had problems with the cheesy parts. <br/><br/>i had other problems with the movie too. for example coins being put on the eyes of the people on their funeral pyres - when coins had not been invented yet! the fact that 10 years of war felt like 4 days. the total absensce of cassandra.<br/><br/>some below commented that this was the most gorgeously precise version they had ever seen. frankly they're either on crack or are the illiterate schmuck who wrote this pathetic twaddle.<br/><br/>finally, whatever you do if you're studying this in class don't use this film as reference. you will fail."
"Spanner-2","4","1","6","17 May 2004"," A mixed bag
","Big budget epic from Wolfgang Peterson (""The perfect Storm"") that translates the Greek tale of the Trojan War into a Hollywood Action film. And the battles are in fact, terrific. Some great fight scenes make the film really kick at times... which is good cause when the fighting stops and the dialogue creeps in.. things go mediocre pretty fast. Brad Pitt plays Achilles, but he seems to be channeling Fabio in his performance.. all preening and posing.. with the most leaden line reads in the whole cast. Pitt seems very uninterested in his work, he has done much better stuff before, but here he is so leaden and dull that you want him to get killed off almost at once.. Eric Bana, who was dreadful in ""The Hulk"" plays Hector, the Trojan hero.. and he probably comes off best in the film. Bana is the only actor in the film who gives a watchable performance.. He radiates the charisma that a leader of his stature should have, and when he is on screen the character scenes work.. Unfortunately, too much time is taken up with Pitt's weirdly homoerotic relationship with his cousin and assorted other dumb plots. Orlando Bloom does what he can with the character of Paris, kindof a playboy prince who starts the conflict by stealing the Queen of Sparta (a bland Diane Krueger) and then becomes a sniveling wimp till the end.. but its such an unglamorous part that you feel sorry for him.. Sean Bean shows up as Odysseus, but his character is given short shrift, odd for such an important figure in Greek Mythology. Again, the film is watchable and even enjoyable because of some great battles and Bana's work... but tune out quickly whenever Pitt starts talking to anyone... his dialogue is terrible and his performance so wooden you could splinter it...

","Not only is this movie not true to the Iliad, which is forgivable, it is a horrible film technically as well. Troy is some of the most atrocious editing and cinematography I've ever seen in a major motion picture. My theory is that the writer(s) wanted to write an atheist and pro-Trojan take on the Trojan War. This goal is admirable and in and of itself is a fine task. It would be like writing the Passion of the Christ through Judas' eyes- different and intriguing. The director/producer team, however, must have missed that and tried simply to make a popcorn movie out of what could have been a great film. What was with all of the slow motion cuts and jarring zooms? Why was the editing so ridiculously spotty? And please tell me how it is that Achilles could spar with his ""cousin"" at the ruins at Delphi if the Trojan War took place when those ruins would have been a completed temple? Did no one see that glaring mistake? Ridiculous. This movie is sloppy at best and anyone giving it a rating of anything over a 3 out of 10 has obviously much lower standards for what should have been one of the defining epics of our time, along with films like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy or Saving Private Ryan. Seriously, aside from Eric Bana and Brian Cox, this movie has absolutely no value to anyone more than a simple popcorn movie with beautiful people to look at for two hours."

","It is utterly dishonest to associate this film in any way with Homer's far more interesting Iliad.<br/><br/>It's not just a question of the sequence of events, or the fate of the characters, or plot, being completely different... it is - like so many other Hollywood films of this last decade - just crude empire propaganda built to buttress the beliefs of the American Public with ""a bit of history"". Watch how the ""self-sacrifice"" plot develops and ask yourself, how many times have I seen this before in recent films? Besides the moronic philosophy the film really struggles with hamfisted cinematography - poor pacing, and really tedious fighting 'n' f*&king scenes."
"TheFluffyKnight","3","1","7","11 August 2008"," Troy
","Troy is essentially two and a half hours of burly men harping on about how their actions will ensure that their names are remembered for millennia. Which is ironic, because for all the characters' talk about the immortality of fame, the film's sheer mediocrity ensures that it will be remembered little beyond the end credits.<br/><br/>The plot is common knowledge, so I'll be brief. Paris (Orlando Bloom), son of Priam, king of Troy (Peter O'Toole), kidnaps Helen (Diane Kruger), wife of Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), king of Sparta. So Menelaus' brother, Agamemnon (Brian Cox) unites all of Greece and lays siege to Troy. During the siege, a rivalry develops between Hector (Eric Bana), Troy's best warrior, and Achilles (Brad Pitt), the greatest warrior in the world. Ever.<br/><br/>The primary source for all of this is, of course, the Iliad, Homer's ancient epic poem that uses the Trojan war as a vehicle for the exploration of honour, camaraderie, grief, and compassion. All of which director Wolfgang Petersen and writer David Benioff decided they could ignore, in favour of the aforementioned drivel about immortality.<br/><br/>The best example of this complete misinterpretation of the Iliad is Troy's seeming inability to decide which side, the Greeks or the Trojans, is most deserving of our sympathy. While Homer's poem shows great compassion for both armies, Petersen's film abandons this idea, instead making the Greeks war-hungry oafs, the Trojans cowardly layabouts erroneously defending Orlando Bloom, and both sides utterly unworthy of our support.<br/><br/>This isn't helped by the level of acting present. None of the performances are bad, per se; but none of the actors manage to infuse their characters with the kind of humanity needed to engage the audience. The only actor who come close is Peter O'Toole as King Priam, but he is so underused he never gets a chance to develop the character.<br/><br/>Also missing are the Greek gods, whose intervention was the driving force behind the events of the Iliad. Leaving them out probably made sense in the script meetings; the days when Lawrence Olivier could put on a bed sheet and declare himself Zeus are gone. But in the Iliad, the gods weren't just childish super beings. They were symbols, metaphors for different aspects of human nature. When Ares, the god of bloody slaughter, would join the Trojans in battle, it signified that they were overcome by an insatiable blood lust. When Athena, goddess of heroic valour, descended into the Greek ranks, we know they are fighting with honour. Without these symbols, the battles of Troy are empty and meaningless.<br/><br/>They don't even look that good. Sure, the CGI is impressive, but what CGI isn't these days? Cinema has become so saturated with hordes of computer generated warriors hacking each other to pieces that not even ""the largest army the world has ever seen"", as one character probably boasts, can truly excite audiences any more.<br/><br/>Troy is the epitome of Hollywood's recent spate of blockbuster epics; it is bland, empty, meaningless, and any other word you might find in a thesaurus under ""dull"". We can't even enjoy the end credits, that final release from a bad film, because there's an awful, awful song."
"Vanntab","3","1","7","28 December 2005"," Tripe would be more accurate
","Quite frankly, this movie should have used its computer graphics team to drop a nuke on the whole thing; it would have been far more entertaining. I was brave enough to let the insulting butchering of the Iliad myth go to look for something worthwhile, but, much like this film, it was a frivolous and doomed undertaking.<br/><br/>My cynicism seemed endless when trying to critique this film nicely. From a seemingly uninspired cast to plodding character development, there was not much room for enjoyment. The mix of cliché American heroism and a stubbornness to acknowledge cultures, aside from the odd American with British accent culture Hollywood seems to fancy, left me wondering when the fascist Hitler would appear on screen and be usurped by Achilles, apparently champion of all things egalitarian. Thankfully, that never happened, so I guess that results in a one star rating.<br/><br/>Of course the eye-candy ever present in the film was enough to captivate those of the straight female and gay male persuasion, I would rather watch an episode of WWE Monday Night Raw if I wanted to see oiled up hard bodies in limited clothing (at least their acting is somewhat believable, and characters interesting.) So, since this review is less for me, and more for readers, there is another star.<br/><br/>Of course there have been movies further down in the Hollywood waste basket than this, gaining the film one more star. All in all, if you enjoy rummaging around in garbage, you will love this film. If not, watch Braveheart instead, at least they can differentiate Scottish from British from Irish."
"moviewatcher417","3","1","7","10 November 2005"," War epic+Soap Opera Dialoge=Movie not easy to swallow
","**Some Spoilers** I really wanted to like this film and that's how I went into it. I came out trying to figure out what the heck I just watched. This movie was like the lovechild of Gladiator and Beverly Hills 90210. It suffers from bad dialog and too much butchery of the original epic. I understand the need to make changes when you are making a movie out of something like the Iliad. But whoever wrote the screenplay for this went too far. There were some good parts to it, which kept me from fleeing the theater. 1. Sean Bean-One of Hollywood's most underrated talents, Sean shines as Odysseus. At least, the writers were smart enough to give him some of the best lines.<br/><br/>2. Eric Bana-He is perfect as Hector a loyal and tragic hero.<br/><br/>3. The fighting-There were some really good fight scenes in this film, some of them on par with the battles in Lord of the Rings. However, that is the only thing about this film that even comes close to touching any film in that series.<br/><br/>Now, for the bad points.<br/><br/>1. Helen-This character had some of the most vomit-inducing lines I have ever seen. What is this, a Greek war film or a Soap Opera? Her husband insists that he wants to kill her. I can't say I blame him. After listening to her talk for about five minutes, I want her dead too. I do not blame Helen Kruger for this and I hope she gets another chance to shine. I blame whoever gave her these lines and made her play such an annoying character. Are we supposed to believe that this is the woman that two nations go to war over? Sorry, no sale.<br/><br/>2. Brad Pitt-I don't know how much Brad got for this movie, but someone should see about getting that money back. As far as acting for tough guys goes, Pitt did a better job in Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Here, he plays a self-centered jackass with pecs and that's it.<br/><br/>3. Orlando Bloom-Without giving away too much, I suspect most of the changes from the Iliad in this movie were made to suit Bloom's fans. If that's the case, then Orlando should not have been cast as Paris, because Paris is a very hate-able character, both in the movie as well as the poem. That is why what happens to him at the end is so hard to swallow. He lives! And gets away with Helen, the other annoying character. If the script writers wanted to change something, they should have had Hector live. <br/><br/>Bottom line-This movie is only a shadow of Lord of the Rings. Watch this only if you are really bored and have a high tolerance for bad dialog. Bana and Bean fans might like it if they skip certain parts."

Achilles is supposed to die-that's one of the most famous deaths. Though Greek mythology is questionable- they should at least mention the Golden Apple, since that's the whole reason Paris goes after Helen in the first place. I thought the acting was horribly cheesy and the plot was too all over jumpy. And if someone's comment is going to be the spokesperson for the movie-they should at least spell the lead character correctly(Achilles!) That's all I have to vent about now. Thank you!"

I was very impressed with Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom. They were great choices for their characters since Brad appears serious and muscular and Orlando appears young and timid. The other actors/actresses were remarkable as well.<br/><br/>One thing I do not understand is how I can feel so much sympathy for Achilles in the end, even though I do not like his behavior/attitude throughout the movie.

","An epic film with great battles, nice costumes, camera, effects etc. but so shallow. It's a shame when uneducated people are writing scripts and making films. Homer won't be sleeping well in his grave anymore. When I was a high school pupil they were teaching us that Agamemnon didn't kill Priam and wasn't killed by a girl called Briseis?, that Priam jumped off Troy's walls, Achilles wasn't inside the Dureian Horse, Agamemnon took Helen back to Greece and there was killed by his wife Clytemnistra. They were also teaching us that Hector didn't kill Menelaus and that Paris when he killed Achilles, was dragging his body with his chariot for three days outside Troy to bring fear to Greeks. And oh my God, names like Boagrius, Tecton, Glaucus, Velior not only they are not ancient Greek names but they look like that came straight out of 'Xena' or 'Hercules against the Incas'. The result is at least laughable. It's a shame to spend almost $200 million and make a film like that, with no particular reason to change the story. After wasting 2 1/2 hours and £10 in the cinema, watching Troy, I start wondering that maybe my teachers in school were ignorant and uneducated.

","This is easily one of the worst movies of the year.<br/><br/>Troy was an absolute joke. It is completely inaccurate and has some of the worst acting I have ever seen from both Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom.<br/><br/>Just about everything was wrong with this movie. Let's start with the inaccuracy. Achilles dies in battle as soon as he kills Hector by an arrow shot by Paris. One Arrow. Not some sappy love story with a peasant girl at the end when Troy is being raided. And certainly not by five arrows. One arrow to the ankle is all it should have taken. But no, the director had to put an additional four in his chest. Agamemnon was killed after the Trojan war, not during.<br/><br/>The script is awful, delivered by an unbelievably fake cast. Brad Pitt complicates the role of Achilles, making him less believable as a legend. Lines like, ""How about a king that fights his own battles, wouldn't that be a sight"", and, ""Be careful, king of kings, first you need the victory"", are so poorly delivered we cannot help but laugh.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom do some of their worst work in this movie. I didn't for a second believe Bloom as Paris and just couldn't stop laughing at Pitt's unevocative dialogue. Just listen as Achilles rides up to the wall of Troy and calls out for Hector so he can fight him, ""HECTOR!"". Over and over we hear him shout. Even in the background while Hector bids farewell to his family.<br/><br/>There's a scene of particular dreadfulness that I would like to point out: when the armies of Greece are on the beach and begin marching up to the walls of Troy for a massive battle scene. In Braveheart, Mel Gibson filmed the perfect English army gathering that made us fear for the Scots. That lasted about 50 seconds and was one of the best moments in the film history. Here, Wolfgang Peterson, isn't satisfied with 50 sec. but goes for 3 min and 45 sec, which any movie buff knows feels like an eternity in the theater. I guess Peterson wanted to hopelessly bore so we would forget about how bad the movie is.<br/><br/>There is one good thing about Troy. And that would be the action scenes. That is the only reason this movie gets a 4 out of 10. The choreography was amazing, especially in Hector and Achilles' big fight. However, that is not enough to redeem a movie."

The other disappointing thing is that there are some genuinely good efforts wasted here - the special effects are really well done, and both Eric Bana and Sean Bean give good accounts of themselves in light of their material.Amongst the other performances, Peter O'Toole's presence as Priam only serves to remind us of what epics are capable when done well. Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom are insipid, flat and downright annoying, and Brian Cox is one-dimensional, but their characters are written that way. They never had a chance.

","Really, it could of done better. The plot was, well, so different from the history that it was almost stupid. First of all, the Greeks and the Trojans wouldn't be making peace, because they are already at peace. Helen's room would of been a lot more elaborately furnished, and a lot bigger. I mean, she is the wife of the brother of one of the most powerful kings of Greece. Why was Achilles portrayed as some adult? He would of been about 15 when he first joined the war, and disguised one of the daughters of Lycomedes of Scyros by his mother, Thetis, who has always been protective of her child, not training his ""younger cousin"". Patroclus was his cousin, and probably his lover, as it was popular among the young men, but Patroclus was older by at least a generation. Strangely the 10 year long war seems only a few weeks, are at most, a month. Then the characters. Achilles wouldn't of sacked the temple of Apollo, after all, he was half god. Menelaus doesn't survive to take his wife home; Ajax the Greater died a far more honorable death than he deserved; there was no plague from Apollo; Briseis was about to kill Achilles, when they end up having sex; Patroclus steals armor rather than loaning it; and Agamemnon doesn't survive to get killed by his wife. And another thing. My brother asked me why Achilles died from the arrow in his heel. They should of explained that part, because I don't expect all movie goers are history freaks.

"Anonymous_Maxine","Null","1","8","24 June 2004"," Brad Pitt, ladies and gentlemen, is FORTY YEARS OLD.
","Brad Pitt was miscast, blah blah blah, whatever. Every time Brad Pitt appears in a movie, it seems like there's a whole hoard of movie reviewers and critics who frantically scramble to their keyboards, desperate to be the first person to claim that he was miscast. YAWN. Yes, there are scenes that Pitt's iconography prevented from being as effective as they should have been. One of the more dramatic scenes in the movie, for example, is when Hector's (Eric Bana) cousin, Briseis, is speaking to Achilles just after he has saved her from being beaten and branded and raped by the soldiers of Agamemnon's army. She tells him that she's known men like him her whole life, but Achilles understands that he's different, and responds simply, 'No, you haven't.' This, oddly enough, actually works better here in writing than it does in Pitt's delivery, but it hardly means he was miscast. Maybe if he hadn't been chewing while he spoke, the line would have been more effective. <br/><br/>As always, I find it pretty interesting to chronicle roughly how closely the movie adheres to its literary source, although in this case it's at least as interesting to read about how other people follow this. Some people get pretty offended. I've read critics who were offended by the chronology (in Homer's The Iliad, for example, the Greeks do not respond militarily to Paris taking Helen for about a decade), by things that were or were not in the original story (like Achilles' introduction into the movie, where he kills Boagrius), and even by the spelling of certain names (which I won't go into, since the names are ancient, products of a language that is all but dead). Roger Ebert, for example, cites many things that were changed in his review of the movie (which, by the way, was nakedly plagiarized by Michael Savage on his radio show a few days after Ebert published it online).<br/><br/>I roughly take these things into account when analyzing the movie, but I'm certainly more interested in the way the story as a whole is delivered. Being a Hollywood movie, Troy is certainly subject to all of the pitfalls that so often plague big-budget films, and I have a theory that many of these problems are the result of studio executives pulling strings and changing stories in order to obtain a rating that will attract the largest possible audience. The problem is that there are just some movies that should not be compromised in order to avoid an R rating. As you may have noticed, Troy did not escape that fate, and it's a good thing, too. Imagine what Braveheart would have been like had it been softened for a PG-13.<br/><br/>The story is about the revenge of the Greek Menelaus, who is out to seek his revenge and the restoration of his honor by killing Paris, the Trojan who smartly made off with Menelaus' wife while on a peace mission to Greece. Good move, there, Paris. Speaking of which, Orlando Bloom, who delivered spectacular performances in The Lord of the Rings films, overacts his way through the entire movie, even though simple logic should lead you to anticipate all kinds of overacting in a movie like this. I don't know what it was, but there were so many scenes that were almost unwatchable because his acting was so over the top.<br/><br/>Complicating matters is Achilles' cousin Patroclus, who is far more eager for battle than Achilles is, although Achilles' hunger for immortality is unmatched by anyone in the movie. Achilles' entire motivation is to be remembered after his death, not for land or money and certainly not for King Agamemnon, whom he openly detests. In what has to be one of the more striking creative liberties taken from the source material, Achilles is presented as sort of a sulking child at some points, who refuses to fight until he gets an apology even though men are dying by the hundreds. He and his band of loyal fighters wait on the sidelines for the right moment (and reason) to join, while Achilles watches the battle and occasionally mutters tactical advice as though he's watching a football game.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole, the most experienced and accomplished actor in the film by far, delivers an immensely respectable performance as the Trojan king, with a subtle seriousness and devotion that is surprisingly able to transcend the inherent goofiness of the rest of the movie. Now, when I say inherent goofiness, please don't forget that I loved the movie, it's just that it is based on Greek mythology, which ancient Greeks took very seriously, and at the same time is mixed with such modern things like 'Last night was a mistake' and, of course, Brad Pitt, hollering such things as 'Immortality! Take it! It's YOURS!!' O'Toole's performance, however, is so powerful and effective that it's almost like it belongs in another movie, probably an older movie with a more established level of respect. Consider, for example, the single shot of his face as he looks over the ruins of Troy after it has been penetrated by the Trojan horse. The very composition of that shot (to say nothing of how well O'Toole can act with his facial expressions) seems to have been augmented because it is so powerful. This is a truly great actor.<br/><br/>Eric Bana comes out of his role as The Hulk, a decidedly cartoonish but undeniably entertaining comic book movie, and delivers a stunningly convincing performance as Hector, the older and much wiser brother of the man who started the war, not to mention the heir to the Trojan throne. Michael Cox, who has come a long way since he introduced the movie-going world to Hannibal Lecter back in 1986, also delivers an outstanding performance as King Agamemnon, the only bad guy in the entire movie, and delivers some of the least condescending and most successful comedic one-liners that I've seen in a movie in years ('Peace! PEACE!!').<br/><br/>The movie is very much updated for a modern audience, probably most notably in the dialogue portion, although there are some cases where the original language would have just complicated matters more than is necessary. For a movie with such a lengthy running time, Troy is wildly entertaining, although it's ironic that the fight scene between Achilles and Hector was far more dramatic than the full battle scene with thousands of warriors.<br/><br/>(spoilers) There are moments when the movie trips up, like the scene where Hector kills Patroclus, who has dressed up in Achilles' armor so that he can lead his troops into the battle, which Achilles refuses to fight. This scene takes place in the midst of a massive battle, thousands of men are fighting and killing each other, yet when Patroclus is mortally wounded, everyone stops and gathers around to watch, even getting quiet enough to hear Hector murmur, 'That's enough for one day,' upon learning who he had just killed.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is by far my favorite, when the Trojans find the horse on the beach, and one man yells, 'We should burn it!' What a perfect place this would have been to have one of the soldiers inside the horse call out, 'I think we should bring it inside the city!' Thankfully, the movie takes itself more seriously than that, and while Troy displays more than it's share of scenes and situations that are vulnerable to unusually effective smartass remarks (consider, for example, the scene where Achilles mentions the phrase, 'You will never be more lovely than you are right now.' Well, give it a day or two), it is a tremendously entertaining rendition of a Greek classic. Yes, it departed from the source material more than it should have done were it being made as a documentary, but when it's sharing the cineplexes with such trash as White Chicks and The Chronicles of Riddick (which I haven't seen yet, but I saw Pitch Black and therefore have very low expectations), you can't expect the same story that Homer wrote being translated directly onto the screen. Ancient Greece and our modern global society are simply too different for something like that to work.<br/><br/>But complain all you want about Brad Pitt. Someone always will."
"barrydwriter","1","1","8","17 May 2004"," Worst. Movie. Ever.
","I have seen some pretty bad cinematic adaptations before. However, I doubt there could never be a worse adaptation (oh, excuse me, ""inspiration"") of such a perfect piece of literary art than the atrocity known as TROY.<br/><br/>Just about everything in this movie was bad. No, I take that back: EVERYTHING was simply HORRENDOUS. It was simply GARBAGE. Let me explain only a little of what I think...<br/><br/>The characters were mutated to a point that strayed beyond any kind of cliché or stereotype; they became simply dreadful. Achilles became a pompous, over-self-glorifying jerk that seemed to show no emotion other than arrogance. Paris became a little schoolgirl--er, boy--who would rather sit and watch the battle. Agamemnon became an insane, over-the-top, bloodthirsty maniac with the same motivations as our current ""President"" (and not to mention just as annoying). Helen suddenly had a whole blooming romance with Paris the equivalent of yet another attempt at cashing in on poor Shakespeare's famous romance (which will remain anonymous, because what else would I be talking about?). Ajax became a huge muscle-man...and not much more. Odysseus even fell to a similar fate; he became more of a sword-ready fiend rather than the innocent thrust into a war he did not wish to be in. And where was Diomedes? And more importantly, WHERE WERE THE GODS?!<br/><br/>All the armor, ships, and costumes were identical, as if they were manufactured, rather than hand-crafted (which is how it would have been). All of the rooms and houses had such gaudy, Martha Stewart-esque deco and tapestries.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie dragged on forever (I actually checked my watch at one point, only to be sorely disappointed that less than half the movie had elapsed). There was no humor in it whatsoever, and the plot structure was a monotonous pattern of battle-dialogue-battle-dialogue.<br/><br/>How could Wolfgang Petersen and such a fine group of actors and actresses (well...never mind the actresses, actually) create such garbage? David Benioff should be SHOT for his adaptation of the beautiful poem that is recognized everywhere as one of the best and most wonderful pieces of literature ever.<br/><br/>There are so many other things I could rant about with this atrocious movie. Troy was, quite simply, THE worst movie I have EVER had the misfortune of actually spending money on, only to have my visual nerves stimulated (more like raped) from. If you don't believe me, go ahead and see it; perhaps those of us who had the pleasure of reading THE ILLIAD are more biased towards this piece of cinematic garbage, but I will be honestly surprised if anyone other than a little girl of the age of 13 finds this movie to be even remotely entertaining.<br/><br/>Simply put, Troy sucked."

At times resembling an army being ""inspired into battle"" by dialogue that could have been written and delivered by Benny Hill. Never have I seen such terrible miscasting.

","This film features some of the poorest acting efforts I have seen since I watched the 4th grade performance of 'snow white'. Peter O'Toole appears to be suffering from severe gastric distress throughout with a look of anguish which correctly turns measurably to horror whenever Orlando Bloom arrives to fumble pathetically through his lines. Bloom is so wooden that even a table could have been more convincing as Paris and would certainly have been more attractive to Helen. Its hard to spot a decent effort from anyone in this movie and in this sense it becomes compelling and you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for the moment when someone actually acts - it doesn't happen."
"hekkes13","1","1","10","13 November 2005"," Irritating anachronisms, Aeneas and Omaha Beach
","There are a lot of anachronisms in that movie, which are very embarrassing, 'cause I learn classical archaeology. E.g. the helmets and shields are used much more later. In this time the Greeks used boar tusk helmets and light 8-shaped shields. The Apollon-statues' style was fashionable during the archaic period (6th cent.) Benioff killed Agamemnon in Troy, but he died from his wife, Klytemnestra's hand, when he arrived to Mycene, and that was the most popular theme of ancient Greek dramatists. And also killed Menelaus who actually lived after the Trojan War with Helena, and the son of Odysseus met them in Sparta 10 years later. So the screenwriter disregarded the next ca. 50 years of Greek mythology, and the works of Aischylus, Sophokles and Euripides. Maybe he don't know them... But it seems that he knows Vergilius, 'cause he disregarded almost the whole Greek mythology, but the Roman is in with Aeneas. I don't understand this logic. The gods have been cut out, too. But without them it's hard to explain the Trojan horse and the invulnerability of Achilles. Only Priamus seemed like a superstitious old man. So in the whole movie there is a modern mentality. Of course it could sold this way to the public, but the Credits should not write down that they inspired by Homer's Iliad, 'cause only the characters' names have drawn on the original authority. And finally some words about the awful pictures; e.g. the landing of the Greeks. It's like the landing on Omaha Beach, but 3thuosand years earlier. The beautiful sunrise over the sea, with a little problem, that Troy is on the east coast of the Aegean Sea. And the touching burial services, which should follow funeral games, which are so typical of the Greeks."

","I saw this film on HBO with my sisters. The only reason my sisters saw it was because of Orlando Bloom. She, like me, think Bradd Pitt is a Horriable actor. He says his lines so flatly, so crappy it takes you out of the film. When Achellies dies, it is so fake looking. His face, how he dies. We also laughed hard at the part where the ships are arriving at the shore. One guy dies, and he falls over reaviling spanky underwear.<br/><br/>I am not a historian.

When I see a movie it has to have some of the following quailities: GOOD ACTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is one of the most important parts of film. This is what draws you in to the story and action. Good screenplay an example of this would be Spiderman 2. Good film. Not great because of the screenplay. It was so comic bookish, from the 60's.

That doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable; it has its perks. Pitt's performance as the pompous Achilles is decent and Orlando Bloom shows us once again that he can play someone from an earlier time period successfully. Eric Bana's Hector was something that made the whole movie worth while. The major flaw to this film was the excessive amount of its main characters dying. This showed the devastation of war but left no one to enjoy their victory. I only hope that if some sort of spin-off is made from this film Sean Bean will be delightfully portraying Odysseus once again and finally take on a major leading role."
"HarryLime-3","4","1","13","21 July 2005"," No, it really is that bad
","Since ""historical accuracy"" is a theme in the discussion of this movie, it is ironic that so many have now rushed to defend it and suggest that the critics were wrong. Unfortunately, most of the acting and dialogue really is that bad. Brad Pitt, who has shown he can act when he wants to (Fight Club, Ocean's Eleven), unfortunately falls into the trap of self-importance that marred his one-note performance in Legends of the Fall. He also seems to buy into the notion that any character in a would-be swords-and-sandals epic must speak with a muddled British accent. His flat delivery is laughable and makes Achilles seem like he is pouting when he should be tormented. Thankfully, Brian Cox seems to realize that the script is sub par, so he compensates by gleefully chewing the scenery. He at least injects some life in his scenes. Bana is game enough, and manages (for the most part) to defeat some more of the ludicrous dialogue. Diane Kruger, however, does nothing to suggest why Helen was worth all the fuss. Orlando Bloom's facial expressions while watching the Hector-Achilles duel are so bad they would seem sub par in an Ed Wood movie.<br/><br/>The screenplay is especially disappointing, given that David Benioff wrote the excellent script for 25th Hour. His take on demystifying the legend by giving real motivations for the character's actions is actually quite inspired, especially as to why Greece would really want to invade Troy. However, these story elements are eventually sunk by the insipid dialogue (""There are no pacts between men and lions"" and ""It is too early in the day for killing princes"" wouldn't even cut it in a Star Wars prequel). The notable exception is a scene between Priam and Achilles, which finally fleshes out some of the relationships in the movie.<br/><br/>Not all is lost, however. Peter O'Toole gracefully elevates every scene in which he appears. The scene in Achilles' tent is a tribute to both him and David Benioff. They turn this into a great scene despite Pitt's dreadful line deliveries and laughable attempts to seem conflicted. The well-choreographed duel between Achilles and Hector is a worthy set piece. Saffron Burrows and Sean Bean also excel in (unfortunately) lesser roles.<br/><br/>Overall, the worthy parts are not enough to compensate for the half-baked whole. Given that this involves one of the cornerstone stories in world mythology, consider this film to be a great opportunity missed."

","Where do you start with this dog? First of all it is pretty pleasing to the eye, with lots of action & spectacle. But that's about it. This is History as viewed through the lens of a Schwarztnegger movie.<br/><br/>For a start Achilles never entered the walls of Troy, he died outside. Also Agamemnon lived well beyond the battle well before the fall of Troy. There's lots besides that, including the usual rubbish of sword play. Has anyone EVER tried to stick even the sharpest sword into someone? I was lucky that I never had to bayonet anyone, but I've spoken to people who have & they all told me that you just can't go up to someone & go ""HAH!"" & have a blade go right through. Don't forget you've got to add in the protection of armour & the fact that the ancient Greek blades wouldn't have been as sharp or tough as modern examples. We know from Roman chronicles that the legionnaires weren't so stupid as to have their swords bounce off the enemy, they went for the legs, preferably the ankles, to drop your opponent where you could cut his throat or just let them bleed to death. The fight sequences shown in ""Troy"" are, as a result, totally fatuous.<br/><br/>There's lots of sneering, grunting, clunky dialogue & even worse acting. This has to be the Pitts for Brad, I've never seen him so one dimensional, it is as if he didn't want to be there at all. Brian Cox goes a long way to rescuing the characterisations on screen with his Agamemnon & Sean Bean does what he can with the role of Odysseus (a role so truncated as to be almost erased from the story altogether) but the supporting cast of various sorts just get by as if going by-the-numbers.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole makes a watchable Priam, but his age seems to get the better of him, his sonorous repetition of ""The Gods"" this & ""The Gods"" that seldom allow him to rise above the mediocre. However that is something of an achievement give the standard of the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Diane Kruger as Helen is eye candy, end of story. Orlando Bloom shows promise as Paris, but the part seldom allows him to develop. However I do like the fact that he shows barely disguised fear when entering into battle, which is probably something closer to the truth than the romaticised tales handed down by the Greek poets who recorded these events at the time.<br/><br/>Of course the big sticking point with anything dealing with Greek history is the touchy subject of homosexuality. The Greeks placed such a high value on female virginity that recreational sex had to find an outlet somewhere & man-on-man action was the only alternative, assuming you had no captive women to be your sex slaves. The latter is clearly mentioned, but not shown, the former doesn't even appear by inference, but Greek records are clear that this was a normal & every day affair. However, as we have already seen, Hollywood has little respect for the truth or accuracy (which is why such awful tripe as U517 got made).<br/><br/>Finally the CGI is often obvious & clunky, especially when the large formation so Greeks or Tojans are shown marching. I've seen better animations in Role Playing computer games. This is definitely not up to the superb standard of CGI in The Lord of the Rings. But then if it was smooth & natural it would seem out of place amongst the creaking script & the clunky acting.<br/><br/>Chug lots of beer & settle down with a pizza if you want to make this an enjoyable experience. If you've any previous knowledge of Greek history then avoid this or you'll throw up, no matter how much beer you've had."

","The ancient poem Iliad by Homer is still recognized, as one of the most important and especially as one of the greatest poems of all time. For being an emotional and thrilling story, which has unforgettable as well as unexpected moments, to be impactful from the beginning to the end. The story follows the Trojan war, which takes a long time that would spread blood on the ground, while the heroism and the courage of the main characters, are directly shown in all the way. As they would never give up, in what they are going to face during the battle. During the long decade battle of Trojan War, the gods of Ancient Greece judge for what they are seeing. The filmmaker Wolfgang Petersen seems to be intrigued, by directing an adaption of the poem. After a long time of work, in 2004 came out Troy by Wolfgang Petersen with Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom. The movie's plot: The prince of Troy, Paris (Orlando Bloom), has an affair with the Queen of Sparta, Helen (Diane Kruger), as they both would run away together in Troy. But it would cause the armies of the Greece, to declare war on Troy, by filling the fury of the King of Sparta, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). The brother of Paris, Hector (Eric Bana), guides the armies of Troy, without expecting, to face the most ferocious warrior of the armies of Greece, Achilles (Brad Pitt). The movie seems to give a lot of surprising expectations, as the poem is still studied by the students in the schools. The poem is still discussed, both in negative and in positive way, by giving it a massive importance. Instead the movie disappointed, the audience and the critics, by not elaborating the movie to be completely like the poem. The story does not contain any gods of the Ancient Greece, by trying to focus only on the war and conflict between the characters. As the filmmakers tried to elaborate the story, by including only the human characters with less supernatural elements. Even it does not work by excluding the supernatural elements, which are very important in the story. As the gods of Ancient Greece are absolutely fundamental in the story, to see if they would react either in the positive or in the negative way, about how the war is proceeding. Brad Pitt did an interesting performance as Achilles, a warrior who is so powerful that can be killed only by wounding his heel. Achilles does not have any mercy with anybody, during the battle and there would be so much blood around. Even there should have been more specific details, about how does the body language of Achilles, expresses for his ferocity during the battle sequences. Instead to describe like in the movie, Achilles being so powerful to kill quickly the opponents, which does not make clear about his emotions during the battle. Eric Bana made a well done performance as Hector, the brother of Paris, who would do anything to take the right choices during the battle. Hector is aware for how much the sacrifice of the armies, does cost in the war, even he would never give up, no matter how long does the battle take. Even there should have been more emotional details, about how close is Hector to his family, what are his biggest fear for the future of Troy, as well as his doubts for the future of his family. Orlando Bloom did an interesting performance as Paris, the prince of Troy who would cause the war, declared by the armies of the Greece. As the bond between Paris and Helen, is so strong to be inseparable. Even there should have been more details, about if Paris might think he did take the right choice, or if he might think it was the wrong one to feel more doubtful. The production design has been elaborated, to let the audience feel, how did the characters lived and which kind of places they lived, at the time where the story is set. The costume design has been elaborated, to see what kind of costumes as well as what kind of amour the characters did wear, in every details and in the specific colors of the costumes. The camera has been used to shot the most spectacular sequences, by making the movie epic in every single camera movements, as well as in every single camera angles. The score by James Horner has been elaborated, to let the audience feel the atmosphere of the story, in every single musical notes to be unforgettable. But still these positive notes do not justify, the negative sides of the movie. Including how the screenplay has been elaborated, which was supposed to be clear about the story, from the beginning to the end. But it does not include the most important elements of the poem Iliad, which makes the movie incomplete and not clear enough with the main characters, neither with the main themes of the story. Troy is one of the most entertaining movies, even it should have been elaborated better with some important elements, which some of the main themes of the poem should have been included in the movie, to be much close to the original material."

Sadly, though, the acting isn't at all joined up. At bit like the Dutch football team of the 1980s, we have lots of individual stars but relatively little cohesion between them. Peter O'Toole brings some gravitas as Priam, bit otherwise it's a loose collection of A-lister performances that try their best with a staccato script and some fairly clunky direction. As an end-to-end adventure film, it isn't as bad as it has been accused of being, but it definitely could have done with a deal more emphasis on the characterisation - Brian Cox is dreadful as Agamemnon; Brad Pitt (Achilles), and particularly Eric Bana (Hector) are shockingly wooden; Orlando Bloom (Paris) & Garrett Hedlund (Patroclus) appear there merely as eye-candy and Diane Kruger as the one who launched the thousand ships sounded more like Celine Dion every time she spoke."

","From a historical perspective, this film is barely sticking to the legend and takes many liberties. Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom hold starring roles, playing Achilles and Paris respectively, and seem to have forgotten how to act beyond staring intensely and shouting. The sensational battle scenes are fantastic, gory, and deliver all the promised Greek carnage, which does make up for the lack of dimension and reliability of the secondary characters. There is so little time devoted to establishing character relationships and relies instead on the common knowledge that relationships exist between husband and wife, cousins, and lovers, rather than showing any evidence. The film does present the lack of moral alignment well, as it is never made clear who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist, which is how war should be portrayed, from an objective perspective."

"tahcko","4","0","2","19 March 2017"," Fans of Ancient movies might like it but others not really.
","Tory the 2004 film about the ancient Trojan war is a mediocre film. One third of the movie was fighting scenes which were not innovative and basically showed average film directing skills. The camera techniques are very mediocre like the use of simple full body shots and non innovative reverse camera shots for dialogue. The soundtrack is mediocre making scenes sound whatever the mood is with a forgetful orchestra soundtrack.<br/><br/>The plot of Troy is a dull story of how Paris, who is poorly ""acted"" by Orlando Bloom, steals Menelaus' wife ""Queen Helen"" and Menelaus finds out then he sends an army to Tory to get her back. With this plot there is a load of action fighting scenes ""which are OK"" but nothing you haven't seen before. The movie shows continuously Tory and Sparta is fighting and its a battle to see who wins, but the movie acknowledges the audience probably knows the story and so the film doesn't care to elaborate on the ending where troy invades Sparta with a Trojan horse. <br/><br/>Nominated by Golden Schmoes Awards for ""Biggest Disappointment of the Year"", the film is lacklustre, first the director of Tory ""Wolfgang Petersen"" is a mediocre director with no innovative storytelling through the camera. His fighting scenes are made so the audience thinks its epic but really it's the cheap move of the director showing Hollywood Rambo style fighting with a hand-held shaky camera so you think its epic. When I saw scenes when Troy prepares to battle by getting their gear it was like Peter Jackson's fight preparation scenes, also with the mass amounts of fightings and epic scenarios you would be better off watching The Lord of The Rings Trilogy instead of Tory. The acting is OK but they don't seem fully immersed into a believable character because of how linear they act, Brad Pitt as Achilles doesn't show any heroic action just ignorant self centred arrogant attitude. <br/><br/>The costuming of the film is pretty good and shows the historical accuracy in the area that the film is based in. The screen writing is decent as well though no real camera work made it interesting just static conversations. The music fits the scenes and ticks off what makes a soundtrack fitting but it never gets you in awe or into the score, the sound effects are very noticeable that they were added in for dramatic effects you can't miss them. The editing and camera effect are boring the lighting does a good job and the editing was pretty standard as well, this film won't get you awe and in the least, it will make you think the film is just slightly more than just another mediocre action Hollywood film.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, Tory is an action packed film about the Trojan war, not a lot is memorable about it. If you want a historical film worth your time pick up ""Gladiator"" or ""300"" as they are similar to Tory. Tory is not a downright god awful film it does some things right but there are noticeable flaws in the film like the non innovative camera techniques, mediocre acting and lacklustre soundtrack and so on. If you're thinking of watching Tory you'll probably leave after watching it thinking it's mediocre or if you may love it if you're into ancient historical films but for most of the audience it will be a decent film."

","I've been a fan of these historical epics ever since I saw my first sword-and-sandal film about five years ago and my enthusiasm remains as unabated as ever. TROY is a wonderful movie, the kind of epic you didn't think they made anymore, kind of like GLADIATOR but on a much wider and more expensive scale. I wasn't too concerned about this film after I heard Wolfgang Petersen was the reliable director and he doesn't disappoint again.<br/><br/>Romance, honour, warfare, action, rivalry and politics are all involved in this sweeping movie which is a perfect rendering of state-of-the-art CGI graphics (to simulate the vast armies and thousands of ships) and close human drama. Many critics have remained unswayed, and its true that this film has its fair share of flaws. Some might call the tacked-on romance needless, others may complain that the characters are drawn too simply and in black-and-white (such as Brian Cox's obnoxious, overacting bad guy Agamemnon). Purists are furious that Homer's original work was altered to fit a more mainstream Hollywood ideal. I say, so what? This is great escapist entertainment and there's nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>There is actually less action than I was hoping for, with one-too-many sequences focusing on Pitt and his girlfriend or Bana and Saffron Burrows,who is actually prettier than the lacklustre Diane Kruger. Kruger just looks like any top model these days and is hardly the ""face to launch a thousand ships"" that she needed to be. Too conventional – they needed a recognisable actress, not a perma-tanned German girl. Yet the central casting is great – Pitt gets his chance to sink his teeth (and muscles) into a proper and atypical role for a change, whilst the quietly brooding Eric Bana is superb as the introspective Hector who realises his fate is sealed. Supporting acts are great, whether it be Sean Bean as Odysseus (his Wooden Horse is excellently designed) or Brendan Gleeson as the powerful Greek warrior king. Orlando Bloom is a surprise too, in the role of a snivelling coward whom the audience end up hating – nice to see him more than just the bland hero, so kudos for that. Peter O'Toole is as good as ever though a little wasted (in terms of screen time).<br/><br/>I read an interview with Petersen who claimed to have gone all-out with the gore. Not in this version – perhaps it was taken out before released. Still, there are some fine grisly moments for male viewers and plenty of testosterone-inducing action. Watch out for any scene involving Ajax, the huge and quite brilliant warrior, or the opening battle with the huge bald guy played by Australian wrestler Nathan Jones. Battle sequences are fast-paced and vicious and fun to watch, but the best part of the film is the Hector vs. Achilles showdown – it's all downhill from there, leading to a quite perfunctory siege and sacking at the climax. But watching Bana and Pitt slug it out in front of the walls of Troy is certainly one of the most powerful moments I've ever witnessed in a film, and I'm glad they didn't back out of showing the brutality of the times. A superb moment in a good film – there's nothing really to criticise here and it was certainly a lot better than I had been led to expect."
"fernandoschiavi","7","0","1","21 April 2015"," With epic status, and taking issues of fidelity to the original work and build script, the film has spectacular battles and serves to entertain
","With a budget of $ 185 million, and under the command of experienced German director Wolfgang Petersen, The number of successful action films alone, already gave the certainty that the grandiose project would be in good hands, and the cast assembled by director only gave credibility to the project and virtually guarantee a ticket to the epic.<br/><br/>The adaptation is responsible for David Benioff, who had the previous work just great 25th Hour (2002), starring Edward Norton, Barry Pepper and Philip Seymour and directed by Spike Lee Benioff is based on ""The Iliad"", poem Greek Homer's epic that chronicles the events in the period of just over 50 days during the tenth and final year of the Trojan War. Overall, the script Benioff owes the English dialog (so far no problems), but it is full of cynicism against the lyricism of yore. The original poem consists of 15,693 verses could hardly be adapted into a movie as much as it comes in an extended version on Blu-ray discs with 6. In this case, adjustments, exclusions and clumps were expected in the construction of the plot, leaving the final cut of the film with 2h43min long. <br/><br/>The main themes of the Iliad are present in the script, and is chief among them the wrath of Achilles. Through the consummation of this anger is treated to humanize the hero and demigod Achilles, always conflicted by its dual nature, the son of the goddess and man, so deadly, the choice between dying Achilles struggling young and be remembered forever or stay safe and forgotten, denote the choice between raw values such as safety and long life, and moral values as the eternal glory and recognition, the contrast between the pride of Achilles and Hector sobriety, which does not seek glory like Achilles but struggle for the safety of their family and town, and the preservation of its roots Trojan, the human condition that shows the deadly dilemmas and superior interference embodied in the gods who take advantage, the consequences of war for the sides involved, friendship, honor, love, friendship, among numerous other issues pertaining to the human soul, which is one of the qualities that have given the longevity of the Homeric narrative universal culture through the centuries. These themes, perhaps the more effective participation of the gods is a point not as exploited in the adaptation of Benioff. The writer also plays with the facts known to the public and places them on the screen counting with popular knowledge about the famous events. For example: of course you all know the issue of the ""Achilles heel"" as his weakness and uses it in the movie, but do not worry at first explaining why he has a weakness on that particular part of the body or at least have been mentioned before in any way. And Paris knew the weak point Achilles was just hit him on the spot? To compensate for that, the director puts other arrows in the chest to justify the death not explained before. Already the Wooden Horse is a problem because its construction is not shown by thousands of men. The horse just suddenly appears on the screen.<br/><br/>Regarding liberties with the poem, some of the previously mentioned exclusions are unnecessary (especially if the work was divided into two or three films). The prophetess Cassandra, who despite his prophecies targeted enforcement, would not be taken seriously by men. She warns Paris that his search for Helena would bring war and destruction to Troy warned the Greeks hidden in the wooden horse.<br/><br/>The cast includes prestigious names and popular appeal and strength were the publicity campaign for the film. Brad Pitt is the man stronger and more courageous and skillful warrior, Achilles. We have Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, the beautiful German Diane Krueger as Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world. Rose Byrne, Julian Glover, Brian Cox, Peter O 'Toole and Brendan Gleeson complete the cast.<br/><br/>With happiness in choosing his cast, would be left to Wolfgang Petersen do what you know best, directing major productions of action, and in this case with the face of epic. And Petersen does not disappoint. He creates beautiful open plans, and a moving camera exciting. Some scenes are iconic when you remember the movie, like when the camera will gradually rising behind a rock highlighting the fleet of a thousand ships, or attack with balls of hay burned, or the violent battles and well-choreographed in the open, or in individual battles between Menelaus and Paris and between Achilles and Hector, or the final sequence with the giant wooden horse. The director cleverly uses photography Roger Pratt competent in creating plans. The soundtrack by James Horner who had worked with Petersen on The Perfect Storm is not really a highlight and becomes very bureaucratic, but the works proposed. Another highlight of the technique is the Oscar-nominated costume made by Bob Ringwood.<br/><br/>Acceptance large movie also gives the fact that these scenes are directed well complemented by great visual effects work. The multiplication of boats, and characters in battle, the immense buildings added to the natural landscapes of the film set are very well done. Everything looks very natural on stage and the collective and individual battles excite and entertain.<br/><br/>Troy is a fun top quality. With epic status, and taking issues of fidelity to the original work and build script, the film has spectacular battles and serves to entertain, making it so flawless. Well done commercial cinema that still brings us superficially historical parts and sharpen the desire to research more about these topics always exciting. Shall not have the complexity of The Lord of the Rings, but it stands as one of the great epics of recent times."

I was psyched upon hearing that this would be an adaptation of the ancient classic. However, when as I watched, I noticed it got some things right, but much more wrong. First things first, the gods (except one, Thetis) are completely absent, which was an integral part of the story. Secondly, Helen was said to be the most beautiful woman of all is completely miscast and not very beautiful. Third the war was supposed to take 10 years as opposed to a few weeks here. And finally the Trojan horse, though present is rather crudely done (it was more crafted in literary works).

","The movie Troy is directed Wolfgang Peterson and is based on Homer's The Iliad. It was an entertaining action movie.

However, unlike The Iliad, the existence of the Greek god's is noticeably absent.<br/><br/>The romance between Helen and Paris that was the cause of the 10-year war at Troy is present, but not really explained. For me there is just too much missing for me to really enjoy Troy based on reading The Iliad.<br/><br/>What I did like about this film was Achilles, which was played by Brad Pitt and was fairly accurate. His anger at Agamemnon and his refusal to fight until Patroclus was killed by Hector were present in the film. As well as Patroclus wearing Achilles' armor into battle against the Trojans. The fight scene between Achilles and Hector was an epic and violent battle and very well done. I also enjoyed the scene between Priam (Peter O'Toole) and Achilles (Pitt) when Priam asks Achilles for the return of his son Hector's body so he can receive a proper burial.<br/><br/>Troy was an entertaining action movie, and I would recommend it if you do not want an accurate portrayal of Homer's The Iliad."
"Dr_Coulardeau","7","0","1","28 June 2014"," Rather disappointing
","The Iliad and Achilles have always been fascinating mirrors to the western mind. This rather short version of the Trojan War is done for a popular audience and it shows. It is also done for a modern audience and it has to be short. It sure is shortened.<br/><br/>We could list all the essential events that are missing from the human sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter by Agamemnon himself to get from the ""Gods"" a favorable wind to go to war. And the ""Gods"" did not substitute a goat or a ram to Iphigenia as another ""God"" will do when Abraham was going to sacrifice his own son, though we will never know if it was Isaac or Ishmael, since there are two versions running around, one behind the other, both trying to catch their own tails in their own teeth. Human sacrifice is part of humanity, has been and will be as long as wars and the death penalty exist. The Celts burned the guilty alive in baskets hanging from trees. The Romans dipped people in boiling oil or crucified them along the roads. The medieval church burned witches and wizards at the stake, or fried homosexuals in a frying pan with oil in France, or grilled homosexuals on a grill without any oil at all in England. And what about these marvelous death penalties that do not work or take a long time to be effective in our modern civilized countries? We regret a great show like in England under kings and queens up to Elizabeth I when a convicted criminal would be drawn by horses to the Bartholomew Fair ground on the day before the Bartholomew Fair to be hanged there but not to death, brought down, drawn in the meaning of eviscerated, quartered and finally beheaded, the head being picked by the hair and directed at the joyful gleeful crowd because the brain and the eyes can see up to seven seconds after the beheading, so that the guilty victim can see the people rejoicing at his or her death. <br/><br/>This film is very clean indeed. <br/><br/>The film is also totally silent on the enormous stake of this war. They reduce it to power for Agamemnon. That's short. Troy controlled the main Indo-European route from Iran to Europe through Anatolia. That was one of the two immigrating routes that produced our modern Europe. Along this route came all kinds of goods but also knowledge like cattle raising and agriculture and metal industry (or what it was at that very beginning of the metal civilization) and religion. The Greeks wanted to take the control of this commercial and cultural circulation to Europe to make a profit on it. That is not power, that is commercial dictatorship. <br/><br/>The film is totally silent on the fact that the beautiful Greek religion was in the process at the time the Iliad was being written of integrating some religious and cultural elements of the people who had been in Europe since 50,000 years ago and who represent 75-80% of modern European DNA, viz. the Turkic population known as Cro-Magnon or the Gravettians, and some others still known today as the Basques. By reducing the historical stake of the Iliad and Ancient Greece, we can forget about the fact that the Indo-Europeans conquered the whole of Europe with what will never be more than a 20% minority in Europe. <br/><br/>What saves the film then?<br/><br/>In fact only two actors: Brad Pitt as Achilles and Peter O'Toole as Priam. The others are secondary and most of them mediocre. Brad Pitt gives some taste to the story, though of course the particular relation between him and his cousin Patroclus is entirely unrevealed and he even appears as a gallant person who saves a virgin teenage woman from the grubby and dirty hands of soldiers. On the other hand Peter O'Toole gives Priam the dignity and the force this old king must have had to have to be able to go and beg for the body of his own son killed in fair fight by Achilles. <br/><br/>The famous Trojan horse is also a nice character and the trick is surprising in the fact that it worked, at least so does the legend have it. <br/><br/>Finally we could say the film insists a little bit too much on couples of brothers. The two Greek Brothers, Agamemnon and Menelaus on the Greek side and the two Trojan brothers Hector and Paris on the Trojan side. And all that for a woman, Helen, who was married to an old man, Menelaus, and fell for a more or less young teenager, Paris. But do not expect any love in all that. It is only a question of possession for Menelaus and intercourse for Paris. Helen just has to play the game of satisfying the impulses of the man who possesses her. The film even manages the escape of Andromache, Astyanax, Helen and Paris, more or less and at least. Since Paris has managed to kill Achilles, he is not even a hero and the fugitives are nothing but assassins. In other words the film is doomed to have no morality.<br/><br/>Some beautiful battles and some very impressive ramparts, city walls, palaces and temples, but not much more, and the back side of Brad Piptt a couple of times for the perverse cheese-addicts.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","Wolfgang Peterson's ""Troy"" takes the essential elements from Homer's Iliad, fills in the gaps and creates a compelling story for audiences three thousand years later. The reason it works so well is simple, it takes to heart a lesson that Hollywood filmmakers have always known but often failed to heed ~ the characters and the story need to be larger than the spectacle.<br/><br/>One thing the filmmakers chose to ignore was that the siege of Troy supposedly went on for ten years. In this version, the whole thing seems to be over in about three weeks. The filmmakers must have thought a full decade would slow the story down, and as the ending was going to be the same anyway, a few weeks was about right for the Trojan War.<br/><br/>The story begins as Hector and Paris, sons of King Priam of Troy, are concluding a peace mission to King Mennelaus of Sparta. Paris falls in love with Mennelaus's wife Helen, played by Diane Kruger, whose beauty could drive men to do foolish things. Orlando Bloom as Paris proves he is just such a man, and takes Helen with him when he and Hector return to Troy. Eric Bana is terrific as Hector who takes honour and courage far more seriously than Paris. He is aware of the consequences of this action but as Helen loves Paris, decides to support his brother rather than return her to Sparta <br/><br/>Mennelaus enlists the aid of his brother Agamemnon to get Helen back. Agamemnon, played in an unashamedly over-the-top performance by British actor, Brian Cox, uses this incident as a pretext to go to war with Troy.<br/><br/>Agamemnon also enlists Achilles, Greece's greatest warrior. Brad Pitt as Achilles brings intensity and sex appeal to the role. It was either phallus or phalanx for Achilles, and he leaps from bedroom to battlefield with equal zeal. Achilles is a difficult and dangerous man and as is the way with such things women can't resist him. These days, he would no doubt be a Formula One driver or a rock star – it's reassuring to know some things never change.<br/><br/>On the other side of the Aegean, Paris presents Helen to the Trojans. His father King Priam played by Peter O'Toole knows that the Greeks will invade to retrieve Helen, but is also aware that they have only awaited an excuse to do so. Hector is placed in charge of the defences, but he has done his numbers; he knows the Trojans can't win although he commits himself to the task nevertheless.<br/><br/>The Greeks sail to Troy. Helen's face has launched those thousand ships and they are all up there on the screen. The Greeks arrive and make a bloody landing. The movie presents a number of battles. Each one introduces a new angle to avoid repetition – it's pretty much the formula that has worked so well for ""World Championship Wrestling"".<br/><br/>Paris accepts Mennelaus's challenge to fight him for possession of Helen. They duel in front of both armies with surprising results, proving that Paris is a better lover than a fighter. Eventually the contest we have been waiting for takes place ~ Achilles versus Hector. It's a promoter's dream and lives up to expectations.<br/><br/>The intensity of these sequences rob the final scenes of some of their impact, and the introduction of the wooden horse is decidedly anti-climatic.<br/><br/>Historical accuracy was not the number one priority of the filmmakers, but entertainment certainly was. At two and half hours, the audience leaves the cinema with extended bladders but also with a sense of satisfaction."

","Having seen Troy for a 3rd time now, i feel ready enough to write a review on it which is fair. Troy has an all star cast containing the likes of Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt so that already glistens it. The film was a good length with enough to keep you just about interested. <br/><br/>To begin, i thought that Hector, played by Eric Bana really held things together. His sense of leadership was brought right out in the film and you did become emotionally attached especially after his death in the fight against in my view, a not so noble and brave Achilles. I didn't like how he was portrayed at all to be quite honest. However, i did enjoy the fight scenes and the end as Troy burnt. The acting throughout was pretty solid and Orlando Bloom played the part of Paris perfectly in particular when he fought for Helen.<br/><br/>A short review here, but overall it was not one of the best releases of the year, but still an interesting one.

","Overall, I felt that this movie was pretty good because it is not like your average Greek war movie. Because normally when you watch a Greek war movie like ""The Clash of the Titans"" you are thinking of humans and gods living in harmony. However, in this movie they just depict the gods as something they refer to for help or omens. As you the movie ""Troy"" the Trojans always refers to the god Apollo and his omens when they go to battle with the Greeks, however when you watch this film you even though they refer to a god they do not show him in person. Thus since they do not have any gods in the movie, it kind of makes the movie a little easy to watch because you know that everyone in the movie is human. Besides the movie ""Troy"" not having any gods in the movie, it is also similar to what is happening in the Iliad. Consequently, even though some parts are wrong in the movie, I feel that the director or maker of this movie did that because they wanted to make the movie more appealing to the public. Because I know that if the director went by how the Iliad was then it would have been connection between some of the characters in the movie. Thus the movie also has a good use of rhetorical devices like metaphor, repetition, pathos, and arguments; which thus make the movie more appealing to watch. So overall the movie ""Troy is a good movie to watch because it is easy to follow, it has a good use of rhetorical devices, and it is similar to the epic the Iliad."

","Let it burn let Troy burn! This movie is good but not even close to great. I will say it didn't seem to cliché at all. This of course is based on the story of how Troy fell and the heroes that fought in it, and of course the giant horse that everyone knows of. I have no clue how accurate this movie is but they sure make it look cool.<br/><br/>The plot is of course the fall of Troy, so how does this movie sell the audience on a movie they already know the ending to? Well they add some bad-ass fight scenes with Brad Pitt, men getting slaughtered by swords, arrows, and in one case a giant hammer. I find this movie is very interesting to watch, but thats it.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I see with this movie is all the characters are flat, Brad Pitt play Achillies the warrior with a heart. Then you have Eric Bana who plays Hector the family man and the only character I even gave a damn about. Last of the big ones Orlando Bloom who is Paris the whiniest person in the whole damn film and yet he still has his bow and arrow from The Lord of the Rings. It would've been epic if he was Legolas that could've made this movie a master piece instead of a rental worthy movie. In the end with all the characters with them being so flat when they die you don't care you just think OK next fight scene.<br/><br/>The dialog isn't bad but could be a helluva lot better. All the characters will have at least one line of really cheesy dialog that seems like George Lucas wrote it.<br/><br/>Now the music score is fantastic I applaud the composer. In certain scenes the score just pulls you in and you become immersed.<br/><br/>Overall low rental for those who like the Greek tales or guys slicing each other up into little bits.

","I find it amusing that people criticise this movie as historically inaccurate. Of course it is, like an old-fashioned John Ford Cowboys and Indians movie that inspires schoolyard kids to reprise the mythic purity and simplicity of the theme. I mean, steel cuts into flesh with an added sound effect of a knife sharpener, like Stars Wars explosions make noise in airless space? Okay, we accept this is a fable, all the more reasons to treat it as such. But director Petersen also took out the mythological element that made the story more real for ancient listeners of the tale (which is interesting, since it can be argued that his other ""realistic"" films – Das Boot, Enemy Mine – are structured like myths). Myth for the Greeks (who didn't yet exist as such at the time of Troy nor even in Homer's day) would have been seen as enhancing the story, not making it less realistic, as one might expect from a modern perspective. In the original, gods and goddesses weave in and out of the plot, sometimes favouring one side and then the other. Homer's audience would have understood: the achievements of men count for little faced with the power and caprices of the supernatural and all it stood for. People who thought otherwise were guilty of hubris. The problem for the modern spectator is that the lack of myth is supposed to make the story more real. In fact, it means it depends entirely on the psychological dimension, so it is easy to judge this movie. Is the action sufficiently motivated by the scripted emotions conveyed by the actors? The answer of course is no. The actors are good, but their emotional depth seems misplaced since we are not provided with any real clues to account for the force of these emotions driving them to a ten year long murderous frenzy. In fact, the movie reduces the war to cupidity, greed and schoolboy notions of honour and masculinity (by the ""Greeks""; the Trojans are in fact more complex psychologically because they are defending their homeland from the imperialist invaders). But the decision to motivate the action prosaically leaves Petersen in a bind, and so the photography, costumes, montage and even the score to a certain extent become ""mythic"", with old-fashioned long shots (now undoubtedly aided by CGI) to show the epic proportions of the battles, loving shots of the ""eternal Aegean"", of ""sad"" sunsets signalling death, of mighty walls, choreographed balletic duels, and so on. Myth and its richness are thus reduced to things – armour details, dramatic lighting – and plays no role in the human. This could have been a great film. As it stands, it is a great failure. You read Homer once, you never forget it. You could watch this film 20 times and even admire its technical prowess, but it is in the end forgettable."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","1","4 March 2011"," Certainly a cut above its director's usual forté of English language films, Troy isn't without serious flaw but sustains enough interest and drama to its conclusion.
","Wolfgang Peterson's Troy opens with a voice-over proposing to us as to whether or not famous tales; stories of bravery and bloody warfare; fables about the rise and consequent falls of famous nations, kings and civilisations and heroic, blood-thirsty warriors as well as their actions will ever be remembered or recalled over the ages - whether people will ask as to how what happened, happened. It would seem the answer is ""yes"", but only if it's ever really distilled through the filter Peterson waters-down the tales of old he puts on screen here, and put out to a common-place audience in the manner that it is. If the aim of the film was to educate or inform or make those aware of the sorts of stories and content this piece puts to the screen, then Troy is ancient Greek mythology for the generation of social networkers; a three hour or so slog through warriors and their tirades, family affairs and love lives, a sweeping; scything; swooping film complete with overly dramatic delivery and the odd burst of orchestral music to emphasise drama and expansiveness. Provided with this in mind, it is a wonder that it at all works to the degree that it does.<br/><br/>The film predominately covers two young men from two separate warring side as well as an awful lot in between. Eric Bana's Hector is a Prince to the higher-ups of Troy; a warrior but a politician and a philosopher as well as a mentoring figure to Orlando Bloom's Paris, his brother; Hector is a proud man, pleased that peace exists for the time being where he is based. Then there is Brad Pitt's Achilles, a fearsome warrior with long blonde locks and a stern expression; a man we first encounter in bed with a woman whom looks as if she might have just fallen out of a modern day centrefold shoot, a man effectively a mercenary-for-hire who's late for a large battle his employer, Brian Cox's Greek king Agamemnon, is about to instigate but negates any trouble with both his gyp and his unworldly ability to perform in a one-on-one fight. The situation these people and these kingdoms find themselves in is narrated orally to us in that manner that makes it sound like this is the most important tale you'll ever hear. Agamemnon, the power hungry tyrant, wants Troy and control of its surrounding area; mixed up amidst all of this is Brendan Gleeson's Menelaus, a man angry at those from Troy due to Paris' swiping of his wife Helen (Kruger), whom has fallen in love with Paris and has consequently eloped.<br/><br/>Things escalate, with Achilles tempted into working with Agamemnon and his cronies of which include Sean Bean's (disapointingly cast as the grizzled 'tough-guy' once again and proving that 2007's Far North is the best thing he's done in a while) Odysseus, so much so that asking his mother for help merely sees her provide advice along the lines of: being famous and remembered throughout history beneath this mirage of 'celebrity status' is good; and lopping people's heads off for a living when you aren't driving swords trough their chests is a pretty decent way to go about attaining said status. The film, despite being set thousands of years ago, carries an annoyingly polished feel to it since there is very little grub and grime to proceedings, despite the unusually brave overall downcast nature Peterson applies to the material which was always ripe for that of being poorly played.<br/><br/>The film is driven by rather beautiful, somewhat unrealistically photogenic people such as Pitt; Bana; Bloom and Kruger, each of whom come across as sympathetic as the film can possibly make them regardless of role and are in stark contrast to the older and wearier Gleeson and Cox whom are tyrannical, aggressive, all conquering and vengeful in a far uglier fashion. Achilles' gradual falling out with his king and employer Agamemnon sees Cox inform Pitt that ""no-body will remember him"" as ""history only recognises the kings from centuries gone by"" - information I'm not sure on what he's basing, since it was the actions of a fair few from around about this era which has gone on to spawn such thinking; not, with his dreams of stardom and fame, something Pitt wants to here. Their gradual falling out feels more-so symptomatic of this distinction the film makes between the 'young' and 'old' performers more than it does because two rounded characters are genuinely disagreeing.<br/><br/>One cannot watch the film with a certain nagging sensation at the back of one's head, critical observations of 2000's Gladiator about how various feuds were instigated by way of trash-talking and calling one's opponent out alá a contemporary wrestling or boxing match rearing its head at specific points. There is some interesting material later on to do with Hector's battle he has with his council members more broadly linked to theology, proving the film can when it wants to have its 'pretty boy' leads fall foul of the elders therein on more substantial grounds when it wants to, but this sort of stuff is few and far between. Soap opera narrative aside and while it is generally allover the place, I was surprised by how much I came to be involved in the plights of its characters; Troy a war film with an eye on the more grandeur or scoped nature of battle but with an additional, more mature and more downcast eye on the love these characters have for one another behind the scenes. Very little is ultimately won in Troy but an awful lot is lost, and its perception of war as an ugly and terrible thing which does nobody any favours rings rather depressingly true when two supremely advanced nations are unable to come together and instead come to fight. Troy is a thoroughly mixed bag of tricks but one just about worth catching."

","Wolfgang Peterson could have made a terrific film, but alas he cast Brad Pitt as Achilles. The movie looks great, the action is wonderful, the outfits, and the sets are all marvelous. Allowing Pitt to come in and create Achilles as a brooding Californian was a bad mistake. Eric Bana is fantastic as Homer and every time Bana raises the movie above the mediocre realm--Pitt brings it back down in his scenes. Pitt is awful in this movie and he darkens what could have been a great film. The other complaint about the movie is the fight between Homer and Achilles. You have the two most powerful and skilled warriors in the fight and you let Achilles beat him too easily and brutally. Bana's performance deserved more---but we gave in to star power. Had the fight been more evenly matched, you may have felt something for Achilles afterwards--as it is, who cares about him and his quest for glory."

","Personally, I am not familiar with the original story for the battle of Troy, so I can't comment on how historically/mythically/culturally accurate this movie really is. Whether it's fully embellished or not, it is a rather fun and timeless story; it is only appropriate that Hollywood should someday film it with such a high production cost and a full list of A-list actors.<br/><br/>This is such a film; a slick and stylish production with plenty of large-scale set-pieces, exotic-looking locations, huge battles and fight scenes, ambitious CGI effects, and a smidgeon of classic romance. The talents of Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, and even Peter O'Toole are all dispensed here. Watching ""Troy"" is about as rewarding of an experience as the long list of other Hollywood epics (such as ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" or ""300""), for better or for worse.<br/><br/>The best part about this film is that it is tremendously entertaining. Whether watching the original two-hour theatrical cut or the rather sublime three-hour director's cut, the film is tightly paced and hardly ever dull. Battle scenes are spectacular and often times bloody. Individual fight scenes are pretty swell too. The CGI work is a little fake-looking, but still well-realized and quite slick to look at. Outside of the battles, the film is quite pretty to look at, with so many unique settings and solid camera work.<br/><br/>The most negative aspects about this film would likely be reserved for the pickiest of viewers. Despite the film's quality production, it is not even comparable to the most highly-rated epics in this genre; movies like ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart"" can easily out-match ""Troy."" After all, ""Troy"" does not have the same quality writing and acting, much less the same thematic prowess or emotional power. It is certainly not as immersive, deep, or insightful.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Troy"" is a polished and entertaining film. It comes recommended to most casual audiences, but those looking for full artistic valor can do better.<br/><br/>4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)"
"cocomufi","8","0","2","24 September 2010"," Review for ""Troy""
","The movie ""Troy"" is an adaptation of Homer's Iliad and also includes material from Virgil's Aeneid. The cast was filled with many well-known actors such as: Brad Pitt, who played Achilles; Diane Kruger, who played Helen of Troy; Orlando Bloom, who played Paris; Eric Bana, who played Hector; and Peter O'Toole, who played Priam.<br/><br/>Movie-wise, I think that the director and producer of this movie were very smart. The way they presented the movie was very well-thought out and smart. The characters they chose to play each character were not the best choices acting-wise, but they were the best choices for the publicity and success of the movie. The actors who play the main or lead characters are well-known. One of the main reasons they got their parts were probably because they could attract an audience and help the movie do good at the box office. To me, the actors did a pretty good job portraying their characters. I thought Brad Pitt made a great Achilles, but his physical appearance made up about 75% of his character. Diane Kruger was a great Helen of Troy looks-wise, but I didn't think that her character required a lot of acting skill. She wasn't a big part of the movie, so she didn't really have a chance to show any acting skill. Orlando Bloom played the part of Paris very well. To me, Paris was a pretty boy pansy-ass coward and Orlando Bloom pulled it off nicely. His looks and the way he acted throughout the movie convinced me that he was Paris. Eric Bana was a great Hector and pulled off the part very well. His acting was very diverse, from the ferocity he showed when fighting, to the regret over killing Patroclus, Eric Bana really portrayed how great Hector was as both a warrior and a person. Peter O'Toole, I thought, did the best job overall. He played the part of Priam well, and the scene where he asks Achilles for Hector's body was one of the best scenes of the movie. He played his character convincingly, and was the best actor overall.<br/><br/>The movie overall was enjoyable. It's more enjoyable to watch when you know a little background information on the movie. I thought that the movie was a pretty accurate adaptation. I like that the movie didn't include the Gods in it because that would have made it weird and confusing. I like that they changed parts of the story to make it seem more relateable and watchable. For example, instead of Paris deciding who gets the apple and Aphrodite giving Helen to him, the movie shows that they fell in love overtime. To me, that makes a lot more sense and is relateable and watchable. Overall, I would give the movie 8/10 stars."

The only true to the Iliad part of the film is Achilles's heel. A siege that lasted years is all rolled up in a few weeks. There is no doubt in my mind that a person who has actually read the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers. Any other interpretation is simply childish or blissfully ignorant. I do not mince my words. Nor do I want to bore readers to defend something so obvious but never hinted at in the film. If the director could find it in himself to cover his one eye, why didn't he cover both of them. This 2 disc widescreen edition will end in the rubbish bin.

","Praise rained down on this film, aroused my curiosity, then I rent the DVD home to find out how the so-called masterpiece won the international repute.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I was in a puzzle as to how to evaluate it. Apparently, Troy is not faithful to the Iliad, and is not historically accurate. In Iliad, Homer let Helen to take the blame for the battle, it's all for Helen. In the film, the tyrant Agamemnon invaded Troy result from his own desire for power, wealth and reputation.<br/><br/>Tthere was standout cast, the actors didn't fit the characters they portray very well. According to the standard of handsome, charming and attracted at that time, a man must be big, large, strong, or heavy. Take Prince Paris for example, he was barely qualified to the tough model. I assumed that Brad Pitt was more adequate for this character; as for character for Achilles, I prefer The Rock Johnson, he is born to be a worrier. I firmly believe that Johnson will portray outstandingly as if Achilles has reborn in modern movie.<br/><br/>Although I have some criticism of this movie, undoubtedly, there are some advantages that is worth mentioning. The film highlighted the passion for patriotism, love for family and lover, wisdom of pardon, variety of virtue which has passed down from predecessor. And the scene which a young man received the sword of Troy from Prince Paris implied that No matter how worse the situation is, never shall we give up the hope.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film leaves something to be desired; however, I can't deny that it is full of entertainment."

","The new director's cut of Troy might at over 3 hours be rather long to have been sitting in a cinema, but for home theatre, this is now finally the movie punters wished it could be when it first came out. The extra scenes - a mixture of character moments and action scenes, truly change it from a bit of a muddle, to something approaching classic status. The battle scenes add little, but the character scenes change and explain the dynamics of the characters, in particular Sean Bean's Odysseus, and the tension between King Agamemnon and Achilles. There is still a problem with the casting... no-one really looks that comfortable in their roles, neither Eric Bana, Brad Pitt and certainly not Orlando Bloom. Only Peter O'Toole really fits the part, at least as much of a part as he is given. Diane Kruger looks pretty, but whether it is the script, or her acting, it is difficult to say - but she never quite seems worth putting a thousand ships to sea for. That aside, the battle scenes are visceral, and if this movie added anything new, it was the mano-a-mano battles with Achilles, which are terrifically well choreographed to make you really believe in his invincibility. Extras are prolific - I gave up before I managed to exhaust all the topics, which are conveniently arranged in segments a few minutes long, so you can either watch all together or search for just the parts which interest.

Sometimes he seems laughable like a delusional college boy who thinks himself the legendary hero!<br/><br/>Generally, despite the huge look, it was average. Just few lines captured my attention. The editing was about making a distinctive personality for the movie unlike most of the contemporary movies, but it didn't wholly work since the story itself doesn't want to be that distinctive. (Peter O'Toole) as (Priam), and (Brian Cox) as (Agamemnon) were great though in not a great movie. And I hated the nudity, it's Hollywood's adolescent way to attract audience, which cheapens its movies highly!<br/><br/>It's provocative to see all of these cold shots for endless warships, or innumerable armies (read: CGI, NO, rather Cee.. Gee.. AHHHHYYY!) THEN you know about the 200 million Dollar budget!! It's irritating since it wasn't that portly sight after all. I hankered after Stanley Kubrick's (Spartacus); which was made 40 years earlier, and without Computer-generated anything! I bet the budget went like this: 50 million for the CGI young men who worked in front of their computers, 50 million for the costumes, sets, etc, 50 million for the cast (Pitt alone took 18 million), and 50 million for the most deceiving publicity at all; imagine how they pay too much for the guys who come up with resounding taglines that appeared eventually as naively general like: ""For Honor, For Victory, For Love, For Troy""!<br/><br/>(Wolfgang Petersen) always has that special quality; he mastered here some artistic sad cadres like sublime drawings. But it shows that he wasn't enjoying making an old war movie (I believe Ridley Scott was jealous). The scenes weren't stately as they should be. The legendary halo is taken, and not for the sake of human look inasmuch as the sake of making another flick. The fights weren't unique or memorable. Yes, (Petersen) managed to do it fair, but without so many brilliant moments, or deep meanings. Unless my belief that the story works perfectly as a deliberate satire against the American war on Iraq, since the mighty force can make wars, kill thousands, destroy a world for pure foolishness, or pressing instinct, where absolute power is absolute corrupter. So the old empire is nothing but the new empire, being dull, possessive and mad as its kings; which could explain the obvious sense of bewailing at the soundtrack with all the long, gone too long, mourner female vocal while Troy was being destroyed for no fault it did.<br/><br/>If that wasn't right and I'm having delusions, or very rare coincidence, so this is just an ordinary Hollywood blockbuster, that evoked the missed sword and sandals movies of the 1960s. But it didn't outclass its antecedents of classic epics, or leave a weighty mark as a drama or as a war movie. Even the well-meaning idea of being a satirical Troy wasn't fully played, or boldly aimed. Anyhow, a (Brad Pitt)'s fan will be happy, though maybe Achilles in his grave won't!"

","""Troy"" retells the epic story of Homer's ""The Iliad"", wherein the Greek army descends upon Troy in an attempt to reclaim the legendarily beautiful Helen of Troy.<br/><br/>The basic story is of course familiar to most already, which doesn't exactly work in the film's favour. Nevertheless, the story is an entertaining one which modern visual effects bring to life in a vivid manner. Wolfgang Peterson's direction is well-handled throughout while James Horner's score is serviceable though not particularly remarkable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film's technical prowess is let down by some poor casting. I ought not to be surprised that in a multi-million dollar epic like this the producers focused on star power to drive the film. This led to some questionable casting choices. Brad Pitt & Eric Bana are not cut out for this sort of thing. A lot of their dialogue sounds stilted, although I must admit that they handle the physical aspects of their parts very well. Peter O'Toole hardly seems like his heart is in it (with the exception of one scene) and I don't think that I'd single out anyone at all as having given a standout performance.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if you enjoy epic films like me then you may find this one to your liking. However, with the poor casting the problems of the film are difficult to ignore."

","The name Troy reminds us of the Trojan War portrayed by Homer in his Iliad. And thus when the movie came out, I had watched it hoping to find a depiction of the same. But this movie Troy merely borrows names and characters from Homer's Iliad and otherwise is not such a sincere adaptation of the original. What is worse is that the movie does not have a proper pace and the overall handling of the plot is not to the mark.<br/><br/>The primary reason the Trojan War took place is because the Gods wanted it to take place. Humans by themselves could never have done the deeds that led to the war. It was the madness that Gods infected their subjects with that led them to wage a war of madness on each other. This movie decides to go for an alternate treatment of the Trojan War. It removes the Gods. There are no Gods in this movie. If there are no Gods in the movie, then the act of Prince of Paris running away with Helen looks too feeble and weak. The movie fails to convince us the need of war. And when there is no need of a war, the overall enjoyment of the movie is lowered.<br/><br/>The overall depth of the characters is poor. There is not much of character development that leads to understand their actions, their strengths and their weaknesses. Perhaps Achilles is the best done character though he is not a consistent character. Some of what he does at the end of the movie is not consistent with his overall attitude throughout the movie. The King of Troy, Priam is the only character that I could enjoy watching apart from Achilles. The movie lacks in its portrayal of characters.<br/><br/>But there is something good in the movie after all. In spite of the overall plot being poorly handled, there is some really good action to watch out for. The two wars in the movie and the photography is wonderfully done. The scenery is wonderful. And the best part of the movie to me is the single mano-e-mano battle between Hector and Achilles. This is among the most well shot and choreographed fights I have seen in a long time. However, the reactions on the faces of the relatives of Hector who know that the end is near is too artificial and disturbing to the beauty of the fight.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is not enjoyable. I especially did not like the way the ending of the movie is handled. It is too lame. Today, when I get the chance I do not like to see the whole movie. I simply switch to the scenes that are well done but it is simply not possible for me to watch the whole movie again."

","Let me start off by saying this is not a masterpiece. From the text it came on I think it could of but it isn't. However, the movie gives itself a good shot at it. The visuals effects are amazing and that is because we are dealing with Wolfgang Peterson of course and the acting is good to a certain extent. I won't go into plot details because nearly everyone in the world has heard the story of the wooden horse so I will talk about the movie. Firstly, I wouldn't say anyone was miscast. There was a lot of buzz about Brad Pitt but when you think about it, who else is going to play the hunky war hero. Arnie? Be my guest. All support was great especially Eric Bana and Brian Cox. Orlando Bloom was good at playing a sissy but I don't know if that is a complement and Peter O'Toole was decent also and even Diane Kruger was good at playing a sl*t. The battle sequences are great and the first shots you see of Troy are just 'WOW!' Even though I am praising the movie a lot it still has plenty of flaws like when they are doing wide shots. A lot of them feel like the camera man is freezing and hes shaking around with the camera. Some of them also felt very stiff but I think I am the only person in the world who would pick that up. Also, I know Achilles is supposed to be the best fighter in the world but no one can be that good and of all the people who end up killing him it has to be the sissy. Overall good! Though it could have been better."
"skutah","7","0","2","5 July 2007"," Not bad, but why didn't they name it ""Achilles""?
","I watched this movie when it came to the cinemas in Germany and once again in television some weeks ago. Though I liked it in a way, because I'm fond of the optical experience of this kind of movies, there were some disappointing elements.<br/><br/>But first, I want to mention something positive: I was impressed by the demonstration of how Achilles' fighting works to make him nearly invincible. It was an extraordinarily good idea to explain his power in war by his acting and reacting faster than others and employing a better and more precise method. But I don't think - like at least one of the former reviewers - the idea is correct that Greeks at that time did believe in the existence and power of their gods as little as we do. This may fit in our contemporary world view, but I think it would be a much better interpretation of the time and place depicted if one had introduced serious doubts about why the god protecting Troy, Apollo, didn't help his town. On the other hand, they depicted Agamemnon and his real aims in waging war against Troy in a very convincing way and the choice of actors for Agamemnon and Menelaos - who are brothers - was definitely fitting. Furthermore, the scene depicting Priamos who comes to Achilles to get the body of his dead son back is as near to the story of the Iliad as it is impressing.<br/><br/>Yet, I was a bit disappointed by the following points: I didn't understand the reason, why they made it appear as if Priamos, the king of Troy, who is famous to have had about fifty sons and a number of daughters, only had two sons, Hector and Paris. Surely, the others are less important, but it would have been sufficient to place a number of people hanging around - they employed enough people in other scenes - and to mention that there are more than two sons. I also don't know why it was necessary to put an end to this famous ten-year-lasting war this quickly - just to save some aging make-up? Finally, the thing most annoying to me all over the film was the overemphasized stress on Achilles (though I can imagine this has to do with Hollywood art styling Brad Pitt as THE hero of the film). Achilles may have been one of the best heroes of the Greeks fighting in the war against Troy, but he definitely was not the only one nor did he in any way participate in the capture of the city (for he was dead by then). There could also have been made more out of the problematic character of Achilles, who surely is acting in an extremely bad manner when treating Hectors dead body as he does. Anyway, there was a much greater number of interesting personalities and heroes in the original story (e.g. Ajax 1 and 2, Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor) who are not shown in a way illustrating their importance (perhaps to the exception of Ulysses). The Iliad is surely not at all a story mainly concerned with Achilles and Hector. It should be stated, at least, that although Achilles had killed Hector before, Troy perhaps would not have been conquered for some more years if there hadn't been the trick of Ulysses which made its way into common language (even of todays PC world). In omitting the element of the gods, however, there is also lost a whole dimension of the story - and the one most appropriate for introducing a comic element, by the way.<br/><br/>So, on the whole, it's not a bad film and surely good entertainment, but they could have done more in doing into a movie a story of the potential the Iliad is offering."
"whattorso","Null","0","6","4 April 2007"," Greeks ? Greeks ? Spartans ? Where are you ????
","Oh lord, you mean to tell me these are Spartans ? or Greeks even ? I doubt at all that Brad Pitt knows anything about acting as a Spartan would. Apparently, if you're Spartan, you have long, clean blond hair and are starring in the most homo-erotic movie of the century. This seems to be a problem for most people to swallow, considering that people call Pitt a man's-man or the dashing lady killer. I don't think it crossed his mind that the skimpy little outfits he and the ""other Spartans"" were wearing added to the effect. Or, in ancient Greece, the concept of homosexuality at least was not defined, although men did have relations with younger boys just before the onset of puberty.<br/><br/>This seems to be the only thing good about this movie, considering that everything else is a haughty kill fest with no tension other than the occasional stretching and recoiling of men's bikini briefs by fellow Spartans. Mostly, the grunty, yet pretty soldiers here are getting their rocks off by running around in feathered helmets and doing little tricks in their chariots while Achilles prances in the air with that same kill move he uses in the film repeatedly. He's always oily and sweaty, and fine . . . he sleeps with the one woman, but you know what ??? Spartans and the rest of the people in Greece did the same while having sex with younger boys ! Go figure ! If you've read up on your history, Troy is a little out of context considering that Spartans found anything except war and fighting to be frivolous. They didn't even season what they ate let alone their sexual endeavors.<br/><br/>If you've never read up on Greek or Spartan history this movie is quite entertaining for those who failed high school social studies/history. But I must admit, even if you're a history buff, you'll have fun pointing out the little homosexual innuendos present in Troy.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend not watching this movie because there is no intended plot other than to ""recreate ?"" a particular part of history, and transpose it into something unbelievable, modern and devoid of mystery. You know what's going to happen at every turn !!! despite what you see ! I'd rent ""9 Inches To Heaven"" before watching this again, and I hate porno."

","So I like old style battle movies with spears, arrows, and swords for a closer fight. That is unmistakeably one reason I like ""Troy"". I don't like Orlando Bloom in anything (except ""Lord of the Rings""), that is one reason I don't like ""Troy"". Orlando Bloom always plays the love interest/lover-boy role, and being that I'm not a woman, that stuff doesn't interest me. The story was decent, it was based upon actual history after all. The story focused more on Achilles (Brad Pitt) and Hector (Eric Bana) more than anything, but it was all leading up to an eventual climatic battle. The battle scenes were the only scenes that interested me, and I think they strategically placed the battle scenes in the movie at points where I was just about to lose interest."

","It is not Homer. It is not the ambiguous shadow of old Greek masterpiece. But it is a movie with Peter O'Toole in a fine role. And it is important.<br/><br/>I saw ""Troy"" with any kind illusion. A film with a important budget have the respect of truth as small detail. And a film with an pure American Achilles is for heart, not for memory. But can save a single good actor this tremendous project? Peter O'Toole is a splendid Priam thanks to classical theater art. He have measure of character, a character like land who must be explored. For he, the role is not escape or a new art's stand. In his acting the important light is gives by tradition, by a interesting career, by role- second skin.<br/><br/>Like many super productions, ""Troy"" is impressive but it has not soul. It is a wood horse, a slice of glory, a epic construction in a glass box. The facts are shards of a lost pot. The images are strong and fakes. Achilleus is only a brutal macho, Paris- a dumb boy, Hector- a pink victim of duty.<br/><br/>But the essence of sadness is the absence of gods. In this case, the film relates a anonymous war, in Irak,Lichtenstein or Camelot. Troy is only a ordinary prey and the revenge is same like in a tavern. So, can a actor saves a movie, alone?"

","I was very disappointed in the way that this movie tried to rewrite the mythology. The movie itself was entertaining and the battle scenes and acting were good, but it didn't adapt very well from myth into screenplay (whereas movie like LOTR did). I do think that the movie was legitimately well made.<br/><br/>Do not see this movie if you are like me and interested in the mythology and interested in seeing it come to life.<br/><br/>However, if you really don't care very much about the classics, this movie could end up being right up your alley. Its a fairly normal Hollywood attempt to recreate someone else's work. It does a decent job of documenting the fall of Troy and you might come out enjoying it. The differences between the movie and the myth are pretty extreme though for the educated viewer."

None of the actors even have the look of the historic people. <br/><br/>The movie also has very bad dialogs, which sound extremely strange when listen to. And the whole loads of scene are just too cinematic for action movie lover about hero is untouchable. Plus it is a very inaccurate history epic. A really bad research of a scramble storyline written into a screenplay.<br/><br/>I think the movie is overdone with the little knowledge of the history and research -- making this movie look very modernize and really abrupt and somewhat incomplete. All the good actors turn into bad (except  Eric Bana) and the whole action hero scenes is just a waste of time.<br/><br/>Only good thing about this movie is the Battles Scenes which has been crafted and directed beautifully. But in the end not that convincing cause i sense too much fusion between the new and old technique of everything from screenplay to modern day dialogs to the the slow motion action sequences like in the Matrix.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Overall It Didn't Work Out Well and I'm Very Unhappy With It. <br/><br/>Rating: 4/10 (Grade: D+)"

","I now understand why this film got the mixed reviews it did? What on earth is supposed to be going on? Now I studied ancient Greece at school (not in depth) I thought the Trojan war lasted 20 years? I understand from film purposes you can't really have such a large time scale but I thought this was an EPIC!! The Bad points: Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom were truly awful. I think Paris was actually spot on but I get the feeling it was due to lack of talent in Blooms acting ability. Brad Pitt resulted in doing what every bad actress usually does in that situation  whips their clothing off and hopes no one will notice. Well Bradly we did!! When he is told that his Cousin (don't get me started on that!) has been killed he looked like he had a bad case of trapped wind. He stands around looking like someone stole his teddy, he lays around and broods, he defies the Gods (which I doubt he would have done). In the Iliad Achilles is arrogant but he is at least likable. I wanted someone to spank him! Whatever his mood (if it wasn't moody or sulky) more or less looked the same. I have to be fair it wasn't only Pitt and Bloom who failed to meet expectations others in the cast were as bad it's just that as main characters they were repeat offenders. Diane Kruger killed what should have been an absolute brilliant part to play, I think she was miscast (very pretty but I don't think she would have launched a canoe let alone1000 ships) and her and Bloom also suffered from a bad script. Peter O'Toole was wasted (the man himself said how awful the film was) what was the point of having Julie Christie in it? I feel a lot of good actors were sorely underused. <br/><br/>The changing of certain story lines. Achilles had a MALE lover (for viewers who are not familiar with The Iliad in the film his lover is his cousin), surely it wouldn't have hurt the film to keep this in, or to at least have been ambiguous about it, not make them blood related. Also I maybe wrong here (forgive me) but Achilles never actually makes it into Troy, he is killed by Paris after Achilles kills Hector. I guess the studios didn't want Mr Pitt to cop it too early  Why, did they hope the audience would stay just to see if Brad would lose his clothing again? Staying on the Brad Pitt naked theme, did we need to see him sandwiched between two (or was it three) lithe women? Was this to hammer home the point that Achilles was a red blooded warrior? We didn't need this at all. The point of Achilles heterosexuality was laboured home, far too often and detracted from the story. <br/><br/>The GOOD points: There weren't many, although I thought the scale was portrayed well, especially when all the Ships are in hiding it did make my eyes widen. <br/><br/>The hand to hand battles were excellently done (on a par with Gladiator) the blood, the guts, the confusion were wonderfully portrayed by all the cast involved, even the bad man management was well done. <br/><br/>Hector, he made me root for the Trojans. Eric Bana did a brilliant job although he should have been a bit more of a Neanderthal. A bad script did hamper him occasionally but he did the best he could and it showed, I also liked Saffron Burrows as his wife(although the character was wet  I would have thrown Helen over the city walls, Hector dies because of her!!). After Hector had been dispensed with I lost interest. <br/><br/>Brian Cox (Agamemnon) was as watchable(if a little theatrical) as ever and managed to create some light hearted moments in the film, Rose Byrne as Briseis was excellent, she gave the scenes that she was in with Pitt some credibility, she showed some genuine emotion and I hope to see her in more. <br/><br/>The person who I was not only truly impressed with was the man who was criminally underused, Sean Bean. This man made me want to weep, every scene he was in he managed to steal  I admit considering how bad the rest of the cast were that wouldn't be too hard but he did it with such aplomb. He played Odysseus, who was not only a very capable warrior but also a brilliant thinker (the man came up with the Trojan horse for Christ sakes) and he can't have been in it for more than half an hour. Whenever you heard the Yorkshire/ RP accent of Bean you knew the film was on the straight and narrow, He shamed Pitt in acting ability, he looked more at home on the battlefield than most of the stunt men and he strode around the show generally looking like he was in charge (and he was as Odysseus and as Sean bean). I just wish he could have had more screen time. <br/><br/>All in all, a popcorn epic that went astray.

It has fire, passion, huge battles, death scenes, friendship the lot. If someone made a film based entirely upon it, then people would be blown away. Sometimes the starting material is good enough without alteration, and Wolfgang Petersen chose to ignore this. Or maybe the audience simply didn't *want* an intelligent, thoughtprovoking film on the consequences of war. Maybe all they wanted was hot men in skirts.<br/><br/>Doesn't excuse the fact, how dire this movie was. Achilles and Patroclus's relationship was completely removed, and he weeps more I think for Hector, than Hector's victim. Poor Patroculs's character was mutilated- bang goes the Homeric hero, strong, brave, compassionate and enter whiny boy who doesn't know the right end of a sword.<br/><br/>The acting was terrible with few exceptions. Poor old Orlando Bloom. We all know he's nothing more than eye candy, and that we don't expect him to *act* so I will refrain from savaging him overly much. But Eric Bana and Brad Pitt- two actors who've done much better stuff than this (i.e. Fight Club.) It's sad that Hollywood hasn't realised yet, that shoving a few battles in the mix, a few woman and a nice hero, is not the recipe for a good movie. Perhaps one day, a decent director with Homeric vision, will come along and make Homer proud. Until then, don't waste your money on this trash.<br/><br/>You may be interested to know I have nothing against popular movies, so this is *not* an egoist thing. Bad movies are universal.

","Even if it was not meant to be historically accurate, this movie could have done better but didn't. Especially for those who have read the books and know the story beforehand, it was the least they could expect. Pitt (as he also pointed out) was not 100% suitable for the ""tough Achilleas"" role. His face is too soft to play an ancient character. Bana as Hector was great and Bloom as Paris was entertaining. Pitt's & Bloom's appearances were at least average. Agamemnon's part was exaggerated to the point Cox started becoming irritating. The movie was too short to cover most aspects of this story but I must admit that it is difficult to put all these things in an one-part movie.

","I found Troy an extremely disappointing movie. It is filled with dialogue scenes that remind one of soap operas. Much of the acting is deplorable. The battle scenes are great, but the pacing is flawed: the switches between dialogue, action and suspense do not work at all. The score composer seems to have had a hard time filling up the void. But the weakest point of the movie must be the story and the character development.<br/><br/>The movie makers decided to expunge all references to the more romantic aspects of the myth (i.e. the gods), which in itself might not have been a bad move. There is a big enough story to be told (in fact the Illiad is restricted to merely the events between the fight of Achilles and Agamemnon over Vryseida to the death of Hector) and plenty of heroes to become acquainted with, so the presence of gods is not strictly necessary. Thus, the altered story was not really a downside. However, the way the story is told is agonisingly bad, particularly because the lack of character development in the part of the Greeks is so great that there seems to be no motivation for their actions.<br/><br/>The Trojans, Priam, Paris and Hector and their wives all carry their characters reasonably well. But the Greek heroes are just deplorable caricatures. Achilles, for all the time he takes up on screen, only manages to come out as an adolescent whose parents don't let him play the music as loud as he wants. His wrath against Agamemnon is played out in a 10 second scene. He spends all of two minutes talking with Patroclus, and yet he is enraged when he is killed. Maybe Peterson's point was that Achilles was never really enraged.<br/><br/>To sum up: Visuals: 10/10 Music: 3/10 Pacing: 4/10 Characters: 5/10 Plot and dialogue: 3/10<br/><br/>Overall: 5"

","this film is a total piece of crap that reflects how Hollywood is totally unable to understand anything to culture or literature First of all, they were no Berverley Hills hairdressers living in ancient Greece (as far as I know). So people were not blonds with stupid haircuts Second of all, and that's the real problem, the film ignores the main characters of the book : the Gods. The troy war, as Homer tells it, is a war between the gods that are playing with the humans. To erase it for, I guess, the stupid purpose of making a so-called more realistic film, is an complete non-sens. Or maybe it was to please the Christian American fanatics ? who knows. And I don't even talk about the poetry. If Hollywood was able to understand what poetry was, I guess someone in the world would know about it.

The acting is a bit sub par i think, and it's way overproduced. Also the casting is pretty bad is several cases. Brad Pitt is a good choice, but he just isn't genuine. I like the man, but he belongs is pop movies like Fight Club and 12 Monkey's where he can be eccentric. Also, the choice for Agamemnon was atrocious, and I like him in x-men, the ring, and the borne movies, but he just isn't right for this part. They start off with a goofy occurrence as well. Achilles is sleeping through a battle with two chicks at his side. Did we see maximus doing this in Gladiator? Did we see William Wallace doing this in Braveheart.

"hotbreaf504","3","0","7","9 November 2005"," Why even try this??
","OK, what one first has to do when viewing this film is if they have any knowledge of the Illiad to forget it and just watch the movie for what it is. The movie in itself is a fairly good movie, it has good special effects, good fight scenes, and is fairly well acted by all, save the horrible Orlando Bloom. <br/><br/>However, to those of us who have knowledge of the Illiad, one question comes to mind, and that is why would an established filmmaker even attempt this film. This story is so huge I find it very difficult to fathom a two hour or two 1/2 hour movie, a mini-series maybe, but that is still stretching it. Now I know that there is the idea of a challenge and wanting to go for the glory by making a film with a great story. But then why would one discard huge facts about the story crucial to the understanding of the characters and their emotions.<br/><br/>Just a few examples, in the original stories by Homer, the Trojan war takes 12 years rather than 2 days or however long it took in the movie. Another is the almost omission of the funeral of Patroclus, this scene may be the most important event in the entire Trojan war (when Achilles climbs atop the burning funeral pyre and cuts his hair off as a sacrifice to his fallen friend and swears vengeance on Hector and the Trojans) because it is the event that brings on the fury of Achilles (the opening line of the entire Illiad) and allows him to fight against the Greeks turning the tide of the war. I also felt it was a mistake to simply not involve the Gods in the story at all, they play a major role in the original story. The Gods play roles in the outcomes of several battles during the story, are the parents of certain characters including Achilles, and if it were not for the Gods involvement I am convinced that Hector would have beat Achilles in their showdown.<br/><br/>These are only a few of the examples that these filmmakers overlooked in making this film. Now I have no problem with somebody telling their own version of the story of Troy, and if this what Wolfgang Peterson and Company claimed this to be it is actually a decent movie, however do not give Homer credit like they do because this is not Homer's Trojan war."
"IrishKitty","6","0","2","26 October 2005"," Somewhat shallow, clumsy affair
","I've just watched Troy, long after it's release and after hearing a variety of comments on it from terrible to exceptional. It stands amongst some serious competition and cannot help but be compared to Gladiator, Braveheart and other such battle-filled epics. The plot is well put together, not too complicated and somewhat familiar to everyone, particularly Helen of Troy and the Trojan Horse concept. It is disappointing then that the two above are not so special in the film. Helen's beauty is mentioned by some characters, but her character is never really fleshed out and contradictory in her spontaneous fleeing with Paris and then her subsequent world weary 'wisdom' when she says she finds naive Paris 'so young'. The Horse is none too magnificent, a dull, smaller than I expected creation with about 10 Greeks in it. And it appears so late in the film, it is almost forgotten. The battles were also a disappointment after such shocking shows in Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, Gladiatior, The Patriot and so on. Some of the individual fighting looked clumsy and awkward, perhaps in an attempt to convey their heavy weapons and armour, but I think it could have been choreographed better. Only Pitt and Bana appear to have had well practiced routines. The acting is a mixed bag, Pitt sports a perplexed look for the half the film, his fame hungry Achilles maybe a little unsure of himself, making him impossible to love or hate either way. He is given too much time in the film, too many brooding shots, too sentimental a last scene. The film could have been called Achilles and it would have made more sense, such was the director's apparent fascination with the tanned, toned hero/anti-hero. Bana was a revelation to me, I'm not a fan but he brought depth and gravity to Hector, as a warrior, son, brother, husband and father, all the responsibilities on him. For this I think his final fight scene with Achilles too short and not worthy of his performance. Peter O'Toole was excellent, a proud but broken King with much dignity. Overall, a little too long, too chopped into sections of battle and storytelling with some over-the-top CGI moments of thousands of ships and marching men. It is worth a look but not the best it could have been."

","Once again, Hollywood writers can't think of something original. Greek myths all contained a moral, most of them were about human nature. This particular one has been turned into a story about a coward (played by heart-throb Orlando Bloom)that steals another man's wife and gets away with it. His brother and father get killed for his sake and his country is destroyed, but he gets away in the end. So I guess stealing another man's wife isn't considered a bad thing to do in Hollywood. I guess it doesn't PAY to let a thing like morality to get in the way of your pursuit of the Almighty Dollar.<br/><br/>In the Greek myth, Paris gets what he deserves in the end. <br/><br/>Casting Brad Pitt as Achilles was an excellent call, though. Achilles was handsome and extremely vain. Casting Sean Bean as Odysseus was good too. Pretty good visual effects, and good acting for the most part."

The movie holds your interest, although there are a few cringe moments, with some terribly poor or clichéd lines.

","Sex is hotter in war. Love is more passionate. Women are turned on by it. No one experiences pain. Misery is a chance to act out. Looting and burning are a gas. Everything is sorted in a flash. Hormones make the world go round.<br/><br/>The battle of Troy --- in fact the war for Ilium, but don't let's bother about a mere detail like the name of the city in question --- according to those who lived much closer in time than we, bore no resemblance whatsoever to this utter travesty, which sacrifices all to make war into glamorous entertainment and, ultimately, recruitment propaganda.<br/><br/>The war was determined by the gods, and took longer to decide than Julius Caesar's eight-year campaign to conquer France. ""The gods"" is no mere word. A scientist called Julian Jaynes has written a fascinating study (look it up) of how The Iliad shows that men thought differently in that era, before men's capacities were externalised into technology. ""The gods"" describes a superior mentality that we would do well to research and attempt to restore, if we want a livable future world.<br/><br/>The idea of men fighting a war over a woman had an irony for the Classical world that we have lost, because the Greek ruling class was entirely bisexual, as was Achilles (although that is censored out here). Menelaus was doubly moronic for dragging Greece into a drawn-out bloodbath over a dame when he had innumerable boys on whom to sate his lust.<br/><br/>To view the supplementary features about this film, you really start wondering how far off the day is when no actors or sets will be required for an epic. Brad Pitt must have pondered the deeper significance of his lines about immortality when he reflected that his image could be recreated on screen in any number of roles indefinitely, using the powers of CGI."

","I recently watched ""Troy"" for a second time and realized just what a mediocre snooze fest it is. I hadn't been all that impressed with Troy after the first viewing, and this movie does not hold up well with repeated viewings.<br/><br/>Like most period pieces these days, Troy at least is a good looking picture. The costumes, the landscapes, the ships, the palaces, etc are all very nice to look at. Brad Pitt is nice to look at as well, but his character Achilles is as dull as a doorknob. One just does not care about what happens to Achilles. The other characters are similar. Diane Kruger brings nothing to the role of Helen - for the face that launched a thousand ships, she's pretty lifeless. Orlando Bloom's Paris has a little more personality than everyone else in the movie - but he's such a loathsome coward that one is rooting for him to die soon rather than truly interested in what will happen to him.<br/><br/>The storyline just drags on and on. Even when there are fights and battles, they are boring. I was disappointed that the supernatural elements of the original myth were not included in this movie. Paris ticking off the goddesses, Achilles being dipped in the Styx, and other events involving the gods of Olympus would have spiced up the story a little bit. As it stands, the plot is dull and way too long.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that one is really not sure who to root for in the movie. It isn't clear who the good guys and the bad guys are supposed to be. There is no hero in this movie, and there isn't even an anti-hero. Perhaps a better screenwriter could have done a nice job of playing up the ambiguity between good and evil in Troy and made it interesting. Instead the lack of a protagonist and antagonist makes one care nothing about any of the characters and makes for a very painful 3 hour movie. When Troy is finally over, you don't feel sad that Achilles has died, or happy that Troy has burned, or any of that. You're just glad that the movie is finally done."
"lizabuffy","5","0","3","12 August 2005"," Troy is not completely unwatchable if taken as simply as a film, but if taken as representing the literary works of the Virgil and Homer, it is a dismal failure
","The film is based predominantly on Homer's Iliad, although it takes cues from the Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid. The screen play was written by David Benioff and falls amazingly short of its inspiration. The movie is full of sweeping changes from Homer's work. When one changes the work of a literary master, it would be hoped this would be for the better, to make a work more accessible to a general audience. In the case of Troy all it does is serve to confuse the issue and paint the Iliad as a love story, which most certainly was not.<br/><br/>Let us start with the literary inaccuracies that run so rampant throughout the film. It opens up with King Agamemnon at Thessaly. Achilles is to fight Boagrius (a completed fabricated character) to settle control of the nation. In this half hazard introduction we learn Achilles is the son of Thetis, a goddess. This is close to the only mention of the gods, a major force in the Iliad, in the entirety of the film. From this addition the film skips to Paris taking Helen from Sparta. Paris and Hector are depicted as having a deep love of one another, but even this simple connection is not accurate. Hector was angered by the actions of Paris and felt him a coward unworthy of being a prince. He did not protect Helen for Paris, he defended Troy from the Greeks.<br/><br/>Menelaus goes to Agamemnon for aid in retrieving Helen so he can ""kill her with his own two hands"" when he retrieves her. This could not be further from the literary reality. In the Odyssey one learns Helen returns to Menelaus after the fall of Troy and continues on as the Queen of Sparta. Not only does Menelaus not wish to kill Helen, he himself does not die. Of course, this is little fact is over looked when Paris meets Menelaus on the field of battle. The conflict between the two is accurate, Paris did run away (although this is with the assistance of Aphrodite), however Menelaus being killed by Hector is not. The very act of killing him would have been against the rules of engagement and are counter to the character of Hector.<br/><br/>Achilles is shown as removing himself from the battle when Agamemnon takes Briseis away from him. This is accurate; this slight is the reason for the anger of Achilles in the Iliad. However, Briseis is not an acolyte of Apollo, nor the cousin of Hector. She was a wife claimed as a prize in early fighting that Agamemnon claims as his own when he is forced to give up his own prize to avert a plague brought on the Greeks by Apollo. Making Briseis a cousin to Hector only served to muddle the plot. It also failed to show her connection with Achilles or Patroclus.<br/><br/>Patroclus is another character to suddenly find himself in a new family. He was never the cousin of Achilles; he was his dearest friend and comrade. He did manage to get himself killed, which was the turning point for Achilles rejoining the battle, but it was not an accident. Patroclus asked permission of Achilles to take his armor and lead the Myrmidons into battle. Achilles allowed his, even watching much of the battle from his ship. Hector knew he was fighting Patroclus and intended to kill him. <br/><br/>After killing Patroclus, Hector shows his wife how to escape the city. This never happened. In fact, she ends up being sold as a concubine and Hector's son is thrown from the walls of Troy.<br/><br/>In Troy, upon learning of the death of Patroclus, Achilles goes to the walls of the city and demands Hector come down and face him. In the poem Hector is caught outside of the walls of Troy because of his own hubris is not returning to the city in the face of his numerous victories. <br/><br/>When Achilles kills Hector he does drag the body, but he does this for more than a day. It is the twelve days he spends defiling the body that prove to dehumanize him and show how far he has fallen. It is this fall that allows for the catharsis at the end of the Iliad between Priam and Achilles. This catharsis is hinted at in Troy, but is never fully reached. Priam is stripped of his courage when he comes to Achilles in the film. Rather than risking his life and coming with a ransom for the body of Hector he just shows up in the tent. The act of Achilles offering him food and protection is skipped over. It is the conversation with Priam about his own father that moves Achilles to return the body. The entire point of Priam and Achilles together is lost.<br/><br/>Benioff obviously had a great love of the Trojans, if his portrayal of their characters versus that of the Greeks is any indication. He paints Agamemnon and Menelaus in a very bad light, gives Paris and Hector a great nobility and gives far too much screen time to Helen. Homer did a better job of remaining impartial and he was Greek.<br/><br/>Given his liberties, it is unsurprising that during the funeral of Hector (the actual ending place of the Iliad) the Greeks build the ""Trojan Horse"" to send in. This is drawn from the Aeneid, and even it did not describe a horse full of soldiers. The reality is this was most likely a siege engine used on the gates of Troy. Engines during this time could have been described as horse like. From this horse Achilles and other Greek soldiers pour out into the city. Achilles goes to save and dies dramatically in her arms after Paris shoots him (minus the aid of Apollo) through his ankle. Of course, this is after Briseis managed to kill Agamemnon (also not based in literary reality)."

If one merely wanted to reconstruct the legend of the Trojan War as depicted in the ""Iliad"" one wouldn't need, for example, the wholly gratuitous sexism that is evident thought-out ""Troy."" ""Troy"" seems to serve as the counterpoint to ""Alexander"" which depicts Greeks as great fighters but as rather effeminate and, perhaps, homosexual as opposed to ""Troy's"" constant reminder that the ends to be attained are to ""keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds!"" The totally overblown masculinity of the characters is made quite unbelievable in a film where there is no female nudity but where Brad Pitt is in some degree of undress in almost every scene. Brad is an attractive man but the constant flashing of his oiled torso is a little much.<br/><br/>Besides that, Pitt as Achilles is a totally one dimensional character. Achilles is an unlikeable, self-centered asshole who thinks only of his name being remembered in posterity (what the Greeks called ""arete"") I began to wonder why I should care about Achilles and his everlasting glory after the first time he is shown on screen. His only redeeming quality is that the scenes of him fighting are entertaining in the way its almost superhuman. Orlando Bloom (Paris) looks like he's thirteen years old and a girl, a very whiny girl at that. Eric Bana's (Hector) constant, unabating patriotic jargon and implied atheism is tiresome. His father, King Priam, is portrayed as a foolish old coot who consistently makes poor decisions because he listens to the priest instead of to common sense. One is quickly led to wonder how the hell a man as impressionable and inept as King Priam has been able to keep Troy from utter destruction this long. There is a part where Hector asserts that the Trojans should remain inside the city and allow the Greeks to attack because the walls of Troy are unbreachable. This seems to make sense since the Trojans were able to repell a large force of Greeks only the day before but, like a superstitious idiot, Priam listens to the priest instead. The same happens when Paris advises Priam to burn the horse the Trojans had left on the beach but, of course, Priam listens to the priest yet again and Troy is raided and destroyed. And yet we are supposed to accept that Priam is a good king because he is motivated by love of his country while Agamemnon is motivated by greed and avarice. Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is, unfortunately, the most well cast actor in the movie. While far from convincing, he at least looks sort of greedy and cantankerous.<br/><br/>Another gripe is that, much like ""Alexander"", the director couldn't figure out what accent the actors should use. Some of the actors have Irish and Scottish accents, while Brad Pitt and Eric Bana try to have British accents (which they don't), Hector's (Bana's) wife has some accent that's supposed to be Greek sounding but isn't, etc. I can't understand why the director can't choose one accent and have everyone, at least, try to approximate it.<br/><br/>The love stories in this film are hokey and unconvincing too. Achilles' romance with the cousin of King Priam who has been taken hostage is abusive. Its not clear why she is troubled when Achilles is slain at the end since he's killed her cousin Hector and, on top of that, she doesn't seem to care about him that much throughout the movie prior to that time. The relationship between Paris and Helen is unconvincing as well. It seems that Helen doesn't really like Paris but only eloped with him to escape the loveless and abusive relationship she had with her betrothed, King Menelaus. She comforts Paris when he's constantly whining but it seems as if she's only with him because he's boyishly handsome while Menelaus is a grizzled, portly, middle-aged guy. These relationships might also not have been as convincing as the script writers would have wished because the actors they chose to play the lovers stink and have no on-screen chemistry.<br/><br/>While the battle scenes were entertaining, they weren't good enough to save this film. The soundtrack made me think I was watching ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" at times and ""A Walk in the Clouds"" at others. I don't know who the hell chose the song for the closing credits. It sounds like Teddy Pendergrass singing with the interspersal of the Arabic woman in the background at times. I had to turn the DVD off when the credits came on because this song is so incredibly cheesy and out of keeping with the film I'd just seen that it hurt to listen anymore.<br/><br/>All and all, Wolfgang Peterson took a premise that could have been wildly entertaining and ruined it with an all-star cast of bad actors and bad storytelling. Surprisingly, the movie is still entertaining. It took me two watches to realize to what extent it sucked, which isn't bad since I realized Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" sucked after just a few minutes. Bravo Peterson, Bravo!"

","(Never have so many missed so much. <br/><br/>Fist, who is this Homer that wrote the poems, accompanied by lute, the two songs, The Ilyad and The Odyssey? A first year student knows that there is but one survivor, Odysseus, Song of Zeus ""brackets not allowed"" Son of Zeus, which is to say, Son of God. And these are his stories. Because only he survived, there can be no other Author than this king, of the Achayans and Ithaca (the rocky island), Odyesseus, whom many have tried to rename as Hercules, aka, Herakles, son of Hera, which Odysseus was not. That would be Ars, not Aries whom the Romans called Apollo (again, not Apollyon his antithesis of the Roman Herodians) who, when felled by Pallas Athena, goddess and sister of Odysseus, through their Father Zeus, created the Seven Hills of Rome, and where Romulus and Remus claimed their Spartan ancestry. (""wherefrom"" was edited by the site speller, apparently, a non-English speaking native.) <br/><br/>Second, what are both the Ilyad and the Odyssey about? The life of Odysseus. No more, no less. Ilyum, erroneously called ""Troy"" again by the Herodians, is the land of the Hitites and bears their symbol, the Swastika, which 3,000 years later was to be embraced by the Nazi's in a vain attempt to claim lineage from them. <br/><br/>It is a hill about 12 miles south of Phildelphia in Turkey. <br/><br/>The Turks, in their white slave trading habits (how Priam got so rich), have kidnapped Helen. <br/><br/>The first epoch, The Ilyad, is the united Greek Empire punishing these Eastern civilizations for their slave trade of Greek women. <br/><br/>The second epoch, The Odyssey, is about the sole survivor's return home to the treachery in the now capital of the empire. The politicians to be most bloodily slain for their own transgressions against the king, the recognized (""reconised"" edited by bonehead speller) son of the Greek king of the gods, Zeus. <br/><br/>If Odyesseus is not the focal point of the story, then the story is false. And in history when falsehoods replace truth via poetic license, it is called propaganda, or, a lie. A prettied pictured as given by the men who rewrite history past. You cannot take poetic license with a poem. Period. You can only tell a lie thereby. The poet does not grant to Hollywood any such license to alter his works. And there is the Amercian tragedy, they do it anyway because they ""think"" they are artists; worse, they ""think"" they are poets. A poet and an artist is the man who lives the story and writes about it, and never the ones who simply rewrite it for personal gain and fortune. <br/><br/>Had the actual epoch been read, and the proper research done, it would have been quite clear to both recent filmmakers that their vision was blind. Not just in the account, but severely in the cast. <br/><br/>The same university scholars that acclaim these films are from those institutions that also called Heinrich Schliemann a fool for thinking the Trojan War was anything more than a myth, and then reversed face when the first archaeologist (""archaeologist edited by bonehead speller). (The sound is Latin, bonehead, ""ae"" pronounced ""a"" not ""e"") taught the universities the first real archeology (bonedhead edit two on (""archaeology"") while proving the fact of The Ilyad and The Odyssey. <br/><br/>And throughout this they have all missed the basis of the Swastika, symbol of the Hitites and their rebirth as ash can (""ashkenazi"" edited by bonehead who obviously does not know Hebrew), as opposed to edit far deem, (""sephardim"" edited by bonehead, who needs to go to school to learn how to spell, and learn some poetry and art). <br/><br/>In the end, the two films are the myths, and the epochs are the facts as misrepresented and entirely not entertaining versions of the not entertaining industry thereby. You cannot justify the ""cutting"" floor by revenues. How many times will the ""dudes"" in Hollywood make this mistake and blame others before admitting their own myopic not creative vision? <br/><br/>A cell phone with Internet would be more entertaining than a cast of LA's who have no idea of what part they are playing in LaLaland. <br/><br/>And one other fact they all missed. To feed 100,000 soldiers, you pit broil cows (""heffers"" edit). Thus, the sacrifice to the gods is that of feeding your army. And what exactly happens when you fail to do this? Don't 100,000 men get a little riled about this and impose the will of the gods? What did you think? That Zeus cared all that much about a few cows and not about feeding his followers? Historians and Hollywood, two blind directors they have heard somewhere, but not being the ""traveller,"" the Bard, have no idea of what the Warrior was talking about. (edit too long; again, bonehead site) Where was all this ""vision"" by these two directors and these two casts? With the Cyclops, obviously. <br/><br/>Kirk Douglas still rules as the only one to get the part right, and his director to get the story right. <br/><br/>And neither these two directors nor casts of this end of our millennium set of inept even comes close. These productions are so ""mish-mosh"" edit by bonehead and watered down for some PG rating attempt, that they hang like an albatross about Beverly Hills. A Know Nothing story by Know Nothing story repeaters. How then do they question the box office flops? <br/><br/>Thank God Hollywood rejected ""The Lord Of The Rings."" Else Tolkien and the history of Midgarde as well would have been a LaLaland ""candycane"". <br/><br/>Claim what you will, but do not claim the existence of ""vision"" in Hollywood. It is the vision of the idiot bonehead who did the spelling for a movie site. How stupid can you get?"

","Troy could have been a terrific film, it really could. The story is well known and a very good one, but in this nothing seems to work. Pitt is truly dire as the lead, his emotions poorly conveyed and his general screen presence sadly lacking. As for Orlando Bloom, well, the man should be banned from ever again appearing in cinema. His performance is so embarrassingly wooden that you sometimes imagine the film is set in a forest. He adds nothing at all to anything he stars in. The battle scenes were not too bad, but the pace of Troy is agonisingly slow at times and you soon wish it was all over. Sean Bean makes a welcome appearance, but only for a short while, and it's sad to see him passing the time in tripe like this when we know he can perform so well in shows of Sharpe's ilk. Troy should be remade with some decent actors and more action, then it might be worth a look! In terms of battle scenes, the viewer is left feeling short-changed. Troy is one to miss."

I mean, some one really should tell him that acting is more than just striking a pose, displaying a chubby profile and staring grimly. Of course, maybe he got it right; it could be that in reality Achilles was nothing more than a baby-faced shmoe with a couple of sword tricks and a rep. If so, then maybe this is why he's mostly remembered for a weakness (ie, world-class tendonitis).<br/><br/>Still, if placing inappropriate individuals in the roles of legendary and semi-legendary heroes should sadly become the norm, I want to get on board as quickly as possible--to avoid the rush.

"jamesmcguirk","5","0","4","6 May 2005"," Bad, but not that bad
","I watched this movie for the second time last night and I must say, I actually enjoyed it. First of all, though, let me say that I accept most if not all of the negative critique that has been directed at this film. As one reviewer rightly points out, the film claims to be based on Homer's Iliad but then includes the story of the Trojan horse which is, of course, taken from the much later Aeneid of Virgil. Incidentally, the same reviewer wonders about Achilles' girlfriend in the film. In fact, the character of Briseis is present in the Iliad and she is the reason for the stand-off between Achilles and Agamemnon - though not really for the reasons presented here. The demise of Agamemnon is also inaccurate and seems to have been added to provide a tidy Hollywood ending. In fact, the character of Agamemnon generally is somewhat mistreated in this presentation. He comes across as a far less pleasant character than the Agamemnon we find in the epic itself. Then there's the issue of the gods. Not only are they omitted from the story here but the characters (especially Achilles and, to an extent, Hector too) are irreverent in a way that would be incomprehensible to the Greeks themselves. Having said this, I wonder how the film could have been made otherwise. For example, in the battle between Paris and Menelaus, the Iliad tells us that before Menelaus can kill Paris, Aphrodite descends in a cloud and rescues the Trojan prince and whisks him away to the safety of his chambers. Could this be included in the filmed version? Would it have resonance to a contemporary audience? Probably not. Of course, I accept that a film like this is dangerous insofar as it gives the non-reading audience the sense that they now know the story while what is found here is a significantly altered (butchered?) version. But the point is that the real story requires the kind of suspension of disbelief (gods appearing and disappearing in the midst of battle, changing sides and the fact that the outcome has been determined by Zeus before the whole thing starts) that would make it difficult for a contemporary audience. This is not an excuse but a reason. As far as the good aspects of the film are concerned, I actually think that in spite of the aforementioned modernising features of the film, we do sometimes get a sense of more genuinely Homeric notions such as 'philotimia' or the love of honour. This was a crucial aspect of the sensibilities of the Homeric age and it is well represented here even if somewhat disjoined from any concomitant theological implications. As far as the performances are concerned, Peter O'Toole and Brendan Gleeson do well with the characters of Priam and Menelaus respectively. Eric Bana isn't bad though Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom are weak. And Brian Cox, notwithstanding the characterisation of Agamemnon is always enjoyable to watch. Overall, then, a bad re-telling of the Iliad if that is what it is supposed to be but, if one can bracket that kind of purist demand, an enjoyable action film with some great action sequences and good performances."
"lkeele55","7","0","2","3 May 2005"," Not Homer, but not bad either
","This film only marginally resembles the Iliad in plot. Characters get killed who shouldn't; characters survive who didn't, relationships are strange, and the war is remarkably short. Hektor is not a pacifist in the book, and his wife never begs him to stay home from the war.<br/><br/>But it's a visual feast, with good pacing, and remarkable acting. It's a good story in its own right. I always suspected Agamemnon was nothing but a sensualist brute, and that Akhilleus was reflective about all the many men he'd killed. Also, Sean Bean makes a perfect Odysseus.<br/><br/>If you somehow missed this movie the first time around, I couldn't say it's a ""must see,"" but it does make for an enjoyable evening."
"lemon_magic","7","0","2","1 May 2005"," Meant to be a blockbuster, but comes across as a TNT miniseries
","This is a very curious case of the whole being less than the sum of its parts. The supporting cast is very strong, the big stars do a creditable job, and there is great photography, wonderful sets and costumes, and soundtrack. but somehow it just doesn't have the impact of a major Hollywood movie. In spite of the big screen ""A"" list production values, somehow this version of the Iliad looks as if it should have been done as a 2-5 part miniseries for one of the cable channels.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem is the way the whole siege of Troy is chopped down so that somehow the whole thing seems to take maybe a week to 10 days, instead of the years and years of the original story. You get no sense of a lengthy siege, or of repeated skirmishes and ebbs and flows in the morale and effectiveness of the troops on each side. Instead you have the thrust for the capital, a counter attack that pushes the Greeks back, a bit of waiting, a skirmish where Achilles' friend dies, the duel between Achilles and Hector, and the actual incident with the Horse. And that's about it for the ""war"".<br/><br/>Another part of the problem is Brad Pitt. The film chooses to play his character Achilles as a sullen, fey (in the 'doomed' sense of the word ) passive-aggressive battle Diva who only fights for people he respects (or likes) or for personal glory. I realize that a lot of the actual Iliad is spent with Achilles sulking in his tent and the Greek commanders trying to get him to come out and fight for them, but Pitt just isn't imposing enough a presence to justify all this fuss in the film. Yes, he's buff, but he isn't dangerous or legendary looking, just kind of weary and sullen and glum. (BTW I'm not a Pitt basher on principle - I thought he was hilarious and believable as the Gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champ in 'Snatch' and as Tyler Durden in 'Fight Club').<br/><br/>Similarly, the director and the main actors all seem to choose to play their historical counterparts as limited, self-aware, troubled men who seem overburdened by the demands of their stations and of the war. The one exception is King Agamemmnon, who is a completely despicable one dimensional power monger. Oddly, he is also perhaps the most compelling figure in the movie - perhaps this is because Brian Cox is capable of playing some of the most menacing villains and bad guys in the history of film. (As good as Anthony Hopkins' version of Hannibal Lector was,Cox's was even better and more subtle). So possibly going for the 'human' dimension of the main characters in the Trojan war made the actual epic scale of the conflict shrink somewhat.<br/><br/>One high point in the film is the early duel between Paris and Menelaus (Helen's cuckolded husband). Watching Brendon Gleeson play Menelaus as a huge, scary, burly warrior in a towering rage, it's hard to believe that this is the same actor who played the sad-sack hick sheriff in ""Lake Placid"", or the amiable father who offers refuge to the lovers in ""28 Days Later"". That's amazing range in a heavyset middle aged male actor. And Orlando Bloom keeps his ego out of the picture (this is the guy who played the invincible Elven warrior Legolas in LOTR, remember) and lets reality rule as Menelaus absolutely demolishes the smaller, younger Paris and sends him crawling to his brother for help. That, to me, was cool film making.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film quite a bit, and admired quite a few things about it, but nevertheless felt somewhat let down. But I'd watch it again, and probably enjoy it more, on the small screen."

If it hadst been for the superb presence and acting of he who played Hector and the excellent portrayal of Priam then it might have totally floundered. the fighting sequences were often too hurried and chopped around too swiftly for some to establish who was doing what to whom. Casting for this movie seems to have been done more on who is 'in' at the moment, rather than who could best portray the character. Certainly I found Pitt's display as Achilles somewhat painful. But my main beef is with the tampering with the story. I cant say history obviously, but things which I expected to come to pass simply didn't and some things portrayed were totally unexpected. This could have been a great movie. It will languish in the corner of my DVD collection for those days when I fancy some light entertainment and don't care too much about what I watch."

The movie is almost three hours long and feels twice that. The biggest flaw is the over-abundance of unsympathetic characters. The film focuses on Achilles (Brad Pitt), a pompous warrior who is too full of himself to be the focus of a feature of such length. I quickly grew bored with him and wished for every scene with him to be over quickly. The character of Paris (Orlando Bloom) seems to be a spoiled, rich brat who does not care what the consequences of his actions are. Again, he takes up too much screen time. The only appealing characters are Hector (Eric Bana), the brother of Paris and the only one involved in the proceedings with an intelligent head on his shoulders. Sadly, his character meets an unfortunate end. Peter O'Toole, as the king of Troy, is wasted in an underwritten, far too short role. Had the focus been re-adjusted onto Hector and away from Achilles, this picture would have been much better. Also, as with most movies made today, the computer effects are overdone and unconvincing."

It's too expensive to see at the theaters and too expensive as a DVD, but quickly nabbed up as a previously viewed DVD at my rental place. Truth be told, I could have waited longer. A massive amount of creative license went into this movie. It is a highly stylish and visually stunning movie with epic written over it, but that's all it has. The inaccuracies and contradictions are enough to make you cringe. Wolfgang Petersen's attempt to create a historically factual film without the fantasy ingredients is noble, but if you want a full story of the Trojan War, you need to include Protesilaus, Penthesilia and the Amazons, Philoctetes, Diomedes, Cassandra, Pyrrhus, Aeneas, Anchises, Hecuba, Scamander, Astyanax, Oenone, Lycus, Idomeneus and a host of other major characters. There's too much talk of legacies and glories and a vague overview of missing incidents that were dropped from the screen play. The war lasted ten years, not a month. As far as the cast, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom provide fair and noble performances, but Achilles is played by Brad Pitt as a restrained pretty-boy psycho with Hitler tendencies rather than the noble warrior he was. Peter O'Toole, an Irishman, a Celt, enemy of the Romans, plays Priam; Zeus must be loving that! Brian Cox seems miscast as Agamemnon and portrays him with the same personality of all his other movie roles. Lastly, I have a lot of offense with Diane Kruger playing Helen; she looks more like a movie star than a princess. Sienna Guillory from ""Helen of Troy"" with her more natural beauty would have been a better cast choice. ""Troy"" is pretty much all grandeur, but it lacks the romance of ""Helen of Troy"" and the spirit of ""Odysseus"" with Armand Assante. Once someone merges the best ingredients and cast choices of those movies, then and only then will we see a truly great Trojan War story!"

But I cannot let him and much of the rest of the cast off for this film, and all of those enigmatic stares they kept doing.<br/><br/>Script: Apparently the writers think that an audience is incredibly stupid and frequently forgets whats going on. At some point it is mentioned that Brad Pitt wants to secure his legacy. Then, just as the stupid audience begins to forget, somebody mentions ""he wants people to remember him when he's dead"". Then a few minutes later a different character says ""Achilles wants men to remember his name in x years time"". By this time I want to forget everything about this film.<br/><br/>Camera-work: Picture the scene: something bad happens to an unfortunate character. Other characters leave, giving the disappointed/sad/upset/thoughtful character a good chance to stare at the camera with an appropriate expression to show the audience just how disappointed/sad/upset/thoughtful they are.

I remember the gods' importance and interference in the events of mankind in these epics. But without them, the events of the film are steered by human flaws and strengths alone. Thus, going to war in Troy is because of human lust, greed, ambition, shame and hatred...not because the gods are angry. It's tailored for a modern audience skeptical of the reasons given for war, for better or worse, and it's a valid topic. Compared to the earth-bound behavior of the Greeks, Priam's adherence to signs and omens from the gods seems silly. And in a modern context, it is.<br/><br/>I had problems, however, with the Trojan War lasting about the length of a weekend, like a four-day thing we get with Thanksgiving. This war is fabled to have lasted TEN YEARS!!!! You might as well have entitled the film ""Vietnam"" and put it in the jungle for a weekend of lush greenery. Traveling by ship from Athens to Troy would have taken longer than the time frame of the movie! Hell, it took Odysseus ten years just to get BACK from Troy! <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!! <br/><br/>Speaking of being faithful to other works of Greek literature . . . the killing of Agamemnon was just plain stupid, and totally avoidable. Has anyone in Hollywood heard of The Oresteia? Was it included in their syllabus entitled ""Hackery 100?"" Also, the romance between Achilles and the Trojan princess was incredibly lame. It was good to see Brad Pitt's character care about SOMETHING in this movie, other than his own immortal fame. It made us care about him more. But there had to have been another way, other than making up a Trojan character and having her fall in love with the guy who just killed her countrymen. It was a stretch that simply didn't work.<br/><br/>And the CGI moments were basically useless. We all know it's CGI. The ""scope"" they're trying to bring to the conflict isn't heightened by digital armies and armadas.<br/><br/>So, some good things and some really bad things in this movie. I'm still on the fence."
"paulcreeden","6","0","1","13 March 2005"," Not even Homer lite
","The Iliad was not all about Achilles. But this movie is all about Brad Pitt. I am a big fan of Mr. Pitt for many reasons. However, I am a much more avid fan of Homer, whose Iliad has been massacred by this 1950s epic with 21st Century special effects. The sacking of Troy cannot compare to the devastation wrought on Homer's epic poem by this production. ""Lord of the Rings"" received far better treatment on all levels. Brian Cox plays Agamemnon with Vaudevillian villainy. Brendon Gleeson takes a better stab at Menelaus, but it is not his finest hour. Orlando Bloom's Paris is prettier than Helen of Troy. And bless the memory of Peter O'Toole, who, despite age and infirmity, gave this movie its only dose of class. In fairness, I should also credit Sean Bean with a somewhat respectable Odysseus. The staged beefcake shots were calendar worthy, I suppose, but even the passion seemed canned and stale. My vote of 6 goes to all the crew and post production folks who did a great job on the look of the film, with the exception of the really bad hair extensions. Why can't someone have the guts and vision to do the Classics with intelligence and respect for both the original brilliance of the stories and the intelligence of an audience? The Iliad could have been done much better with less flash."

Orlando Bloom, Mr. peach fuzz, and Diane Gruger, the slut that launched a thousand ships, are the perfect bland couple. Orlando can't even act wussy, although he did manage at the Oscars to look like a frightened child, and Diane has no allure at all. Peter O' Toole plays the aged king well with Saffron Burrows as the scared wife, Sean Bean as wise Ulysses, Brendan Gleeson as vengeful Menalaes, and Tyler Mane as the hulking brute Ajax. Julie Christie as mommy Achilles and James Cosmo(Braveheart, Highlander) as a general are strong in small roles. Brian Cox looks like he is having fun as power hungry Agemennon, while Eric Bana is sturdy as brave Hector. The costumes, sets, and fights are impressive, but the script, score, and casting scar what could have been a great epic. Brad Pitt as Achilles and Diane Kruger as Helen are not strong enough in these roles. They may look the part very well, but they don't nail the two most crucial roles. This bastardized Homer may have worked better with these two roles in someone else's hands."

Sure the acting was very wooden(even from Pitt, who I know can act), but overall it was a watchable experience. Anyway reasons that I didn't like it were that the story was all wrong. Hector was a warrior and not the King's son, Hector's wife did die, as did his child. Achilles was killed by the arrow through his heel and not ones fired at his stomach, although he was indeed killed by the King's son Paris. Pegaclus was not Achilles' cousin, he was a very close friend. There are also many more points I could point out. I think it is wrong that Hollywood changed about the facts of this famous story. Although I have to admit the story they did come up with was well put together.

"film-critic","5","0","1","21 February 2005"," Careful boy, my mercy has limits.
","My feelings on Troy are mixed. While I did enjoy the action/war scenes that reminded me of Lord of the Rings, there was the small detail to the story and plot that just completely blew my mind. Why, if you are going to make a history epic such as this, would you focus so intently on the characters that the story (which should have been the star of the film) pretty much falls to the wayside? I think that it has something to do with who you have carrying your story. If you have actors that are a little less defined in their careers, perhaps you would focus more on the story giving us the way that Homer would have been happy with. Instead, we headline huge actors to carry the roles and focus more on the shirtless wonders of the world instead of the written word. It is sad and unforgivable at the same time.<br/><br/>To begin, let me tell you what I really liked about this film, which shouldn't take up too much space, but is still worthy of mention. I loved the grand scale of this film. When I read Homer's work, I didn't think of this tiny little incident that felt and looked like a back lot to a movie studio. I wanted epic visions of land, wars, and chaos. I wanted to be placed right in the action by being transported to the era visually and audibly. Director Wolfgang Petersen did this with the greatest of ease. This is a big production film, and he never allowed us to forget that. Second, I enjoyed the smaller stories of this film. The hints and references made to the culture at the time that allowed those three years of Latin class, Greek Mythology, and history of Troy seemed to constantly keep a grin on my face and my mind in motion. It reminded me of Disney's Hercules, one of the most under-appreciated Disney films out there. There were subtle hints and clever moments that just placed that intelligent smile on your face. Troy did the same even threw in a couple ""fun"" CGI moments for everyone to share, but sadly that was it.<br/><br/>If you could turn the sound off on your television or surround sound and watch this film, you probably will experience a better picture than I did. From the opening scene until the very anti-climactic moment in Troy, the hardest trouble that I had was the accents that accompanied our actors. Brian Cox is one of the worst as I nearly found myself laughing in hysteria when he bellowed his first lines in a very un-Greek British accent. This was followed by Orlando Bloom dawning a very unmasculine British accent coupled with Peter O'Toole looking very un-Trojan in his element. If that wouldn't have been the tip of the ice cream, we were allowed to add sprinkles with the grunting force of Brad Pitt as our heroine/anti-heroine Achilles. Taking moments from Rocky and Cobra, Pitt gives us his worst performance to date as a man given the strength of millions, but the emotions of a child. It is sad to see Pitt butcher such an amazing character and never look back in suspicion. This was not the role for him, and somebody (even the best boy) should have stepped out of his place to inform the Hollywood hitter that perhaps he was making a grave mistake. Unfortunately, nobody came through and Troy was created and the power of Fight Club was thrown right out the window. Corporate Hollywood had its field day in the Trojan sun.<br/><br/>Another steaming issue that I had with this film was the pacing and timing of the overall picture. Why did it take two hours to get to the most popular moment of the film? Why did Petersen bog the viewers down with idle moments of passion and unnecessary character development when really we were most interested in learning about the infamous ""Trojan Horse"" and the ""Achilles Heel"" references? I would hate to say it, but those were two of the reasons why I was very interested in seeing this film. I wanted to see Petersen's portrayal of this historical moment, but instead what I discovered was that choppy editing left too much on the sandy desert floor. It felt, at least to me, that the ending was very rushed and very underdeveloped. The ending seemed cheaper to me, and without giving anything away, almost out of the precedent set forth by the beginning of the film. I think Petersen knew that he had run out of time and the budget was already too big, so the ending was forced to suffer. This ultimately hurt the film more than helped it giving it that sensation of a two-week science project done the night before. I felt sorry for those involved with this droopy ending.<br/><br/>To be honest, you had a very powerful story here that failed due to corporate Hollywood deciding to cast big names to fill the parts and place more emphasis on who was going to get the most screen time instead of story. The actors hurt this film more than most will imagine because they just never fully represented the power of Homer's work. I would have never imagined seeing Brad Pitt fighting along in Greek/Trojan times, and even after seeing this film I still cannot. Brian Cox, normally fascinating in every film he does, just fell flat on his face in this film with the yelping of British words during this era. It didn't fit causing the epic to quickly transform into nothing for that another summer blockbuster. The story didn't help much either, forcing us to desperately want to get back into our High School Latin class to relive the truth of the story one last time.<br/><br/>SEMPER UBI SUB UBI!!! <br/><br/>Grade: *** out of *****"

I found the role of Helen to be unappealing. In the poetry story, you get a true sense of Helen's inner conflict and turmoil. The makers of this movie made it seem like she couldn't decide which dress to wear. That is seriously how much anguish she showed. For what this movie could have been, I was very, very disappointed.

I was surprised they still gave credit to Homer for this; I'm not too sure he'd be signing off on their script somehow. The dialogue is pretty much horrible and does little to provide the viewer the bigger perspective of the history surrounding the story. I see Benioff wrote 25th Hour, then goes to this; pretty big jump and it shows. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt is a great guy for some roles, but he'd have made a better Paris than Achilles; The Rock as Achilles would have been a better choice for Achilles. Orlando Bloom I liked in LOTR, but here he mostly made me cringe with his portrayal of Paris (hopefully it was more the director's fault). Diane Kruger is pretty, but the most beautiful woman in the world? One to start wars over? Combined with OB's Paris, it's very hard to believe this couple served as the focal point for a war.

From the beginning of the movie i was hooked. Also i do have to hand it to Brad Pitt because he did very well, if he was angry you could tell and if he was in sorrow you could tell. Not many actors or actresses have that talent anymore. Even though i am a fan of Orlando Bloom i do have to say that his performance in the movie was vague. I don't think he showed a lot of character. I also liked how the director got a unknown actress to play Helen because if he didn't than no one in Hollywood could ever fill out the character. What i mean is, if he had gotten some A-lister then we would have already known their past work and could have compared and so on. But with an unknown we don't really know of any other work so it would be completely new, also in a weird way refreshing, because, knowing that some big Hollywood actor or actress got the job i think would have ruined the movie."

I liked Orlando Bloom's portrayal of Paris as somewhat of an overgrown child. He just runs away from everything, and Hector has to do the dirty work, including killing Menelaus. But after Hector dies, Paris kind of comes into his own, taking everything more seriously, and even practicing his archery, which as we all know comes in use. My huge problem is when Agammemnon is holding Briseis, and she stabs him. It looked like it was right in the jugular, something fatal, and Agammenon doesn't die until he returns home and Clytemnestra kills him herself! I also liked the little bit with Aeneas.

Hollywood can do it better. Never mind that Achilles' lover was Patroclus, not his cousin, which would better explain why Achilles' anger at his loss was white hot and his grief inconsolable.<br/><br/>Pitt looks good, if not believable. What's with all the self psychoanalyzing? This isn't Ibsen. It's Homer. Gods are gods and men are men. Even demi-gods don't go through life analyzing themselves. They just do what they want. They're heroes, after all.<br/><br/>The sets were nice--- very deMillean. But the dialogue??? Surely if they could do a fair job of Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis, someone could have done better with Homer's Iliad. In fact, although I translated all of my Homer from Latin (never took Greek), I'm sure that even Cliff's notes did better.<br/><br/>It's strange that a story that has been revered and admired for almost 3000 years still isn't good enough for the maven scriptwriters and directors of Hollywood. However, I hazard a guess this movie will not be remembered for 30 years, let alone 3000.<br/><br/>After watching this movie a second time, I have to admire Pitt more. His Achilles is Homeric in many respects...more than the screenplay. But what is striking is his performance in the battle scenes. He exhibits incredible grace or was this something they could do with special effects? I know now what I want, 7 years later. I want HBO to attack the Iliad with the same gusto they produced Rome. The Iliad needs far more time for character development than 2+ hours. It would make a wonderful 10 segment story and could be treated with the respect it deserves.

Being a person who loves Greece and Roman history as much as I do you will not be disappointed with the way everything is depicted on screen. Make sure that you don't come into this film expecting anything though because you could get it wrong. I have a vivid view of how I think things should happen and some were met yet others were not. You win some you lose some. Oh well.<br/><br/>2. Brad Pitt does an amazing job as Achilles. I don't really like him that much because of all the fuss about his looks, but he was perfect in this movie. He has perfect amount of tenderness and crudeness(can't think of a better word) blended together to create the best view needed to fall in love with Achilles.<br/><br/>3. The battles scenes are perfect. They pull away at perfect times to give you the feeling of the massive army on both sides. Although I think that the Trojians were displayed the best in this movie it does not make me like Greeks any less.<br/><br/>The Bad 1. I hate Paris. Orlando Bloom does do a good job of playing this character, but I don't like him at the end of the movie. I like to call him a little bitch, but others I am guessing will not agree. He first screws Helen of Sparta, then she goes back to Troy with her which gives a reason for Agamemnon a reason to fight.. again. Paris never listens and that pisses me off. Plus since he runs away in his first fight when he is fighting for Helen, he later feels the need to fight. I mean what the hell do you feel bad or something? Whatever I'm done with him.<br/><br/>2. Agamemnon!! I really hate him. He is one of the reasons I would not see this movie! The good outweighs the bad in my mind so...alas I still love this movie. I dislike the way Brian Cox plays this part. I think in the end he makes him out to be a bigger asshole than he really was.<br/><br/>I think that this movie needed nothing added and nothing taken out in the end. It was great to watch the visuals to a story I know so well. This in the end is very accurate to the story of the Illiad. Although I may not like the other works to follow this, both the Greek and the Roman, it doesn't effect how much I do end up liking this movie.

Hector fights throughout the whole war even though he knows he is going to lose. Helen attempts to seduce him and he refuses the most beautiful woman because of the love he has for his wife (a very rare occurrence in mythology). Although I could write a whole essay on this topic, but do not have the time or will to do so I will end with this. Hector shows more honor than Achilles ever thought of and probably more than almost any character in literature. As far as it not being that good of a movie, I agree for other reasons. I do believe however that this movie was based on The Iliad and no The Aeneid which explains why the Trojan horse was not a main aspect and why it was so greatly based on Achilles."

","Speaking from the viewpoint of a reader of the Trojan War myth and a movie goer, this movie is great. In terms of story (and tradition of telling the Trojan War story), characters, special effects, it's a great piece of work. Even it's historical accuracy is good.<br/><br/>I was able to compare this to The Illiad and other narratives, and this movie makes a view significant changes.(Menelaus's death, Paris's survival, Patroclus being a nephew of Achilles, and the war didn't seem to go long) But that didn't bother me in the slightest because the story of the Trojan War has been altered over time since it's inception. Homer was not the first to tell it but merely the first to write it down. Altering the story has been apart of Trojan War tradition, and this movie has kept to it. I think this story is catering to modern tastes, but Homer was catering to the tastes of his time as well. And I don't think he would have a problem with this at all. Like I say, the movie is keeping with tradition.<br/><br/>The basic narrative however remains the same with the elopement of Helen and Paris, the reluctance of Achilles to go, his closeness to Patroclus, the initial Greek victory, the quarrel over Briseis, Paris being a poor fighter, the Trojans repelling of the Greeks, death of Patroclus, Hector's and Achilles dual, Trojan Horse, and Fall of Troy. For that I like it. In the end Trojan war adaptations should just be a good story, and that's what this is. A damn good story. A story that, in this case, is well written, flows well, isn't not boring, quite engaging, and scripting thats solid.<br/><br/>When reading The Illiad I was supportive of the Trojans, and this movie agrees with me, with the Greeks portrayed as warmongering, womanising, bullies. Homer had put a regal spin on the Grreks, but this movie had them as total jerks. Agamemnon, Menelaus the epitome of the attitude. I did not like Ajax in the book, and I was glad to see him die in the movie. Achilles, Patroclus, and Odysseus I didn't mind however. I felt really sorry for Hector having bad luck thrown on him repeatedly, Priam just wanted his city protected and genuinely believed the gods would help him, Andromache wanted her husband to be safe, Paris was pitiful but not unsympathetic, and the Trojans were just protecting their land. sympathetic characters are essential to me, for a good story and this movie delivers.<br/><br/>The special effects were also good. For the armies and battles they were necessary, and complemented an already good story. It was quite a spectacle. The architecture and statues seemed consistent with 1200 BC. The military uniforms were consistent Greeks had their typical regalia, and the Trojans had west Asian suits rather than Greek uniforms in whixh they've been depicted in past efforts. The choreography is good too as seen in the battles.<br/><br/>What's also good is the versatile cast. Eric Bana and Rose Byrne from Autralia, Diane Krueger from Germany (who is also VERY nice looking)Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean from England, Brian Cox from Scotland, Peter O'Toole from Ireland, Brendan Gleeson from Northern Ireland, and Brad Pitt from America. It's good to see the talent the rest of the world has to offer rather than confining it to the Hollywood big names.<br/><br/>My only problem is that they gave little attention to Hecuba (Paris and Hector's mother) as well as Thetis. But otherwise it's damn good.<br/><br/>Interms of story, characters, visuals, and historical accuracy, and (in my case) closeness to the written version, and keeping with Trojan War tradition this movie delivers. It's an epic achievement because the money spent on this has resulted in the above being converted to the big screen, in a visual and audial treat. An 8/10, Wolfgang Petersen, Homer would be pleased, and so am I."

","Set around 1250 B.P., King Agamemnon of Mycenae is conquering yet another land. While their armies are massed for battle, he offers to settle the fight with a duel between their best warrior and his. They send out a giant soldier; the Greeks summon Achilles and being the Greatest Warrior of All, he triumphs with a single strike of his sword. Although he serves Agamemnon, Achilles is openly in contempt of his king and is reluctant to put him and his men in service to the King's expansionist goals.<br/><br/>At the celebration, we meet the Spartan leader Menelaus whose wife Helen has been carrying on a brief affair with Paris for no legitimate reason other than he's freaking Orlando Bloom and her husband isn't. When Paris beseeches her to come back to Troy with him, she agrees, but Paris's brother Hector is less than pleased when he finds out what has happened on the trip back.<br/><br/>Understandably peeved, Menelaus asks Agamemnon to go to war against the impenetrable fortress city-state that is Troy to get his woman back. Agamemnon agrees because if he conquers Troy, he'll have control of all the useful world, so in this case, Helen is the excuse for war, not the reason.<br/><br/>Assembling the legendary fleet of a thousand ships in what appears to be a few days the Greeks sail for Troy. In a Bronze Age version of Saving Private Ryan the Greeks get their butts rightly whooped on the beach until Achilles and his band of brothers are able to storm the beach and defile the Temple of Apollo, where Achilles captures and then woos Briseis a cousin of Hector and Paris who'd joined the order of virgins in service to Apollo.<br/><br/>It's decided that Menelaus and Paris should battle to settle who gets the girl. Paris proves he is no match and he's about to be cut down when Hector steps up, killing Menelaus and guaranteeing there's not going to be peace anytime soon.<br/><br/>Everybody was ragging on Troy for not being true to Homer's The Illiad. Well, that is always important to be true to the story, but I'm not too familiar with the story, so I don't care. The film is very entertaining. Pitt is surprisingly amazing as the great warrior. Bana is equally talented playing Hector. The acting in the film all around is top notch. The film is very underrated and to me, the best film of the year.

","Troy, however impressive the special effects might be, this movie is good, but tries to be great, and is unfortunately unsuccessful. It was a good show, however.

Achilles was supposed to have been shot on the heel, but he is shot by many arrows. But the positive things of this movie still stand out over the negative. There was very good acting and an excellent storyline. The repeating theme in this film was to be remembered by your heirs and to be in legends and never die.

"bakersr1","Null","0","2","5 January 2005"," Troy is a great movie, but please read the original to learn the truth as told by the blind Homer.
","Troy is a well made feature epic film on the scale and magnificience of Gladiator and Braveheart. Having said this, if I was not familiar with Homer's original Iliad, I would have loved this adaptation more. I believe Wolfgang Peterson wanted to create a more noble image of Hector than what we know of him through Homer's blind eyes. Achilles is made a bit more brutish and unfeeling than Homer would have liked, but not near as distorted as Hector. I must admit that I favor the Dardanians (the Trojans), but the Achaians (the Greeks) were the ""good guys"" according to Homer. Troy was an arrogantly proud city thumbing its nose from the Hellespont seeing itself unconquerable and the center of the civilized world. Homer's tale is about how such arrogant vanity can be brought down. Hector is a microcosm of this whole theme. His fight with Patroclos, a grown man and second in command of Achilles' Myrmidons in the real story, was not a case of mistaken identity. Hector knew who he was fighting, and he actually stabbed Patroclos in the back while the Greek hero was fighting among a throng of Trojans. Hector then steals the armor off of the dead Patroclos and puts it on in an attempt to mock Achilles and the Greeks. Achilles' revenge is not so petty in the original story as Peterson depicts in his version. But even in spite of huge discrepancies as the one just elaborated on, Peterson's film is worth watching and enjoying. I just hope that people will take up a good translation of the Iliad and read the story as it was originally told. The gods have a great deal to do with the outcome of the war, but it is the cunning of men and their courage that made the whole event worth telling to the generations of people that came after that glorious time of around 1200 B.C."
"vegeta_6969","6","0","4","4 January 2005"," Good overall but a few weak points.
","Troy is a film adaptation of the Ilaid the famous poem that Homer wrote about Achilles dying by Paris' hands and so forth. The movie itself was not bad, but I thought the plot in someways were stale. I wish that it could have focused more on Agamemon (played by Brain Cox) who was trying to take over Troy to rule all of Greece. Instead the plot itself, was staled for the simple reason that Paris took Helen from Agamemon's brother. I thought this killed the whole meaning of the war itself. I was glad however that the tension between Agamemon and his mischievous yet most elite soldier Achilles both on their own personal quests for power and glory, was present to counteract the sappy garbage that was going on. <br/><br/>On to the positive's:<br/><br/><ul><li>Brian Cox was perfect as the ruthless Agamemon. He really brings out what he is trying to accomplish and sticks to that goal. Another great bad guy performance by this well versatile actor.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After his plunk in the Hulk, Eric Bana has really brought himself out of the gutter as Prince Hector. His presence and determination to keep his city safe was well presented by Bana. I think this movie really brought himself out of the deep end.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I always get angry about this. Sean Bean was great as Odyssesus. I just wish the directors would do more with him in his good guy roles. He is another well rounded actor and it bothered me that he wasn't in it enough.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Once again Brad Pitt only chooses a role that he knows that he is capable of pulling off, and as Achilles he does an excellent job. I have always respected Pitt because he knows his limits and doesn't try to make himself anymore than what he knows he can do.</li></ul><br/><br/>NOW THE BAD STUFF:<br/><br/><ul><li>I have said it before, I will say it again. Orlando Bloom is not as talented as all the girls think. He was terrible in this film. He can't even pretend to be naive for about 10 minutes. The only thing he did that was credible was shoot a bow and arrow and he has already done that in L.O.T.R. I still believe that Bloom can evolve from his arrow shooting ways. I haven't given up on him yet, but if he doesn't improve within the next 5 years then he'll never be good in my eyes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Diane Kruger did absolutely nothing in this movie. As Helen she was more of a statue that you would put on a trophy than a helpless woman. I think she is a great actress but she presented nothing in this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>The rest of the acting was pretty poor too. Even Peter O'Toole did not really strike anything interesting to me. Looked to me like they just added extra's in to prevent doing anymore work.<br/><br/>Overall I give this movie a 6 out of 10. The battle scenes were excellent in this movie. I just wish we could have seen more of a conflict between Agamemon and Achilles. What could have happened was Achilles could have grown somewhat of a conscience and realize that there was more to glory then winning a war. I dunno it was just an idea."

","Apparaently the ""Nay"" sayers for this film came out of the lot of people who felt Pitt was miscast and the film was fictionalized. Bullocks. It is a story about MYTHOLOGY, therefore artistic licence can be applied despite deviations from Homer's Epic(which was obviously artistically licenced as well). Pitt was under-spoken and true to form. The fact that Hector was dismissed in a large part did not seem to matter as the crucial scenes between himself and Achilles were included and exceptionally well performed. Also, the fact that Peterson was the director, should have left a clue to the potential viewer that they were not going to see a spoof of a film. Underrated..definitely. Spot On..well not exactly but entirely entertaining and despite the 2+ hours, it was very watchable. My 10 star rating is a 7+."

","Despite not really living up to it's epic expectations I found this film fairly enjoyable. I personally like what they did with the story and humanizing it, I do agree with some who have said that removing the gods removes a huge chunk and focus of Homer's legendary story and the culture as well, but when you consider Hollywood's previous failures with attempting to bring the Greek Gods to the screen I am glad they did not attempt it in the end. The primary acting in this movie leaves something to be desired and is on the whole weakly lead, what makes this film truly work is the brilliance of the supporting cast. Eric Bana was on the whole good as Hector but the other primary players: Pitt, Bloom, and Kruger are where the weakness lies. There are some scenes with these actors where I feel like crying BRILLIANT, and then the next scene with them I feel like yelling, Who in their right mind would hire this person, that was terrible. To be fair I am not sure that is entirely the actors fault as the characerization is a little weird. The Supporting cast on the other hand was all terrifically and brilliantly characterized. Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Brendon Gleason, and Julian Glover are all excellent character actors, Julie Christie steels the single scene she is in with Pitt. And of Course rounding out the supporting cast is a man who I believe cannot give a bad performance, Peter O'Toole, and Kings seem to be his forte. He plays the tragic Priam brilliantly. The two best scenes in the movie are the initial fight the Achilles is in and the fight between Hector and Achilles. Definitely a good film, just not great.<br/><br/>7/10"

Wolfgang Petersen can indeed be a great director. Das Boot is probably the best sub movie of all time, but when something as the likes of Troy comes about with a shadow bigger than a castle and premieres as a rat with a thousand warts, one's reputation can be dismantled quite swiftly. To give this film a 7.0 is an outrage and a tyranny. It's the only war film I've ever fell asleep in, and I, a filmmaker, as well as a damn good film buff, know when to fall asleep."

That apart, the women are beautiful, the locations, CGI inspired or not, superb, and the script makes a fair stab at a complicated story. This film attempts to take a wider view of the period and the conflict, unlike Gladiator, which was able to home in on an individual, so direct comparisons are unfair.

In this his (Sean Beans) Odyseus is a wiley warrior who is (almost) psychoanalytical in his knowledge and understanding; it was a masterful performance.

I know the movie was filmed in Mexico (still a long way from lamas' South American homelands), but isn't that treating the viewer as a complete idiot?

","I liked this movie. One reason being that it seemed to make a very good attempt to evoke the bronze age psyche. If I could go back in time to that era I would expect to see men and women looking pretty much as they do now (maybe not QUITE as well shaven as in the movie!)but having a very different worldview and mindset. This is what they seemed to have. Life was cheap, for example, and war was always worthwhile if it had the potential of expanding empire. Rank and status meant a lot - well brought out in Menelaus's scandalised reaction to Paris's cowardly backing away in their fight.<br/><br/>The music of James Horner, much maligned on this site, did a great job of evoking the period, I thought.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt had the sulky, petulant, egomaniac Achilles to a tee. And Mr Bana was perfect as Hector. Full marks too to Peter O'Toole.<br/><br/>I was amused by the reactions of the ""I've read Homer in the original"" snobs who wanted the film to be an exact replay of the book. I particularly liked the suggestion of the bright spark who felt the movie should end with a funeral! And were those who decried Orlando Bloom's performance reacting to his character instead?

I found the music overbearing and intrusive but most of all, it's the appalling script that floored me.

","I remember the debate over ""Helen of Troy"" (HOT) and the people who loved it (maybe influenced a little by Sienna Guillory's backside), those who loathed it, and those, like me, who said it wasn't great but that it was reasonable entertainment. After all, it was made for TV on a limited budget and we shouldn't have expected a masterpiece. And I didn't mind the creative interpretation of the story. I mean to say, the original story is probably fiction anyway, so screen writers should be allowed some licence (Homer is regarded by some academics as being two different authors due to the great differences in The Iliad and The Odyssey).<br/><br/>Throughout this debate, the anti-HOT critics said how wonderful Troy was going to be. Well, I've just seen Troy, and how wrong they were.<br/><br/>Trying to be objective, the two movies may be roughly on a par, although in saying that I think I'm being generous to Troy. The real point is, however, that Troy has far less excuse to be appalling. Despite a great cast and being billed as an epic, it turned out to be as credible and engrossing as a turnip sandwich (or some other word that begins with ""tur"").<br/><br/>One of the big failures was Brad Pitt, who is normally outstanding in movies. In Troy he was more wooden than a painter's plank (actually, thinking about it, leaden is probably a better word than wooden - the sinking connotations are particularly appropriate). His American accent rang right though the movie, sadly revealing, for the first time in my memory, his limitations as an actor. He was also too small in stature for the part, and the martial arts manoeuvre that he used in the opening battle scene was both geographically and temporarily ridiculous. Perhaps if it had been set in Asia a few centuries later, the Director could have got away with it.<br/><br/>I actually thought that Eric Bana and Brad Pitt played the wrong roles. Bana was pretty average in the movie as well, but The Hulk could have made a great Achilles and Pitt may have been more believable as Hector, who was presumably a great strategist.<br/><br/>Turning to others in the caste, the portrayals of Agamemnon and Menelaus were far more convincing in HOT than in Troy. Rufus Sewell was brilliant in HOT, while the two actors who played the roles in Troy looked like old men going through the motions (I've forgotten the actors' names already, perhaps they will be happy about that). As for Diane Kruger, well, I think I remember seeing her in the movie somewhere. On the positive side, Peter O'Toole was a little better than the others.<br/><br/>Ultimately, however, the real difference between Troy and Helen of Troy was how much you cared at the end. Stories have tension because you care about what happens to the characters. In Helen of Troy, despite the imaginative (critics might say eccentric) interpretation of the story, I found myself caring about the characters and being glad when big Aggie finally got it at the end of the movie. But by the end of Troy, I wanted to see the whole cast killed off."

","One of the greatest stories ever told, a budget to match, and a cast that should shine in a film such as this... So, why does it not quite work? In my opinion, everything is just too big, too in-your-face to actually move you. This goes for the size of the armies, the effects, the score and the dialogue. It lacks any kind of subtlety.<br/><br/>I blame the scriptwriter and the director. The writer for the dialogues which are meant to ooze heroic pathos but in most cases seem to miss and are just pathetic. The director for the many poor performances in this one: Diane Kruger is certainly beautiful, but all she has to do is cry and look anxious for most of the time. Like her, all that Brad Pitt's Achilles seems to do is look pretty and throw portentous glances around. The changes that his character undergoes are poorly explained in terms of motivation, too. Orlando Bloom's another one cast apparently only for his looks. But what was going on with Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole? Cardboard characters if ever there were some. Evil, power-mad tyrant the one; good, gentle old ruler the other. Since I know they are both capable of so much more, I have to lay the blame at the director's door. During the whole film, one gets the impression that Wolfgang Petersen wanted to do 'his' Gladiator, yet he seems to lack the necessary intuition to do justice to his subject material.<br/><br/>To be fair, it's not all bad though. The battle scenes are excellent, even though they could have been bloodier. Eric Bana is a standout and carries most of the film, and Sean Bean steals every scene he's in as Odysseus. Rose Byrne, Saffron Burrows and Brendan Gleeson manage to do at least something with very little. The middle part, in which the pace picks up and the major battles are fought, is exciting, but overall Troy leaves you with the feeling that it could have been so much better if the focus had been put on the telling of a great story, rather than trying to make it as 'epic' as possible. Good-looking but hollow on the inside, this movie is a Trojan horse in itself."

","This film is possibly one of the worst films i have ever seen. It destroyed the Homer's legend and is portrayed in a brutal and amateur way.<br/><br/>In a nutshell it depicts the Trojan war as a half hearted little brawl between two megalithic powers (the Trojans and the Greeks) one said to be undefeatable, the other an amalgamation of all the armies of a broken and war writhed county. However, a number of the essential characters from the book (the proper story) aren't even in the film and most of the characters that are in it are all messed up. Despite impressive acting from Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Peter O'Toole the film, for me, was still a firm flop. Brad Pitt, being the leading star, didn't really do much to improve the status of the film. I'm sure the number of female teens that went to see the film for the sole reason of seeing him in a skirt was immeasurable. (It being the only reason it gave challenge in the box office!)<br/><br/>Watching the film drudgingly for the second time I was further more put off by the amount of blood shed, though physically it was very little (there was hardly a drop to be seen) I couldn't help but notice that at least two thirds of the film was gory and savage slaughtering. OK I accept that it is a film about a war (THE war if you will!), but something about it just didn't seem right, i cant describe it so I wont.<br/><br/>Don't take my words to heart, if you liked the film thats great, good for you. If you haven't seen it, well done, you made a smart move, but if you get a chance give it a quick peek and make up your own mind. but whatever you do don't take it too literally.<br/><br/>PS.

"mentalcritic","5","0","1","1 November 2004"," Tries a little too hard...
","One major problem that seems to face Hollywood adaptations of literary material in the last twenty years is a fundamental lack of respect for the tone of the source material. Recent Stephen King adaptations have tried to be family-friendly, The Lord Of The Rings was robbed of the scenes upon which its peculiar characteristic depends in favour of overlong battle sequences, and then you have Troy. Troy, being based upon The Iliad, has a lot to live up to, especially given that The Iliad and The Odyssey are considered such great landmarks of literature.<br/><br/>Where O'Brother, Where Art Thou? wore its loose relationship to The Odyssey on its sleeve and instead tried to present an answer to the question of how it would read were it written during America's so-called golden era, Troy tries to present itself as a dramatic and literal interpretation of The Iliad. It doesn't work in that sense. For one thing, it tries to tell years worth of events in a pace that implies mere months. It's almost as if modern filmmakers cannot even be bothered implying the passage of time.<br/><br/>Another major problem is in the casting. We truly have an international cast here, and there is certainly nothing wrong with that. However, when you listen to the cast speak during this film, it becomes obvious in a hurry that the only member who has any Greek ancestry is, ironically, playing a Trojan. Brendan Gleeson and Brian Cox don't even bother to hide their Irish or Scottish accents, while Brad Pitt often makes one wonder if he is about to tell us that the things we own end up owning us (ironically, a line that wouldn't have gone amiss here). Poor little Orlando Bloom looks utterly lost during most of the running time, and it becomes obvious at the end that he just cannot act without a bow in his hand. A new version of the action hero syndrome.<br/><br/>However, Troy also manages to get a few things right. The battle sequences are shot with a stable, steady camera that, while often too close for the audience to comfortably see what is happening, at least doesn't induce nausea. The actions of the characters doing the fighting actually make sense, too. Compared to Rohirrim charging the hundred-foot tall Mumakil during The Return Of The King, simple things like the Spartan warriors hiding behind the shields they join together are a welcome change.<br/><br/>Connie Nielsen and Diane Kruger get a decent shake as the feminine quotient of the film. Nielsen must be feeling quite angry that she wasn't even considered for an Oscar after Gladiator. Every scene she appears in, she seems to have a look on her face that seems to say ""my career has tanked, and horsemouth won an Oscar?"". If anything, she seems even more forceful than at the end of Gladiator. Kruger, on the other hand, gives a measured, soft performance that leaves the viewer in little doubt as to why Paris would risk provoking war for her.<br/><br/>I gave Troy a five out of ten. This is the same score I generally give to all films that appear reasonably good, but waste so much potential. Sure, it is worthy of a viewing, but in this market where a film comes out every week, this just isn't enough."

","There are hundreds of American films of superb quality, such as ""Some Like it Hot', or ""Requiem for a Dream"" There are others: 'Lost Horizons' (the musical); 'The Exorcist II'; Dino de Laurentis's 'King Kong', which are so very bad that they lurch into such heady realms of camp that they become wildly entertaining in their own perverse way.<br/><br/>This is almost, but not quite the case with 'Troy'. With a script adapted from the 'Iliad' of Homer, (Simpson, presumably), this movie is a monumental failure on all fronts:<br/><br/>Performances...Orlando Bloom as Paris (Of Hilton rather than of Troy).<br/><br/>Helen of Troy presented more as an Amber of The Bold and the Beautiful.You want to see a Helen?...see Irene Papas in 'The Trojan Women'. <br/><br/>Brian Cox doing the usual British actor in Hollywood schtick as Agamemnon, (the rule is..the more morally compromised the character, the more British his accent-see Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons in the 'Die Hard' franchise.)<br/><br/>Eris Bana as Hector with a mid-Atlantic/ mid-Pacific accent so bogus he doesn't sound like he comes from anywhere.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole taking the money and running, just as he has been doing for over twenty years. Essentially, this is the same performance he gave as Tiberius , all those years ago, with a couple of kindly smiles thrown in.(...the film was 'Caligula'...O'Toole and Gielgud claimed that they didn't know it was going to be sado-porn, but they took the checky anyway!) <br/><br/>....and finally, Brad Pitt as Achilles....no poofy attachment to Patrocolus for this Achilles, as he pouts and mouÃ©s his way through the film. His boyfriend has become his ""cousin""...ahem! His hair is more expressive than his face. Presumably these warriors were much younger than the forty-something Pitt, but he does manage to convince as a twenty something...as long as his features remain immobile.<br/><br/>The music is ghastly, the design awash with anachronism...(i particularly liked the Archaic Cyprian, Classical sorta' Greco-Egyptian Trojan stuff.<br/><br/>The music was a pain, but as with many of these deals it was 'D'oh..the script STUPID' that did the most damage:<br/><br/>HELEN: Last night was a mistake!<br/><br/>Paris: And the night before?...and the night before that?<br/><br/>HELEN: I've made a lot of mistakes this week!<br/><br/>In Homer and the Greek tragedians, Menelaus survives the war and confronts Helen, only to be prevented from taking his vengeance when she turns the full beauty of her breasts on him. He forgives her. In this epic, Eric skewers him in the first battle. The character of Cassandra, someone who you might have thought fairly central to the story disappears in a blinding flash of Hollywood 'improvement'.<br/><br/>As if this wasn't bad enough, Briseis stabs Agamemnon in da neck, punk....thus removing the need for such classic characters as Clytemnestra, Electra and Orestes Why change major plot points when they do nothing to improve the story? Homer's storytelling instincts leave Hollywood's for dead . <br/><br/>Add to this the fact that each of the 1000 ships seemed to be carrying at least 1000 men, all of whom looked like refugees from a San Diego Bears' Convention and you have a disaster almost bad enough to be a camp classic......but not quite, (my eyes kept glazing over)."

"Yongle","Null","0","1","13 September 2004"," Falls Short of Expectations
","This movie had the potential to be so much more than Wolfgang Petersen delivered. It is shocking that the studio was willing to spend $200 million on this ($17.5 million of which went to Brad Pitt) without a proper script and changes to Homer's story that made no sense.<br/><br/>And now for the acting. Brad Pitt is a good actor with the right material and he has played memorable characters in movies like A River Runs Through It, Se7en, Fight Club, Snatch, Kalifornia and Twelve Monkeys (all of them had excellent performances from him). Before the movie came out I rooted for him and Bana over Bloom (who got on my nerves to no end). As an admirer of Pitt, it pains me to say he was completely miscast as Achilles, though the blame lies more with Petersen for putting him in the movie. Plus Achilles had some of the weakest material in the movie and he was also given some of the worst lines. All the changes to his story seem to have been tailored to a Hollywood superstar though this is probably not Brad's fault. And like Tom Cruise in the Last Samurai, he remains too much of a superstar to vanish into his role. Achilles of the film was at his best when he was fighting. I am really surprised as to why Brad did not take the role of Hector, especially since Hector was the the heart of the film.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Eric Bana. Bana was excellent as Hector and might have even played a memorable Achilles (he was Chopper Read after all) had he and Pitt switched characters. He should have been completely boring especially since he was transformed into a saint for the film but Bana did not let that happen. His scenes with his wife were excellent and their relationship was more touching than the supposed love of Helen and Paris and the invented romance of Achilles and Briseis, even though Hector and Andromache got the least screen time. The Achilles-Briseis relationship seemed like an excuse for Benioff to make Achilles as likable as Hector or to give Pitt a romance, seeing as how the Trojan men had plenty (though see below for my thoughts on Paris-Helen). Back to Bana, people thought he would be the worst of the leads and he held the film together instead. It went downhill very fast after Priam reclaimed his body. Funny how the least-publicised have a way of sneaking up and snatching films away from big stars.<br/><br/>As a non-Bloom fan and one who finds the guy over-hyped for his relatively weak acting skills, Orlando Bloom was okay as Paris. However, he had the worst lines and zero chemistry with Diane Kruger. Bloom needs to change his acting style because the breathless speaking voice and overacting eyebrows are irritating/ distracting. In his defence though, he was much better in Troy than in POTC. His scenes with Bana were excellent as he toned down the histrionics and acted. His fight with Menelaus was classic and his fear was palpable, as was the shame he later felt. However, most of his scenes with Helen were terrible. That having been said, he was likable even though he was more sympathetic than Homer's Paris. I could see the change in Paris' character more than I saw it in Achilles and Bloom did a good enough job to make it believable.<br/><br/>Sean Bean was criminally underused and deserved more screen time, as he was also more appealing than Achilles. He also kept the film together with his performance. I hope to God the studio has taken notice of the good reviews this man got and maybe now we'll get the Odyssey with him in the lead.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole had some funny moments with the reaction shots during the Hector-Achilles fight but he more than made up for it with his appeal to Achilles. Both he and Bana are deserving of Oscar noms.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson is amongst my favourite actors and he needed more screen time as well but he was wonderful as always (though it's a shame that he was characterised as such a baddie). Brian Cox was wonderful as a hammy baddie and I got plenty of laughs from the way in which he spat out his lines. I would have loved to see him live and then get his comeuppance in a sequel but thanks to Benioff's script, no such luck.<br/><br/>The women of the film have little to do but Saffron Burrows was heartbreaking as Andromache and it would have been nice to see her and Hector get more screen time. Briseis was great but Rose Byrne seems to have out acted Brad Pitt at every turn. Diane Kruger was nothing special as Helen and thankfully she did not have much to do either.<br/><br/>The one-on-one fight scenes were fantastic and truly innovative but why did the armies look like they had 50 million men on each side (as opposed to 50,000)? The cinematography was fine but Petersen really needed to avoid foreshadowing by focusing so much on certain actors (the 30-second slow-mo shot of Briseis in the beginning made it obvious something would happen to her, especially if one had not read the Iliad). The score was terrible and the studio was wrong to fire Yared. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie should have been better than it was. Bana, Bean and O' Toole brought a lot of depth to the film but they were not the main stars and made do with what screen time they had. Instead of paying Pitt so much, the studio should have made sure that their lead could carry the role. A solid showing from him might have made this film an Oscar contender, hokey dialogue and all. Alas, no such luck."
"marysia","9","0","1","2 September 2004"," Made for Mocking
","This is a movie that was made to be mocked. I think I have read about five separate parody summaries of it and every one was hilarious. Despite this it is in and of itself quite a good movie, despite alterations to the original storyline.<br/><br/>Eric Bana is the standout performance of the film (setting aside Brad Pitt's bottom, nothing can stand up to the power of Brad Pitt's bottom). He prevents the film from being ridiculous by being convincing, heroic and touching. The film is also aided by strong female performances, Briseis does a good job of distracting us from the fact that we all know Achilles was really supposed to be shagging Patroclus all along. However, just because the film-makers did a good job of covering up their cowardice at portraying a gay hero doesn't make their actions any less pathetic. Andromache and Helen were also well played.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom was perfect as Paris. He's just not cut out to be a convincing hero, but as a spoilt young princeling who brings everything tumbling down around him thanks to his own poor judgement he's ideally cast. He's innocently delusional and foolishly romantic, I particularly liked the scene where he tells Helen they can run away and live in a cave and he'll hunt rabbits and then everything will be okay.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt occasionally suffers from overly dramatic cinematography but aside from that he's ideal as Achilles. Stunning in a sarong, convincing as a slightly one dimensional pouty egotistical young warrior who has to face up to the fact that this battle is not going to be like any other in his past.<br/><br/>So they changed the story, I thought I would mind but on the whole I didn't. Kassandra wasn't required, the Gods didn't need to actually appear, changing Agamemnon's death made perfect sense in a movie context, changing Achilles' was less palatable but logical. Actually one of the weakest points of the movie was where they stuck to the story of the Trojan Horse, cause let's face it, that was never the most convincing story ever told. ""Oh look they've all gone home and left us a big horse, let's take it inside the walls. What could possibly go wrong?"""

","If I am not mistaken in the Iliad the actual Trojian War took 10 years. This film made it look like it took 3 days. A lot of details did not match the Iliad. For example Achilles was killed before the walls of Troy were breached, and it wasn't Paris who advised Priam to burn the Horse Statue, and many others. I was also expecting Achilles armor to be more lavish since in the Iliad his armor were carefully designed by the gods. It was disappointing on many levels.

"without_eyelids","4","0","3","28 July 2004"," 60 percent ego, 40 percent plot
","Prior knowledge of the Iliad or any of the arguably better Iliad adaptations will damage your perceptions of this film. Most of the film is spent subverting the audience to a propagandist vision of Troy and Brad Pitt as Achilles, Eric Bana as Hector. Wolfgang has done a great disservice to the story of Troy by stripping it of its flesh. The Gods have been removed, as have principal characters, as well as principal fates. <<Spoiler>>All that's left is a typical movie arc, where the entire Trojan war is a parabolic 3-hour curve in which the beginning of the curve is at Paris' eloping with Menelaus' wife, Helen, the middle peaks with the climactic confrontation of Hector and Achilles, and the end is some bullsh*t where Paris escapes with Helen and Achilles kills his own king. You know it's going to suck when principal characters (like Menelaus) are killed off just to expedite the movie, even though their insight is crucial to the remainder of the story.<<End Spoiler>><br/><br/>I squirmed and sat bored throughout the entire movie. Troy certainly fits the ""2004"" updated rendition of the Iliad, as it is earmarked by the completely fake and mitigated violence/storytelling depth that made the Lord of the Rings such a sell to the 9 years and up film crowd.<br/><br/>Wolfgang cutting the fat from the story leaves it with nothing. Troy is a very typical Hollywood movie with shallow lead characters delivering subpar performances in war movie that tries to achieve realism, but only manages to slaughter its titular mythology. There's no depth at all: no insights into actual Grecian warfare, no proper evincement of character, no historical depth to make up for all the things that Wolfgang cut. I spent the entire movie trying to be convinced that Brad Pitt was Achilles, that Eric Bana was Hector. I failed. <br/><br/>When Braveheart was released, the folk hero William Wallace was portrayed in all memorabilia with the likeness of Mel Gibson, a subtle honor to a great movie and a man whose documentation is even more scant than Achilles. Will Brad Pitt, just to name one of the principal characters who participated in this disastrous PG-13 watercolor portrait of ancient Greece, ever be so intimately tied to Achilles? Neither his performance, nor this movie, is memorable enough. We're still waiting for an excellent and classic filmic adaptation of Troy, and this, my friends, falls far, far short."
"omsdiver","3","0","2","27 July 2004"," Great budget, great production...even greater failure
","Some can say this is action movie so the historical background can be treated with certain degree of freedom - and it's true. But for Troy almost every aspect of history (or myth) was neglected. It's screenplay stands in opposition even to logic. But let's start from the beginning.<br/><br/>I can understand that the director could not afford to show 10 years siege but there are ways to shorten the historical time. 16 days (or maybe 17, i did not count) instead of 10 years is for me going to far.<br/><br/>I also cannot understand how the Greeks wanted to breach the walls of Troy without any single catapult or ballast - swords, javelins and arrows are a little bit ineffective against walls. Well, maybe they were counting that the siege will take long enough to discover powder or even guns.<br/><br/>There are also some quite, I would say, even stupid moments. The first one takes place when Hector is leading counterattack after first battle day. Greeks are surprised, Achilles is drinking and probably doing some nasty things but suddenly he appeared and led the attack. After a short fight Hector is killing mighty Achilles, when appeared not to be Achilles himself. I wonder how it is possible that 50 - 70 thousands men (both armies) stopped the battle within few seconds after fake Achilles died. But even more funny is to see that Hector, knowing that Greeks could be crushed, is saying to Odysseus ""Come on guy, let's stop this fight and go for a drink or two.""<br/><br/>Finally when Achilles killed Hector, being alone at the gates of Troy, no single soldier tried to stop the man who is going to desecrate the body of great Hector, no single arrow was shut, nothing happened.<br/><br/>To summarize the Troy was one of my biggest disappointment this year."
"noontide35","Null","0","1","24 July 2004"," A tragedy preserved, in spite the absence of the Gods
","I'd been sort of waiting for this movie to come out for quite a while, and after seeing it i feel it's a decent job, for what it's worth. And by that, i mean a big budget movie by Hollywood with the dual ambition of attracting the general audience as well as assuming a position in the epic movie category and becoming an instant classic. It surely could have been much better given the magnitude of the theme but the director did at least one thing right -- staying truthful to the epic storyline and more importantly, preserving the gist of an ultimate tragedy of human kind in its matter-of-fact way of story-telling. <br/><br/>The director made an interesting yet dangerous choice by actually not including any God in this movie, cause Trojan war is, if anything, a war between Gods. I'm no man to comment on Greek mythology but the way i see it, ""The Iliad"" is such an important piece of literature in human history, aside from being the first epic poem ever, is that it is the first to express the futility of the efforts of mere mortals and thus the tragic nature of human being in such a magnitude. Odysseus and Achilles didn't want to go to the war in the first place, and Hector surely wouldn't bring an enemy like Greece upon himself if he had a choice. Yet these three are the ones who suffered most (aside from the faceless people in the once magnificent Troy who got ruthlessly slaughtered). Hector and Achilles were DOOMED to die even before the war started for no obvious reasons, and Odysseus suffered a ten-year odyssey :) after single-handed brought down the unbreakable Troy and literary wiped the city from the map. <br/><br/>To follow that logic, Heroes like Hector and Achilles were invented not to show how glorious human being can be but rather how insignificant and futile we are as a race in the face of history and divinity. Unmatchable heroes as they are, they were totally unable to defy destiny. Hector is no less formidable a fighter than Achilles, but in their duel, his javile was deflected not by Achilles but Athena herself, who also guide Achilles sword across Hector's throat. That's why no matter how great he was and whoever he was fighting, if the Gods decided he should die he didn't even have a chance. Achilles was killed in the same fashion by Apollo, who favored Hector and chose a wuss like Paris to be Achilles's terminator, almost as a mockery. <br/><br/>I think the director choose the exclusion of Gods at least partly for practical reasons. 3-hour movie as it is, it probably can't afford to accommodate the complicated nature of Olympians if the movie was to tell a complete story. But it managed to deliver the sense of an epic tragedy without the help of the Gods. It so happened that the director made Achilles fight for fame, Hector for survival so more justified and humane, but, in ""Iliad"" Achilles was a soldier without a cause. He was dissed by Agamemnon and was on his way home until he heard his ""dearest friend"" (NOT his cousin, u guys do the math :) was killed by Hector. Thus began the chain reaction of Heroes dropping dead like flies. It deepened the sense of helpless of mortals cause even God-like Heroes like Achilles was totally played by Fate. And again, the reason Hector was slain by Achilles in the duel is because Zeus put the death of both heroes in his balance, and the side with Hector's sank down. So again, it's Fate, not God, who's running the show here.<br/><br/>Fate, in Greek myth, is a force (not an entity like the Olympian Gods) that's beyond EVERYONE, including the almighty Zeus himself. the Greek myth is filled with stories of Gods lamented over the sorrowful yet unchangeable course of Fate. So the Greek thought, not mere human, but even their Gods were dominated by the shapeless yet irresistible Fate. Apathetic and unpredictable as the Gods were, there's a more powerful and fearful force that the Greek couldn't even give a form to help themselves understand like they did with the Gods."

","I thought the film ""Troy"" was a superb effort in film-making. The acting, cinematography and technical aspects of the movie were top-notch. I do, however, have a few quibbles with the screenwriters. First of all, I think it would have been more interesting if Hector had been a woman, perhaps a lounge singer. Then they could have included a couple of upbeat songs to get the audience through all that plot. Secondly, there shouldn't have been a war over Helen. That seemed a tad overwrought and those dusty battle scenes could have been avoided. Paris should have realized his naivete and found a more suitable partner back in Troy and raised a nice family. I think they should have written more funny lines for Priam, too, especially when he's speaking in front of his cabinet. The whole setting should have been moved out of those dreary desert locations and played perhaps in the mountains or on a riverboat. And lastly, neither Hector nor Achilles should have been killed. The only one who really deserved to die was Andromache. Other than that, it was an interesting film."

He looked great; but most people look good standing next to an Ork. Anyway, I was disappointed in him this time. Frankly, he seemed a bit wimpy, especially when he's lying in the dust hanging onto his big brother's ankle. <br/><br/>But, back to Brad. Obviously the screenwriter thought Homer and his ""Iliad"" was just too, er, Greek. So, the storyline needed a bit of change to incorporate Brad, the boy from Shawnee Oklahoma. <br/><br/>It's all about Brad; he works the role, from show pony with a sword, to redneck with a sword, to unwilling warrior with a sword, to priestess ravisher with, er, you know, to finish as a sorta nice guy but no sword, just an arrow in the wrong place. <br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for a strict version of the original, forget this movie.

Achilles, played by Brad Pitt, shows how a warrior can change when the right opportunities come to him.<br/><br/>It bothers me when people judge this movie because they herd is was very gory and nasty.

","This could have been great, it could have been a classic. From seeing the trailer that was indeed what I was expecting. A talented director, a great cast, enormous in scope and with great music. So what went wrong? The problem with this film is not the attempt to turn a classic book into a commercial Hollywood epic. It might have been that and still be a great movie. The biggest mistake is its breaking of the foremost rule in storytelling; create characters that the audience cares about, or everything they do and go through will be pointless. We never really care what happens to Achilles or Hector or anybody in the film when they keep reminding us that everything that happens is inevitable. None of them seem to have any choice in the matter or learn anything from their experiences. Should we root for the Trojans who are Noble but stupid? Should we side with the Greeks who are either power-mad or sheepish followers? It's the personal stories that should drive the film to a logical conclusion, but we hardly know anything about any of the characters, except the most basic information. I'm sure that given some real characters to work with, none of the performances would have been as flat and the audience would have been left not so much with an empty spectacle, but with a film that said something about human nature. <br/><br/>As for the empty spectacle, there's no Peter Jackson at work here, judging by scenes that were out of focus, scenes that seemed to be lifted straight from The Two Towers and music that was highly unoriginal. Every time we are supposed to feel anything a whining 'ethnic' voice urges us to (Gladiator anyone?) At times the music is strangely inappropriate (swells of heroic strings while Trojan soldiers stab Greeks in the back, or straight through a monologue by Achilles). Were the producers sleeping, or did the budget run out before anyone could say: let's do that again? This one sadly will definitely not be remembered for thousands of years."

The set design, cinematography, CGI and tone of the film is brilliant! My only major gripes were that the whole Paris/Helen thing didn't work - most of the time if was really obvious Diane Kruger (no relation of Freddie's?) didn't seem really interested in the movie, there was no way of telling how much her character loved Paris (Orlando Bloom), which I thought was quite important seeing as how this is the whole reason the war started!<br/><br/>Eric Bana was very good in role of Hector, not once did I expect him to go into a rage and turn into the Hulk! Brad Pitt stole the show for me - as Achilles, he provided for me the coolness of Tyler Durden and some cool butt-kickin' Jedi! Interesting character, a good role for Pitt....the love/hate relationship between him and Briseis worked better than the mess that Kruger tried to give...<br/><br/>Big-ups on the CGI though! It's very good, you could tell they were using MASSIVE during the rendering for the battle scenes! Overall the look and tone of the film bears uncanny resemblance to GLADIATOR, and the seige of Troy bears resemblance to the seige of Minas Tirth in THE LORD OF THE RINGS : THE RETURN OF THE KING, but these are only very minor gripes, and obviously Wolfgang Peterson was inspired by them....<br/><br/>To sum it all up : a Hollywood blockbuster based on a Greek legend, pleny of battles, romance, action and drama to keep you interested!

"l-o-lyle","Null","0","1","30 June 2004"," This is Nothing New (spoiler)
","'Troy' is a 'Greek-myth' movie just like any other (yawn) -minus the pantheon of gods and goddesses who played key roles in the fates of the heroes (and villains). This film is simply a rehash of a popular story (ostensibly about Troy) and credited (with apologies?) to Homer. Okay the movie has GREAT special effects, and is a superb visual feast with some outstanding casting (especially Peter O'Toole as King Priam and Eric Bana as Hector. Who else but Orlando Bloom could play the wimp Prince Paris?)<br/><br/>But it really should have been called 'Achilles' after all that is who the film is really about. We first meet our hero when he dispatches an enemy in one deft hop, skip and jump motion (which is his trade mark move throughout the film). It is a pity that the opening sequence had not been with Odysseus and Diomedes finding him disguised as a woman and hiding among the maidens on the island of Skyros! Or maybe, if the story had stuck true to its title, 'Troy': opening when Agamemenon and Menelaus went to Ithaca to recruit Odysseus only to find him, apparently raving mad, sowing salt in furrows that were being ploughed by a horse and a donkey. A ploy that would have worked had someone not thrown his baby son, Telemachus, down in front of the plough! <br/><br/>So who is this Achilles (played by Brad Pitt), anyway? A brutish and agile warrior who falls deeply in love with one of Apollo's priestesses and who gets somewhat annoyed when his 'cousin', Patroclus, is killed by Prince Hector in battle? Homer's Achilles loved only two people in his life  himself and Patroclus (who was actually his lover). Apart from his mother, the beautiful sea-nymph Thetis (ably portrayed in the film by Julie Christie), any women in his life were just useful vassals (even his son, Neoptolemus, was little more than a PS at the bottom of the page). Achilles was an athletic and brutal warrior, true enough, and his Myrmidons formed a fearsome and formidable army - but he never loved his captive slave-girl Briseis the way it was portrayed in the film. Yes, it is true that the desecration of slain Trojan hero, Hector, by Achilles was nothing less than shameful (and was actually toned down in the film), and his own legendary demise (struck through his vulnerable heel by a poisoned arrow from Paris' bow) is actually the irony of the tale. But he was killed (or, more probably, murdered) by Paris long before the conception of the wooden horse. Thus, the true hero of the Greeks turned out to be the wily and cunning Odysseus (who was a rather stocky man famous for his flaming red hair and beard, quite unlike the wiry, strawberry blonde character played by Sean Bean). <br/><br/>If production companies want to make movies about brave but brutal heroes who are apparently blessed with being invincible why choose Achilles anyway?<br/><br/>Brad Pitt would have made a superb Cu Chulainn ('Hound of Chulain / Ulster'). Cu Chulainn was a legendary hero of Ireland and he, too, was invincible. He was the champion of Queen Medhbh of Connaught, and he defended the magical brown bull of Cooley. He is the Irish equivalent of 'Achilles' with an equally exciting provenance (his original name was Setanta, but he earned his title 'The Hound of Ulster' in a most remarkable way.). A fearsome, brutal warrior, 'The Hound' felled anyone who stood in his way until he met his own end in an equally bizarre and ironic manner. Now, how many movies are there about him (or about any other Irish myths and legends)? Peter Jackson was a man with a vision and he took a huge gamble with Tolkien's pseudo-myth 'The Lord of the Rings' and it paid off - because it is refreshingly new and different! Doesn't anyone else have the courage to break the mould? Come on, guys! Give us break  we want something NEW!"

Her great gift, and healing powers gave a lot of strength to desperate Trojans. The fact that nobody realized the reason for her incarnating in Troy at that particular time when her starling abilities were most needed by her people.

Brad Pitt as Achilles did hold some sort of 'god-like' majesty, but it wasn't enough to make me believe this movie. I thought when walking into Troy, that I was going to see some sort of period-epic...which it was, but it was also heavily centered around how god-like Achilles was. Like Roger Ebert, I think that the dialogue and the pacing was clunky and I really disliked the moments when entire battles would come to a near-complete halt just so the two representatives of either army could fight in a melodramatic romp around and at each other. (Once in Ajax vs Hector, again in Hector versus the cousin of Achilles). The characterization is somewhat bland, but there nonetheless. Achilles is the lone warrior who does not believe in his king...regardless of whether or not he believes that the king has control. The battle scenes aren't that wonderful either...and I was really amazed how 50,000 Greeks had an army tantamount to the size of the 250,000 orcs in Return of the King. Roger Ebert commented on how the battles take your mind off of the actual war, and more so on the effects themselves...he couldn't be more correct. <br/><br/>Through the bickering, I must say that what I enjoyed about this film was the incredible choreography in the one-on-one fight scenes. I was blown away by the magnificence of Hector vs Achilles and how gracefully the fight moved along. It was, in my opinion, one of the best ""sword/javelin fights on screen"", although I am completely unaware of how many of those there have been in the past.

","Whilst I've always liked the story, I've never really liked the Iliad.  It's so easy to get bogged down in all the 'mighty voices' and it reads like a series of small fights between lots of different characters.  I've always preferred the Odyssey, it has so much more story.  That said, it's easy to see why Hollywood wanted to make a film of this.  It has flawed heroes, romance, tragedy and more importantly lots and lots of violence.  The continual appearance of a nearly naked Brad Pitt doesn't do it any harm either.  The trouble for me was, it seemed to be trying too hard to be everything.  As an action/battle film, it was superb.  Cast of thousands, authentic looking fights and weapons, lots of blood . . . . but it was trying to be an epic romance as well, which I really struggled with, especially given that romance does not figure too strongly in the text.  I also struggled with their attempts to portray strong women - Briseis in particular.  Her redemption of Achilles was just a little difficult to swallow - especially given that I'm pretty sure that Homer's version has him cutting her throat on Patrocles' memorial.  I also struggled with te happy ending element of the film too - As any scholar will no, Troy does not continue to survive with the sword, and Hector's child is doomed to be viciously murdered, rather than escaping to Mount Ida.<br/><br/>That said, I really did enjoy this film, although it felt a long one.  Brad Pitt's portrayal of Achilles as a tortured hero was sheer poetry, even if it didn't fit with my own view of the petulant, egotistical maniac of Homer. Peter O Toole was devastatingly good as Priam and Eric Bana was a perfect Hector, one of the few characters, along with Odysseus, remaining true to the spirit of the text.  Orlando Bloom made a pretty Paris, but the inclusion of his archery rankled with me - it was jarring reminder of his role in LOTR and really spoiled the suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Troy will probably go down as one of the classics, and it is a great film.

","First of all, it was a well produced and directed movie. Nice customs, nice casting. The heroes understood what they should perform. I also agree that Helen was not the reason but the motive to start the Trojan war and it was positive that it was mentioned. The customs were realistic. THe characters were up to the epic, with slight differences.<br/><br/>But... Menelaos was not that old. Agamemnon was not that gritty The fight between Achileas and Agamemnon started because of Briseis, during the Trojan war, not before. Achilleus was not a veteran ordered by Agamemnon, and nowhere was said the reason of his immortality (so that the audience would understand why he died with this way, when Paris stroke him).<br/><br/>Orchomenos was not in Pelloponese and not in the Homeric era (the place in the map, at the beginning of the movie). Hellen was blonde indeed. No -one mentions why Paris had chosen Helen. Why Appolo and Posidon protected Troy. Why the walls of Troy were not easy to be destroyed by the Greeks. Andromachi did not escaped with their baby...that was the bad think of the Trojan war. Where was Ekati? Where were the 50 sons of Priamos? Where was Kassandra? Why should Helen have two roles, the one of the maided-accused-for-the-war and one of Kassandra? Where was Laokoon, the priest-divinator whose role took Paris?? Where was Aeas? Both of Aeas?? Nestor was not a mentor of Agamemnon, he was the king of Argos. Where was Triptopolemos? THe son of Achilleus who was called after the death of the last one? Where was Filoktitis with his poisoned arches? Briseis (and Chriseis) was not a priest of Appolo; their father was. Offending a god's temple was a hybris to the people and nowhere in the poem was mentioned that Achilleus had destroyed the temple of Apollo. On the other hand, it was a good movie for the people who have no idea of what Iliad is about...and as a matter of fact I cried when the Greeks used the Trojan Horse (Dourian Horse in my scripts) to take Troy.<br/><br/>I have a last question: Why Hollywood makes the maximum of effort to show in its identical form fairy tales such as Lotr or Harry Potter and doesn't do this when it comes to real myths and the heritage of our world???????"

","Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy"" is well-directed, well-acted, and the production value is very well done. However, this film follows in the footsteps of many other superior films that all make their point more strongly than this one. It is a very competent film, but I think is little more than a large-scale spectacle movie that is lost amidst all the sub-plots and characters. Had this been a six-hour mini-series on television, it probably would have played better with these many characters. Very distinct echoes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and, most especially ""Gladiator"" are very noticable throughout this film. Even the score for this film is almost directly plagarized from ""Gladiator"". The one thing that distinguishes this film from the others of its kind is the question of who to care for more: The Greeks or the Trojans? On one hand, we have the Greeks, who have entered this war for glory and revenge. Their king, Agamemmnon (Brian Cox) is a power-hungry madman. Their greatest warrior, Achilles (Brad Pitt) is a fearsome and brutal killer who does so for his own glory and eternal fame. Then we have the Trojans, who are fighting this war at their doorstep because of the love of the prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) has taken Helen (Diane Kruger), the wife of another Greek king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) who is brother to Agamemmnon, back to Troy with him, severing the fragile peace that the Greeks and Trojans have just made. The king of Troy, Priam (An excellent Peter O'Toole) has no desire for war, but will fight to protect his son and his city. There is also Prince Hector (An excellent Eric Bana, who can finally live down ""The Hulk"") who is a great but reluctant warrior who wants no more fighting so that he can live and be a husband and father. However, fate and the gods seem to conspire against all who inhabit this world. From what I understand, this film has taken liberties with the ""history"" of this story and made it a modern re-telling with flawed and decidedly modern-type characters instead of the legends of mythology. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of confusion and obvious suspensions-of-disbelief with many of the characters. Another element that this film suffers from is its frenetic battle scenes. The editing makes it very difficult to tell who is who a great deal of the time. Also, some of the performances are a little flat. Pitt, who I think is a wonderful actor who has shown in films like ""se7en"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", and ""Fight Club"" that he is more than just a pretty face and well-chiseled body. But as Achilles, he tends to wander a bit. Bloom, whose Legolas in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy catapulted him to stardom and his role in ""Pirates of the Carribean"" only helped to solidify him as one of the next big things, is very one-note. Meanwhile, it is the women who suffer the most. Kruger, and Saffron Burrows, as the wife of Hector, have very little to do other than cry a lot and look pretty. Cox, who has his share of great performances from ""Manhunter"" to ""L.I.E."" sees fit to portray Agamemmnon as a brutal savage with no mercy and is the biggest cookie-cutout character of all of the players. The player in this film that will probably go unrecognized for his great work is the great Sean Bean for his wise and heartfelt portrayal of Odysseus. This is decent summer fare, but don't expect it to perform at the Oscars as well as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Gladiator""."

","Troy is not an epic masterpiece, but it doesn't try to be. It's thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted, well-directed, and an utter pleasure. Yes, I did a double-take when Agamemnon's fate, uh, contradicted what I read in high school, and the ten-year Trojan War was wrapped up in about a month, but a good story is a good story. I would say the movie is a bit closer to the way it really happened than Homer's version -- do any of us really believe the Greeks and Trojans were mere pawns in a war of the gods? In other words, the story is adapted for a modern audience -- the same way the oral tradition of Homer's time adapted the story for their audience. To those who hated the movie: I understand, you make good points. To those who say the movie is the greatest movie ever made: well, you're jumping the gun a bit, but yes, it's quite satisfying -- flawless in terms of what it tries to accomplish."

","This film ISN'T a deep study on human nature, nor an original approach to a 'war tale'. It doesn't invent cinema nor tries to play with its language. It doesn't display huge battles with 'grandeur', and it is neither an audiovisual challenge, as 'LOTR' is, Peter Jackson's entertaining toy full of special effects for your eyes and ears.<br/><br/>In the other hand, 'Troy' IS an outstanding action film because it shows one of the best battle tactics and maybe the best one on one fights ever, inside an undisguised war film; because it gets close to this war so harshly that it inevitably becomes anti-war; and, above all, because it reminds us (maybe vaguely; sadly, this film is far from deeper tales as Dalton Trumbo's epic script in 'Spartacus') that the most interesting special effect is, simply, the story."

","Here are a couple of extra items to add to Ray Keebaugh's finely-observed list of Things We Didn't Know About Homeric Greece Until We Saw ""Troy"":<br/><br/><ul><li>Llamas are indigenous to eastern Europe and Asia Minor. (Silly me, I thought they came from South America.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The right to wear tie-dye was reserved solely for Trojan royalty.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In Troy, the sun rises in the west, rather than the east.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Achilles' mom, the goddess Thetis, enjoyed jewelry-making as a hobby.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Paris was closely connected to his inner Elf, which is evidenced by the fact that he never really relaxed until he picked up a bow.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Time passed very quickly in the ancient world; amazing to see how a ten-year-long war could seem like a week.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Shaolin fighting monks must have migrated to from China to ancient Greece at some point long ago, as Achilles' fighting style was strongly influenced by Asian martial arts (complete with slow-motion and rotating-camera effects).</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, I give ""Troy"" 2 out of 5. The female cast were all very stiff and featureless, Orlando Bloom's version of Paris was very wet, and Peter O'Toole should have had much more screen time. Plus, by omitting the Greek gods and goddesses and generally making free with Homer's story, the director muddies the reasons and impetus for much of the plot, including the ""Achilles heel"" moment. Still, Brad Pitt looked very nice from the neck down, and Homer's ""wine-dark sea"" was quite pretty and blue. Plus, we should be grateful that the filmmakers did not inject a ""warrior princess"" character into the story, as is currently the fashion in Hollywood (like they did with with Arwen, since people here can't seem to resist comparisons to LOTR). But certainly worth a bargain matinee or a DVD rental (when the time comes) for costume-drama fans.

","I enjoyed the movie Troy, but was disappointed at the way Homer's work was butchered. Iliad was about events that occurred in the tenth year of the siege of Troy. The Greeks had come to Troy thinking it would be easy pickings and instead found themselves fighting a nightmarish never ending battle. Troy was Vietnam for Mycenean Greece.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen attempts to do what even Homer never attempted; instead of taking one single story of the war and using it as a metaphor for the greater whole, Petersen scrunches together the whole war with its various tales, digressions, and consequences, and tries to make a single story of it. His version of the Battle of Troy plays fast and loose with the traditional details, and in attempting a task of such great scope, misses out on some powerful lessons about humanity, human behavior, and human nature. Wolfgang Petersen is no Homer.<br/><br/>This said, the movie is still tremendously engaging and interesting to watch. Computer-generated battle sequences are mesmerizing and in some cases improvements over those seen in the Hobbit films. Single combat is portrayed with great style and ingenuity and is truly frightening at times. The cast is able (Pitt is quite good as Achilles, Bloom is likewise appropriately flowery and dislikeable as Paris Alexandros). The scale and scope of the film is epic, grandiose, and impressive."
"fungsusie","Null","0","1","12 June 2004"," I've seen this movie, read the book, gone back to see the film and find it enjoyable and believable.
","I will not comment on many aspects of the film which many viewers have already done. I want to say something about Achilles.<br/><br/>There are many criticisms of Pitt's ""bronzed surfer"" which I find rather unnecessary and mistaken. In the Iliad, Achilles is described as ""god-like in his peerless beauty"" which to the ancient greeks included personal valor, fighting skills and physique. Even Priam, after his ransom of his son at Achillles's tent, looked on him and agreed he was ""like a god to look at."" The greeks had no problem with admiring beauty. Why should we? An important aspect of portraying Achillles is to bring out that beauty and perfection of his physical form. So what's the problem? Achillies is an icon of a very different value system. The ancient greeks loved and prized physical prowess. They hold sporting contests in honor of their dead. We are more likely to dismiss Achilles as a vain body-builder and judging from the comments of many critics, it does seem we are not as comfortable as the greeks in taking delight in the beauty of the human form.<br/><br/>There may have been an excessive desire to sell Pitt's good looks and physique but that's not his fault. As one viewer in these columns had already remarked, someone on the set wanted him to be more Brad Pitt than Achilles. Pitt is a fine actor and is capable of much more if given a chance.<br/><br/>Still, given the limitations, I find his portrayal of Achilles a sensitive and intelligent one. Achilles is usually thought of as only a great warrior, all brawn's and no brains, but there is a deeper more introspective side of him which I'm glad the move has chosen to explore. Achilles knows that man is doomed. In the book, he says to Lyacon ""Yes my friend, yo too must die. Why make a song about it?...And look at me. Am I not big and beautiful, the son of a great man, with a goddess for my mother? Yet Death and Sovran Desitny are waiting for me too."" In the movie, Achilles says to Patroclus ""We men are wretched."" In his dreams, he sees all the men he's killed waiting for him on the banks of the river Styx. When he goes out to wrap up Hector's body for Priam, he weeps and says to the dead Hector ""We shall meet again soon, my brother."" In the face of death, all men are equal.<br/><br/>Even god-like Achilles will die. His knowledge and acceptance of this brings a humility and gentleness to Achilles which lets us love this great warrior more.<br/><br/>In his eagerness for battle and glory, Achilles can be proud and conceited, conscious of his stature as the greatest warrior, seeking for his personal fame at the expense of other's lives. But Pitt's Achilles allows a kind of compassion, a weariness and pity for man's lot to creep in ""It's too early in the day for killing princes."" when he lets Hector go. Achilles can be cruel and vengeful but he is also capable of understanding Priam's pain, of admiring courage in an adversary and granting honor where it is due (Hector's funeral, after his wrath has dissipated a bit). Achilles knows that every moment is more beautiful because it will not last.<br/><br/>He is brave partly because he has looked death squarely in the eye, unlike our modern-day fear and denial of death. He is a man who dares to say what he thinks and do what he feels, not constrained by the ""soldier's obedience"". He knows that life is short, bitter and sweet. I feel Pitt has done a good job in portraying such an Achilles.<br/><br/>Is this how Achilles really is? Whose Achilles? Homer's? Peterson's? Pitt's? It doesn't really matter. Homer has given us a great work of art, to help us imagine and understand ourselves a bit more. This film has also done its part in giving us its own words and images. It's not perfect. Nothing is. But even imperfection can satisfy and inspire."

","It constantly amazes me how, despite the uncounted original works of fiction that have never seen conversion to celluloid, Hollywood continues its tedious remake schedule of old, already done-to-death films. Of course, Hollywood covers up this trend with the new buzz-word ""re-imagining"", to describe this remake trend. But a remake is still just  a remake, no matter how badly you muck about with the story and characters or how many CGI effects you can cram in.                                          <br/><br/>
So it is with Troy. Though not an awful film by any means, it really doesn't stand out as anything memorable. In fact, it had the feel of one of those old Italian sword-and-sandals epics from yesteryear, just with better known actors.<br/><br/>The film moves along at a good pace and there is plenty of action, but it's not really edge of the seat stuff. Most of the actors give OK performances but the only one who seemed to have any passion for the role was Eric Bana, as Hector. The others just seemed to plod along. Orlando Bloom didn't seem at all comfortable with his role, at least, not until he had a bow in his hands. Peter O'Toole gave one of his usual ""I might launch into a manic moment at any time"" performances, though mercifully, he never does. And Brad Pitt.....Hmmm. Brad Pitt as Achilles, a legendary hero. Well, I have to admit that he certainly worked out a great deal and looked great. But he didn't seem to me to project the commanding power that the role required. Maybe if he'd been a few inches taller.....<br/><br/>Overall there isn't much plot. The whole film is just an excuse for one battle scene after another. It's as if the writers decided that the audience knew the basic plot anyway, so they didn't need to do anything other than write ""insert battle scene here"" at various points in the script. In fact, this is a rare occasion for me. I have to say that I felt the battles actually got in the way of any story there might have been quite badly. As a result the movie is essentially one long series of battles interspersed with idle chatter and thin attempts to develop the characters.<br/><br/>Oh, and how Wolfgang and Co must have laughed at their little ""Achilles' Heel"" joke at the end. That was one of the most awful contrived moments I've seen for a long time. Laugh it up Wolfgang....made your money back yet?<br/><br/>All in all it entertains, though it is definitely NOT destined to be remembered alongside such old epics as Ben Hur or The Ten Commandments. Watch this movie for the battle scenes, which, whilst well done, are most definitely overhyped. Supposedly the most gory and realistic battle scenes committed to celluloid, they are, nonetheless, quite ordinary as far as I am concerned and could have benefited from some imaginative choreography.<br/><br/>
Not bad, but not good either."
"derickallen","Null","0","1","9 June 2004"," By a narrow margin, succeeds as an epic
","Haven't read Homer's Iliad. In fact, didn't know of its existence until the trailer for Troy came out a few months back. From the trailer alone, I thought this was another epic worth watching. I had to do a little research on Troy as neither the Iliad nor Greek mythology was ever taught as part of our curriculum, unlike in other colleges. Of course, it was all worth the researching and waiting when this film finally came out and I have to say I deeply regret that fact that it was not part of our English curriculum.<br/><br/>I must say, after being awed by the hugely triumphant Lord of the Rings trilogy, I was expecting more movies of that genre would come out... the ancient and epic type... In fact, I was highly anticipating yet another epic adventure to come out, it was just only a matter of a few months I said. And Troy was born.<br/><br/>I had no detailed prior knowledge of the story to which I could compare the movie as it unfolds so I guess the only benchmark to which I could consciously compare it from time to time while watching was the recent LOTR. True enough, there were a lot of similarities and I have to say at least they attempted to duplicate, if not rival, those pioneered by the LOTR such as the massive CGI army, the long and sweeping camera shots and angles, the elaborate costume, armour, and set designs, etc. There was not much WOW factor involved but it was good to see such feats again even for the nth time. While it lacked the more expansive camera sweeps and inherent thrill by the LOTR, it stood on its own. It was rather decent, neatly done, and believable. After all, you could not beat down the master, not for the next 5 to 10 years perhaps. That I have accepted. Aside from these few instances of forced comparison between the two epics however, the rest were original for Troy.<br/><br/>Well almost, except for Paris portrayed by Orlando Bloom. This boy simply does not know how to act well. He has a limited range of emotion and facial expressions that he keeps on repeating over and over again. Worst, he was given a bow and an arrow reminiscent of his Legolas days. Bad, bad, bad. But he did portray the cowardice and humiliation of Paris rather well, if it were the intended effect in the first place. I guess he didn't have to act them out with much effort for they were the actor's default expressions.<br/><br/>Oh yes, the scene stealer they say was Peter O'Toole. He did great alright, but it is without a doubt equally shared by Brad Pitt as Achilles. Although they didn't have to keep reminding the audience that he was the greatest warrior ever. They just have to show it and we'll pick it up if the portrayal was good. Fortunately, both the verbal reminder and the portrayal were top notch so I had not much problem about that. In fact, Brad Pitt imbued the character with the grace, skill, and action befitting a god-human warrior. This proves that Brad Pitt also has a place in action-adventure, not just dramas. Indeed, he displays remarkable acting range. He should however work on his accent though, thick tongue he got there.<br/><br/>I was particularly interested also on the actress who would play Helen especially so that her beauty was purportedly the cause of this great war. She was only briefly shown during the trailers and she looked beautiful. She still is beautiful now that I've seen the film in its entirety but that's just it. No uniqueness and greatness to her beauty. You could easily forget her face. In fact, she's just pretty. They got one of the best looking actor but they got lazy looking for a one-of-a-kind Helen.<br/><br/>Eric Bana as Hector was a big surprise for me. I did not expect he can also deliver such nifty performance. He was believably a really good father and son in the story, fitting the character very well. His facial expression when he unknowingly killed Achilles' cousin (or lover) thinking it was Achilles says and captures it all.<br/><br/>There's one avenue this film excels over LOTR: it's the individual fights. A lot of well-thought, well-prepared, and well-executed choreography are evident here, which I complained to be lacking in LOTR. I guess you just could not have it all eh. Particularly, the best scene belongs to the grand one-on-one fight between Hector and Achilles. Witness how Achilles uses his shield and the trademark ""death leap"". The most emotionally-charged scene is when King Priam secretly met with Achilles begging for his son's body. Peter gave a perfect effortless performance on this one and was well reciprocated by his younger colleague Brad.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film relentlessly succeeds in being an epic adventure. There were no gods as one might expect but that was OK. I respect their decision so long as the film can still stand on its own. Rightfully it does. This is wrongfully rated as R18; a PG13 would have been more apt. Finally, as this film was very costly to make, I hope it will earn reasonably at the box office because it faces tough competition with other big films slated to be released this summer like Van Helsing, Shrek 2, and Harry Potter. A film as worthwhile as this, I just do not wish to lose financially. If you have money enough for just one movie, between Harry Potter 3 and this one, you can wait for the vcd or DVD of the former."

It's true that as the gods are omitted in the film Helen appears as a brainless woman determined to trigger a war for love: she is not Aphrodite promised Paris he would have her. Some say that Paris is a spoiled brat who should have been killed: he has grown far from his family and was only found back recently, that's why they are all so glad to have him (moreover Paris is not supposed to be a nice man just because Orlando bloom is famous...).<br/><br/>The absence of Gods had numerous effects, it is not obvious for people who do not know the iliad that Achille has reasons to be so scornful, that Paris and Helen had no choice. People think that Agamemnon is a tyrant ready to invade any part of the world for any reason: he is only Menelas' brother and leader of the kings who have all sworn to protect the couple Menelas/ Helen There are some details that really do not fit in the original story (the way Odysseus convinces Achille to come, the death of Achille...) but it's an adaptation of a book six time as long as LOTR, and including a cast of famous actors that do not like to die stupidly and cowardly... In my opinion it is a very good film, though there are some discrepancies with the Illiad. Those who say that they didn't like the characters miss the point cos the characters are mainly as they should be. Moreover I think that those who do not know, quite well, the Illiad can not appreciate the movie as they should, cos they do not know the ins and outs.

","Well, I guess you have to be a woman to really appreciate Brad Pitt's star quality in this particular movie. He hasn't made an appearance in any big movie hit for years and only played in weird and daring films (not bad, just not mainstream/blockbuster stuff), so I really enjoyed having him and all his sexiness on the big fat screen. As for his acting, I think he played Achilles (who is basically an egocentric bastard) very well, all the other actors made the best out of their roles, too. It was just that you didn't really have to act much in this film. Troy is about battles, about clashing swords and chariots and big heroes, and you can enjoy it as action film. It was a bit disappointing for me that the gods were completely left out of the whole story and that it was made to look like historical events. This placed too much weight and decision-making on the heroes' shoulders and while the whole story made sense in a way, all main character lost their loveability because they weren't toys in the gods' hands but real killers. I also dislike that they left out Cassandra, she would have made at least one strong female character in the whole plot.

","When proud gods and greedy warriors collide, war and conflict are inevitable. That pretty much sums up the underlining theme behind every story in the Greek mythology: Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Athena, and co. against Hercules, Prometheus, Achilles, Perseus, and their like. Sometimes the gods dominate the battle with their awesome power, and in others the witty mortals come up with a deceptive strategy and fooled the deities, turning the tides with an unyielding zeal.<br/><br/>And there's the Trojan War. Possibly the greatest war ever known in the whole myth, it pits the Kingdom of Troy, safe and secure behind their city walls, against the whole Achaean region, which is a part of the great Greece, an alliance of kings and war generals under the great ruler, Agamemnon.<br/><br/>Troy focuses on the role of Achilles, an Achaean warrior known for his unbelievable strength and invulnerability. Though a Greek by birth, he despises Agamemnon and his army, refusing to completely submit to his control. Yet, Achilles desires an everlasting recognition of his name, which he perceives can only be attained by fighting in a great battle, and winning.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is a 100% American. And it looked like he was unable to adapt to the foreign character required for the movie, at least not for the lack of trying. He's got a strong American accent within his tones, which sounded awkward when everyone else speaks in the old English style. However, he makes it up with superb performance as a combatant, frequently awing the audience with his 'jump-and-stab'.<br/><br/>Definitely a 10/10! With an overall picture quality that's only second to Lord of the Rings, thanks to breathtaking photography and strong battle scenes, it's hard to see a fault in this heavy winter blockbuster, technically speaking, of course.

","You think you've seen this remake again and again and again..... well this movie sticks to the same basic storyline, but with one major difference... the acting, action choreography and visual effects is just way more spectacular. Brad Pitt plays an excellent Achillies... the mortal boy dipped in the water of the gods making him practically immortal. His fighting styles with sword and shield makes one imagine the depth of training and skill it takes to wield them.<br/><br/>Let's also mention that Brad Pitt is absolutely, fantastically sexy. He spends a quarter of this movie either naked or with a cloth wrapped loosely around his waist (very low slung ladies... Ohhh laaa laaa)<br/><br/>This is a must see, no matter how many times you think you've seen the various versions of the Troy saga."

","Well, being Greek American, I was looking forward to this movie for the past two years. After all is said and done, it has met my expectations in some regards while falling short in others.<br/><br/>Starting with the good---- I honestly have to say that Eric Bana, Peter O' Toole and Sean Bean gave INCREDIBLE performances. They were the 3 most believable characters in the entire film. If there is ever a follow up, i.e. The Odyssey, I am confident that Bean can carry the load. Also, I think that Brad Pitt should get more credit than he has been getting. Sure- he had his corny lines and bad accent. However, at the end of the day, when I left the film I honestly felt like he fit the ""bad ass"" mold perfectly. He was a refined killing machine with no conscience except when it came to Briseis. His fighting scenes were remarkable and he portrayed the demigod Achilles to physical perfection. *The individual fight scenes between Hektor/Ajax and Achilles/Hektor were memorable. The scene between Pitt and Bana is one of the best of all-time. *Priam begging Achilles for Hektor's boday was highly emotional. A classic scene which resonates down to our current day.<br/><br/>Now, for the bad----- 1) The music was horrible. Expecting something similar to Horner's masterpiece in Braveheart, I was utterly disappointed. When I think of both Braveheart and Gladiator, certain songs stick in my head from each film. Troy only had a few good musical scenes. I think that dramatic music would've added greatly to the emotional feel of the movie. At times, I also felt that it was too GRAND. (trumpets, horns..I felt like I was at Anglo-Saxon banquet) 2) The script: A large portion of it was good..however, some lines were way too clichÃ© and melodramatic. (Like when Helen said ""Don't Play with me, don't Play."" and when Paris told Bana ""You're the best man I've ever known."" I mean, I think that a sorrowful and silent pause in that circumstance would've been much more moving. I simply felt that some of the stuff they were saying was typical of what we always hear in epics. (Not enough imagination) 3) The lack of emotion: Although it had its emotional highs, I expected to leave Troy in awe and full of goose bumps- Neither happened. I left feeling good- but I did not feel like I did after I saw Braveheart. The death of Achilles was intense, but NOT GRIPPING.<br/><br/>** 3 out of 5 Stars**"

"drewwesley","Null","0","1","3 June 2004"," A good film with understandable characters.
","How closely does the film resemble the epic by Illiad? Probably little, but remains ""inspired by"". How apparent is the film's attempt to shine as an epic feature? Very. Can you see CGI in the masses of ships, battalions, and terrain? Of course. Rather than looking at film to amuse us, we study films critically. And this sometimes takes away from the enjoyment films should give us by taking ourselves for a ride.<br/><br/>And a ride it is! This film does something most movies should, but most movies don't. It offers the viewer an equal perspective to the scope and drama of opposing characters that maintain a respectable degree of integrity. Achilles (Pitt) desires a legacy of timeless fame albeit knowing of his impending doom. Hector (Bana) wishes to defend Troy, preserve his family, and protect his honor. Prince Paris (Bloom) - think archer from LOTR and pirate from POTC - follows his heart by taking another king's wife for himself. Does their love justify this act of adultery - and stealing? Henceforth, a superb individualist warrior, a nationalist, and a love-struck prince ignite one of the greatest wars the world will ever face.<br/><br/>But at least in this film, it is easy to walk in the shoes of the characters because you know where they've come from, and where they want to go. Achilles has always been forced to fight and hone his skills to kill swiftly and effectively. He searches for peace, compassion, and any redeeming quality that heals his humanity. Hector has served his father and city as an honorable young leader. But instead of rebuking his brother for inheriting royalty, he wears his armor of duty with strength, determination, and loyalty. Paris is accustomed to nobility with little experience in combat. He's no superhero, and his best courage is limited, but he introspectively questions his honor."

","Every year it happens. The first epic of the summer. It has effects, it has big names, it has the big advertisements, it has ... no writing!<br/><br/>First I may have to apologize for actually knowing the story of the Iliad. Quite frankly, after seeing the movie, I'm surprised they give Homer any writing credit at all. He certainly wouldn't want that credit. <br/><br/>The actors did what they were supposed to. Brad Pitt captivated the audience, Eric Bana supported him well and was a good complement, and Orlando Bloom played an excellent pretty boy. <br/><br/>Beyond that, the movie clearly got too big for its own good. The Trojan War lasted 10 years, not three weeks. In its effort to convey the heart of the war, Troy somehow felt too thin. There really weren't any epic battles. There were a few good duels, but that doesn't make a movie. The characters weren't especially well developed. Achilles, the most developed character in the movie could not have been further from the true myth of Achilles, who truly was a large, dumb brute with very homosexual tendencies. Of course, Brad Pitt would not want to play such a character, so they changed it. And, any movie set in Ancient Greek Mythology that completely ignores any presences of the gods feels like you only got half the story.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie felt like a lightweight version of Gladiator, minus the acting, the writing, and the story."
"castansfield","5","0","1","2 June 2004"," Not particularly Greek, not particularly good...
","Troy is the sort of movie that tries to be many different things and fails at most of them. It tries to make a very Greek story more appealing to modern American audiences by condensing its time line, eliminating its gods, and focusing on the big ""heroes"" of the piece, but it retains the (mostly) simple-minded motivations and the (mostly) appalling behavior of the protagonists. It tries to be an ""epic"" but forgets that epic movies have to have high-minded goals. It tries to be dramatic, but badly miscasts the lead actors and badly directs them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the makers of this film did not realize that, while Ancient Greek can, for the most part, be translated into English, Ancient Greek values can not be translated into American ones. The Ancient Greek concepts of heroism and honor are such a far cry from modern notions of them that it is simply foolish to shoehorn the Illiad into a pat American action-adventure format. <br/><br/>In general, there is no one to root for in this film, because it is clear from the start that everyone in the film is motivated by base emotions, from the greed and power-hunger of the ""villains"" Menelaus and Agamemnon, to Achilles' sheer ego and misplaced machismo, to Odysseus' unquestioning sense of ""duty"" to fools, to Paris and Helen's immature, teenybopper love. In some films, this lack of true ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" could be an asset, leading the audience to meditate on genuine issues of war and patriotism. However, the film at no time allows that sort of reflection, concentrating instead on the ""heroic"" biceps and glutes of Brad Pitt and the rest of the beefcake on display. ""Troy"" wants to be a rah-rah action film with no one to rah-rah for, and that is its biggest curse.<br/><br/>Its second biggest curse is Brad Pitt, who is one of the most startlingly uneven actors of his time. Pitt's career has featured both stand-out, star-making performances, as in ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club,"" and also appallingly empty-headed and flat ones, as in ""Meet Joe Black"" and ""Legends of the Fall."" ""Troy"" firmly falls into the latter category, featuring Pitt at his most Keanu Reeves-esque. At no time does Pitt rise above the mostly pedantic dialogue or show any of the charisma he has demonstrated in other films. Pitt's Achilles is all muscular surface and no thoughtful introspection. Meanwhile, Pitt chooses to adopt a semi-British accent which is both utterly unconvincing and utterly unnecessary for an Ancient Greek. The entire blame should not fall to Pitt, however, for the character he is given to work with is an enigma- he is thoroughly unlikeable (doing such ""honorable"" things as desecrating the dead body of his foe and choking his recent lover), and yet the movie never actually admits it, treating him as a blonde demi-God through and through.<br/><br/>Though Pitt, as star of the film, stands out among mediocre actors, others share the blame. Orlando Bloom is neither convincing as a lover nor as a coward, and at no time is it ever clear why Helen would choose him, of all men, to run off with. On the other hand, Diane Kruger as Helen is such a non-entity in her role that you can't understand Paris' attraction to her, so perhaps they are the perfect couple. Meanwhile, the usually-solid Brian Cox is lucky he didn't choke on all the scenery he chewed during his performance.<br/><br/>Luckily, the combined talents of Peter O'Toole and the underrated Eric Bana and Sean Bean balance the scales a little bit- all bring gravity and conviction to their roles, making them believable, noble, and sympathetic characters. I would actually welcome ""The Odyssey"" if Bean could reprise his role.<br/><br/>As for the battle scenes and special effects (which, admittedly, people are going to see the film for, anyway), they are spectacular and well-done. However, they are also redundant- if the filmmakers had to eliminate important characters like Cassandra and the Gods, couldn't they have made the movie a lot shorter? By the time the Trojan Horse is finally wheeled in, there have been several ""climactic"" battles between the Greeks and the Romans- mercifully, the final funeral scenes are brief. Of course, by then you might be so tired that Josh Groban's lifeless singing puts you to sleep even faster than it's intended to.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, Troy is neither rollicking enough to work as escapist entertainment nor deep enough to work as a dramatic film. The hapless actors are given hokey dialogue and nearly-absent direction, and most of them don't rise above those limitations. And, call me a nit-picker, but is it too much to ask that the actors learn how the Greek names are actually pronounced? Every time I heard Helen's ex referred to as ""Men-el-OW-us,"" I cringed.<br/><br/>But oh, those biceps and glutes!"

Honestly I haven't seen many of Brad Pitt's movies or liked him that much in the movies except for Mickey in Snatch and J.D. in Thelma & Louise, but when I saw him as Achilles it completely got me entranced in Troy. He was amazing as Achilles and brought amazing acting to them movie. The fight scenes were a little gory but well done and the romance was very well put in to the movie. Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, and a number of the other actors and actresses that were in the movie were great in the acting.

","Possible Spoilers.<br/><br/>Troy is certainly not a bad movie.  It is an interesting subject, and the special effects are excellent.  However, it lacks the weight that an epic should have.  The characters are superficial due to the number of them present, and the story fails to engage.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of the attack on Troy by the Greeks after Helen, the wife of Menelaus is taken from Sparta by Prince Paris of Troy.  Those who have read the Iliad will notice differences between the it and the film. Most noticeable among the variations is that while the Trojan War is said to have lasted for 10 years, the battles depicted seem to last only a few weeks.  Also, the ending for the Trojans is far more uplifting, with Hector's family, Helen, and Paris all escaping.  While the alterations will disturb those tightly in love with the Iliad, they are necessary to bring this story to the screen at a running length less than 4 hrs.<br/><br/>Achilles, played by Brad Pitt, is the official star.  Everyone comes second to him, but Pitt's rendering of the great hero makes you wonder why.  Yes, Achilles is known for his self-importance and arrogance, but he should also seem dangerous enough to be respected, and this just isn't the case.  Two dimensional as Achilles is, the other characters aren't much more memorable. The actors play their parts appropriately, but not with distinction.  Peter O'Toole as Priam leaves the only real lasting impact.<br/><br/>As mentioned previously, the special effects of the battle scenes are superb.  The costuming is also wonderful.  However these are not enough to save Troy from mediocrity.  The film is decent, but not what a great legend should be."

","This was an action packed, bloody spectacle. The battle scenes were huge and terrifying. And, of course, Brad Pitt was gorgeous. Unfortunately, it's not the story Homer told. His story included the intervention of the Gods. His story spread the war over 10 years, instead the 3 weeks that this battle seemed to take, which gives more drama and tension between the characters. His story was complex and interesting, giving the warriors better motivation for their actions. And some very important characters were missing, like Cassandra, Priam's prophetess daughter who foretold the doom of Troy, but no one would believe her. They sort of morphed her into Briseis. These were two different characters. And Achilles never rode inside the Trojan horse because he had already been killed by Paris' arrow to his heel.

I found the difference in acting quality nowhere as evident as in the scene in which Priam visits Achilles to ask him for the dead body of his son. O'Toole acts this scene with great intensity and Pitt's facial expressions as he reacts to Priam's words are just plain amateur theatre group quality, really ruining the scene for me. And another thing: I may be wrong here, but it seems to me that in each of his films Pitt has at least one scene in which he is eating (in Ocean's Eleven it seems like it's the only thing he ever does), and I don't know why this infuriates me so much - perhaps because he always eats the same way, irrespective of his role, or because it seems again like such an amateurish acting device?"

Brad Pitt's achilles seems capable of one facial expression, a menacing pout, but he does manage to carry across Achilles' high-strung character, essential Greek desire (I believe the Greek word was kleos) to emblazon his name in posterity. Orlando Bloom captures Paris' vanity (I wonder why), and cowardice. Eric Bana shines as Hector. His character is<br/><br/>impossibly likable: a reluctant warrior, an honorable fighter, at heart a family man, a prince who cares more for his people than his own life. This noble Hector (who is indeed portrayed this way in Homer), combined with Brian Cox' nasty, self-important, and power-hungry Agamemnon, makes the view want to root for the doomed Trojans.<br/><br/>In all, the movie is not bad. The script is poor at times and two things key to the plot of the Trojan war are omitted: one is a scene in which a wily Greek convinces the Trojans to accept the horse; the other is the explanation of Achilles' love for Patroclus, which sends him on a rampage. In total though, the movie is pulled off. You leave the theater feeling like the movie, rather than just battering you, has also made you think. It's worth watching.<br/><br/>7/10"
"milesm7597","4","0","2","29 May 2004"," Muddled epic
","SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>There have been much discussed about the film's adaptation of Homer's epic poem about the battle at Troy. Artistic license aside, I think it is unfortunate that the very points of departure from Homer's lyric poem, and indeed from much of the oral stories of Greek lore, is precisely what makes this film sadly muddled and surprisingly lacking in epic catharsis.<br/><br/>First of all, one of the main themes of Homer's poem was the futility of the mortals in second-guessing the rather diabolical and playful natures of the Gods. This theme, served to underline the fatalistic sense of impending doom and the mortals' hunger albeit futile race toward immortality prevalent throughout the Iliad. This drives both Achilles' and Hektor's hubris in defying the Gods. Without this underlying sense of existential futility for which the mortals fight for, and the mischievous shenanigans of the Gods, the film fails to capture the epic tragedy of the humans' quest for freedom (and immortality) under the whims of the Gods, and their inevitable fate.<br/><br/>Achilles' main characteristic - as one embodying both mortal and God, with a rather beautiful history of having been dipped in the river of immortality (except for his heel), being excised, just reduces him to... the rebel without a cause - the unwilling hero driven only by ego without context. <br/><br/>More out of character is the film's depiction of Hektor. Hektor is Troy's best fighter. He is also a brave and valiant hero. By anticipating Achilles' victory over Hektor in the film, the film minimizes Hektor's own capacity to be fiery, brutal, outlandish, arrogant, hotheaded and indeed the portrait and inspiration for Shakespeare's Hotspur in Henry IV. Hektor goes down fighting fierce. Bana's Hektor is way more introspective.<br/><br/>Added to that a rather difficult (and in this film unsurmounted) characters of the lovebirds Paris and Helen, complete with stilted, unconvincing and in fact annoying lines, the film just falls too short of true conflict with genuine cathartic emotion. <br/><br/>The relationships in the film fall surprisingly flat, opting for messy battles completely devoid of the poetry that made Homer's 800 page bloodbath so beautifully horrifying. A key moment in the film and poem, the dragging of Hektor's defiled body around the grounds of Troy before his horrified father and wife, is curiously abridged (the poem sees Achilles dragging the corpse around for days before he is slain by Paris while on his chariot) and as a result, surprisingly hollow when it should be sacrilege. Such is the tone of the film that fails to match up to the poem's epic proportions.<br/><br/>Such is the catharsis that Homer offered his listeners - epic battles poetically described, themes underlined, pain vested and characters rich and intertwined. This failure is surprising, since Aristotle once wrote the very 'rulebook' of the well written play (or in this case, screenplay) that Hollywood has adopted whole heartedly in its 'formula' screenplays. exposition- conflict, turning point, catharsis and denouement. The film fails to deliver on any of this with any aplomp or relish, given such rich material to draw from. Disappointing."

","I have not seen such a failure in cinema in many years.<br/><br/>Troy opened well...and then plummeted. The music was horribly done. For this type of movie, there should not be repeated motifs over and over, with no bass or percussion backing. For a war movie, I envisioned a score with much more percussion and heavy bass sounds, similar to the score of Master and Commander or The Last Samurai.<br/><br/>Costuming was also not done well. Some of the armor looked like it was plastic, which it probably was. Achilles' costume worked out well, because it was simple, but not all Ancient Greek and Trojan soldiers wore elaborate armor. In fact, most just had a metal chest plate and helmet.<br/><br/>The acting was the only somewhat good aspect of this film. Brad Pitt wasn't great, but he could hold the character of Achilles together. Eric Bana did a good, strong job as Hector, but it could have been better. Orlando Bloom was annoying, but the character of Paris is, so that works well. The man who played the King of Troy did a very good job. Sean Bean did a very good Odysseus, also.<br/><br/>Some of the camera-work was done well, other times it was not. Some visual effects made the set seem to other-worldly, rather than near the Aegean Sea.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie was not very good. It was hyped a lot, but there were many, many shortcomings."

Therefore I guess it might be comprehensible that they alter the final end of this legend in this movie, despite the fact that it becomes much less exciting than the real epic story. Besides, there is also a great pity that they drop the part of miracles, which also decreases some attraction of this film."
"glennrparker","5","0","3","27 May 2004"," Gladiator Redux
","Well I was kinda looking forward to this film. I'm a big fan of Greek Mythology and although the story of the Trojan War isn't as full of fantastical elements as most of the myths, there are some worth mention in a film which intends to illustrate the story, most obviously, Achilles mystical origins. Although the work of Ray Harryhausen was far from definitive and is now very dated, it did introduce the wider film audience to the world of Greek Mythology and fired my imagination as a child, spurring me to read and learn more on the subject. I was hoping that ""Troy"" would bring an opportunity to introduce contemporary audiences to this vibrant world.<br/><br/>Sadly, what we have is a remake of ""Gladiator"", stripped of its mythological origins and told as a straight war/romantic epic. The Achilles/Agamemnon relationship is very reminiscent of that between Maximus and Commodus. The ""Troy"" battle scenes reminded me very much of the early battle in ""Gladiator"". Neither film manages to surpass the battle scenes put on film in ""Braveheart"", which started this whole historical epic cycle. Peter O'Toole's King Priam just kept reminding me of Richard Harris' Marcus Aurelias. Replace Romans with Greeks (same religion, different names) and the comparison is complete.<br/><br/>The fact that its mythological origins have been omitted proves detrimental to the story. Although the Gods are often mentioned, we have no real proof of the awe they inspire and details such as Achilles' weakness appear odd by having no proper explanation.<br/><br/>There is one scene that stands out however, and no doubt will be rightfully applauded. The grudge match which ensues when Achilles rolls up to Hector's House is tremendous. A stand-alone fight scene which casts all of the film's other battles in the shade.<br/><br/>Onto the acting. Pitt's Achilles looks and acts like a living statue. Usually a very fine actor, here he seems paralysed by the stodgy dialogue. He only really comes alive in the aforementioned fight scene outside Troy. In contrast Eric Bana's Hector is a very impressive performance. He ably conveys the Trojan hero's strong sense of duty, which is often at complete odds with his belief in what is the right thing to do. Diane Kruger is a very pretty Helen, ""the face that launched a thousand ships"", but she too falls victim of the sub-standard dialogue. Sean Bean makes an engaging Odysseus and Tyler Mane is an imposing Ajax. Orlando Bloom's Paris is portrayed as naive and immature, which makes it difficult to understand how Helen would risk so much for him, but it does make for compulsive viewing as Hector's sense of duty towards his brother, against his better instincts, leads him to risk so much. But when Bloom takes up the longbow, I found myself thinking of Legolas again, which perhaps shows lazy casting.<br/><br/>I was hoping this film would lean more towards ""The Lord of the Rings"" and less towards ""Gladiator"", so I was a little disappointed. However, it is visually engaging and moves along at a brisk enough pace for such an epic. But a wasted opportunity, I feel, nonetheless."

","They did do a fairly good job of condensing 10 years of warfare into 4 weeks. The film had all of the salient points of the epic although not necessarily in the right order or context.<br/><br/>I didn't think that Brad Pitt did as bad a job as other reviewers. He did show the obsession and range of emotions of the lunatic he was portrayed as. After all, the actor can only be as good as the role he is given. Orlando Bloom did show some excellent emotions at times. He shows that he might really have promise for more than a pretty boy with a little more work and the right vehicle.<br/><br/>Peter O'Toole was magnificent ( what else is there to say ). The rest of the Ensemble was very good. For some reason the part of Odysseus was downplayed. For me the best part of the film, was when Paris passed the sword of Troy to Aeneas. Without that the film would have lost all credibility.<br/><br/>All in all, I think that Homer would have been pleased with this visualization of his story that had been passed down by oral tradition for a thousand years. <br/><br/>I give the film 3 1/4 stars.

"Nitznatzer","7","0","1","26 May 2004"," Big disappointment
","To make it short: I expected to see an epic action-filled masterpiece. But the first half of that movie was boring: neither screenplay, directing, music, camera nor actors were satisfactory. You only get the full bundle of monotonous dialogues and not much action in the first 60 minutes! One word to the music: in my opinion it is absolutely misplaced: when it should set the i-dot to some scene it only destroys it because it kills the camera dramatics.<br/><br/>After 60 or 70 minutes the movie gets better, the actors (I liked Eric Bana most) also (but it's hard to love Brad Pitt in that movie).<br/><br/>And there is also good music (stolen from Gladiator: woman's ""crying"" voice) and a ""stolen"" big battle scene that can't beat the perfect ones of LOTR II / III. Unfortunately the scriptwriter also changed the lyrical order in a very liberal way.<br/><br/>The movie tries to show you how a city/ a room (even a king's audience room) looked like at that time. So it tries to transport you into another time. That's the good news. Bad thing is that this doesn't let the movie look like a multi-million dollar epic...<br/><br/>So they get you into the cinema with that bombastic trailer, but then...<br/><br/>I can only hope that the director of ""day after tomorrow"" which will start these days has done a better job.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you want to see a good epic tale you should watch ""Ben Hur"" or ""Gladiator"" or LOTR, but don't expect too much from this ""Troy""."

When you see Gladiator, since the beginning, it is clear that Maximus is slowly going to death. So, when he is really dying you already knew it should happen, but you can't help falling in tears. It is passion, it is something that goes beyond rational thinking and brings you into the story.<br/><br/>Troy is a big movie that pays great attention to his historical roots (for an example: Troy stands up on a three-hundred feet tall hill just like the ""real"" Troy found by Schliemann), but lacks in respect of his audience, telling the story without passion or style.<br/><br/>No style in his editing, that is a little childish. No style in his music (How did James Horner do that?

By that point of view you would love Achilles' wrath and violence combined with love and grace (he's got grace even when he kills someone!), or Ulisses' little mind tricks, so poor in ethics but full of knowledge.<br/><br/>I hope you will see this movie anyway: you'll enjoy Achilles and Hector as lead characters and the great visuals of the landscapes and the battles.

In this case, we see about 74 different pans and sweeps of the ships coming to Troy. Anyway, blah, blah, blah... there is tons of love story crap, and tons of Brad Pitt's butt.

","Troy is extremely loosely based on Homer's writings, so do not expect a movie based on the book. Instead Hollywood have made a screenplay the Hollywood way, and I am so lucky that I have not read the book, so I was not disappointed about the characters.<br/><br/>The movie has a huge budget and I am sure that the producers expected to make an epic movie like Spartacus, Ben-Hur or Patton, but they failed to succeed on this level.<br/><br/>An epic movie needs to be big in every sense, and not all directors have understood what makes a big movie big. Battle scenes with huge armies are often a good way to make the movie big, and Petersen understood this very well. You can enjoy the visual part of the battle scenes, I can only say that the battle scenes are impressive.<br/><br/>An epic movie should also have a good story, and this is one of the weak points in this movie. I am sure the story has a lot of potential, but it does not work that well in the movie. It is maybe because the movie is too short with less than 3 hours. Ben-Hur is almost 4 hours long, and I miss 30 minutes or more of Troy. Some scenes were simply too short, which often is a bad habit for modern cinema.<br/><br/>The casting should also be right in an epic, and I am not sure that the choice of Brad Pitt was right. He would be credible, if Achilles was presented as a god, but he was not. Instead he was presented as a great warrior, and I cannot see Brad Pitt as a legendary warrior. The other actors worked better with Eric Bana as the best. Sometimes I felt that Orlando Bloom was more Legolas than Paris, when he was using his bow. I think it was a bit dangerous to choose an actor who just has been a main character in a recently released trilogy, but this will maybe change over the years. You do not think that Indiana Jones is Han Solo today.<br/><br/>Still I feel that the movie was not that good. As a part of the audience I felt that some parts of the story were not really explained, instead the movie continued to the next phase, where I was sitting back disappointed that some part of the plot was not explained more in details. This is not the feeling I want to have, when I watch a potential epic movie.<br/><br/>The movie had the potential to be legendary, but something went wrong during the production. I do not think it is Petersen's fault, it is more likely that it was the script.

","I saw this movie as a Shakespearean Tragedy in that the major characters had fatal character flaws that ultimately controlled their destiny or demise.

Paris' (Orlando Bloom) flaw was the fact that he was a wuss - he did better later in the movie so long as it did not involve hand to hand combat.<br/><br/>In my opinion there were 2 major problems with this film. One is that it never invoked an emotional quality that made you care. Epics such as Saving Private Ryan or Master and Commander both drew the viewer in emotionally. Second, all of the actors have given better performances in other movies. For instance, there was a scene in which Drad Pitt is trying to cry (I won't tell why to spoil any of the movie), but it almost seem that he was yawning instead.

I think it would have been better if they had chosen to focus on less characters.<br/><br/>Before the film I didn't know anything about the story of Troy, but from watching it I could tell that it had been changed a lot. I suspected that the love story between Achilles and Paris and Hector's cousin wasn't in the original story as it seemed to be tacked on. Again, that was very weak. The acting was good apart from a lot of them seemed to struggle to keep a British accent (Eric Bana, Brian Cox and Diane Kruger). Orlando Bloom seemed to use the exact same few expressions he used all the way through Lord of the rings especially when they gave him a bow and arrow. Brad Pitt stood out to me even though he didn't have a very good script to work with, and the fighting scenes were pretty good too.<br/><br/>I was really disappointed but it was entertaining so I'd buy it anyway.

I can forgive them for not including the character of Cassanda, but I found it hard to forgive them killing off King Menelaus by the hand of Hector!  In the original mythology, King Menelaus lives, gets his runaway wife, Helen back home and kinda lives happily ever after.  When they killed off Menelaus, I knew then that this movie was not going to follow ""The Illiad"" at all. <br/><br/>
I think the director of this film wanted to show the evil of greed (Agamemnon wanting to conquer Troy) and the stupidity and brutality of war. This movie tries to be serious about these themes, but doesn't quite come off that well.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is very good as Achilles.  Alot of critics said that Brad Pitt is miscast as Achilles, but I don't think so.  His portrayal of Achilles is right on the money.  Achilles is arrogant, brutal, self-confident, battle-weary but honorable warrior, and that is absolutely portrayed to perfection by Brad Pitt.  Brad's got this long-haired blonde beauty look going that definitely makes all the females' hearts beat faster (I know mine did)!<br/><br/>Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom gives very good performances to characters that weren't written very deeply.  Peter O'Toole is terrific as King Priam.  The best scene in the movie had to be King Priam humbly asking Achilles to give back his son's body so his son could have a proper burial.  The two actors, Brad Pitt and Peter O'Toole play off each other nicely in this scene.  I felt that was the one true moment in the film that felt authentic.<br/><br/>This movie is like, two and a half hours long.  Way too long in my opinion. The audience around me was getting fidgety, and so was I.  When the heck was that legendary trojan horse coming?  And when that horse do make it into the walls of Troy and the soldiers all popped out of it, it was anti-climatic. <br/><br/>
This film is no way a powerful epic.  It should've been better written. This movie when it comes out in your local video store, is going to be an excellent rental.  In my humble opinion, I think this movie will play better on the small screen.<br/><br/>I give this movie a C+."

","SO GLAD to see the classics return to theatres and capture this level of interest. Pushed by the winds of success of TROY (2004), is it foolish to hope to see a sequel called ITHACA, based on the Odyssey? I think the setup is there. (*** A LITTLE BIT OF SPOILER *** The last scenes of TROY show Odysseus (Sean Bean) honouring Achilles at the pyre.)<br/><br/>At rated R, the younger adults who are not able to see the movie now must be disappointed. Even then, it might be a good idea to read The Iliad in the meantime, and so the time will pass. I did that for JRR Tolkien's LOTR back in 1994, but of course the movies have not been made then. Such works of imaginative literature are sources of great films and they inspire as well as inform movie-goers.<br/><br/>I found Brad Pitt's Achilles easy to believe in. I think it was an interesting role for him. In five or ten years time, who would like to remember Pitt in Snatch, or Fight Club or Seven? Well, I guess time will tell! Pitt's martial depiction of Achilles was well done. It would seem that for Pitt to take on a subsequent martial role would be to diminish a Pitt-Achilles to a Pitt-Genghis Khan or to a Pitt-Napoleon. This Achilles is the right martial role for Pitt.<br/><br/>Now, Orlando Bloom (who played Paris) may do well to explore the benefits of job range. He is good with those arrows, yeah. My teenage cousins are agog over Bloom, so there is probably good reason for casting the guy.<br/><br/>Cast with Bloom a second time was Eric Bana (they both played parts in Black Hawk Down). Bana's Hector gets my two-thumbs-up. The tragic-hero character could not have been better served. (*** SPOILER AHEAD ***) Hector's chariot-dragging by Achilles at the end of their one-on-one combat outside the walls of Troy is proto-typically reminiscent of more recent treatment of warriors in Somalia (a la Black Hawk Down) and in the Iraq war.<br/><br/>Special acknowledgment to Rose Byrne's Briseis. Natalie Portman could not have done it any better.<br/><br/>I believe Wolfgang Petersen interpreted The Iliad for our times. I did not expect a faithful screenplay, and I am not disappointed by the liberties that were taken. In the end, the movie was about TROY and not THE ILIAD. The value in the difference lies in the one bridging the gap to the other. See it and read it, in any order you can or would like. By the way, the book is not R-rated.<br/><br/>7-1/2 of 10."

Too much of Achilles standing around looking angry and or arrogant. It took away from the actual story. Having read the the Illiad I was a little baffled that the the movie displayed the War as if it only took place over only 2-3 weeks. The Trojan War took place over a span of 10 years. ~Something I did like was when Paris handed the Sword to Aeneas at the end of the movie.(You know, the sword that as long as a Trojan has it their people shall go on.) After the fall of Troy, Aeneas led a band of Trojan refugees to Italy and became the founder of Roman culture.(You can read about their journey in the Aeneid) That part in the movie was a nice little touch. All in all, the movie was decent,but it should have been called ""The Story of Achilles"" instead of ""Troy""."

I am NOT a big action movie fan, but I think action fans will like it (I went with two, and they LOVED it).  Big scenes and battles, along with the obligatory attractive women and typical cheesy hero cliches will attract the action crowd.<br/><br/>As for me, I liked the visuals, the music and the direction overall. Wolfgang Petersen is a pretty good, solid director.  Almost every scene in the film effectively conveyed grandeur, power, and energy!  It also really gave you the feeling of being back in time.  I was impressed by that, so the movie didn't bore me or anything.  But I didn't think the story worked, artistically...<br/><br/>They tried to make the Trojans the ""good guys"", but it just didn't work, and I don't see how it ever could.  After all, Troy started the war by kidnapping a woman at an up-till-then successful PEACE MEETING, and then continued the war by keeping her.  How does one make that look heroic? Well, apparently, not very easily.  They tried to make you feel sympathy for Helen, but I mean come ON.  A huge war because some chick is tired of her husband?  Imagine how many wars we could have today on that basis, heh!  And it certainly didn't help that Paris (the guy who wooed Helen) was a trash-talking wimp who never backed up his big heroic promises.<br/><br/>They try to make you hate the Greeks by portraying Agamemnon as a greedy old jerk, but it doesn't fit with the setup of the story.  The great heroes are Achilles and Odysseus, who are both Greek, so they come across seeming very strange, like heroes who somehow ended up on the wrong side, a side they hated (I kept expecting them both to defect to the Trojan side).  You end up feeling sorry for the Trojans, just because they're such fools!  And you feel sorry for the heroes because they spent their whole lives fighting for nothing, or for ""bad people"".<br/><br/>Not satisfying.  Not satisfying as a tragedy, not satisfying as a drama, not satisfying as an epic, and only satisfying as a movie because of Wolfgang Petersen and some nice action sequences.  IMHO."

Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did excellent jobs training for this movie and this is a definite must see for their fans, but still an awesome movie all around without that.

Although it is a long movie, it does not feel like it because the story moves right along without losing interest.Don't listen to the usual critics who always have to unfairly criticize big-budget films with big stars just to sound falsely intelligent. They criticize some of the changes in the story from The Illiad, which, as you've noticed, is NOT the title of the movie.

Boasting perhaps the most extras I have ever seen in any film (or are they visual effects?), and, next to the Lord of the Rings, some of the most epic, absorbing battles ever captured on film, Troy is a film which thrives solely on its spectacular action. Set aside this element, and the performances of Brad Pitt's cawky, confident Archilles (""You won't have eyes tonight..."")and Eric Bana's tempered, ferocious Hector provide at least a tolerable ground for otherwise impassable ""love before honor"" and ""the details of war"" scenes.

"Faizan","Null","0","1","24 May 2004"," A movie that wrongfully depends on the shoulders of its giant star. Good entertainment nonetheless.
","A caveat for those of you who take their history lessons from the movies; Troy is inaccurate and doesn't follow the epic poem 'Iliad' entirely. But that isn't its biggest imperfection. That dishonor belongs to the decision of placing its faith on the star studded cast of Hollywood superstars, led by a stilted and constipated Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>The central story remains much the same as dictated by legend and documented by Homer. While on a peace mission to Greece, Paris (Orlando Bloom), prince of Troy, falls in love with and eventually sneaks away the King's wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), much to the dismay of his elder brother Hector (Eric Bana). Repercussions eventually arrive in the form of the Greek army invading the shores of Troy, led by Agamemnon (Brian Cox), apparently avenging his brother Menelaus' (Brendan Gleeson) loss of a wife, but having a grand scheme of domination all his own. He also despises yet requires the presence of rebel soldier Achilles (Pitt), who himself seeks fame and glory above all else. <br/><br/>As a war movie, 'Troy' offers lazy aerial shots of battles that have become all too common to viewers familiar with a certain trilogy from the last few years. Director Wolfgang Peterson is far more successful at placing his leads in one-on-one combats that show his deft usage of close camera work to provide raw scenes of carnage and brutality. Especially effective are two key battles that pit Paris against Menelaus and then later towards the climax, Achilles against Hector. The latter vibrates with energy and cackle absent in any of the other bigger set pieces. <br/><br/>As the pivotal character, Achilles' is overflowing with pride and arrogance that eventually spills and gives way to a dull and vexed figure who is difficult to like because Pitt's presence feels too contemporary. Unlike the then relatively unknown Russell Crowe in 'Gladiator', Pitt's star appearance hurts the film achieve a sense of the ancient that it strives for. Bana as Hector fares better, not only because his cause carries more resonance, but also because he successfully evokes the proper balance of heroism and righteousness. The cowardice of Paris, as played by Bloom, is here turned into a class act. For the little duration that he is on screen, Peter O'Toole as King Priam of Troy brings a dignified grace that only comes with age coupled with ability. A scene where he sneaks into Achilles' tent and pleads for the body of his son is powerful and shows a marked contrast between the capacities of the two. <br/><br/>The dialogue is clunky and attempts at making the story seem political, fraternal and confrontational all at the same time. The end is also too tidy and polished in setting the comeuppance of all the major players while James Horner's trumpet and vocal heavy score is a misfire and does little justice to the visuals. In the end Troy delivers less than it promises because it promises too much. And although there may be much to admire about Troy there is little to like about the central figure of Achilles.<br/><br/>Rating B"

","I've seen Troy on this Friday and have to admit that it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen. From the historical point of view the movie had some flaws. Particularly the direction from where the sun rised when the Greek army was at Troy was very disappointing. On the movie the sun rised above the sea but it should be above the land since Troy is at the east coast of Aegean sea. I was confused if they were still at Greece or they've been to Troy:) The landscapes are also not as of the actual Troy. From the point of camera technique and acting, some short cut, slow motion scenes were really irritating and unnecessary. The performance of the actors was average but really sufficient since the movie was not focused so much on characters. However if you like to see some familiar scenes from ancient Greek mythology and some action with nice costumes and really nice backgrounds I would suggest tis movie without hesitating."
"Lianna9","9","0","1","23 May 2004"," A really excellent film -- from a certain point of view
","That point of view is this: forget what the credits say about the Iliad being the inspiration for Troy.<br/><br/>Instead, consider Troy to be the inspiration for the Iliad.<br/><br/>Pretend that Troy is the real, what-actually-happened story, which was then modified and enhanced through hundreds of years of oral storytelling in a culture in which people believed that the gods routinely interact with mortals and intervene in their lives. And then think about how and why changes might have been made in the story over the centuries. One example of this has been completed for you by the filmmakers. They have explicitly spelled out how the legend got started that Achilles was a near-immortal who could only be killed by a shot to the heel. Here are some other things to consider in the same vein: <br/><br/>Do you think that people might have come up with an intervention by a god to explain Paris's survival after his defeat by Menelaus because this made more sense to them than the idea that Hector could commit a shockingly dishonorable act? Do you think that people might have ""forgotten"" that Briseis was a virgin priestess and member of the Trojan royal family because of the potentially embarrassing ease with which she gave up her virginity to Achilles? Do you think that people might have come up with a convoluted backstory for Paris, rumors of extreme beauty for Helen, and legends of an extraordinary love between the two of them simply because they hated the irony of having such a devastating war being started by an impulsive sexual fling between an immature guy and an unhappy woman?<br/><br/>I think that Troy works surprisingly well from this sort of perspective. I looked at Troy this way and found the story fascinating. I also found most of the characters to be very real and compelling, especially Hector, Odysseus, Paris, and Helen (yes, Helen). If you try my backwards view of Troy, you might have a similarly positive reaction."

","I've been looking forward to seeing Troy for a while now, despite negative reviews. Finally I had a chance to view it last night and beside the fact that the running time is two and a half hours, I found it to be a pretty good movie. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a date movie, well, don't see Troy. Actually, forget that, if you want to have a girl clinging to you then see Troy. I know I cringed at the fight scenes (and violence is usually a plus for me!), actually at a few points I almost climbed on top of the seat trying to protect myself! It's just a movie like that, where you can really get into it. <br/><br/>The real tragedy of Troy is that there is no bad side. Discounting Agamemnon (Brian Cox) both sides can be sympathized with. You've got the Spartan's side who believes they are fighting for Helen (Diane Kruger) and then you have the Trojans who are protecting their prince, Paris (Orlando Bloom), and their land. However sad it was to see all the deaths, I left the theatre feeling satisfied.<br/><br/>Now to the actors, unlike some I found Brad Pitt to pull a masterful performance - maybe it's because I didn't have any preconceived ideas of what Troy would be like or who Achilles would be, but I truly enjoyed him in this. I found him to be tormented, yet capable of love. <br/><br/>Eric Bana (Hector) held his own as well as Orlando Bloom (Paris) -- they sure did look like brothers, and I found myself believing that they were in fact brothers. And Peter O'Toole (Priam) was a great ruler, believable as the King of Troy. I loved the scene between Pitt and O'Toole, it made me cry. (not going to say anymore than that for those who have not yet seen Troy). <br/><br/>Another notable performance was that of Sean Bean (Odysseus). I found him to be my favourite character in Troy. He was funny, smart and extremely sexy (whoops, did I say that? I meant likable!) <br/><br/>As for the ladies in Troy, I thought that they were all great. The performance that stood out the most was Diane Kruger, she fit every image I had of what Helen would look like.

"silvercreature","7","0","1","22 May 2004"," in defense of Troy
","I caught Troy in theatres, heading in with lowered expectations. The sense I'd gotten from reviews on the Internet I'd read was that this was a mediocre attempt at something potentially great. I bought that. And before I go into anything, let me just state here that I wasn't enthralled by Troy or anything like that, but I did like it and question those who chose to bash it so much.<br/><br/>I really don't understand those people that want to attack its ""historical accuracy"". Everyone should know that this is not about something that actually happened. It is a work of fiction. I wonder if people simply assume a movie is based on true events if it's set a long,long time ago (like hundreds or thousands of years). Troy wasn't even a real place. It may have been loosely based on some real places but the fact remains that it was made up. Anyway, I'm not going to get into all that. I'm just surprised that so many people seem to not have a clue about The Illiad.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was well-filmed and that even the stuff that wasn't battles was entertaining enough to sit through. To me personally, the fight scenes were way cooler than those in Gladiator (I feel it's fair to compare the fight scenes in these two movies as they're based on similar kinds of combat and the movies were only made a few years apart from each other).<br/><br/>People shouldn't attack how one-dimensional any of the characters were since this is based on a thousands-year-old epic full of one-dimensional characters. The film-makers actually tried to give Achilles some depth by making him all angsty and questioning fighting. In the poem, Achilles was a hero cause he was great at killing and he never questioned anything - end of story.<br/><br/>My main problem with the movie is the omission of the stuff that would probably have everyone (well, not everyone obviously) complaining were it included and that's the mythological elements of the story. They were completely cut out. Of course, the characters go on and on about their gods but we're quickly shown that there are no gods as everything that happens in the movie has a logical explanation behind it. They even ruined Achilles' death this way - they showed him get the arrow in the heel but then made a point of having two more arrows strike him in the CHEST to bring him down. These two arrows get pulled out before he dies and he is found with the single arrow through his heel suggesting that this is why people said his heel was his only weak point. I find it odd to remove mythological elements from a story that's fictional anyway. Now stay with me on this point before you think I'm saying something completely different. I'm going to use the word ""pretend"" here so people don't freak out: let's Pretend that the whole story of Jesus Christ is just a fictional story like Troy. Now let's say that the movie The Last Temptation of Christ is made about this fictional story. Only for some reason, the film makers see fit to come up with rational explanations for events that happened in the story that were supposed to be miracles or the work of God. Like, I don't know, having Jesus have a bunch of wine hidden at that party so that people were only lead to believe that he'd turned water into wine. Why do that? After all, aren't the supernatural events what make the story interesting and worth telling? The characters talk about Achilles being the son of a god and that's why he's so great but the movie makes it clear he's not. If he'd been invulnerable to all injuries except for his heel (like he is in the actual story) then it would have been clear that he was the son of a god but the film makers made sure that we knew he wasn't. That there were no gods. I just don't understand that. It's true that even with the supernatural elements removed, there is still an interesting story there but I just don't see the need to leave them out. If people were afraid that today's audiences wouldn't buy the gods doing stuff, then why would they buy a huge war being waged because of one woman? And I hope we don't live in that world anyway. It's a movie about something fictional, it's not real, so you don't have to buy into anything anyway. Just watch it. Or don't.<br/><br/>It just would have been cool to see the more mythological aspects kept in. I don't even really disagree with the changing of other things like the decision to make Agamemnon a total jerk (ditto Menalaus) and have him get killed (ditto Menelaus).<br/><br/>Anyway, I wound up liking Troy may more than I thought I was going to and I'm so far baffled by most people's complaints about it (I've read reviews on here in which people stated that characters didn't get scarred or dirty - are these people blind? what movie were they watching?) but that's not to say that it's a fantastic movie or anything. I've named my criticisms and they make sense. It's fine with me if you hate the movie but don't hate it for ""historical inaccuracy"" - that makes no sense. Don't hate it for things like ""the war is senseless"" or ""Achilles is one-dimensional"" - those are part of the original story and sort of the point - if you don't like that stuff, take it up with Homer. People should learn to read. Also, don't get so hung up on the fact that Brad Pitt shows a lot of skin - that has nothing to do with anything."

","Troy is a wonder of animation cinema age.In movie,there is a great work of creating cities,battle scenes.I'm not complaining it.Because if this is the war of all times,this is the only way to be like it.This is a movie which you always want more.<br/><br/>     But in spite of great animation work,Troy is not a classic unlike Ben-Hur,Lord of the Rings,or Gladiator.There are a lot of points I like to see but when you make mistakes in main things,there is no matter for the things deep in core.I think Petersen forgot some points for glorifying the heroism in audience as he tries to make a great movie.<br/><br/>     The most beautiful thing for the movie is the philosophy and the drama surrounding it.This movie is not just a story,it tries to be deserving of the structure of the novel,Iliad, and tell something about the nature of human and politics.Glory by Achilles,politics by Agamemnon,conscience and responsibility by Hector,passion by all of them.By this side,movie gains a deep and strong structure which everyone get something to think,especially about what is going on in today's world.<br/><br/>      The second advantage of the movie is the great cast.Every actor is a legend like the characters they play.There are a lot of 'many-talked' actors but I think the greatest performances are from Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox.By their amazing performance,they nearly make the movie their own acting challenge.Especially Brain Cox,by his acting show,he throw away everyone playing with him,no matter if they are million dollar worth Brad Pitt or Eric Bana.As I said the cast is the biggest reason to watch this movie,except one...<br/><br/>    The biggest disappointment for me is Brad Pitt.There are 3 ways to make a movie like this.First,you take a legendary director so there can be actors with normal star statue,like Gladiator.Or the tittle is a legend so there can be normal star statue actors or director,like Lord of the Rings.Troy goes with the third way,a normal star statue director so there have to be super star actor.And I don't think there is anyone who suits Achilles in mind better than Brad Pitt among super stars like Tom Cruise,Johnny Deep,Keanu Reeves.I thought I wouldn't say this in a hundred years bu I understand that the only super star to play Achilles is Charles Heston in all cinema history.I may not appreciate his personality but he has the face of these characters.Brad Pitt is one of the actors I like watch most but he is just a baby-face for this one and the watcher can't take seriously when he talks about politics,glory...<br/><br/>     Another factor about this fact is there is too much nudity in this movie.No matter if there is love or women,this movie tells a man tale.Telling their fights and sacrifices.And as you wait for to see another character,man or woman,naked you can't focus on their heroism,dying for what they live for.The biggest problem of the movie is this,as all the main characters going down to die,watcher can't ask in mind 'Why did these man die?,Why did they sacrifice their lives?'.Gladiator was very good about this,because it told a man's tale in a man way.Because no matter if it is a man way,it has the same impact on man and woman audience.If there were less nudity and woman,the empathy for audience would be easier.<br/><br/>      Another thing is a main theme for the music.In total music is very good but it lacks of a main theme which represents the emotions both of the movie and the audience.We saw how it worked well in Last of the Mohicans,Star Wars,or Lord of the Rings.Because of this absence,the feeling,that makes the watchers feel as one in the case of glorifying emotions,can't work well.This is another reason why we can't respond against the deaths of the characters in the way it must be.This absence is also felt in the battle scenes.<br/><br/>      Like theme music,the dialogs are missing,too.There are a lot of spoken words but few is to be remembered.Most speeches are parts of the dialogs but there are few of them to carry the weight of the movie in the mind of audience.Because it is these kind of dialogs which symbolize all the meaning of the movie for the watcher.When you talk about the story,they are the words which you use to give the impression in your mind,like 'You shall unite or you shall fall' in Lord of the Rings or 'May the force be with you' in Star Wars.<br/><br/>     In the second half of the movie,I think there is a problem to make the story going on.Because there are no nearly no drama but a lot of battles.One finishes and one begins.This is a good for a simple action movie but in this kind of movies,there must be an one and only battle which audience can see what they all can see.But even the fight of Hector and Achilles can't satisfy this need.So,I think,in most of the watcher,that's why there is a feeling that something's missing in action.<br/><br/>     Shooting the battle scenes is another thing.The fight of Hector and Achilles is legendary for cinema history, and we feel why they are the biggest warriors of all times.But in other scenes,there are something lost which this scene has:Wide-angle shoots.The shots are taken in the scenes with close angles so we see what's going on inside the battle instead of watching glory and mighty of war.Then in some scenes,Petersen is like to forget the all war and focus on small stagings inside it,like the fight between the Hector and the huge guy in the second battle.Most of the time it is good and makes the audience fell like they are not just watching an animation wonder.But this time these stagings take so long.<br/><br/>     There are great work on creating the city of Troy in building it and animating it, but this movie can't reflect the mighty and greatness of it as we feel for Gondor in Lord of the Rings.The reason is we see a few of city of its big time than we see in burning it down by Greeks.All we witness is the large size of the walls surrounding it.<br/><br/>     Troy is a good movie but unfortunately it won't be in much of the one's top 10 movie lists,I think.The reason is not the things it has but the missing parts of them.Petersen take the characters out of 'more than human' category and represent them as they are all like normal ones inside to make them suitable for the mind of the audience.But he forgets something suitable for the heart.But no matter if it is liked or not by the big masses,it will be a main brick in the cinema history."

","I enjoyed Troy. I thought the story was elegantly translated to the big screen. The landscapes and battle scenes were visually stunning, and the CGI was done well enough that you really didn't notice it. The acting was good, especially Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox. I have not been overly impressed with Eric Bana's previous work, but I felt like he did a really good job as Hector. Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom were adequate. The main downside to this movie was that the dialogue was so ridiculously cheesy that it made it very hard to take the movie seriously (even my wife kept giving me the ""gag me"" sign), but this isn't enough of an excuse not to go see it. I would definitely recommend this movie, especially if you like big sweeping epic films with lots of action just try and take the dialogue as comic relief."

","I had one concern going into the theater: that Brad Pitt would ruin the whole movie. I was wrong. Director Wolfgang Petersen succeeded masterfully at portraying Achilles as a wonderful warrior, worthy of both disdain and respect. But it is Hector, his reluctant opponent who gains our loyalty.<br/><br/>The casting for Troy was excellent. The characters were appropriately developed for the story. The combat is intense. The plot is not disappointing.<br/><br/>Some may prefer characters and dialogue with a little more Shakespearean intellect. But while Shakespeare's plays include violence and war as a backdrop, in ""Troy"" the war is the story. That doesn't make it any less intriguing and entertaining as a manifestation of human values, desires and emotions.<br/><br/>Hector represents strength where Paris, Achilles, and the kings are weak. This is why he rules the movie.<br/><br/>The same people who didn't like Perfect Storm or Gladiator because of who dies, may not like this one either.

Not that I'm saying `Troy' was perfect, I just don't want to pay attention to its disadvantages, because in general I liked the film.<br/><br/>From the very beginning I didn't expect to see serious historical movie as it was clear to me that Troy' is another Hollywood creation made to entertain people. Maybe that is why I'm not disappointed. It is a very nice work, the movie is exciting (battle scenes are not so tiresome as I expected them to be for I don't like watch people fighting and killing each other), most of the actors are famous and reliable (and attractive and partly naked most of the time  all the girls leaving the cinema was sighing dreamily: `Oh, Brad Pitt was GORGEOUS...'), costumes are picturesque. What else is needed to please one's eyes? <br/><br/>For people who like to take compassion on movie characters it's an appropriate movie. Love, anger, sorrow, hatred etc., etc. You can't help crying on some moments... <br/><br/>To sum up, enjoy. If you've read the book you may have some problems as the movie was not even based on' it, just inspired by'. As for me, I spent those 2 and more hours very nice.

","If you haven't read Homer's Iliad you're in for a ride. If you did read Homer's Iliad get ready to buy a big bucket of popcorn to keep yourself busy from being disappointed. <br/><br/>Let me state this fact Troy is not an adaptation of Homer's Iliad! It's inspired by it. Troy is a reinvention and a dramatic one at that but lacks the interesting plot that made the literal work great. Achilles is portrayed larger than life with a heart and feelings-- a killer capable of loving. Helen is down-played and her part of the destruction of Troy is secondary. What really sticks to mind is Achilles, Achilles, and Achilles. I can't help but notice the story revolves around this character which according to Homer was the greatest Greek warrior. Fine. A legend. Big deal. But Achilles did not make prime time in Iliad. In Troy he is the movie. Now, take Terminator and have it go back 3200 years ago and you won't notice the difference because plot wise it's a familiar story. An invincible warrior who in the end gets his heel shot up and he weakens. But the director, Peterson, doesn't think this heel thing is important and presents it uninterestingly. Oh, Paris is loverboy weakling in this version. I felt like screaming out, ""Kick some ass, Legolas!"" Overall, Troy is also 45 minutes too long. Snore."

Major events were absent while some new ones were introduced! I just can't understand the logic that the producer followed to decide which part of the epic should be left off and which should be emphasized! For example the Trojans were apparently more religious, while the Greeks were presented as plain barbarians with no respect for religion!This is only an example of course! I just don't want to bother myself trying to explore every other weakness of the movies historical background!!! Finally i must say that i found disturbing the fact that the original epic is interpreted very poorly in this film! I wonder how the public would have reacted to a similar interpretation of the Tolkiens Lord Of The Rings trilogy! It should be also at least 3 episodes!

"TheFlickDick","Null","0","1","25 May 2004"," Who has read the Illiad?
","Troy.<br/><br/>Directed by Wolfgang Petersen 163 min.<br/><br/>Who has read the Illiad? <br/><br/>Not many people in current viewing audiences I imagine.  I have had two botched attempts in high school and a recent skimming that left me with residual cerebral numbing. It doesn't surprise, though it is a fantastic story, it was written for an audience who's great, great grand children are still complete strangers to our modern society.  So to convey such a epic it seems only logical that it be presented to a new generation (millennium for that matter) in film. <br/><br/>
I'm always a little hesitant when it comes to film epics. Some do hold the majesty and literary integrity that we associate with Greek, Egyptian or biblical legends. (E.g.- The Ten Commandments) Some boldly fall flat on their bushy bearded, porcelain faces. <br/><br/>
Troy is a move in between that.  <br/><br/>Wolfgang Peterson has directed many enjoyable films (Most notably 1985's `Enemy Mine'.) More interested in story and character development than on gratuitous violence, this formula is not lost here.  <br/><br/>Not bowing to a studios typical `Renny Harlin'  bankable style Peterson manages to bring a steady if not slightly light handed approach. Large battle scenes start out in truly epic form but reveal the sad reality of ancient warfare. Brutal, bloody and slow. Smaller scale battles (E.g. the Myrmidon assault on the beach of Troy) and individual fight scenes are choreographed and filmed to perfection.<br/><br/>
Brad Pitt is never quite convincing as Achilles.  Aesthetically and athletically perfect he seems to lack the necessary depth necessary for his character.  No doubt a casting decision based on box office cred, of which Pitt has in spades.     <br/><br/>Pitt's performance is offset by the work of Eric Bana in the role of Hector. Bana's performance outshines even Brian Cox (Agamemnon) and Peter O'Tool (Priam) He doesn't suffer fools except for when the fool is his king and father. Tactical judgements are left in the hands of astrologers. And Priam is, to Hectors chagrin, all to willing to listen.<br/><br/>
Loyal and skilled we see Hector as a man who would rather stay at home and raise his family than go to war. Torn between his love for his brother and the safety of Troy he sees through Agamemnon's plot to use the abduction of Helen as an excuse to invade Troy and control all of the Aegean. <br/><br/>
Troy has some huge literary flaws that somehow, do not detract  from the finished product.  For one Hector does not kill Memelaus.  After the ten year war (which feels like 10 minutes in this movie) Memelaus confronts Helen. He intends to murder her but is captivated by her naked beauty and she is spared. <br/><br/>The most interesting is Achilles is killed, by Paris, but before the Trojan Horse is brought into the city.  <br/><br/>You can kill of Achilles early , but you bloody well can't kill of Pitt to soon.  <br/><br/>The score is nice but a little to reminiscent of `Gladiator' <br/><br/>
Troy is not a bad movie but not a particularly good one either.  Promising much and delivering little the big screen offers little in spectacle.  Be patient, wait for the DVD  so you can view those well defined abs over and over while bypassing the tangled romance scenes that leave you longing for the arrival of the horse.  <br/><br/>

"Sees All","Null","0","1","25 May 2004"," Comic book kitsch
","Yikes! Where to begin!?  I know Greek mythology well, so this original screenplay `inspired' by Homer was shocking to me since it bears only a slight resemblance to its source material.  For starters, the ten years of the Trojan War have been condensed into a couple of weeks.  Menelaus is killed by Paris early on and Briseias (of all people) kills Agamemnon, effectively truncating the entire saga of the House of Atreus.!  (In this version of things Iphigeneia is not sacrificed and Agamemnon will not return home to be murdered by his wife, and Orestes will never avenge him and be driven mad by the Furies.)  If you can get past that, you may find this film mildly interesting if you like spectacular scenery, sets and costumes, attractive performers and lots of violence.  Some of the camera work is stunning.  There are several scenes that are almost direct lifts from the paintings of Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, especially Helen's entrance into Troy.  But there are also a couple of scenes where the light is too bright and everything looks washed out.  The music, for the most part, is intrusive and borrows heavily from Wagner and Thomas Tallis, among others.  The dialogue is comic book kitsch.  The audience laughed several times at the showing I attended.  The performers, under the circumstances, bear up well. Julie Christie, thankfully free of the ravages of cosmetic surgery, adds dignity to her brief scene early in the film.  Peter O'Toole as Priam is as hammy as ever.  Brad Pitt looks good, which, along with some athletics, is all he is really required to do.  (He's a lot older than the mythological original, which makes his character rather peculiar.)  If you are completely ignorant of Homer you may enjoy this film.  I predict that in the future, TROY will be a part of your local TV's late night `Sword and Sandal Time,' along with HERCULES VERSUS THE VAMPIRES."

","SPOILERS.<br/><br/>When given an incredible story such as the Iliad, Hollywood would benefit greatly from the Lord of the Rings example. The action was a lesson learned, but try sticking to the story/characters. Troy fails to capture any details in the poem of the Iliad. I have no qualms with the acting.<br/><br/>""Akhilleus""/""Odysseus"" is Greek, ""Achilles""/""Ulysses"" is Roman; of course they use Achilles and Odysseus. A very picky complaint, but adequately illustrates that the makers bastardized the greatest epic of western literature, and spared no expense to ignore the facts. But how about major adherences?<br/><br/>Every complaint I've heard would have been fixed had they stuck to the material at hand. Flat characters, overdone love scenes, length, etc. are a result of complete neglect of the Iliad. Clearly the worst thing is why start the film before the war starts and end with the burning of Troy, when the book starts 9 years into the war and finishes before Troy is burned? Was there not enough epic material to cover...can any movie capture an epic in 2 1/2 hours and keep the audience's attention? The result is 45 minutes of unnecessary pre-war set up, leaving the film with 2 hours to cover a 9 year war and resolve character issues. Of course Hollywood just solves this by making the war two weeks and two minor battles.<br/><br/>Hollywood has two problems with this story. First, the love scenes are a background theme while the story is about Achilles' anger. Worse yet, Achilles hardly plays a role for most of the book. This will not do for a summer epic movie. Hollywood must make love the forefront and one hero stand out. That's Hollywood's other problem...there are far too many characters in the Iliad who are described in detail only to die. Granted, a movie can't spare that, so why did they span the time frame beyond the book?<br/><br/>I'll never know. They could have made up their own story set in Greece with all this glorified action, and saved a great story such as the Iliad for someone who has respect.<br/><br/>Someone said they should do the ""Odyssey"" now with Sean Bean. Yea, I'd love to see that. Too bad they killed Agamemnon though in Troy. He plays an important role in the Homer's Odyssey, but I guess they don't care much for details anyway.<br/><br/>I was worried they'd ruin the book, and they did. It's an o.k. movie even if you haven't read it."

","SPOILERS (but do read on and avoid the movie)<br/><br/>Having read other comments and reviews I felt obliged to make a comment on this movie for which I have two major complaints (to add to others in previous comments). First of all, this film completely lacks any originality. It starts off spoofing Gladiator only to become a weak copy of that great work in many scenes and in the music. Other scenes are transferred directly from Saving Private Ryan (the landing on the beach), Return of the King (battles in front of Troy, Troy looks remarkably like a smaller version of Minas Tirith) and the other LOTR films (must admit, though, that I enjoyed seeing Boromir and Legolas reappear in Troy when Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom fell back into their roles from LOTR!).<br/><br/>I would not be disappointed by the big changes made during the 'adaptation' from Homer's work if only they made sense in the storyline. Important bits from the Illiad are ignored, and important characters are killed in the film despite surviving in the book. Never mind this, but by making Briseis a niece to king Priam instead of 'just-another-slave-girl' her capture by Achilles should seriously improve the 'Greek' basis for negotiations with the Trojans. No one wonders or asks about this, even though (IMHO) her value to Priam should be sufficient to change the outcome of the war as we know it????<br/><br/>Never mind also the poor dialogue and strange casting. Plenty of comments about this elsewhere.<br/><br/>Watch the movie as part of your Hollywood-homework and enjoy the battle scenes and think back upon and enjoy films mentioned above even more!"

The siege of Troy lasted 10 years, in the film it lasted a couple of weeks. On the first day of major battle Hector kills Menelaus and Ajax. Interesting! Menelaus survived the war and returned to Sparta with Helen, Ajax fell on his on sword at a later date.<br/><br/>Odysseus thought of the Wooden Horse plan a long time after Achilles had been killed, therefore Achilles was not involved in the sack of Troy Paris DID NOT survive the war, and certainly didn't escape with Helen.<br/><br/>On to Agamemnon! Petersen has completed ignored the fact that a series of plays was based on Agamemnon's return from Troy. Aeschylus's Oresteia was based on the return of the king home, his murder by his wife, and the revenge wrought by his son. But oh no, Agamemnon dies in the sacking of Troy! There are other occurrences in the film which made laugh and despair at the same time, but I'm only covering the really major screw ups.<br/><br/>Surely Hollywood did not have to tamper with the stories to this extent??<br/><br/>I thought the acting, overall, was very good, as you would expect from such a stellar British cast. The only weak link was Pitt, and normally I think he is excellent. He couldn't cope with the rage and anguish within Achilles tormented soul, and sometimes it appeared that he was reading off cue cards, so stilted was his delivery. <br/><br/>The battle scenes were good, although a little LOTR. Indeed in a scene near the end I really thought it was LOTR; Sean Bean was hacking his way through a room, whilst Orlando Bloom was firing arrows into the melee.<br/><br/>If you want to switch off for 2+ hours it might be worth seeing. If you want to learn more about the stories surrounding Troy, or you already know them, then don't bother.

But there are many core facts missing that made Iliad so great that it appears a bit poor. Many Greeks are not happy with the fact that ""Troy"" gives a bad illustration of Ancient Greeks. They appear to be a ""mideaval"", semi-barbaric clan and Trojan appear to be very heroic. Greeks were la creme de la creme at the time and were very much advanced. The geographic inaccuracies were very frustrating. There is no port at Sparta and no sea at Larissa. In general, it is a good film, very entertaining and very impressive.

I just feel that the writers have passed up a major opportunity by not showing the aftermath of the war. <br/><br/>This is a story that has resonated through history because it has something everyone could relate to: War. The futility, the horror, the glory of one at the expense of thousands.I do think people should go see this movie because, really, no one is going to make a ""Troy"" movie for, like, another twenty years... Now thats a tragedy.<br/><br/>Oh, and the music feels like something you hear on a cbs mini-series."

","***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Honestly, I came in psyched. I was ready for this movie, even though I knew they were going to take certain liberties concerning the original story of Homer. I was ready for them. I sat through Braveheart's historical liberties and accepted them; and Gladiator turned out wonderful. The few liberties in Lord of the Rings were mainly improvements, and were done with such respect and love for the text that they didn't seem like liberties as all. <br/><br/>I'm now wondering if Wolfgang read any Homer; honestly. <br/><br/>Here was my thought process throughout the movie.<br/><br/>*Spoilers*<br/><br/>First off, they took out the gods. How can you take out the gods? They were essential to the story. There was no getting around them. Making the plot about geo-politics somehow worked though, so I grumbled and sat through it. The effects were neat. OK. No gods. I can move on.<br/><br/>Man, there's some damn good acting in this. Bean, Pitt, Cox, Bloom; they're just acting all over the place. That was a terrible line, and it almost sounded good. That's good acting. <br/><br/>WHAT?! Wait a sec, no, Achilles was a kid who waded into columns of people and created pools of blood; then went home and coerced the slave women. They better not turn Briseus into a love story......<br/><br/>They at least kept Hector and Ulyses the way they were supposed to be.<br/><br/>They're turning this into a love story, and Brad Pitt is somehow going to be the hero of the film, I know it.<br/><br/>Y'know, if you're going to make a T & A film for girls, you should represent it as such; call it ""Brad Pitt sometimes in a skirt"" and allow all of us the foreknowledge. Don't dress it up as a cool History Drama which this isn't turning out to be.<br/><br/>OK, the siege is wrapping up pretty darn quick. This was supposed to be 10 years with a lot more stuff thrown in.<br/><br/>No. Absolutely not. Achilles didn't DO that! No No No! (people in front of me walking out of the theatre exclaiming ""this is bull"") They are turning Achilles into a Hollywood Hero and killing the essence of the character. Completely.<br/><br/>Acchiles; the central character through much of the book, is no longer Achilles. He's now the Hollywood all American poster character. It's like if someone made Harry Potter a blonde haired blue eyed American who randomly threw footballs and got along with his family. That's terrible. <br/><br/>And that just Cheesy the way Agamemnon bought it.<br/><br/>The AENEID?!! Throwing Virgil's cheese into this as well?? Sadly, I think they just did it to leave themselves open to make a 3rd sequel. That's utterly terrible. <br/><br/>So there it is. I could have put up with nearly everything they took with the story until they changed Achilles central character. The big difference between other successful book movies is that this one was made without any reverence for the tex; and it shows. <br/><br/>If you like standard Hollywood fluff and haven't read Homer, see it.<br/><br/>If not, you'll be sitting there, jaw agape, eye's watering, clutching at the seat at the end of the movie wondering why you came."
"rywilliams04","Null","0","1","23 May 2004"," What's the deal?
","OK I've reading a lot of reviews and comments on this movie, and I'm sure my points have been raised already, but it makes me feel better getting it out there, so with that i have 2 comments. One is that i can't understand how some people are so angry that the movie doesn't follow the Illiad. First off no movie based on a book is going to follow it. Second there is no possible way it could have been based solely on the Illiad, the whole scene with the horse occurred in the odyssey. To follow the book exactly the movie would have to be many more hours long, and would confuse the hell out of everyone, because no one would be able to keep track of all the mortals and immortals, events, and what not unless you were a Greek mythologist. So with that said I think a person seeing this movie, along with an other movie, should go view it with the sole intention of seeing a movie, not to become knowledgeable on the history of the Trojan war.. So if your complaining that the war was actually ten years long, don't worry so much and just watch the movie for what it is. Obviously they had to cut the previous 9 years of the war.If it bothers you so much go actually read the illiad and the odyssey to satisfy your complaints.<br/><br/>My second comment involves something that has been bothering me for awhile. After seeing brad pitt in seven and fight club he became to me an awesome actor. For the past couple months i have watched many many movies he has been in. With the release of troy he has received a lot of attention. What angers me is that every interview and article only deals with his looks. I;ve watched a couple interviews and you can actually see him getting p*ssed off that they only talk about his looks. I think he is one of the most underrated actors around. Every movie i've seen him in, he has played his part as believable as I can imagine. His ability to become one with the character he plays shows greatly in all of his rolls. He does a lot to prepare for his movies and i think it definitely shows. People get too caught up in his looks, because..well.. he is a good looking guy, but after watching many of his movies i think he doesn't receive nearly enough recognition as an actor."
"davidbutler","Null","0","1","19 May 2004"," Brad Pitt miscast
","I slogged through over two hours of this movie. It is far inferior to Kubrick's Spartacus. The homo erotic aspects to the story were whitewashed as only Hollywood knows how. The central relationship between Achilles became a cousin/cousin relationship and this enormously reduced the movie's potency for me. The music by James Horner seemed to plagiarize symphonic music by both Shostakovitch and Rachmaninov. Brad Pitt proves that his skill lies in contemporary roles rather than classical roles like this. He vies with the Wooden Horse and is upstaged by it! Perhaps a wooden Oscar? The supporting cast only served to show up the younger stars perhaps Orlando Bloom coming off slightly better than Eric Bana. Good performances though brief from Julie Christie and Peter O Toole who will probably get a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Brian Cox plays pure evil in a perfectly fitting role. He has a great acting range. The movie is lacking in tension and the CGI are laid on heavily with a trowel to cover the cracks in the storyline. For a comparison see Becket and The Lion in Winter....both with O Toole or watch Spartacus incredible even though made in 1960."

","First of all, When I heard about that Troy movie, I told myself, *How could they make a 2 and an half movie about a war who last 3 years???*<br/><br/>It's easy to compare that kind of adaptations with great epics like *The lord of the rings* but they also missed a point: why did they have to choose a side for the audiences??? I mean, M. Petersen could decide to let the two gangs as neutral as possible (Why wasn't Priam (Peter o'toole - very great in this movie; very emotional)the bad guy who let his son kidnap the beautiful Helen and be Menelas, the great noble warrior who come to save her??)<br/><br/>Beside that flaw of script writing, the fighting scenes let us thought about old epics like SPARTACUS and many others) that was something great to watch.<br/><br/>Another good point: the character of Hector and Achilies. Their purposes were very noble and actual, Sean bean (Odysseus) portrayed as well his character, pulled apart from Brian Cox side and Brad Pitt side.<br/><br/>(by the way, I guess that M.

","Spectacular battle scenes (not as good as the ones in LOTR series)! But the storytelling side and the acting side are just average to above average. Something is not quite right when they move Homer's Iliad to the big screen.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't think Brad Pitt did a good acting job as Achilles... He just does not look like the BEST warrior from the Greek side (rather, he looks like a arrogant punk). Can someone tell me why I am seeing Prince Paris becoming Legolas toward the end of the movie? Why is Hector portrayed as a not-so-confident warrior? I thought Hector was the BEST fighter on the Troy side? And, I thought the siege took 10 years in Homer's Iliad. In the movie, I this siege took less than two weeks!!! Overall, it is a good movie but it does not even come close to the level of LOTR. I think I am being generous by giving this movie an '8'!!!"
"Ric-7","7","0","1","19 May 2004"," Myth understanding
","SPOILER, assuming you don't know who won the Trojan War.<br/><br/>I haven't read The Iliad in decades, but wasn't Achilles invulnerable (like Superman), because as a baby he was dipped in the River Styx by his mother, except for one heel which she used to hold him? I am sure I am not making this up. So this means he would be incapable of being wounded (no lover would be able to cut his throat), and his mother would know about this quality. In this film, I am not sure anyone knew, or even if the invulnerability was a factor. The only blood I saw on Brad/Achilles was not his own.<br/><br/>No scars visible on the 98% of Brad's body we were shown. But wasn't Achilles killed by a poison arrow? In the heel? Achilles without a heel is like Cyrano without a nose.<br/><br/>It would have been interesting to explore the character of a brave warrior who knows he cannot be hurt. Is there any real bravery if you know you cannot be hurt? Patroclus stole Achilles' armor but could not steal Achilles' real protection. And how could Achilles hold Hector in such contempt if Achilles were indeed invulnerable, when Hector risked all and Achilles risked nothing?<br/><br/>The movie played as though invulnerability was not a factor. Maybe the movie makers decided to scrap the myth. But if Achilles was not invulnerable, his survival of countless battles without a scratch is totally ludicrous."

"wattly","5","0","1","22 May 2004"," Decent if you know nothing about the Illiad or Greek History (Spoilers)
","Let me first start off by saying this is a halfway decent movie. Although, that probably has much to do with the fact that it is based upon the Illiad, one of the best books of all time. But, they screw the story up so much that anyone who has read the Illiad will spend the entire movie with a 'wtf' expression on their face. Some general problems:<br/><br/>No gods - the Illiad was FULL of gods. Where are they? How can you do the Illiad without gods? Incorrect deaths - Ajax dead? Menalaus killed by Hector? Agamemnon dies? WTF? Achilles - Brad Pitt is what, 150 pounds? Not very threatening. Achilles was supposed to be HUGE, as was Hector and all of the other heros. Perhaps the greatest fighter in the word shouldn't look like a little kid. <br/><br/>Timeline - The war was supposed to have lasted 10 years. According to this movie it lasted about 3 days. There was no sense of time elapsing or anything. Character inserts - Aeneis is my main example. In his story, he fights a little at Troy before founding Rome. In this movie, he's a little kid who gets handed the sword of Troy. Why even insert him, if only to make people confused as to why Aeneis is a little kid?<br/><br/>There were many other changes made, I'm sure to make it fit some cookie cutter Hollywood image. Perhaps the guys in Hollywood should pick up a book before putting something like this out."
"bbbl67","Null","0","1","24 May 2004"," This is not Homer's Troy
","I see a lot of people criticising this film for not being faithful to Greek philosopher Homer's mythological story of Troy. I think what the filmmakers came up with is in its own right a very good story -- possibly even a much better story. It's not cluttered with stories of gods warring with each other and interfering in men's wars, this is purely a fight amongst men.<br/><br/>
Throughout this movie you will see references debunking the role of gods in their wars. In mythology, Achilles was a near-immortal superhero; in this one, he's merely a super-skillful warrior -- he even mocks any suggestion that he's immortal by saying, ""Well then I wouldn't need a shield then would I""? Hector (Eric Bana) scoffs when a war strategy session starts talking about reading superstitious signs; he prefers instead to talk about the practical strategy of fighting this war, such as troop morale. It's men's egos and rivalries that caused this war, and not gods.<br/><br/>
Just by eliminating the supernatural aspects of the story, Wolfgang Peterson, has made a much more relevant movie about war and the ambitions of men. The power hungry emperor, Agamemnon, goes to war on the pretense of defending the honour of his brother Menelaus's marriage to Helen, but really he has had designs on Troy for a long time, and this was just the perfect excuse to go to war. To this day, world leaders still come up with irrelevant excuses to go to war, witness George Bush and his Iraqi ""weapons of mass destruction"" argument.<br/><br/>The special effects and war scenes were spectacular, i.e. Lord of The Rings quality. You see huge armies of tens of thousands of men going up against each other. And unlike in some other movies there really wasn't a good guy side and a bad guy side. You cheer for the Trojans when they repel a Greek attack, and you cheer for the Greeks when they repel a Trojan attack.<br/><br/>
Speaking of Lord of the Rings, there were two LOTR alumni in this movie, Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom. Sean Bean who played Boromir in LOTR, plays Odysseus here; Orlando Bloom who played Legolas The Archer in LOTR, plays Paris here. Interestingly, Paris gravitates towards archery as his weapon of choice here too. BTW, I thought Bloom looked quite heavily like his LOTR castmate Elijah Wood (Frodo) in this movie; it must have been the curly dark hair and all.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt also gave a good performance as Achilles. I thought he brought a somewhat Russell Crowe-type personality to this role. He reminded me heavily of Crowe in the manner in which he spoke, etc."
"newtonooi","6","0","1","24 May 2004"," Biggest letdown since Phantom Menace
","I went to see Troy with several expectations.  First, it would better than the USA movie ""Helen of Troy"" of 2003.  Better fight scenes, better dialogue, more truthful to the original story, and better cinematography. Second, Troy would be as complete in its characters as Peter Jackson's LOTR movies.  Third, a great musical score.  Fourth, a complete movie and not just a sequence of fight scenes.  <br/><br/>My last two expectations were fulfilled.  The musical score was perfect; orchestral - classical feel with grandeur and drama.  The movie flowed well and had enough dialogue and character development to balance out the blood, gore, and special effects.  <br/><br/>My first two expectations were unfulfilled.  The movie was very unfaithful to the original story by Homer.  Any adaption from literature must leave out stuff to save time and because some things cannot be shown, but only read. This I understand.  I also understand if scenes are shortened, or shown out of sequence in order to aid the audience.  But what I cannot fathom is why so much of the movie was very different from the original tale.  The death of Menelaus on the 2nd day of battle?  Achilles inside the Trojan Horse? Four arrows by Paris to kill Achilles instead of one?  The absence of Cassandra and Hecuba, the two most important female characters in the story after Helen.  And of course, the absence of any gods and goddesses to meddle with people's minds and hearts.  Instead the movie became a vehicle for Brad Pitt, his body, his athleticism, and his plain acting.  The movie should have been called Achilles instead of Troy.  The emphasis of the story also changed, from the original grand political soap opera caused by one bad romance (Helen - Paris); to a tale of two ill-fated romances (Achilles - Brises and Hector - Andromache) and one unfinished romance (Helen - Paris). <br/><br/>
Last, I was highly disgusted by the casting.  Outside of Hector, everyone looked AND sounded like northern Europeans.  This tale happened in the Mediterranean, yet I see British Bean as Odysseus, the German Kruger as Helen, Irish O'Toole as Priam, etc.  What the hell?  I didn't expect Troy to be as authentic as ""The Passion"" with all the actors learning Greek.  But they could have taken a look at Hunt for Red October.  Everyone on the Russian sub, including Sean Connery and Sam Neill attemped Russian accents. Get rid of Pitt, O'Toole, Bean, Bloom, and everyone else, and hire Greek and Turkish actors.  Tcheky Karyo would have made a great King Priam, and he is Turkish, which is where Troy sits.<br/><br/>I give it 5 out of 10 stars; 1 for the music, 1 for the Hector-Achilles fight scene, 1 for the minimal gore to complement the great action sequences, and 2 for the great cinematography.  Everything else was a waste."
"ruby_fff","7","0","1","21 May 2004"," An entertaining blockbuster movie of Greek mythology, with stars including Peter O'Toole and a glimpse of Julie Christie
","Directed and co-produced by Wolfgang Petersen (German filmmaker of the famous 'Das Boot' 1981 and his last seen picture in 2000 'The Perfect Storm') TROY is an entertaining big-budget Hollywood fare. The first Saturday matinee show of the opening weekend was quite crowded. Audience attention were held. The film was well-paced even though it's 2 hrs. 42 mins. - it didn't feel long. The story was well-scripted for the screen - condensing and adapting from Homer's 'The Iliad' to big screen entertainment is no small fete - kudo's to writer David Benioff who did 'The 25th Hour' 2002. The battle scenes - yes, the immensity and impact felt with the wide angle coverage - CGI, special effects, visual effects notwithstanding - cinematographer Roger Pratt (who's done quite a few projects with filmmaker Terry Gilliam) delivered effectively, along with score by James Horner at a slightly different tempo here (quite a bit of sweltering notes and trumpets for the period) 'twas good to employ Greek songs aptly mournful in tone to match story progression - there were four funeral rituals respectfully depicted on screen. <br/><br/>There's plenty of online information to be found on Homer, Trojan War, Achilles and as much Greek Mythology as you can take. It seems there's quite a backstory on Achilles' mother Thetis, portrayed briefly by Julie Christie, who has prophetic power, indeed (even Zeus feared her). The scene with Peter O'Toole as King Priam meeting Brad Pitt's Achilles was a memorable one by the lines spoken. A tender scene is when Hector (a steady performance from Eric ""HULK"" Bana), on the night before fighting Achilles, telling his wife Andromache (played by lovely Saffron Burrows) how to save her and their son from the invading Achaean Greeks. The voices of Brian Cox (as King Agamemnon) and Brendan Gleeson (as Menelaus, husband of Helen) were unmistakable even under the heavy garb and beards. ""Lord of the Rings"" fans would be happy to see Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean in action here. The movie could have been called ""Achilles"" as the story is centered around Brad Pitt's role, but ""TROY"" does sound more assuring as a movie title.<br/><br/>Saw the cable History Channel's ""True Story of Troy"" and remembered I've seen the site of Troy when I was in Turkey (1996). It is considered one of the tourist spots for European tours of Turkey by Canakkale and you get to see the legendary Trojan Wooden Horse. Hearing about the excavation history and the archaeologists, literary detectives and military analysts talk about the Trojan War and Homer's poems - yes, like any documentary, these may be mere sound bites and edited images that could be taken out of context, nevertheless, it was interesting to view the TV episode. Perhaps more insightful a documentary on war and the facts and thinking behind war strategy is the honestly worthy Oscar winner, Errol (The Thin Blue Line) Morris' ""The Fog of War,"" where former Secretary of Defense Robert S.(Strange) McNamara is featured talking, reflecting, contemplating about the effects of war. Another fascinating talking head documentary is by filmmakers André Heller and Othmar Schmiderer, ""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary,"" featuring Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, who described her experiences during the last days with Hitler. <br/><br/>It's been a while since we get to see an epic Greek myth on screen, and ""TROY"" is as good a chance as any."

The cast stars only Brad Pitt as first level actor (at least if we're talking about money they get for every picture) but Eric Bana and Sean Bean also are quite believable.

","*Contains Spoilers*<br/><br/>My feelings for this movie is somewhat mixed. There were some great acting from the veterans like Brian Cox (Argamemnon), Sean Bean (King of Ithaca) but much lacking in Orlando Bloom (Paris), Brad Pitt (Archilles), Diane Krueger (Helen of Sparta) and Rose Byrne (Briseis). <br/><br/>I couldn't care much for Brad Pitt's acting; I can't even remember his lines, but he is ideally casted for the fighting scenes. His athletic ability shines in the sword fighting display, that has swift moves, making it almost dance-like. And you cannot deny that he is one strong man.<br/><br/>Diane Krueger's acting is so weak as Helen that you do not understand why the war was started all because of her. Yes, she is beautiful but you wonder is there anything beyond that?<br/><br/>It also could do away with the utterly redundant partial nude/nude scenes littered within the movie; it just distracts the audience from the main story line. As this is pretty much a war epic, I guess Mr. Petersen is just trying to get the attention of the ladies in the audience by lingering on these love scenes, close-ups of Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana and and the very buff Brad Pitt. However, these only made me feel like I am reading another Mills & Boons, disguised as a great classic. <br/><br/>And the scripts have left much to be desired. There were too many clichés; enough to make me cringe in my seat. And sexist remarks like - ""Men are foolish creatures"" and ""Women has a way of complicating things"". Bad, bad, bad.<br/><br/>If you ever were to watch the movie, let it be for the art direction, epic war scenes, beautiful costumes and props. Other than that and you will be sadly disappointed. Unless that is if you love a good trashy novel."
"lsymms","Null","0","1","24 May 2004"," Truely dissapointing
","This movie didn't sit right with me at all.  The screenplay was abysmal and the casting was strange.  Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus was the best example of this.  His role was one of a younger, less experienced cousin to Achilles.  I don't mind the inconsistencies with the Illiad.  I was bothered by the fact that he was obviously old enough to take care of himself, probably in his early 20s.  <br/><br/>**SPOILER** <br/><br/>There's a scene in the movie where he disguises himself like Achilles and leads the Greeks into battle only to die at the hands of Hector.  Hector realizes this is not Achilles and so in turn decides to call the battle off. A few shrugged shoulders and everyone walks away.  Now if Patroclus was say a lanky 14 year old boy that would have made at least some sense, but they were in the middle of a fierce battle (that the Trojans were winning) and it seems unbelievable that Hector could even command his thousands of troops to stop fighting and walk home at that point.  In the book, Achilles sends Patroclus out to fight in his stead, but told him not to chase if the Trojans retreated.  The Trojans did end up retreating and Patroclus pursued them.  Apollo struck down Patroclus, knocking his helmet and armor off. Hector laid the final blow and dragged Patroclus' body around after cutting off his arms (this is why Achilles did the same with Hector's body).<br/><br/>Another thing that really bothered me was how one-sided the movie was.  The Trojans were depicted as the innocent defenders of a grand city and the Greeks were depicted as blood thirsty brutes who were trying to take over the world.<br/><br/>The dialog was weak at best.  I count that up to writing, directing and casting.  Orlando Bloom came off way too stiff, but it seemed like everyone was stiff.  If I find myself criticizing a movie during the movie there's something seriously wrong and about 20 minutes into this I kept thinking, `what the hell was Wolfgang thinking?'  I think they figured they didn't have to write a good screenplay, since they were adapting one of the greatest stories ever told.  So they threw out the influence of the Gods (which would have been pretty spectacular with today's CG); they threw out the drama; they threw out the feeling of the book and were left with the shell of a movie that they never really filled."
"JAKastner","3","0","3","19 May 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of Troy
","When go to your local book store or library, what do you see? There's the Da Vinci Code, the latest Harry Potter book, quite possibly the latest thriller from Stephen King, and of course the latest crap-trap bashing the Bush administration (How many more of these damn things can there be? Hasn't it all been said by now? Or are some holding out for more money?). But what you won't see out in the front, or even in reasonable view, are the ancient myths, from both the Greek and the Roman eras. These stories, which were passed down from generation to the next by word of mouth alone for centuries, showcases the greatest heroes, the greatest villains, and the most enduring lessons man has encompassed into his society. Whether you heard these as a young boy from your parents or studying them in grade school (or in the case of public schools, even high school), these were the tales to live up to, to base moral values on, and to heed the examples of men and women who may not have even existed but were told in these stories to serve the benefit of future generations. Anyone can pick up the latest `hot book of the week' but few can say that these will last forever. The true legends, the greatest legends . only they will stand the test of time.<br/><br/>The story focuses more on the historical events that took place at the Siege of Troy rather then the mythological aspects, for which the tale is best known by and has been known by for generations. After numerous confrontations and mounting dead, King Agamemnon appears to have his goal of uniting all of Greece under one ruler at hand but there is danger afoot. Helen, wife of King Menelaus of Sparta and brother to King Agamemnon, has been secretly having an affair with Paris, prince of Troy, who has arrived in Sparta along with his brother Hector as ambassadors of peace who seek to unite Greece and squelch the years of fighting. In one fell swoop those hopes are dashed to pieces when Paris sneaks Helen aboard his ship heading back to Troy, thus enraging both Menelaus and Agamemnon to declare on Troy when they refuse to return her. But in order to defeat the Trojans, the Greeks will need the greatest warrior, Achilles, who is stubborn, arrogant, and refuses to bow to any king or ruler and the demands they impose on him. He goes forth into battle only at the expense of achieving ultimate glory, or immortality, amongst the people of the known world. Each individual has his own reason for involving himself in this war but what started as a war of love now stands as a war for honor, pride and the devotion to one's own country and everything its entails. The story for Troy is an absolute disgrace to the legend it claims to be based on. If you go into this film with knowledge of the legend of Troy, one must wonder what they were basing this film on as they manage to miss out on the key aspect of the legend. That key aspect of the story is the mythology (the gods, the magic, the fantasy) that is involved and by taking away that the filmmakers miss out on the whole message that the myth invokes and any credibility that try to sustain by the end.<br/><br/>Wolfgang Petersen, director of the film, manages to put together a stellar group of cast members who, more often then not, succeed in presenting entertaining performances in the roles they were assigned but even they can not stop this film from being a near-complete train wreck. There couldn't be a second thought on who to start off with other then the widely promoted Brad Pitt in the role of Achilles, one of the most legendary figures known in mythology. Unfortunately the character in the film is an absolute abomination compared to the legendary warrior that many of us grew up listening about. How could the filmmakers dare even think about taking the greatest warrior of all time (whether he was real or not) and turning him, by the end of the film, into the ultimate pansy? Leave it to a pacifist woman to do that to a man! Who might this be?  Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, cousin to Paris and Hector and vestal virgin given to Achilles as a gift. The character is a total insult to women. She clearly stands against the concept of war, though she never clearly advocates her stance and only gives occasional naïve statements on war, and manages to change Achilles' view on warfare simply by bedding him a few times and manipulating his mind through sensual sex. How insulting! Diana Krueger, who takes on the role of the beautiful Helen of Troy, seems like a waste as she is given little to do outside of being eye candy and acting helpless. There is no emotional depth to the character and the reasons given for her fleeing with Paris are barely even touched on, which demeans from any point the filmmakers could be going for on that angle. And how can anyone have respect for the characters of Paris and Hector, played by Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana, who are played out as cowards and insults to the true warriors, who are for the most part killed off relatively early in the war. Audience members will be clamoring for their deaths after seeing Paris hide behind Hector in his battle with Menelaus, who is practically stabbed in the back by Hector in what is suppose to be a one-on-one fight to the death.<br/><br/>Overall . Be forewarned! Those going into Troy looking for a heedfully based and historically tweaked adaptation of the myth are well advised to avert their eyes from this horrendous gorgon. Director Wolfgang Petersen takes the concept of creative liberties and stretches far beyond the reasonable point for any adaptation and in the process severely damages the legend of Troy in the minds of the latest generation of movie-goers, who will go off spreading the inaccurate portrayal to future generations should the film be deemed a success at the box office. The film is just an absolute disgrace and those who have grown well-accustomed to both Greek and Roman mythology should do themselves a favor by avoiding this near monstrosity at all costs, namely in their wallet. There can be no greater insult to mythologists then turning the greatest warrior the world has ever known into the superlative pansy. Even when one looks past that fact, there isn't much more to the film to salvage any respect for the mad scientists behind this hideous creation. The dialogue is overly clichéd and dull, the immense use of CGI effects becoming increasingly embarrassing and more obvious as the film goes on, and the numerous all-to-close naked shots of Brad Pitt become increasingly annoying, more so for the males then the females of course. Without the whole mythology aspect to it, Paris' capturing of `Helen's heart' looks like a booty call gone out of control and only confuses the audience in their attempt interpret what should be taken from this film. If Van Helsing and Troy are any indication of what is to come this summer, this is set to be the worst summer on record at the box office in a long time.<br/><br/>My Rating: * ½ out of 5 (Grade: D-)"

","First of all, i didn't enjoy this movie. We don't get very much background information on the characters making them all pretty shallow without specific knowledge of the Iliad, and the changes to the original are close to ridiculous (Achilles heel is not mentioned, no gods involved in the war, plus the war only lasts a couple of weeks). It really is true that this movie was merely ""inspired by"" Homer's poem but that still does not give it any substance. The attractions between the characters are never really explained (Paris and Helena? Achilles and the priest? why??), which doesn't help the poor character development either. Overall the fight scenes are well choreographed, the film has great visual effects but it's not worth seeing in a movie theater, you'll just be bored..."

","Achilles / Brad Pitt: I would be tempted to agree with the reviewer who called him a graduate of the ""Joey Tribbiani school of acting"", however I know that he can do much better than this. I can therefore only explain it by Petersen's poor directing. (too many close up shots of Achilles looking far far away, looking angry, looking proud,...) To many shots of Achilles' curvy rear end as he wakes up. Yes he is gorgeous but for God's sake this is a historical film not a Pirelli calendar.<br/><br/>Hector /Eric Bana: The reason I went to see the film. Great performance. Can't wait to see what he can do his next films. Here's another teenage fantasy: Muscular bare-chested man holding a baby in his arms: Wolfgang you have to work on that cliche problem of yours!<br/><br/>Paris/ Orlando Bloom: His wimp of a character won't do any good to his fan club.<br/><br/>Priam/ Peter O'Toole: Should get an Oscar nod for his heartbreaking performance.<br/><br/>Helen/ Diane Kruger: Her acting is fine but her beauty lacks the distinction that would have launched a 1000 ships. Saffron Burrows/Andromache has got it, but needs to find another way to portray distress. Fishmouth with chin twitching is not a good idea.<br/><br/>Odysseus/Sean Bean: Excellent as always.<br/><br/>Achilles' mother/ Julie Christie: Only a cameo, but captivating.<br/><br/>I had a problem with the film's structure: The film shows us the arrogant and greedy Greeks as being the heroes therefore the spectator should identify with them, however unlikeable they may be. On the other side you have the Trojans, who are good and fair but who unfortunately are the enemy. You end up disassociating with the story for lack of identification logic. If not likeable, Achilles' character should have been made more attractive, interesting. He's just shown as an arrogant maverick Californian surfer with no apparent reason for being the a-hole he is. It is all too long (but pretty empty), too shiny and even though I have nothing specific to bring to attention (the dialogues and the delivery?), it all felt like a big anachronism. We are left with a chick flick for guys, good enough for straight to video."

","No one seems to like Orlando Bloom in the role of Paris beyond his alluring looks.  I think if the reason for his love of Helen were explained, he would have had more to work with and developed the part more.  Maybe a mention or two of the goddess that gave him three choices would have been a start. Oddly, the fact that in general the fight scenes were shot too close up and therefore were a little less frightening worked in Orlando's favor in comparison to the more direct way his battle with Helen's husband was shot. I think he conveyed his fear and the way the battle and his opponent were presented made the audience understand certainly by the time he crawled toward the camera.  Perhaps some would distain his fear and crawling toward his brother, the heroic Hector.  But, I really felt for Paris.  It is bothering me two days later like no other scene!  It's the script's fault that no Trojan reaction to his turning tail was shown.  When he joined them behind the doorway toward the end, the Trojan soldiers seemed to be indifferent to him.  Why didn't they express their distain, if any, for his cowardice?  Then, later, they could have expressed admiration for his ability with bow and arrow.  At the end, his shooting the arrows into Achilles, who had killed his brother, would have had more redemptive power."

Totally devoid of character buildup or even a half decent plot (which you would think is easy with a story told a thousand times), this movie needs someone who knows how to write.  The editing and soundtrack are ok as is the cinematography.  But the lack of substance short of a love story with mucho violence is what makes this movie something to put a warning label on at the local rental place.  Do not watch if you are allergic to corn.

"artetiegr","5","0","1","18 May 2004"," Convoluted, but Nonetheless Entertaining
","Troy, more aptly described as 'The Legend of Achilles' is an epic, action-packed film depicting the Trojan War (duh) and the Fall of Troy (since one couldn't get this from the title). Amidst the tanned, shirtless beauties (Bloom, Pitt, Bana), the lovely, extra-squwishy sound effects, the booming, patriotic music and the exquisitely volatile characters, the movie proves to be anything but drab. However, this can be either good or bad upon interpretation.<br/><br/>On an acting level, Troy holds its own; Brad Pitt as Achilles accurately plays an unsympathetic character quite literally born to kill, just as Orlando Bloom plays an immature, rash and otherwise pathetic (I'm not biased...) Paris to teeth-griding, fist-shaking degree. Eric Bana as Hector was moving in his honor and passion --character motivations were, for the most part, clear and aptly described. And while some of the roles (Helen) were complex-speech-impaired, I remained completely consumed, intensely involved and otherwise entertained for the whole of the movie.<br/><br/>So why aren't I rejoicing in the magic that is Hollywood's interpretation of Homer's epic? Simple. The film had too much conflicting emotion. The overall feeling of sympathy was pitted towards Troy in the first fifteen minutes, by depicting a) the Greek ruler Agamemenon (argh) as a heartless, sarcastic and overbearing King, b) casting good-looking boys like Bloom and Bana as Troy's leading men and c) putting just enough emphasis on Hector to make one feel much, much more sympathetic for him more than Achilles will ever muster. It was certainly disheartening for me to sit through the film's entirety waiting for my favorite characters to die.<br/><br/>But the conflict does not end there; certainly, while Achilles may be likable in his brutish, sullenly compassionate nature, I never got enough emotion from him (though this did not seem to be any fault of Pitt's). Indeed, he had just shifted from an almost entirely static character to showing some depth right before he (psuedo-spoiler) died. I question why, if Achilles is the hero (or anti-hero) and most certainly the main character, did the director gather such a sympathy for Troy which Achilles ultimately had a hand in destroying? The world will never know.<br/><br/>However, despite the obvious conflicts with the original tale (ten years into two weeks was a dramatic, but effective, theatrical choice), the somewhat convoluted emotional volleyball and the death of any and all characters worth living save one, the movie did please me in its intensity, drama and stark, but sweet, romance, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. Not too bloody, not too sappy and certainly not too shabby, Troy was exactly what I expected it to be, no more and no less, stocked with thoughtful characters in an enticing look at Ancient Greece. And hey, if the story doesn't lead you in, the cast list definitely will."
"jogagirl","5","0","1","18 May 2004"," Good Idea executed Badly
","I have been looking at the trailer for Troy for quite some time now: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, you can't go wrong right?<br/><br/>Wrong.<br/><br/>This movie should have had the same emotional resonance as Gladiator. Instead, we get the cheesy, over-acted, bad TV-movie quality that seems to haunt so many films of today. Wolfgang Petersen, director of such movies as Outbreak, In the Line of Fire, and The Perfect Storm should have been able to pull off the feat of steering this movie on the proper course. Unfortunately, he could not seem to do so, with bad pan-away shots, poor scene blocking, a bad soundtrack, and lag-time lines. <br/><br/>All the actors did a great job, with the exceptions of Diane Kruger (Helen) and Brian Cox(Agamemnon). Brian Cox is a brilliant actor, but he over-acted for this film. Diane Kruger, while beautiful as Helen, lacked the ability to well, act. Orlando Bloom seemed somewhat lost as Paris, but that is not his fault as his character was not written very well. Eric Bana, Brad Pitt, Saffron Burrows, and Rose Byrne all turned in star performances in their respective roles.<br/><br/>However, the script seemed to be written by a drunken frat boy still on a bender with too much lag time in the lines. For the most part, all the actors did well, it is not their fault that the script was bad and that the director was out to lunch.<br/><br/>Jerry Bruckheimer should have produced this film and paid Ridley Scott a little something extra to direct it. As a film-goer, I should have felt tears and sorrow during the funeral pyre scenes, instead, I felt disappointment because the shots were to small. The camera should have been lifted overhead and far so that I could see all the pyres burning at once. Also, during the ""Braveheart"" speech Brad Pitt gives to his fellow warriors as Achilles, I should have been roused to the challenge of the fight, not felt like a spectator at a really boring baseball game. And the scene where Achilles goes to challenge Hector was like watching a man call for his lost dog (""Hector, here Hector! Hector? Hector are you there?""). It seems as if all the money that should have been spent on the script was given to Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Now I will say this, there is some Major Eye Candy in this movie. Eric Bana built up as Hector was hot, as well as Brad Pitt, who for all intensive purposes, presented the Best Body Possible for this film. Orlando Bloom was equally hot as Paris, but there should have been a steamy, steamy love scene between him and Diane Kruger. If this is the face and the affair that launched a thousand ships, we should have seen the action that started it all. Last but not least, the editing was awful, they could have shaved about 30 minutes or more of lag time and filled, with well, something good.<br/><br/>All in all, I would buy Troy on DVD simply for the eye candy and nothing more.<br/><br/>One last bite: To all you classicists out there who are ragging people who have not read the Iliad and therefore cannot criticize this film, get over yourself. I have studied and graduated from a liberal arts college, I've read my fair share of the classics too thank you very much."
"conan4742","6","0","1","18 May 2004"," forgettable
","I wouldn't expect much more from a summer movie. Troy starts out at a stumble, with bad dialect and clunky acting as it tries to move towards the battle scenes. In the first forty-five minutes, everyone seems to be in an off-day as far as acting goes. Sean Bean alone seems to know what he's doing, but perhaps that's because he had relatively short screen time at the start.<br/><br/>Things did get better as the movie went on, although it suffered from some odd directing choices (such as the slow zoom in on Priam as he sits on his throne; this shot ruined the intense feeling and came off as laughable) and a thoroughly bad soundtrack that sounds like it was done on a keyboard. Brad Pitt does alright as the edited Achilles, who is more redeemable to modern audiences than his childish and prideful predecessor (although his line about immortality upon landing on the beaches was difficult to swallow); Orlando Bloom doesn't have to do much more than stand around looking pretty and worried; Eric Bana is by far the most honorable and sympathetic of anyone in the movie, and he pulls it off admirably; Peter O'Toole does well even though he gets his fair share of bad lines; and Brian Cox does some serious scenery chewing here. He's more of a Disney villain than anything. But still there would be some difficult dialect that would make the audience either smirk or cringe. <br/><br/>Overall, the action scenes were the best part of the movie, especially the huge throwdown between Achilles and Hector, which was intense and well done.<br/><br/>I don't agree much with how they've mishandled the story, however, and tried to base it on the historical version of Troy (which no one knows). The removal of the gods I can understand, actually, since the characters themselves are interesting enough, but it's the misuse of the characters that gets to me. Numerous people, such as Ajax, Menelaus, Paris, and Priam either don't die when they should, or die when they shouldn't, and all for the wrong reasons. Achilles comes off as too sympathetic for my liking; even though he is supposed to be the image of valor and nobility, these traits don't overcome his childish, impetuous pride, which results in the deaths of thousands of troops. <br/><br/>But since this is just a mediocre movie, I'm alright with it. By next summer, no one will remember much about it, or care to. The characters will live on, as the movie predicts, but the movie itself will not."
"philjay","Null","0","1","18 May 2004"," Stupidity is as stupidity does - and this movie is STOOOOPID!
","I went to see this flick, against my better judgment, on the basis of a Chicago Tribune review. Even as a 50s-style epic this film was a disappointment.<br/><br/>Its claim to be based on Homer's ""Iliad"" is outrageous. Except for the names of the characters and places plus a few brief scenes lifted from the great epic poem, it was nothing like its supposed source. The violations of the classic story line are very many. One of the biggest is that the Trojan War was ten years long, not less than a month as in the movie. The gods, especially Apollo and Athena, who are major and essential characters in Homer, are entirely absent here. Helen went back to Sparta with Menelaus and they lived for several years after the war. Achilles' mother, far from urging her son to go to war, tried to hide him when Agamemnon's people came to get him. Agamemnon was not killed by Briseis but by his wife, Clytemnestra, on his return home as revenge for sacrificing their daughter Iphigenia to Poseidon in return for a safe sea voyage to Troy. The actual numbers of Greeks and Trojans involved in the war was probably in the hundreds, not in the tens of thousands depicted here. Anyone who has actually read the Iliad can see many, many more violations of that classic's story and themes.<br/><br/>Suppose we say, ""it's Hollywood and just entertainment, so don't be so pedantic!"" I would answer that the acting is leaden (except where it was outright hammy - shame on you Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox!), the screenplay is lame, the characters are one-dimensional, the action scenes go on far too long (at the expense of the story), the cinematography is nothing special, and the special effects (digitalized ships, soldiers, and cities) looked phony. ""Troy"" has been compared to ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur"" but it is more like Steve Reeves in ""Hercules."" The one thing that could have saved ""Troy"" would have been a tongue-in-cheek attitude, but it was in deadly earnest from first frame to last.<br/><br/>I suppose those who are into masculine physicality (as a source of power or sexual fantasy perhaps) can enjoy it. People with very low standards for plot and character but who love lots of action (and I do love the kind of action movies that don't take themselves too seriously) will enjoy this film. I stayed to the end, even though I knew ""Troy"" is a travesty ten minutes in, because it was like watching a train wreck. I wanted to see how bad it was really going to be. In that it exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>For those who would like to see an epic film with a strong story line, interesting characters, and impressive camera work I recommend ""Spartacus,"" (USA) ""The Emperor and the Assassin,"" (China) ""Alexander Nevsky"" (Russia) and ""Ran."" (Japan) For a much more exciting, heroic, and interesting epic story I recommend reading ""The Iliad."" There are several prose translations for those who would be put off by poetry."

","This is a sterling effort at the epic genre by legendary 'Never Ending Story' helmer, Wolfgang Peterson.

THere were some greeks next to me in the cinema and they all seemed perfectly happy to gasp and whoop in all the right places.<br/><br/>There is a camp-factor about it all, with the guys getting their bums out all of the time and a particularly homo-erotic sparring session between Achilles (a brilliant, on form Pitt) and his cousin where they giggle like little girls, fighting with a veritable 'Ohh, smack my bum and I'll hit yours harder' attitude. <br/><br/>That's before Bean shows up to break it up and talk some man-sense! He's great and steals the show as usual. Eric Bana is so much harder than Achilles - he's a natural warrior, whereas Achilles is a gods-blessed cheat - and their final battle was one of the most excruciatingly tense one-on-ones I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Lovely music that sounds like a combination of Gladiator and Titanic. An absolutely essential blockbuster for 2004. 7.5/10<br/><br/>WARNING: This film is completely ruined at the climax when 'Eastender's Ashley Cotton appears for a cameo.

","This time Wolfgang Petersen decided to touch a Greek mythology, the famous one from the poet Homer. This material has an excellent color, camera and fantastic special effects, really competing with the trilogy of ""Lord of the Ring"". It also has good acting, particularly from the experienced Peter O'Toole, who played the role of king Priam, and Eric Bana as Hector (Priam's son). Brad Pitt (Achilles) was OK but not at the same level of these two actors who may compete well for OSCAR nominations as the best supporting actor. <br/><br/>Historically the plot of the film is not the original one. Patroclus is shown as Achilles cousin when in fact he was an Achilles good friend. Achilles knew that Patroclus wanted to fight and he gave him all his weapons to fight. In the film it is shown that Patroclus went to fight without the consent of Achilles. <br/><br/>The film is shown only with real human heroes but no gods from the ancient Greece took part in it. The Iliad of Homer has a mixed of human beings and gods interacting all the way. <br/><br/>The end of Paris is not shown, he rightly killed Achilles with just one arrow and not four as shown in the film, but later Paris was killed by one of the gods. <br/><br/>Achilles was an excellent and invincible fighter but not so cruel as shown in the film. He always had huge differences with Agamemnon, and this was well reflected by the film. <br/><br/>Little was shown regarding the love between Paris and Helen.<br/><br/>
Although all these aspects well not well shown in the film, I consider that it is in general a good material, which may encourage young people to read more about the Iliad. Let also hope that the director, Petersen, is decided to make a new film about the Odyssey."

Because, the place (Gelibolu, Canakkale, Turkey) where the war has been regarding to Homeros and shown in the beginning of the movie, is in the west side of Anatolia. Therefore, the sun never rises up from the sea in there. But we watched lots of times the sunrise from the sea in the movie. Is this a minor or huge mistake for this kind of a movie? I think, this is minor and also the sunrise scenery was beautiful in the movie but the historical movies should produce in the right place as soon as possible. Am I wrong?"

","Spoilers<br/><br/>Having been intimately familiar with the legends this was based off of, it's not unfair to say that I was a very biased audience. And even having seen it, I really think that it blew its potential. The discrepencies between the myth and this movie were needless, and didn't add to the plot. To me, it seemed as though Petersen was cutting corners to make a story that was easier to translate into film, fulfilling tropes and archetypes rather than take some initiative and tell it the way it could have been told. The deaths of Menelaus and Agamemnon in particular seemed to be thrown in just to give the audience some moral satisfaction, that they got what was coming to them. Meanwhile, in the myth, Helen goes back with Menelaus, and Agamemnon takes Priam's youngest daughter as a concubine and returns home (to be murdered by his vexed wife, but that's entirely another story).<br/><br/>At the end, I felt like this movie should have been bigger than it was. Just in depth and production, this didn't seem like it was that big a deal. It was just another movie. The script was choppy and hammy, and everything seemed rushed to make a war that was supposed to last twenty years into a movie that lasted a little over two hours. The complete exclusion of anything supernatural also hurt this film, I believe. And if they keep that philosophy for the might-happen sequel of the Oddessey, I don't think it will be even remotely recognizable. <br/><br/>But even if I set aside the knowledge I had going into this film, I don't think it was that good. With the exception of Eric Bana, Rose Bryne, Saffron Burrows (I know, I was surprised too) and Brendon Gleeson, everyone just seemed to be trying too hard and not pulling it off. The action sequences weren't exactly innovative, and I think should've been considerably more graphic. I mean, all the characters are going on about how horrible the war is, but then we get this toned-down version of Gladiator to support that? Doesn't really add up for me, anyway."

","**Possible spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>I have personally not read The Illiad by Homer, so I can only judge the movie Troy based on its own merits, and quite frankly as a movie Troy has presented the viewer with magnificent battles of sword swinging and blood splattering, but has few things beyond that.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays the hero Achilles in the movie, but Pitt himself does not seem very comfortable in the role.  He often appears to be forcing out the dialogue, and because of that Achilles talks in a stilted manner through much of the movie (although that is not to say that Pitt didn't try).  It could be that the director intended to depict Achilles in that fashion, but in any case I would have expected him to show a little more emotion when he's not fighting someone.  As for the characters of Paris (played by Orlando Bloom) and Helen (played by Diane Kruger), my main problem with their characters is that we are introduced directly with the fact that they ARE in love, but are not shown HOW and WHY they are in love.  Perhaps this was due to time constraints, but if we were shown more background into their relationship, perhaps we could see why they would choose to stay together, rather than them just saying they won't leave each other.<br/><br/>The movie is not all bad though, and it can be quite good at times.  The visuals in this movie are top notch.  From the costumes of the Greeks and Trojans, to the set design of the city of Troy, the (previously mentioned) battle sequences with thousands of soldiers fighting it out, and the well choreographed one-on-one fight sequences, you can tell that the makers of the movie spent a lot of time into making Troy look good.  Also, Eric Bana gives a good performance in Troy, showing quite convincingly how much he cares for his family, his brother Paris, and the fate of the Trojans.<br/><br/>In the end, I thought Troy was a pretty good movie, but not a great movie. The fact is though other movies have shown that you can have both great battle sequences and character depth (e.g. The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Braveheart, Gladiator), and I only wish Troy could have done the same.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7/10."

","(Some Spoilers) Troy is just another classic Summer Hollywood epic that does not live up to the great story that it is based on.  I have read the Iliad and think it is a fantastic story that is really timeless, but this movie does nothing to honor its timelessness.  Maybe i should not have expected it too, as most if not all movies fall short of the books they are transcribed from.  Some characters that were killed in the movie were never killed in the book. Complex relationships that were explored in the novel were completely disregarded or painted in such an arbitrary black and white way that it left the characters bland and almost robotic in their actions/sayings.  Agamemnon v. Achilles (black and white, Good v. Bad)the multi-layered relationship that was the lynchpin of interactions in the novel was represented in such an artificial Hollywood way.  Menelaus and Helen(who in the story actually get back together and live on for eternity) I know  i should not expect every possible detail to be expressed in detail, but they could have at least been a little truer to the story and not killed off essential characters that did not perish in the book.  (Ajax, Agmemeon, Menelaus all lived on in the story)  The only character i was impressed with was Priam (Peter O'Toole).  The proud caring patriarch of the Trojans was played perfectly by O'Toole and portrayed exactly like the character in the novel. It really does not take many lines of dialogue to correctly style a characters personality, unfortunately the people who made this movie felt that over-complex characterizations would lose their core audience.  Just Hollywood underestimating its consumers once again.  Finally the fight scenes were actually very good.  Some of the best and most epic that i have ever seen on the silver-screen, and future epic battle scenes will be compared to this.  Maybe i just went into this movie expecting too much, but if your going to make a 2 hour 45 minute movie, you should at least make the characters a bit more multi-dimensional (besides Achilles) and extend it another 15 minutes if need be."

There was enough large-scale fighting going on to impress you with the effects, and enough one-on-one to make it interesting.<br/><br/>Acting: Shall we spent a moment on Brad Pitt? Okay, so he basically has two facial expressions throughout the movie: brooding or p***ed. But when you take it in perspective, the script doesn't leave him a whole lot of room for anything else. I didn't think he was too terrible, considering. I did actually care about the characters, so I suppose that's worth something. Eric Bana really stood out as Hector, and Sean Bean made a great Odysseus even with his limited screen time. Orlando Bloom, well, he made a believable Paris, but something tells me that it was more due to typecasting than good acting.<br/><br/>Dialogue: Really, really dorky. I think this is definitely the weakest point of the movie, which I cannot understand considering the writers had a whole book full of inspiration from the father of Western literature sitting right in front of them.<br/><br/>Faithfulness to The Iliad: Not much. Don't go in expecting to see a film adaptation of The Iliad; you will be disappointed. It's definitely Hollywood-ized, and doesn't count on having a sequel. Some of the characters that show up in Homer's Odyssey are killed off in Troy; some that die in the Iliad survive in Troy. As it says at the end of the movie, it was ""Inspired by Homer's Iliad,"" and that's where the similarities end.

On the other hand, one can think Orlando Bloom's Paris is nothing but a dark haired Legolas.<br/><br/>Epic? OK, Troy has a couple of good battle scenes. But it remains a ""Hollywood costume drama in a love cum tragedy setting"" with the happiest end they were able to fix up.<br/><br/>What's next after Troy's fire?

People playing characters that came from no where and went no where i.e. Sean Bean's Odysseus. And a really lame love story. Unfortunately the hunk, muscles tactic didn't work, especially for an entire three hours. Also the hunk characters, except for Hector and some scenes with Achilles make you want all of the characters to just die and get it over with. <br/><br/>As a side note, it's obvious they intended for Brad to be the star.

","I just saw ""Troy"" the other day, and I really liked it. I remember, as I watched and then left the theater thinking about the differences between the Iliad/Odyssey and the film Troy; however, after reading all these poor reviews on the user comments index, it seems a lot is being forgotten. The Iliad is a GIANT EPIC poem, with a great many characters and a great many pages.  Trying to adapt that is not an easy task. Being a screenwriter myself, I can understand why the Gods were not involved in the picture. Because, that creates the opportunity to make a reasonably lenghted film. If Troy was a completely faithful picture, then it would have to be 2 films that are three and a half hours; and judging by the reviews here, there are a lot of people who can't even watch one film of 2 1/2 hours. Also, with so many characters, you've got to condense to make the film work. Plus, let us not forget that not every one who will go to see this film may have read the Illiad. So, while the Homer purists may be irritated by that fact, it's simply true that a large percentage of the audience are going to watch a movie and be told a pretty good story. And as far as the ""look"" of the film, I like what Petersen did. He took a traditionalist approach, instead of trying to WOW everyone with MTV-style cutting and shooting. He made a film that was approached in the style of the great epics of the 50s and 60s. And personally I appreciate that kind of nostalgic sensibility. Particularly in a time where eighteen year-olds who want everything on screen to be blown up in THX surround sound is the target audience, resulting in the highest percentage of bad movies ever. And Troy is, quite frankly, much better than most those other ""films""."
"Homeless-Dad","Null","0","1","21 May 2004"," Entertaining, but inaccurate (POTENTIAL SPOILERS)
","I just got home from seeing the movie Troy and i will admit it is entertaining, but being a big fan of The Iliad and The Odyssey, i will have to say it is inaccurate.  <br/><br/>Some of the major inaccuracies that i was rather upset with were the deaths of Agamemnon, and Menalaus.  In the actual story, Menalaus does not in fact die.  He finds Helen and takes her back to Sparta and she is once again the queen of Sparta.  However, in the movie Troy, Menalaus who fights Paris (correct) beats Paris (correct) and Paris crawls over to Hector and grabs his ""sturdy leg"" (correct), but then when Menalaus tries to deliver the finishing blow to Paris, Hector stabs him and then Menalaus dies.  When i saw that, i figured, ""Well, i guess he won't be in The Odyssey movie if they make one.""  That's not as big a deal as the other inaccuracy.  Agamemnon, who is for some reason portrayed rather barbarically in the movie, is killed by the cousin of Paris and Hector.  I think i like his death in The Odyssey a lot better with him coming home to his wife to find that she was cheating on him and planned his death.  Considering how he is portrayed in the movie, i thought it would've been a much more fitting end for him.<br/><br/>But my main concern is the length of the movie.  Yes, it was rather long, but storyline wise, it was much too short.  It appeared that the war only lasted 15 days when really it was supposed to last 10 years.  This makes me think that there will be no movie for The Odyssey (which is disappointing) because Agamemnon is dead so he can't tell Odysseus to be careful when he comes home to his wife, and there Odysseus being away for 20 years would not make much sense because he was only in Troy for 15 days in the movie. <br/><br/>
But this isn't about The Odyssey.  This review is about Troy, so let's get on with it.  I thought that the story was entertaining though inaccurate.  I thought Peter O'Toole was great as King Prium and I thought Brad Pitt did a good job with Achilles as well.  I also thought Eric Bana did much better than he did in HULK as Hector.  But aren't you getting rather annoyed with Orlando Bloom?  After Lord of the Rings, all he does is just play a foolish lover in every single movie he's been in.  And Legolas, Will Turner, and Paris are all pretty much the same character the way he portrays them. <br/><br/>
All in all, I would give the movie a 7/10 because it was a little bit too long, it was inaccurate (which was disappointing because I was interested in seeing what happens in the book), and it was kinda quiet during the fight scenes.  But it was entertaining and the acting was well done.  So there is the reasoning for my 7/10 rating."

I guess all I'm saying is, I greatly enjoyed this film. Yes, I admit, I did originally go for Orlando Bloom and there are those cheesy lines but to those who say that this was not a great movie are obviously off their rocker. They are entitled to their opinion but if anyone believes that the movie will be exactly like the tale, I suppose they should be ready to be disappointed.

","I like the Epic style (Gladiator, Braveheart) and felt that the grandeur of Troy is right up there. I find that until I've seen a movie a couple of times, little things go unnoticed, but for now it is pretty good. Orlando Bloom throws the dice against his Legolas/Will Turner image by playing a decidedly less courageous character. Eric Bana I must say, did an excellent job. I was worried after seeing the Hulk that he might not be that enjoyable to watch. He proved me wrong. It was kinda of neat to see Brendan Gleeson (Hammish, big sidekick in Braveheart) and the actor who played his father, James Cosmo on opposite sides! I felt they wasted Peter O'Toole by making him wide-eyed through the whole thing, and the Helen character just seems to be a waste. Sean Bean is good being a good-guy on the questionable side, and so was Achilles's right hand man (Nigel Terry?). There are enough Honorable Funeral Pyres in this movie to last a lifetime of movie watching. Are they Vikings? And then there's Achilles. Other people have said that this is just a fight movie, but Brad Pitt FILLS the movie with his role. He agonizes over the decisions he makes; ie how he is seen now, compared to how History will see him. You see hundreds of emotions all at once. The one-on-one fight with Hector (Bana), is just awesome. That is the action scene Troy will be remembered for, as Gladiator was for the dual-sword battle in Gladiator (lost head), multiple scenes in Braveheart (killing the magistrate, oiled battlefields) and the Darth Maul (Ray Park) battle scene at the end of Episode 1. Achilles vs Hector is like a dance, it's so fluid."
"turkeyjrky","Null","0","1","17 May 2004"," a humorously scathing review written by a friend
","TROY.<br/><br/>After seeing Troy last night I think that peoples' opinion of this movie will greatly reflect their political viewpoints. The film's themes are loosely organized and the message that it is trying to convey is ambiguous and indecisive. The central theme of the story involves fighting an unnecessary war in the name of glory, power, and state, as well so those who've died won't have died in vain (if this sounds familiar, it should). The redeeming moments tease anti-war messages and the importance of love, family, and honor, yet these sporadic instances are empty and ultimately short-lived. While supports of the war in Iraq will probably enjoy watching Achilles' character wreck havoc, any rational liberals in the audience will find their inner monologue repeating, ""Wait wtf?!""<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom successfully portrays Paris as a spineless little twat, while Brad Pitt's Achilles is nothing more than a confused, short tempered frat-boy with ninja moves and a nice ass. The only character that I found myself sympathizing with was Hector, who was rational and honorable yet knew that the situation would inevitably end badly.<br/><br/>While everyone will enjoy the intense fight between Achilles and Hector and the giant balls of napalm that the Trojans roll onto the Greek camps, this movie has little more to offer besides its man candy. Ignorant war mongers will most likely enjoy this film with its epic battle scenes and nonexistent justifications for war, and everyone else will enjoy snickering when ever Paris comes on the screen, makes some comment referring to love or hunting deer, or strikes a very Legolas-like pose.<br/><br/>For those who still plan on seeing it; be wary and don't expect much historical relevance (who knew Troy was a Byzantine-Egyptian style city that resembled the Cheesecake Factory and its inhabitants were apparently very fond of tie-dye?). For an epic that is based on a classic I was disappointed, mostly because I realize that many viewers will see this film and not recognize the gross injustice to the actual story.<br/><br/>My only hope is that ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""King Arthur"" will be able to quell my discontent and rekindle my faith in the film industry. Trebuchets and Keira Knightley will no doubt raise my spirits."
"zzdravkov","6","0","1","17 May 2004"," ""Inspired"" by Homer?
","To me W. Petersen has done a good job with a poor (very poor, indeed) screenplay. Benioff has a rather short screenplay resume and has failed completely this time. Anyone who has ever read a single chapter from either 'The Iliad' or 'The Odyssey' should feel disappointed.<br/><br/>The storyline and the characters are simply flat. The main original theme is fate and how it is in the human nature to defy it and make choices, whatever the outcome. Unfortunately 'Troy' does not come even near it. Every single character is so deep that a separate movie centered on him/ her could be made. Fundamental error is the omission that the war has actually gone on for ten years and Achilles has made his name already as the great and invincible warrior  in 'Troy' he fights only at the Trojan 'D-Day' and in a private fight against Hector and he just deserves to die in a battle, that is where the legends are made and the original points in this direction. Agamemnon is not the less tragic. He is not a mere ruthless politician-megalomaniac  he has made the ultimate sacrifice to come to Troy  killing his own daughter. Paris ( I loved the idea that he would be played by O. Bloom, but really pitied the man that brought us Legolass) has earned the LOVE of the most beautiful woman in the world (Miss Krueger has a beautiful face and gorgeous body but I must say it  she is cold, and is completely overshadowed by Saffron Burrows) and his tragedy is that she is married to another but they simply belong to each other. In no way he should be depicted as a self-indulging Casanova. And I could go on and on with almost every character in the script.<br/><br/>The only scene worthy of praise (void of the battle ones) is when Priam goes to Achilles plead for the dead body of his son, but O'Toole is just too big for a bad screenplay, isn't he?<br/><br/>In summary, Mr. Benioff if you ever go for another historic screenplay do your homework first and read the original (Homer would be read far longer then any of us) or just watch 'The History Channel' or even betterleave it to Peter Jackson."

Wait a minute, I said, didn't the Trojan War last ten years? The movie version of the greatest siege of the ancient world condenses the entire battle down to about two or three weeks - including the time taken to build the famous Horse. Other than this obvious conundrum (this would be the reason the credits say ""Inspired by The Iliad"" instead of ""Based on the Iliad""), this was a very good movie. An old-fashioned costume epic that's heavy on the spectacle without losing sight of the human element, it conjures up the massive undertakings of Cecil B. DeMille's historical epics.<br/><br/>Of course, it has a cast of 50,000 computer-generated Greeks, but it never feels fake, and gives us a plethora of heroes and villains on both sides of the war to root for and boo. Contrast this to the last two Lord of the Rings films, which are wonderful, but tend to descend into a mishmash of CGI whenever a battle starts and loses sight of its characters. No one's giving away any endings here, but honestly, unless you've lived in a soundproof box or Antarctica your entire life or never opened a book, you know what happens at the end.

That was one excellent piece of movie-making, and all praises go to Bana and Pitt who did it all by themselves, no stunt doubles.<br/><br/>Three - the Peter O'Toole moment. The only really touching and spot-on dramatic moment in the entire 163 minute movie - King Priam begging the arrogant warrior who had just killed his son and disrespected his body to give it back for a proper funeral. You gotta give the man who can utter such a sappy line as ""I loved my son from the moment he opened his eyes till the moment you closed them"" with such conviction and heartache all the credit he fully deserves.<br/><br/>Now, if only those three things were enough.

The dialogues are not period. It would probably be much better if Mr. Petersen had the actors speak in ancient Greek. The battle scenes lack the intensity of those in 'Braveheart' and 'Gladiator'. It is already an R-rated movie; I don't understand what was holding Mr. Petersen back.<br/><br/>In addition, although Mr. Pertersen mentioned to the press that he intended to put together a beautiful ensemble of cast, I believe that casting Orlando Bloom as Paris is a mistake. So is casting Diane Kruger as Helen. There is little chemistry between Orlando and Kruger. Bloom looks more like a valet in the movie. And, although Ms. Kruger is a very pretty person, she looks more like a fancy urban woman than the cause of the greatest war the world has ever seen. As for Brad Pitt, I found his performance lacking certain depth. In the scene where he, as Achilles, is standing outside of Troy calling Hector for a fight, he looks more like he is p***ed off than occupied with extreme anger. When he was wrapping up Hector's body for returning to Priam, king of Troy, he failed to convey a frustration stemmed from conflicting beliefs and to show that he is sadden and humbled by the ultimate devastation. I wish that his performance is as good as that in 'Legends of the Fall (1994).' However, I have to mention that the performance of Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole is generally good.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an OK film, but I believe it will probably soon be forgotten, despite its high budget and its cast."

","First off I am a big fan of the history of Ancient Greece so I am automatically bias towards this film. YES there are historical flaws here and there but so what? It's just a movie and a pretty damn good one at that. I remember reading a review on IMDb suggesting ""Troy"" wasn't long enough, well I couldn't disagree more... I felt they did a good job putting in the relevant information and story. The cast were all brilliant which surprised me but hey I seem to be surprised a lot these days!!! I can see a lot of people being disappointed with ""Troy"" don't ask me why though! But on the whole I loved it! And would urge anybody who likes epics to go and watch it on the big screen"

","Troy - */****<br/><br/>There will be quite a lot of disdain for this film, and most of it from scholars who have read and love Homer's epics. Once you view this film, you will clearly see why. Hollywood has, yet again, taken a classic (one could say the greatest classic) and mutilated the story to cater to the much more inept, action loving public. Several characters, Menelaus and Agamemnon in particular, have their stories so ridiculously altered, its as if the screenwriter, David Benioff, took a crash course in Greek Mythology and fell asleep during the Orestia.<br/><br/>But perhaps you don't care about historical inaccuracies. Even then, this film still fails to deliver. Like all visually dependent films, Troy is an arrogant and superficial movie, lacking character development and thematic scope. Petersen seems to be constantly showing off, as if he believes he is enlightening the audience with his ""amazing"" and ""educational"" movie.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality this film has are its visuals. The special effects and cinematography rival that of Lord of the Rings. Not to mention that every young girl will be drooling all over the lead cast. The acting is very poor (with or with out sex appeal), with exception to Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole, as plot and character development is slim to none. The film gives the impression that both the director and screenwriter ordered more than they could handle, and the actually decent actors were left with the bill.<br/><br/>The musical score is just as arrogant as the script. At times, James Horner sounds like he's trying to glorify the violence and brutality that is taking place, which is the opposite intention of Homer's Iliad. I began to think this film would have been 100 times better if there was no musical score. At least it would have seemed slightly more honest.<br/><br/>Troy may be a visual tour-de-force, but it is on par with such sentimental, and historically inaccurate movies as Pearl Harbor. Scholars and lovers of Homer's epics, be warned! If you like violent action, excitement, and fast-food-style screenwriting, Troy is your summer movie. But please, for Homer's sake, always keep in mind that this is NOT the Iliad.<br/><br/>One star out of four."

","As, no doubt, countless of reviewers and amused viewers picked up on, the script needs work. Wait, scrap that, the script needs lots of work.<br/><br/>The problem 'Troy' faces is not only that it's just not possible to cut Homer's enormous poem into a nigh-on 3 hour movie. The problems that 'Troy' faces are thus:<br/><br/>1.) Badly cast. Diane Kreuger, although pretty, is plain and vapid, and does not belong here. 2.) Brad Pitt is almost as empty, although he does shine in battle when he doesn't have to say anything.<br/><br/>3.) Complete lack of 'reality'. The sets, although large and budget-heavy, never convey the sense of a lived-in world like the epic 'Gladiator' did.<br/><br/>4.) Hackneyed script. It's actually so awful in parts I held my head in my hands and stifled my laughs.<br/><br/>5.) Orlando Bloom. I'm amazed his career has lasted as long as it has.<br/><br/>6.) Bad pacing. Over two hours and then Troy is razed in minutes.<br/><br/>7.) Inexplicably, Achilles is taken down by an arrow to his heel. Being that the movie strays away from the supernatural aspect of the 'original', there's no reason for this. They might as well stabbed Achilles in the head, so to speak.<br/><br/>8.) The music is overbearing and didn't fit in the slightest. In fact, were the music to have been replaced by something more 'fitting', some scenes would have been a lot more enjoyable.<br/><br/>9.) Miserable cinematography during the 'brawls' that took place outside Troy's walls. Absolutely impossible to make out who was who and what was what. 'Gladiator' did such scenes with far more panache.<br/><br/>As much as this rendition of war was poor, it did have some memorable scenes. The mano a mano fight scene, especially between Achilles and Hector (Eric Bana in perhaps the only decent role along with O'Toole) were startlingly realistic and brutal enough to have viewers clenching teeth. However, since such scenes were short and few, the bitter taste of the rest of the movie sours out those memories. <br/><br/>A shame."

","Perhaps I am at fault for expecting too much from Troy given the apparent budget,scale of the production and the quality of many of the actors involved.But I found that as with many movies before it the best bits are in the trailer and the film itself does not live up to what has been promised.<br/><br/>Where Troy succeeds and what makes it good is that it is visually stunning.A massive fleet of CGI ships sails across the Aegean and thousands of Greek soldiers disembark on the beach at Troy.Huge armies of extras and CGI's face each other and do battle in brilliantly worked out battle scenes. The camera sweeps across the cityscape of ancient Troy making it look spectacular and one feels sadness that this going to be destroyed by the end of the film.<br/><br/>The sets too are impressive,particularly the walls of Troy and the palace and temple square give a sense of the splendour of the Trojan civilisation.Also impressive was the costume design with thought going into the design and detail of both the ordinary citizens and the military outfits.<br/><br/>Where Troy fails is with it's plot and character development.The basic storyline is there but is rushed along in order to set the scene for the next action piece and as a result the film becomes disjointed.Adding to this disjointedness is the inclusion of too many subplots.As a result very little screen time and is given to each and the plots are never given the time to develop.The only one which really develops is the romance between Achilles and Briseis.It would have been good to see more time given to the Helen/Paris/Menelaus love triangle(after all this was the root cause of the Trojan war)and the political subterfuge of Agamemnon to give the plot more intrigue which would in turn have given the dissension between Achilles and Agamemnon a greater depth.<br/><br/>Liberties have also been taken with the Illiad itself.For instance the 10 year siege has been wittled down into a matter of weeks,Menelaus and Agamemnon were not killed during the war while Paris was and Achilles was killed by Paris before the destruction of Troy.Achilles death before the end of the war,Paris's death and Helen and Menelaus being reunited would have added greatly to the films depth.<br/><br/>Certain scenes also smack of being borrowed.For instance,Achilles soldiers being slaughtered by Trojan archers when they land on the beach rings a bell with the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan and the subsequent shield grouping is borrowed from Gladiator.The duel between Paris and Menelaus is reminiscent of David and Goliath in the Bible.<br/><br/>Like the plot characters serve only to move the film along to the next action sequence.Characters are given very little to do except look anguished and utter lines about love,duty,honour and respect for the gods.This is particularly true for the women.The only female character who is given any real depth is Briseis as she moves from disdain for Achilles to love for him and being torn between that love and her loyalty to Troy.<br/><br/>There are also too many main characters.LOTR managed to pull this off.Troy does not.There is no feeling of connection between many of the characters and in particular the relationship between Helen and Paris lacks chemistry.<br/><br/>There are moments where the actors are allowed to do their stuff.For instance when Peter O'Toole as Priam asks Achilles for the body of Hector(this is also one of two scenes where Brad Pitt acts well) and when he looks out from the palace balcony at the destruction of Troy,sadness etched in his face.<br/><br/>Overall ,Troy is worth seeing just because of the sheer spectacle of it all but don't expect too much otherwise.Overall rating 5/10."

","This is not the epic film that will be shown in schools across the land as Homer's Iliad. It will be cast into the scholarly mix for discussion and critiqued as a shallow 21st Century interpretation. One redeeming quality was that the romance of the Gods was removed and Agamemnon's thirst for Conquest was well portrayed. The strategic trade location of Troy was not however used as justification, a pity. This was an entertaining film loosely based on Homer's epic and no more true to the story than Kevin Reynolds' Count of Monte Cristo from 2002. This is not the story of the Trojan War, no more than Reynolds told Dumas' story. Ten years of fighting condensed into about 3 weeks doesn't do justice to Homer's wonderful story. I won't begin to list the many inaccuracies, considering Achilles appearance within the walls of Troy clearly means David Benioff was not charged with bringing Homer's story to the screen, but rather keeping Brad Pitt in the story as long as possible.<br/><br/>But to be fair, considering the running time of a little over 2.5 hours, the story was well delivered in the beginning and developed some characters very well (Achilles, Hector(Eric Bana was excellent), Paris, Agamemnon, and Menelaus). However as the film continued it seems to rapidly become a vehicle for Brad Pitt, who while wonderfully portraying Achilles, seems to have forgotten the story was not entirely his own. Sean Bean was admirable as Odysseus, but probably miscast and the character was far too little used.<br/><br/>In the end my hopes were dashed and I regretted shelling out my $7 for anything more than some decently choreographed fight scenes.<br/><br/>Considering how we've been spoiled by the Lord of the Rings, the bar has been set much higher when translating novels to the screen. Hollywood failed to deliver on perhaps the greatest story of all time and cranked out a glitzy, glammed package with Brad Pitt on the cover. While Pitt's performance was excellent, Wolfgang Petersen & David Benioff let him and us down. But at least they give Homer a writing credit, though it probably has him wishing he could cross the river Styx and bring Hades to Hollywood."

","In my opinion, I don't believe that it was the actors who did a terrible job, but the screenplay. The cheesy love monologues of Paris, the random leadership speeches of Achilles, and the boring arguments of Hector all but satisfied me during this film. I am surprised that I didn't like Peter O'Tooles acting performance. I guess I am still holding him up to the standards of Lawrence of Arabia, the greatest Epic of all time. Even the diaglogue of Helen didn't interest me much. As a fan of Brad Pitt's I couldn't help but clench my teeth at the lines he was spurting out. The fight scenes were gritty and awesome, reminding me of LOTR but there were far too little to override the long and dreary ""dramatic"" conflicts. The only actor who I believed was his role was Brian Cox. Actors should be able to fit their role so that when they are on screen they are the character and not themselves trying to be that character. Brian Cox did this beautifully.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe that it tried to be a great movie, it tried to be a great war epic, but the dialogue and the story progression were not there. I went into this movie thinking it was going to be one of the best films of the year, and left with only the thought that it was a cheesy action movie that could be compared to The Punisher. If you're a 14 year old girl who crushes over Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom I think you'll appreciate this film more than I did."

This film is NOT the Illiad; character's die who shouldn't, people live who should die, and not to mention the whole Trojan war is reduced to about two weeks long. The film itself is enjoyable, although it does feel a times that its trying to cash in on LOTR, particularly when you see Orlando Bloom with a bow in his hand, or Sean Bean with a sword. My over-riding feeling when I left this film is one that they tore a few pages from the Illiad, a few from the Aenied, a page or so from the Odyssey and then threw away the rest of the books. The film says its based on Homer's epic poem, perhaps Homer's estate has the right to sue. <br/><br/>If you haven't read the Illiad, go see this film, you'll love it, and then read the Illiad and appreciate how much better it good have been. If you have read the Illiad, go watch it anyway, it is a good film. The acting is (on the most part) good - I exclude Orlando Bloom from this who doesn't act until somebody puts a bow in his hand, typecast anyone? I only give it 5/10 because it shouldn't claim to be inspired by the Illiad, otherwise it would definitely be a 7 or an 8."

","I think it's sad that so many people worked so hard for so long on a movie that mangles one of Western Civilization's oldest and most-respected stories.<br/><br/>Some of the more glaring inaccuracies:<br/><br/>1) The 'Greek nation' was invented in the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Turk Empire (fought 1821 - 1829), NOT by Agamemnon as portrayed in the movie. The concept of a 'nation' as such didn't even exist until the Peace of Westphalia (1648). Homer doesn't even call the Greeks 'Greeks.' He calls them variously 'Danaans,' 'Argives' and 'Achaens.'<br/><br/>2) The Trojan War was a siege--it lasted 10 years, NOT 16 days as portrayed in the movie.<br/><br/>3) The Greek gods and goddesses were all very active in the Trojan War.<br/><br/>4) The Achaean Kings went to war with Troy because of a vow they had made, NOT because they were subject to Agamemnon. At the urging of Odysseus, all of Helen's suitors had sworn to protect her regardless of her choice of a husband. She went on to marry Menelaus.<br/><br/>5) Menelaus did not die on the second day of the war. During the sack of Troy, he slew Paris with his own hand. He and Helen returned to Sparta and lived happily ever after.<br/><br/>6) Briseis was from Lyrnessus. She was not a virgin--Achilles had slain her husband. Achilles captured her along with a girl named Chryseis, whom Achilles gave to Agamemnon. Agamemnon was eventually forced to give up Chryseis in order to end a plague that had been sent as a punishment by Apollo. Agamemnon demanded Briseis from Achilles as a replacement for Chryseis. Achilles responded by refusing to fight. After the death of Patroclus, Agamemnon returned Briseis to Achilles, along with an apology. Briseis remained with Achilles until his death.<br/><br/>7) Paris killed Achilles with a single arrow, well before the sack of Troy. After Achilles' death, Ajax and Odysseus competed for Achilles' fine golden armor. When the armor was awarded to Odysseus, Ajax swore to kill Agamemnon and Menelaus. To prevent this, Athena drove Ajax insane, and he killed himself instead.<br/><br/>8) Agamemnon was murdered by either his wife Clytamnestra or his cousin Aegisthus (with whom his wife was having an affair) after his triumphant return to Mycenae.<br/><br/>9) Aeneas was not a boy when Troy fell--he was a married man with an adolescent son, Ascanius.<br/><br/>No doubt a number of other flaws can be found as well. Shame on Troy for miseducating the movie-going public."

","Homer's ""Iliad"" is an epic poem that has been read for thousands of years; the mythology surrounding the Trojan War has existed even longer. Unfortunately, David Benioff, who penned the excellent 25th Hour, took it upon himself to rework the myth into an almost unrecognizable abomination. Of course it's difficult to keep a myth as complex as that of the Trojan War intact in a film; nobody could realistically expect Benioff to accomplish such a herculean task. But even the smallest details of the film betray the rich characters and plot lines at its heart, for example, Paris asks Aeneas' name when Aeneas would be known to all Trojans! It's as if Benioff cared just enough to pay slight homage to the myth; not enough to make those scenes accurate. Towards the end, the film just gets laughable. Romances are created where they shouldn't be, characters live longer than they should, and Benioff turns the resolution of the Trojan War on its head. If you enjoy Greek myth at all, stay away from this."

","Troy, 2004's biggest blockbuster (well, so far, anyway) is a swords and sandals epic based on Homer's The Illiad.  The Greek hero Achilles (Brad Pitt) is centre stage in story of the Trojan War, one of the largest ever fought.<br/><br/>Paris (Orlando Bloom), the second son of Priam (Peter O'Toole), King of Troy, has a certain way with the ladies (due to a previous encounter with Aphrodite), and falls in love with Helen, the wife of Menelaus, King of Sparta, a Greek city-state.  After stealing his newfound love back to Troy, the Greek armies all rally under King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who has been looking for an excuse to sack Troy for some time.  Achilles, who is the greatest fighter in the Greek empire, grudgingly follows Agamemnon, to fight for the Greek people, and to ensure his name lives on throughout the Ages.<br/><br/>The film runs for just over 160 minutes, and it's a good thing it does; It<br/><br/>took somewhere between 40 minutes and an hour to get over the cheesy acting and close-ups that are thrown at us.  From the opening dialogue (which seems to be a continuation of Maximus' ""echoes through eternity"" speech from Gladiator), we are given our first hint that this is no character driven drama - it's a swords and sandals Blockbuster!  When a character is upset, we will be advised as much courtesy of an extreme close-up involving a hammed-up grimace, so don't worry, you can leave your brain at the door.<br/><br/>Of course, this is not entirely a bad thing.  The ladies will certainly have something to keep them entertained - Brad Pitt has been working out even more than usual, and even Legolas' wiry frame has been beefed up to us with a lovely six pack.  The action is very well choreographed, and any computer-generated imagery is handled brilliantly, blending in with the action seamlessly.  The plot doesn't lag for more than a second, and did I mention. the swords and sandals?<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by the darkness of the film as well.  We see that the war could have been prevented on many occasions, but for greed and pride, and our hero's flaws are made public knowledge.  Achilles' himself is an egotistical hothead, who seems to almost enjoy exercising his power to kill people that cross him, while Paris is a cloudy headed romantic fool. Eric Bana turns in a great performance as the films good guy, Prince Hector, hero of the Trojan Army, and it was great to see fellow Aussie Rose Byrne playing Briseis (though I can't say I remember her from the adaptations I read as a child?), who holds her own in (and out of) the sack with Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>It was great to see all the Greek heroes on screen, including my old favorite Odysseus (Sean Bean), and though war didn't seem to last the 10 years it should have (it was more like a few weeks at most), this film makes for quite an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I had great expectations about this movie. With its great director, great cast and of course its story material The Iliad, I was excited and expected it to be spectacular. I liked it, but ""spectacular"" it wasn't. I won't judge Troy by its lack of loyalty to The Iliad. The fact that they've changed many aspects of the story and even some critical turning points of it is very unfortunate. However, I understand that this is a movie and it was the filmmakers' conscious decision to do so. I'm going to consider Troy a movie on its own for this review. First of all, even though this is an epic film with concepts such as love, honor and courage at its center, something feels missing. It seems to be a little rushed for some reason. But also it is obvious the filmmakers', the whole cast and the crew have put a lot of work in it, and there sure are times it shows.<br/><br/>The cast is considerably strong. Although Orlando Bloom as Paris and Diane Kruger as Helen have failed to impress me miserably, the cast is balanced with great performances by Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana, Brian Cox and the always wonderful Sean Bean. Not forgetting Brad Pitt of course in the lead role of Achilles who, in my opinion, is a very good actor and although has been a lot better than here in Troy, he does a fair job as well. Also kudos to Rose Byrne as Briseis who holds her own against Brad Pitt. Unfortunately, for me, Troy had many low points as well. I thought the editing wasn't very good and the movie definitely had big problems with the original score. The significance of an original score is most certainly crucial to any film, especially big, epic ones like Troy and unfortunately here, it is not inspired, it is weak and without impact. The fight scenes don't awe us or even surprise us, it feels like we've seen all of it in some form or another before.<br/><br/>However, this movie does have its moments and at its strongest in some of its quieter scenes. And at the end of the day, it still is an intriguing story about honor, courage, respect and love. I recommend Troy to anyone who holds these themes valuable and but not necessarily demanding to see a masterpiece. It's worth the admission and a fine way to spend an afternoon."

An ancient story brought back to life, enjoyable for everyone now and not just the freaks. Sure, there are a lot of familiar faces in this picture (braveheart, anyone?), but it wasn't disturbing. It's very hard to give all these ancient heroes the credits they deserve - or supposedly have owned through story telling - and I'm surprised how they pulled it off. It's a risk you take that if you plan on shooting a movie on Troy, you take Achilles as the main character. There's dozens of other people that could have been chosen, Odysseus being one of them. However, Achilles didn't disappoint. He would be our modern superhero, just with less nifty gadgets and more of a stubborn nature. Brad Pitt does well.<br/><br/>Putting ten years in but a few hour's span is nearly impossible to do, but Troy pulled it off. Sometimes the war seems to last only for three weeks, but seeing as we're not focussing on the trials and tribulations of the soldiers, but more on Achilles and his dealing with the whole situation, it's not troublesome at all. So what that they took the whole of Troy's beach in what seems only to be moments. Or that the whole foundation of Rome is concluded in but a single one-liner in the heat of battle? But let us not worry about that: it's wonderfully done.<br/><br/>The soundtrack sounds familiar...the ones who have seen Gladiator will notice the melancholic singing of a woman who seems to be in agony, when the soldiers are dying on the screen. Despite it's familiarity, it does fit.<br/><br/>I had been looking out for this movie for a long time, and I wasn't really disappointed at all at the end.

","Troy has gotten a lot of grief from critics. They say that it does not do Homer justice. But how can anything? And besides, the average movie goer has probably not even read Homer (myself included). There may have been that World History class you took way back when but that probably slipped most people's minds, too. Remember when the Lord of the Rings fans threw a fit because they said no one could adapt the books properly? Well, they shut up pretty fast. Now, this is no Lord of the Rings, but it is not a CGI fest that disappoints.<br/><br/>For the first half of Troy, there is more nudity than blood. The epic battles and all their blood shed do eventually show up but the nudity never really fades into the background. Actually, the nudity is more authentic than the blood. You would think a movie about ""the greatest war there ever was"" would invest in more than watered down food coloring. Especially because they do more than a couple close up shots of their battered soldiers.<br/><br/>The acting is much better than expected. All the actors do a good job with the genre they are a part of. Peter O'Tool is the scene stealer. He gives an excellent performance that should be remembered come Oscar season. Eric Bana quickly sheds The Hulk (thank god) and gives possibly the best performance of his career. Orlando Bloom shows that he is growing up with his roles. He does not play the strong, emotionally put together hero, but the pretty boy who struggles with the knowledge that he is just that and nothing more. Another best of their career performance. Brad Pitt is good to look at but falls in the shadows of his fellow cast mates. This is not all his fault though. He is given the most physical of all the roles and he does this well. Though he does have a character arc, it is not as visible as Bloom's. Sean Bean, another LOTR veteran, takes on the role of Odysseus. He does the part solidly and is not at all Bormoir.<br/><br/>If this is a preview of what the summer is to be then I can't wait. Troy has raised the bar above the crap that studios got away with last summer. It is worth the time and the money. ***/****"
"ilovelordoftherings","Null","0","1","15 May 2004"," when they say loosely based on the illiad,.....
","Having watched troy for the first time today, i have to say that it was not what i expected. Firstly, it was rather cheesy in places (rather sometimes was an understatement). The script was not the best written, not only in dialouge, but because the story was so loosly based on the illiad that it only bore token resemblences. Two characters that should not have died did, Paris died in the poem, and Accilies was actually gay (and it was not his cousin that was killed that he was so upset about(cause it wasnt supposed to be his cousin), but they couldnt include that without saying that he was gay). The acting had good and bad bits, brad pitt was great as accillies, and his performance was worth the watch purely for his body, also eric bana was brilliant as hector, it was truly worth watching, however, even though in my opinion he has been great in other things (and i was a huge fan until today) Orlando Bloom's acting was at some points difficult to watch. this was not helped by incredibly cheesy diolouge, and a reeealy wimpy, rather annoying character. This was one of the most dissapointing parts of the film. The only saving grace was again, the half-naked view of his body at the beginning. O'toole was good, but he achieved pure brilliance in the scene were he goes to talk to accilies, and sean bean was perfectly cast in his part. Most of the other performances were forgettable (so much so that i have forgotten them). The cinematography could have used some more work, and the scrit needed basically re-writing, and maybe some roles needed recasting (OB's especially, he may have been good as something else, but....) This film was a great story, with a brilliant set of actors, however, the scripting and directing were awful. I applaude the costume department tho. (oooh those little skirty things that flapped around). Overall i give the film about a 6/10, however this was only brought up by the veiws of OB half naked, and Brad Pitt so close to it that there was only about 6"" of him that you didnt see (v dissapointing, my favourite 6"" aswell)"
"nickvdh","7","0","1","15 May 2004"," Good movie - but not better then good as one might try to convince you
","Although the story is awesome one can not comment on the story, the story is from Homeros, the biggest poët in ancient Greek. What the movie is doing is making a commercial ripp-off from that story. It is not honouring the poëtry in any way: there is a ""commercial"" interpretation of the texts, and there are faults in it, more, all the poëtry is ripped out, eg: where are the beautiful feathers on the helmet of Hector, his epitethon ornans?<br/><br/>So if it is not that, one might think it is the good play that makes the movie great. Well, some actors do very well, but the one most in the scene (Achilles aka Brad Pitt) isn't really coming over, when he's crying it is almost ridiculous - sorry Brad. Whatever his looks are far better then that of Hector, he should be a hero, but he seems a newbie to the ancient scene. In the ancient story Hector is the best fighter of Troy, the great Hector owns them all, but in the movie he's a loser, he doesn't look cool, he doesn't fight cool and he doesn't talk cool, there is nothing cool or great on him.<br/><br/>So if its not the play, it might be the special effects? Well, not alot of special effects in this movie. The scene is quite nice, but the movie fails to really impress. We've seen those lot of ships in D-Day too, and we've seen that many soldiers in some movies before, so nothing really new to impress here. However the background and scenes are quite well worked out with a nice color sheme and lightning effect.<br/><br/>For the rest, the music is average. This all makes the movie a good movie (thanks to the great story of Homeros and the beatiful images, and to some of you also because of the steriotype love-scenes that are spitted out of the story and placed on foreground, or the fight scenes (although i found them also +/-)). But it isn't the best movie as the re are too many negative points.<br/><br/>But if you are wanting to see a movie to relax and are wanting to see something not to heavy for the stomach with some varying love/fight-scenes, this movie is like the one you need right now. Just don't espect it to be the best one and accept it's a commercial movie (not one with all the Homeros in it), then you can enjoy the movie. If you are searching more intellect, then forget about this movie.<br/><br/>If you read till here, i hope i could give you had something on it.<br/><br/>Greetings, Nick."

","As I've noticed from several reviews, I may be one of few people who has actually read the iliad and watched the movie, and I would say that the movie is an accurate reflection of the poem, which cleverly and subtly solves parts that were absent from the book. The homosexual relationship between Patroclus and Achilles is implied when the both of them are seen naked in the first scene (Patroclus is the one on the far side) and although Patroclus is older in the book then Achilles, he was well represented in his character.  Briseis is---in this movie a combination of Polyxima, Cassandra, and a bit of Briseis. This is something that I found clever and effective, a good solution to a limited time span. And in response to the previous review, Achilles (not Brad) cries because he grows as a character--this is the tragic element presented by Homer.  He becomes a better man through his pain and when he finally fixes his faults, he is brought down by the arrows of Paris which are guided by Apollo."

A Greek Tragedy never has a happy end.The adventure, the honor always has a prize.Always.  Achilles, for example, was a Butcher with no mercy, that profaned Hector's body.

I was delighted with Brain Cox's evil performance and the grand Peter O'Toole who never ceases to bring splendor in every word.

","This film was pretty satisfying as far as a movie experience.  I did enjoy this movie and would recommend it over most films that are sadly in theaters right now.  The scope was impressive although I am overdosed on CGI in flicks these days, and the story was changed to protect the Greek gods. The saving grace in this film were the     wonderful seasoned actors.  Sean Bean was amazing as his voice opened the movie and gave me shivers, and his presence gave the film credibility.  He seemed to be the only man in the film, and you can keep the pretty boys, thank you kindly.  Bean and Cox together were worth watching alone, and Peter O'Toole was as I knew he would be -- amazing.  These veterans and brilliant Brits carried the acting in this film, unless you were there just for the skin of pretty boys.  Pitt was good as the great warrior, and actually not as bad as I had been led to believe, and Bana was intense but with his Aussie accent slipping in the way periodically, I was waiting for ""G'day.""  Bloom was easy to dislike as the wimpish Paris, so he did his job, but was prettier than Helen Kruger in my opinion.<br/><br/>I do find it impossible to think that the director of one of my favorite movies, ""Das Boot"" directed this film.  Things that make you go hmmmmm? However, that being said, I enjoyed this film as my first summer flick, and although I did not come out of the theater going ""Wow, that was the best film I have ever seen,"" I did enjoy it and was glad I saw it.<br/><br/>
Now -- please will some producer/director please cast one of the most watchable, best actors, and the sexiest man in film in a movie with a lead role where he can have the screen to himself instead of a cast of hobbits, Orcs and Greeks -- obviously I am talking about Sean Bean. Thanks."
"nermal1","5","0","1","14 May 2004"," Disappointing
","While the movie claims to be 'based' on the Iliad, you'd be hard pressed to find much in the movie that is actually the same. You have the same character names and *some* relationships that are the same and that's about it. People suddenly become related to those they barely knew in the tale (or become related so people don't get homophobic...), people die when they shouldn't, people live when they shouldn't, and the ending is the biggest slap in the face Homer could ever expect. If you want a Hollywood movie, you'll get it in spades with this. If you want an epic tale truly based on Homer's Iliad, look elsewhere. Better yet, just go read it again.<br/><br/>
The sets are amazing, as are the costumes. Many of the actors are brilliant as well, though many other vital ones fail to deliver (Helen/Diane crucially, and to an extent Paris/Orlando). But the storyline suffers from so many changes to the original, it is totally unrecognisable. When a certain big character bites the dust early on things just go from bad to worse, and the ending is one of the most offensive things I've seen in a movie, a slap in the face to history just to please some fangirls. Makes me wonder if the writer/s truly understood and have read about what happened at the end of the Trojan War.<br/><br/>If you're looking for the Iliad, or even some semblance of it, don't see the movie. You will be highly disappointed. But if you could care less, then go for it, you'll probably enjoy it."
"dswanson35","Null","0","1","14 May 2004"," Pretty good as far as it went
","This was a really well made movie that dwealt on the human aspects of Homer's Iliad.  In Troy the war and its consequences were caused by passions and jealosy, fought by mortals who won or lost based on courage, deceit and cleaverness.  Problem is that in the real Iliad, all these dimensions are dwarfed by the influences of the gods.  The mortals are puppets on their strings, playing out the Gods' personal dissentions.  Humans are bound by fate, influenced by the gods and try their best to asset their autonomy in the Iliad.  That drama would have been much more complex than this movie and might have required a LOTR scale trilogy.  Also, somehow about 9 11/12 years of the 10 year Trojan war got missed.  I did get a chuckle that they had to find a way to have Orlando Bloom use his well rehearsed archery skills to kill Achilles.  All that practice as Legolas didn't get wasted.  They also included a brief scene featuring Aeneas and friends escaping from Troy, a much later Roman addition to the story. My recommendation is to see this movie as a great depiction of ancient world warfare, enjoy its spectacular battles and FX, ogle at Brad Pitt's biceps but then go home and read the Iliad for the real thing.  While you're at it, also read the Odessey to find out what happened to Odesseus after the credits."
"smashattack","4","0","4","18 May 2004"," A cheap Gladiator rip-off.
","Troy is one of those movies that seems like it should be in theaters... but then feels like it shouldn't.  Like it's a sort of documentary with little more than stone characters, or a multi-million dollar soap opera.<br/><br/>The very first thing I noticed about Troy was the music.  Wow, I have never heard such terrible music in my life.  Part of it had some blaring trumpets, which attempted to create a ""heroic"" feeling, but instead felt extremely corny and made me cringe.  The worst part about the music in this movie is an odd, high-pitched wailing woman's voice that seems to pop in every two minutes or so.  At one point in the movie I actually got so fed up with it that, right in the middle of the theater, I said out loud, ""My God, just SHUT UP.""  While Gladiator had the same type of music, with the wailing woman's voice, this technique was placed strategically within the movie, and wasn't so interfering.  Troy's shoved the movie out of the way, slapped you across the face, and screamed until you couldn't think, feel, see, or hear anything else.<br/><br/>The characters are extremely cliche.  We have the bad king--he is evil, of course, and wants more land for himself.  Greedy.  The usual villain.  We have the solo hero, who cares only about his countrymen (and cousin).  He is very noble, but also very arrogant.  There's the good king--good, but blinded by his own beliefs.  A noble gentleman who wants nothing but the best for his people.  The good king's son, who believes his father, although having good intentions, is really making some mistakes.  Throw in a few more villains, place them in ships heading toward the Trojan empire, and you have Troy.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were quite believable, but it was obvious that they were attempting to beat out Gladiator with some scenes, even resorting to using the same kind of camera movements as Gladiator.  But it failed in every attempt, as Gladiator pitted real people and characters in the arena, whereas Troy had a mishmash of simple good guys and bad guys thrown in to fight.  <br/><br/>The soap opera comes next.  The movie begins simply because the prince of Troy takes one of the kings of Greece's wife back to Troy.  The king's older brother, who controls most of Greece, uses this as a means of taking his largest army into Troy to conquer it.  Achilles is recruited, he meets a lovely young woman who teaches him new things about life, one guy dies and many are sad, one attempts to avenge his death, and so on and so forth, in an almost endless circle.<br/><br/>Troy really may not have been a bad movie.  It just felt really phony, really plastic, or transparent.  As if it were almost about to reach the reality of the world, but just couldn't wrap its fingers around tight enough.<br/><br/>My main point in all this?  Wait for Troy to come out on DVD.  Watch it, and decide for yourself.  I won't be watching it again."

","As I had already studied the myth of Troy in Latin, I was very eager to see what Petersen was going to do with the myth of myths: was he going to leave some parts out or would he stick to the original story, even if that meant putting some stuff in that wasn't very credible? Petersen obviously decided against the latter, keeping the movie within the boundaries of the possible.<br/><br/>At first I was a bit disappointed though, cause the fighting scenes were amusing rather than breathtaking (the bit where Paris crawled towards Hector and clutched his leg during a man-to-man fight with Menelaos was hilarious), but as the story evolved and the characters developed, I started to get really intrigued by their struggle for love, life or plain honour.<br/><br/>The second half is obviously exceedingly better than the first one: only then do you get the feeling of really being pulled into the story. The impressive finale makes you shiver and leaves you with a feeling that you wouldn't have missed this movie. The last voice-over by Odysseus is the perfect end to the greatest adventure of this year's cinema."

","First off, if you're expecting the movie to be entirely based on the Iliad, full with Gods and Goddesses, you're watching the wrong movie. This is an adaptation from Homer's classic, yet from an anticipated historical perspective. There are changes in the story as to what happens to make it more realistic. All that said it was wonderfully done.<br/><br/>As a side note, how come every time there is a release of a movie in pre English speaking times, the majority of the actors speak with a British accent? That kind of hit home, as not all of the actors spoke as such (Pitt and Bana mainly) though the dialogue was fairly easy to understand.<br/><br/>For the most part, if you've read the story recently, you'll have a basic understanding of what will happen. That doesn't discount the fact that the questioning of if it will be done correctly, which to me it seemed a perfect perspective for today's majority of non-polytheistic viewers. <br/><br/>Troy showed amazing attention to detail when it came to everything else. The fight sequences were right on, with some accounts as being almost blow for blow as they seemed in the story, with dazzling fighting by Bana and Pitt. The costumes, the vessels, city detail, costumes and the coloration of the garments were vividly represented of the times, where colors were limited to single colors and majority of blues, which were prevalent of the available dyes of the time. It also left appropriate spaces available for the continuation into renditions of the Odyssey and the Aeneid as well, which leads me to believe with an exceptional turnout at the box-office, that the other two will begin production shortly."

","I expected a lot from this film because i had studied the history of Troy extensively. I was unfortunately disappointed when i went to see it. It's 3 hours of fighting with swords, watching brad pitt leap like a gazelle and twirl around so we see his hot bod. It was unusual to see the Ancient Greeks wearing bright blue tie-dyed tunics - they looked like dresses from the 60's. Eric Bana was quite good at playing Hector - but the baby they got to play his son had a really big head and didn't look related to him or his wife - nice one guys. Paris is portrayed as a weak character who we end up not really liking too much - and if you think Orlando is in the film a lot - he isn't its mainly Brad and Eric. I think this film had great potential, i just think they cast the people for the wrong reasons (basically cause they were hot) and they were given poor direction. You realize something is wrong when Achillies is prettier than Helen of Troy - who is meant to be the most beautiful woman in the world....eep! So if you want to see Brad naked for quite a bit of the film, a few nice looking girls and a whole lot of fighting that takes up 3/4 of a 3 hour film, go for it. The Set is beautiful - thats the best thing i can say about it. The music is a poor rip off of the gladiator soundtrack. It's a bit of hot guy fun and lots of naked Brad.

Since I have studied Greek Mythology and especially Homers poems one must say that the real poems are completely different. Main differences were that Achilles died before the Troyan Horse entered Troy. Agamemnon's was not such a bad guy, as shown in the movie. Achilles was a great worrier and didn't have any romance during the war and lastly but most important the war lasted for 10 years and not 20 days. Believe that it's a petty they didn't film the real thing because it would get more positive votes and attract even more people. <br/><br/>Vangelis"

","For the first 40 minutes I was disappointed, because there were many dialogues without any sense in them and absolutely unconvincing play. But it got better, the actors improved, the action started to take place and Brad Pitt started showing the audience that he's more than just a pretty face. Just like Eric Bana, in whom I was disappointed a lot last summer with Hulk. I was satisfied today. He did good. In comparison to Orlando Bloom. I feel sorry for the guy, he gets this low-profile, more action, less talk roles over and over again, if it goes that way, I'll be sad, he is talented, he just didn't have the space to show it. The minute he started practicing with the bow I was screaming inside: Honey, where have you lost your blond wig and the rest of the Fellowship? The poor guy. Staying in the same slot is better than falling back one floor, but worse than any kind of improvement, Orlando. I hope he'll do better next time. CGI is well done, the rest of the cast is magnificent. (Just to think about that rivalry Pitt vs. Bana and hats off for Peter O'Toole). The fact that I've found annoying in the movie: some of the characters' names are not spoken mostly throughout the film. Not that it bothered me, for I know the legend, but what about the ones that don't?<br/><br/>But actually it is good. It is action, it is romance, it is a tale about loyalty, about heroes and cowards, about the battle fought for the greatest thing on Earth - Love. And it gets better with every second you spend in that movie, in that story. A total and magnificently done gotta-watch-it-this-season-movie."

The score sucked, the acting (with the exception of Brian Cox Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean) was pretty lame, the dialogue was all hamfisted and forced (do they need to say ""this story will be retold for 1000 yrs"" every 5 minutes?) and the fight scenes (with the exception of Hector/Achilles) were pretty stale.  Now, for Mr. Peterson's ""adaptation"", and i use that term loosely, of the Iliad/Odyssey/Aeneid...he took Homer and just s**t all over it.  Plain and simple.  Here are some spoilers...I didnt realize the Trojan War took 2 weeks.  How silly of me. I thought it took a decade.  Menelaus dies the 2nd day of the battle?  News to me...Helen and Hector's wife and daughter and Paris escape?  Wow, I thought I read different...the introduction of Aeneas is an absolute joke...Paris fights at the end and kills Achilles, who just saw his slave woman kill Agammemnon?

","I knew I was going to dig this picture in the first ten minutes, when a colossal bald muscleman is brought forward to conquer our hero, Brad-Achilles-Pit, who is currently busy screwing two beautiful slave babes, but rallies forth when summoned, and dispatches the giant in a single blow. This pretty much sets the stage for this brutal, beefy handling of the old story of Helen of Sparta, the siege of Troy and the Trojan horse.  As usual, lots of liberties are taken with the Homerian legend, a moot point, really, if they come up with something as well structured and stirring as this epic finally is.  The scale is grand, the pacing is tight and the cast is uniformly good.  It's all about conquest and brutality, with a slight dose of romance (nothing too intruding, although a bit more female pulchritude on display would have balanced it a bit and added some genre flourishes. Hah!).  The big fight between Achilles and Hector is well worth the build-up.  This is an ancient adventure in the best tradition, and totally enjoyable.  The bigger the screen and louder the volume, the better.  My only quibble: I wish the music score would have been better realized.  The dirge-like female moaning didn't work well in GLADIATOR and is just a distracting pastiche here.  This would have been scored to perfection by Elmer Bernstein or Jerry Goldsmith; oh well, at least James Horner didn't use his obligatory child chorus, and, thank God, Celine Dion wasn't recruited for the end title song (yuck)."

","Really, this movie is bad for so many reasons that it's easier to say what's good in it. Battle scenes, sets, costumes - those are great. Technologically this is an achievement. Although historians might have an issue with some or all of the details, their case is weak if only because, although the city on the Turkish hill was besieged and taken a couple times 3000 years ago, Greeks, most probably, never did that under their own banners.<br/><br/>I wish it was all about battles, costumes and history, I would've really enjoyed a movie like that on Discovery or History channel. Unfortunately there is also a ""drama"" here. Apparently poor Homer did not know much about that because the script writers of 'Troy' decided to dramatize this ""old blah blah blah"". Like this thing with Menelaus, husband of Helen. Apparently he's nasty, and we don't like nasty people, do we? So let's kill him - why would he get his wife back as Homer has intended? Or Paris - he's cute, right? Let him survive, and with Helen too - since the husband is dead, who cares? And why should Greeks besiege this damn city for 10 years - 2 weeks is enough. Etc. Apparently the motto is ""Happy end no matter what and in 3 hours"". <br/><br/>So, okay, you rewrote Homer, which proves that doubts are foreign to you. But with what?! With this pink and syrupy love story that allows Orlando Bloom to strut some? With dialogs that where even good actors struggle, not really sure what kind of feelings they are supposed to express? Oh, I know with what! Brad Pitt's butt! Though I am straight, it really looks nice... Enjoy it, there is not much else.<br/><br/>My advice: don't go. Let the producers lose money and release it on DVD. Then rent it and fast forward from one battle to another. Believe me, you are not going to lose much in between."

Each actor used their own speaking voice/accent except for Pitt who tried three different ones on separate ocassions. I never felt connected to any character nor did I care about the war.

","Just got back from Troy and boy is my arse aching, my mind numb, my eyes tired and tummy full from a delicious movie theater hotdog. Troy had moments where it teetered between good and not-so-good. Unfortunately for me most of the time it fell flat on its face on the not-so-good side. Its sad really because i was so eager to embrace this movie being a fan of the story from which it came. I was eager to watch massive battles unfold in front of me with dazzling effects and for the love between Helen and Paris to convince me that all the bloodshed was worth it. None of this happened. The battles became fuzzy and lost in their grandness. The CG was decent but the directing was clunky, unfocused. This is weird for me to say since Wolfgang Peterson is a very capable director. Every good, solid director has a bad shoot. I can't say that i blame the actors for uninspired performances seeing how the dialogue is nasty bad. But i will say that Orlando Bloom was especially dull and to make matters worse he was playing opposite Kruger who is about as interesting as the wood used to build the Trojan horse. Overall this movie was greatly uninspired. It seemed to be more focused on trying to re-create emotions from the Lord of the Rings trilogy with its chorus humming loudly along. They just forgot that LOTTR took time to let you know and care about the characters. And getting back to the ""love"" story. You'd think that a movie based on the premise of a war that was started over the love of two people would really take the time and make the effort to make you feel as if these two were really in love. What i got was that Helen just wanted a way out and Paris just wanted the ultimate trophy wife. Very long, very dull and a total YAWWWN."

After the opening scene, from that point on, even scenes where he had one line, the audience was laughing. Interestingly enough, local newspapers seemed to have picked up on this fact as well, with one paper saying that his career as an actor is over due to his response from the audience with this film.<br/><br/>True, his character is supposed to be a wimp, but it has nothing to do with the reasons why the audience was laughing, he was just ineffectual in the role.

","Cheesy dialogue and horrible music score aside, Wolfgang Peterson's grand adaptation of the age-old Greek legend is a very entertaining spectacle in that old-fashioned sword and sandals Hollywood epic kind of way. As with all good big-budget, star-studded, action-packed overwrought quasi-historical epics, ""Troy"" is as memorable for its follies (the horribly miscast Pitt as Achilles, the uninspiring Diana Kruger as Helen, the annoying as hell Orlando Bloom as Paris, the pretty-boy homo-erotic nature of it all) as it is for its triumphs (the massive sets and fantastically choreographed battle scenes, the scene-stealing performance from Peter O'toole as King Priam, the deliciously vile Brian Cox as the ruthless Agamemnon, and the star-making turn from Eric Bana as Hector). <br/><br/>Thankfully Peterson is an old-school director, so despite Pitt's posturing and male model stares that reminded me of Ben Stiller's hilarious ""blue steel"" look from ""Zoolander"" and a painfully stale script that doesn't allow the viewer to root for anyone, he avoids all flash and music-video style editing to give the film its refreshingly old-fashioned look and its ""this is an epic from another era"" pace. Both of these welcome throwbacks to the heyday of Cecil B. DeMille make the film itself more endearing (albeit in a very dull way) than any of the wishy-washy characters parading in togas across the movie screen. In the end, with nary an authentic Greek to be seen in the cast of thousands, varying degrees of wavering British accents and the reduction of a richly layered and complex centuries old legend into a single two and half hour Hollywood movie, Homer is probably rolling over in his ferry on the river Styx, but I still enjoyed my popcorn and passed a few hours of my time."

","I've been excited for 'Troy' ever since I saw the trailer with the epic music and uber-squadron of ships.  However, after having gotten into a press screening, I learned something.  If there is any way that this film is going to do well, it will be because Brad Pitt is nude for multiple scenes.  The badass warrior-for-hire Achilles couldn't be portrayed by anyone else, really, women all over the world already think that Pitt really is a God. However, I think that those involved with the film realized that it's a whole lot of war, so since women have been waiting for this film like geeks wait for Star Wars, I think they figured that throwing a lot of bare skin in there would only help to get the butts in the seats.  Not only Brad Pitt, but Orlando Bloom has at least one scene of being nearly exposed in his all, which would make women around the world pirate the video just so they could watch and enjoy the sins of the flesh from the official pretty boy movie of 2004 instead of watching late night Cinemax.  True, the 'important' parts of both Bloom and Pitt aren't exposed, but they got just about as close as they could without hitting that NC-17 rating.  Pitts were mostly profiles, but there was also a lot of magic done with shadowing.  Blooms was more straight-shot, but a bed was what blocked what every woman in the theater wishes hadn't been blocked.<br/><br/>So basically, the storyline seems to be trying to mix together both Gladiator and Braveheart, but comes off as nowhere near as powerful as either film.  The characters are portrayed excellently, but the way in which they are shown to us makes this 2 & 1/2 hour epic seem much longer and much more drawn out.  Worth the price of a matenee ticket."

I liked the fact that there was not too much focus on Paris and Helen (one had the impression after seeing the trailers, but trailers can be misleading a lot!) - Paris was almost perfectly personated by Orlando Bloom, who gave his performance a wonderful cowardly touch without being embarrassed by it. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt did a good job as usual, also Pete O'Toole was very touching.<br/><br/>Outstanding was the performance of Rose Byrne. I think she rescued the lacks in the plot. Impressive were also the choreographies of the man-against-man fights. I was sad to see that Kassandra and Eneas were (almost) cut.

","Was this the worst movie I've ever seen?  Not even close.  However, for such a great story, this movie is pretty horrible.  I've never actually read the Iliad, so I have no idea how close this film is to that (nor do I really care that much).  The plot progression in the film is interesting, for the most part, and (despite some awful dialog) flows fairly well with some glaring exceptions.<br/><br/>As others have talked about, Brad Pitt's character has too many dimensions for who he is supposed to be.  The way in which his affection for Briseis so abruptly changes his character seems quite forced, and it's not like this is even the first time he's loved a woman (if we read into the mother's speech about him having a woman on the island to grow old and peaceful with).<br/><br/>Because I don't feel like spoiling the film for others, I won't go into some of the other abrupt transitions.  I will, however, talk about the acting.<br/><br/>I already said Brad Pitt did a good job.  What flaws there were with his character were not his fault, but that of the writer and some horrible dialog (this movie was chock-full of one-line ""ponderous"" statements).<br/><br/>Eric Bana, however, was tremendously flat, especially given how major a character he was.  Every line was said with nearly the same emphasis. Unlike Achilles, Hector is supposed to have depth.  He has a wife and child (who has the biggest baby head I've ever seen), has to defend his brother, etc...he is supposed to have reasons for doubt and emotion, etc.  Instead, he's fairly tough and just kind of ""there"" throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom, on the other hand, is just downright dreadful.  It's a combination of over-acting and a poor charicature of a prince.  In saying one line of dialog, you can watch Orlando Bloom's face go through about 42 different emotions...it's just so awful to see.<br/><br/>Those are the actors people are going to see this movie for, so I won't bother detailing the rest of the cast.  Agamemnon was one dimensional, but good, and Priam was pretty interesting.  The female characters are all quite hokey, but I've always thought epics were loved because you could have horrible female roles and no one would care.<br/><br/>As for what else is wrong with this film, I have to put some serious blame on the director.  He didn't write this score, but he did have a hand in where it went in the film.  Boy, did he screw that one up!  The music is bad enough by itself, but the placement and volume of it and everything about how it works in the film is just awful.  And then, on top of that, this film had some of the worst cinematography possible.  He uses this 180-degree rotate and pan technique a number of times (too many), and we just don't care about the lay of the land in the end.  He does everything he can to try and give it this ""epic"" feel, but ultimately it just rings hollow.  The one positive thing he did do was that I felt like (especially the city of Troy) some of the shots were very reminiscent of films like The Ten Commandments or Ben Hur or other such old epic films.  Unfortunately, he wasn't consistent in that style, and as such it detracted from the overall picture because these scenes are obviously going to come off as fairly childish and cheesy when compared with some of the more modern cinematic techniques.<br/><br/>I really don't recommend seeing this in theatres...unless you want to see a very nearly naked sixty-foot tall Brad Pitt (to which, I admit, the man is hot).<br/><br/>5/10"

","Epics are scarce now. We have a few wanna-be epics (like Master and Commander; I'm not counting the Lord of the Rings movies because, well, I don't feel that they are), but nothing substantial. And although we won't be able to get another Ben-Hur or The Ten Commandments, we have great ones coming out this summer. Troy is one of them. It clocks in a little over two-and-a-half hours, but has all of the makings of an epic-characters, plot, excitement.<br/><br/>Based off Homer's The Iliad, sans most of the polytheism, Troy begins with Achilles (Brad Pitt) killing the opposing army's strongest man in one blow of the sword. Then the Greek army, led by Agamemnon (Brian Cox), goes to invade Troy and enlarge the Greek empire even more. However, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) sends the army there because Paris (Orlando Bloom) captured his wife Helen (Diane Kruger) and took her to Troy. Now the two armies (Agamemnon's and Achilles's, since Achilles does not fight for Agamemnon) go to fight against the Trojan army.<br/><br/>What really sold me about the movie was not the great acting (for the most part), or the action scenes, but the technical aspects. The locations were beautiful, as were all of the sets. I see where most of the famed $200 million went. Also, the cinematography was amazing-the things that could be done with the camera were very surprising. I was also surprised that the editing was not too choppy, which showed me that director Wolfgang Petersen did not want to make this for the MTV generation-this could be something that could live on for a long time.<br/><br/>I had mixed feelings on David Benioff's (25th Hour) script. Mostly, it kept the movie exciting, even during the parts others felt were boring, and it seemed to move the movie along. It was well-written and seemed plausible. However, there was one thing that really irked me. That was one scene in which Achilles was crying. I can understand how a normal person would cry in that situation, but Achilles is a tough-as-nails guy! It's like seeing James Bond cry. It just discredits the whole thing.<br/><br/>Despite others, I felt that Pitt was very good in his role-he seemed to get this part down well. He obviously put a lot of time into his role. Eric Bana, as Hector, did a great job, too. But now I must come to Orlando Bloom. I've always felt he was over-exposed for no reason, and Troy backs that up. When saying his lines, it seems like he wasn't doing anything with them. I was convinced that he was talking like English was a foreign language. His character did nothing for me-he was almost as annoying as Johnny Depp's character in Secret Window. He knows nothing of life, yet he forces the destruction of everyone around him. I wish someone had defenestrated him. As for the ""old men talking"" (there's a quote in the film saying, ""War is young men dying and old men talking""), all of them were good but not memorable.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes were amazing. All of those extras, everything so exact. It's a shame that this film has been getting mediocre reviews. Those $200 million well-spent will go to waste.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for graphic violence and some sexuality/nudity."

And you just don't have the time to capture the whole image on the screen and read whatever they are saying. Another thing is that I expected more acting and less fighting. I had set my hopes on Brad Pitt who has proven many times to be a great actor. In this film his character is ""flat"" and all you learn about Achilles is his passion for fighting. Then again it was fun to see Brad in a mini-skirt :-)<br/><br/>If you are not from another planet you know from the beginning that Troy is going to fall. The director did a great job on letting you sympathize with the people of Troy and with Achilles and his army. Anoying part in the movie is the story about Helena and Orlando Bloom; I think it was just there because people like a lovestory in a movie and to get younger people (girls) to the cinema as well because of Orlando Bloom.<br/><br/>Overall it was a nice lesson in Greek History, impressive to watch, and poor acting.

","This movie does not live up either to the reputation of the director (well, think das Boot) or the frenzy of positive spin I have been seeing on the web in the last few weeks. For the record, I saw this in English in a Swiss cinema, which meant an intermission (very roughly cut too, I almost saw the scissors).<br/><br/>The film starts well; some cheeky humor and nods to the Harryhausen school of bad guys (cue 8 foot tall warrior). Brian Cox is pantomime-level bad guy number one. Brad P is lovingly shot in a variety of poses (running about) and we all settle back for a splendid night of entertainment. So far so good.<br/><br/>Bring on Helen! Bring on Paris! From here it goes awry. Rather than go through the (hours) of dialog and pick out the best of the cheese, suffice to say that a) there are enough moments when the cringe-o-meter flickers up to 10 to have warranted bursts of incredulous laughter in the cinema b) enough bizarre accents to sound like an acting lesson c) enough sweeping panoramas and beautiful people to make if feel like midweek in Cannes.<br/><br/>This movie proves a lot of things, namely -<br/><br/>that when he is not confined to a small space, the director seems lost.<br/><br/>that Peter O'Toole needs a better hairstylist (Siegfried! Roy!).<br/><br/>that Brad Pitt is not able to carry a movie.<br/><br/>that Legolas should have stayed in the woods (awful, awful, awful).<br/><br/>that quite a few English soap opera and movie actors were happy to have their day in the sun on this movie set.<br/><br/>that the time of sword and sandals movies is now passed.<br/><br/>In summary, a very disappointing movie, no coherence, no real feeling and just a huge amount of money thrown at a project that could have been a wonderful set of movies."

","Oh, come on, it's really not that bad<br/><br/>As a great ""Iliad"" enthusiast I was quite nervous about the possible blockbuster butchering of Homer. I have to say, though, that I was surprised at how much they actually stick to the story. For example, I never thought they would allow a handsome prince in love played by Orlando Bloom to be the wimp he is in the original text. But they did actually make him look really both silly and shameful, which is admirable. Also, I feared the Achilles/Briseis pairing to be horribly sentimental - of course they had to make her a love interest and not a mere trophy, as she is in the Iliad - but mostly they did a sober, tense version of the relationship, apart from some false notes towards the end. The battle scenes were terrific, especially the duel between Achilles and Hector. Eric Bana is sympathetic as Hector, a difficult character to play because he is so damned noble, but the scene stealer is the magnificent Sean Bean as the cunning Odysseus.<br/><br/>What is my most serious argument towards the film, is that it proves less generous and tolerant than Homer by making a shallow bad guy of the Greek King Agamemnon and good guys of the valiant Troyans. In the epic, both sides are portrayed as heroic and human, with heroes and cowards on either side. And the dragged out death scenes are downright ridiculous. Also, the most pompous lines ring horribly hollow and become unwillingly comic. But you cannot exactly complain about being to pompous when it after all is about a rendition of what is in fact The. Greatest. Story. Ever. Told"

","At the center of the movie Troy is a story about two great warriors grappling with the reasons of why they fight. On the side of Greece, is the near-invincible Achilles played by Brad Pitt. Achilles despises power-hungry Agamemnon, the King of Kings of Greece. Achilles, it appears, fights for no reason. Not for love, not for loyalty, and especially not for Agamemnon. He fights because that is what he is born to do.<br/><br/>On the side of Troy is Hector (played by The Incredible Hulk's Eric Bana), a family man and the prince of Troy. Greece declares war on Troy when Hector's younger brother, Paris (played by LOTR's star Orlando Bloom), takes Helena as his bride. (Helena, you see, is Agamemnon's brother's wife.) Hector understands the reasons for the war and this makes him leery, but it doesn't dampen his desire to fight for Troy. He is the son of Troy, and he will protect it to the death.<br/><br/>In the middle of this war, Achilles refuses to fight after a dispute with Agamemnon until tragedy strikes. Achilles, filled with blood thirsty revenge, challenges Hector to a fight to the death. In victory, Achilles desecrates Hector's body for all to see. It is from this point that this 2-hour and 30-minute movie begins its race to the finish. A wooden horse shows up, a city is burned, and Prince Paris finds Achilles' weak spot. (If this is a surprise to you, brush up on your Greek history & mythology).<br/><br/>Troy is a non-stop movie filled with short monologues; cute, sweaty, muscled men; and wide-scale epic battle sequences that rival both Gladiator and The Last Samurai combined. The operatic scores brings dramatic tension to the well-shot battle scenes, which are choreographed to near perfection. Brian Cox is wonderfully evil as Agamemnon. Sean Bean is convincing as the clever Odysseus. And Eric Bana gives depth and emotion to the internally-tortured Hector.<br/><br/>But alas, the movie belongs to Brad Pitt as the brooding, moody, pr**k who is Achilles. Whatever training and preparation Pitt had to become Achilles pays off in this flick. As the great warrior, he slays his opponents with fluid motions and with the flare of a man whose skill is killing. The training also shows on Pitt's wonderfully chiseled body (excuse my drool), which is naked almost as much as it is dressed. (my hormones are a-jumping.)<br/><br/>This movie lived up to and exceeded my expectations. Troy is solid movie that will appeal to everyone's lust-sexual, blood or otherwise."

","(Synopsis - Spoiler?) Brad Pitt plays Achilles, the legendary Greek warrior. King Agamemnon's army reveres Achilles as their greatest fighter, faster, stronger, and deadlier with a sword then all others.  As the Greek's army champion, Achilles has won many battles by defeating the other country's champion. The Trojan War begins when Prince Paris of Troy (Orlando Bloom) takes his lover, the beautiful Queen Helen (Diane Kruger), the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson), back to Troy.  All the Greek armies unite under King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), a total of 50,000 soldiers sail to Troy in a thousand ships.  The walls of Troy are invincible to an invading army, so Troy has never been defeated in battle.  The battle begins with Achilles and his men reaching the Troy beach first and taking the beach almost by themselves.   Achilles captures Prince Hector (Eric Bana) in the temple, but he lets him go free for another day.  King Agamemnon does not honor Achilles for his victory, and Achilles' pride is hurt. Achilles and his men stayed out of the next battle, and the Greeks are beaten badly. Achilles is about to return home when Hector kills his cousin in battle, thinking it was Achilles.  Achilles challenges Hector, and they fight to the death.  Achilles wins and drags Hector's body away.  Hector is returned for a proper funeral, which includes a 12-day truce.  During this time, the Greeks build the Trojan Horse and leave.  The wooden horse is taken into the city, and the men inside open the gates of Troy.  The movie was long and slow in places, but they tried to fit a 10-year war into a short movie.  In movie time, the whole war only lasted less than a month.  Brad Pitt's fight scenes were very well choreographed.  The large-scale battle scenes are outstanding.  The movie will take you on a roller coaster of emotional peaks; then down for a while and back up again.  A warning to all students, you should not write your book report based on seeing this movie, there are many details that are wrong. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run time 2:43, Rated R) (8/10)"

","Having popular actor hero Brad Pitt (`The Mexican') play classical warrior Achilles could be like having Jim Carey play JFK-It just doesn't seem like a good fit. After all, Pitt's pretty-boy baggage and the otherworldly genes of the greatest fighter in literature don't seem to go together.  But they do! Pitt does well enough with Homer's `Iliad' to make sure Wolfgang Petersen's (`Das Boot,' `Perfect Storm') will henceforth be shown by all classics departments as the definitive tale of The Trojan War told in `The Iliad' and the `Odyssey.' When Pitt as Achilles says he did not engage Hector in the first meeting because `it's too early to kill princes,' I was won over by the arrogance and superiority of the hero and the actor.<br/><br/>The adaptation looks good enough to satisfy classics undergrads, who may have read the original in Greek.  Besides the proud and lonely Achilles are the vain and cowardly Paris (Orlando Bloom), the foolish and unfaithful Helen (Diane Kruger), the greedy and gaudy Agamemnon (Brian Cox), and the heroic and harried Hector (Eric Bana). The film lays out each one's strength's and weaknesses, integrates the action into the catalytic abduction of Helen and husband Menelaus's (Brendan Gleeson) campaign to gain back his honor.  During all this Achilles has to be persuaded to fight because of his feud with Agamemnon, but not a difficult persuasion after Hector unknowingly kills Achilles' beloved cousin, Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund). <br/><br/>When he is on screen, no one can touch Peter O'Toole's (`Lawrence of Arabia') King Priam for royal demeanor, commanding perception, and aching love for his children and people. In his case, the baggage he brings from `Lawrence' and `Lion in Winter' serves him well.<br/><br/>The battles are realistic, not quite as bloody or spiritual as the rout at Agincourt in Kenneth Branagh's magnificent  `Henry V.'  Pitt flies through the air like a stunt man from `Crouching Tiger,' and he is pumped up physically even more than he was in `Fight Club.' Although he is not yet an Oscar-worthy actor, he brings a commanding physical presence and delivery good enough to help me forget the stardust he carries.<br/><br/>Homer would be happy with this `Iliad' adaptation even if the Trojan horse appears only in the `Odyssey' and Agamemnon's fate is reworked.  The spirit is for the ages, thousands of years later, when men still go to war for reasons other than love, occupy other countries at great peril, and die inexplicably happy to have their names emblazoned on memorials while families cope with profound loss.  <br/><br/>Tennyson caught the mystery of why men would fight for a faithless woman when he described Helen with the `face that launched a thousand ships/and burnt the topless towers of Ilium.' Troy or Iraq, Achilles or Rumsfeld, wars and warriors are forever caught in the myths of Troy faithfully and sympathetically rendered in Wolfgang Petersen's version, an enjoyable and memorable blockbuster to complement a summer of real war and conflicted citizenry."
"scarlet478","4","0","3","7 May 2004"," Forgettable, but full of eye candy
","Here I am, fresh from a preview screening of Troy...um, what can I say? I feel pretty apathetic about the movie as a whole. In a couple of days I'll probably forget it; it was rather unremarkable.<br/><br/> Why? Well, from the start, I was pretty disappointed in the lack of gods. I have not read the Iliad, but what I do know of the story is through my interest in Greek mythology. Taking the myth out of the story took some of my interest out of the movie. Besides, the location of Achille's...hrm, painful wound...has no significance if the myth is left out. My friend, who wasn't familiar with the story, didn't understand until I explained it to her after we'd watched the movie.<br/><br/> The movie didn't do much to suck me into the storyline. I didn't feel that involved for a long time, perhaps until after they started fighting. Then as things started to really happen, I guess I got a little more interested. I couldn't pick out all the departures from the Iliad, but the end felt a little wrong. Not exactly sure why, but it did.<br/><br/> Brad Pitt, by the way, was pretty hot. This movie sure is full of eye candy. That is probably its only redeeming quality. An all-around good-looking cast, nice battle armor, beautiful costuming, nice blood effects, pretty Trojan city (though it was so perfect that I had trouble believing it was a real city) and some relatively sweet battle scenes. Well, the ones with the armies weren't all that impressive. I think someone said it already, but yeah, after Lord of Rings, my standards have been raised. Troy sadly did not meet those standards. But the battles between individuals were a little better. The one with Paris in it might have intended to be serious but it turned out to be the most comic scene in the whole movie. The one between Achilles and Hector kinda made me want to go back to my dorm and play Soul Calibur II. I'm not entirely sure if that says something good about that scene.<br/><br/> Oh yes, the worst thing the director did with Orlando Bloom was hand him a bow and arrow. I think Bloom will forever be associated with Legolas and having him shoot more arrows in the same Legolas way is really not helping him shake that association.<br/><br/> I said at the beginning of this review that I'd probably forget this movie in a couple of days. Well, it's been almost two hours since I've seen it and it is already slipping from my mind as I try to think of more things to say about it. So, I'll end by saying that I wouldn't recommend watching this if you are expecting to see a piece of wonderful cinema. However, if it's a rainy afternoon with nothing to do and someone else is offering to buy a ticket for you, go for it."

","I went to see Troy expecting to see a spectacular Roman movie. I was disappointed with this spectacular, as outside of the massive extras used in the battle scenes, the movie was very ordinary. Brad Pitt was adequate in his role, and Helen was a beautiful young actress.  The story was long and drawn out in spots and was over long. Once again I go back to the Ben Hur, Quo Vadis of the 50's and 60' when I guess the writers were better.  It is worth seeing but don't get too excited about this one, as it leaves a lot to be desired."
"Gandalf-2","Null","0","1","10 May 2004"," way too short
","To be honest: I really wanted to like ""Troy"", its epic story is really known to everybody, names like Achilles, Paris or Agamemnon are everyday lingo as is the Trojan Horse, now even more than before the internet. It was just a question of time until someone made this into a big movie.<br/><br/>But Mr. Petersen has underestimated the responsibility that goes with it. Troy is not a bad film, it has all the elements, but it is way too short. Everybody has his own agenda, and there are so many heroes of the past meeting in just under 3 hours, that the normal moviegoer just can't take it all in. Since we all know how things end before they do in the film, the makers should keep the audience at bay in awe, but they just can't. It's just like ""Apollo 13"", which was a fine film but kind of boring if you know the story. Now I don't know the (hi)story of Troy in great detail, but enough to see that the film condenses 10 years of siege into some weeks as well as some other details.<br/><br/>Had this story been told in 3 parts, everybody would have loved it. But this is like squeezing the Second World War into 180 Minutes. History is too big to be squeezed into bite-sized movies, the same goes for all the legends.<br/><br/>Apart from that, don't let me take your motivation! Troy is a mighty big epic, told very well, nevertheless quite gripping. It is like always: The more ignorant the viewer is, the bigger the enjoyment of the film..."

","Now now, let's not all be so glum about it. I was at a free movie screening last Tuesday and needless to say, the whole theater kept errupting in laughter. One of the funniest epic movies ever made... Hilarious because of it's unintentional comedy.<br/><br/>What can I say? The screenwriters were horrible! The directing, I guess, shouldn't be blamed, I mean those fight scenes were pretty good. And all the male nakedness could almost more than make up for the lack of pretty much whatever it is that makes the Iliad such an wonderful book.<br/><br/>They do not make you understand why Glory is an important part of life in Ancient Greece. This is why we all started bursting into ridiculous laughter when Achilles thinks of choosing between living and having a family with his mother seeing him again and dying but living on with the Glory. Bad bad idea! It makes him look like an idiot, not the hero he ought to be.<br/><br/>Another, milking too much of the romance but letting the love story drop. It is not good! First of all, Briseis was not the cousin or the temple virgin. She was conquered and was war booty. The heart-felt parts were not heart-felt at all. The lines were terrible! It was just soooo inappropriate for the scene.<br/><br/>THE RAGE! The rage of Achilles... what the heck, it makes him look like a moron! No love set up before he moots and things are so quickly changed... WHERE THE HECK IS LITTLE AJAX??? It was sad...I really was hoping for little Ajax to come along.<br/><br/>THE MOST POIGNANT PART OF THE STORY WAS CHANGED! I'm talking about Book 6 where Hector says goodbye to his family... whyyyyy oh whyyyy did they change that?! You all will see.<br/><br/>And Hector. Don't get me started. Eric Bana looked great and all but he just didn't give emotion. He spoke and he acted, but he did not feel. His eyes are left wanting...<br/><br/>And then the Patroclus... *sigh* I was so disappointed... What's the deal with him looking so young? they're supposed to be best of friends. And this young thing... I couldn't stop laughing when I saw Aeneas. He looked 16 dragging his father and where's his daughter and Creusa???<br/><br/>I'm sorry. This girl Helen... HORRIBLE HORRIBLE depiction of her. Why did they hype her up so much?<br/><br/>I must say, however, BRAVO ORLANDO BLOOM. Although I did not appreciate the Legolas revival in the end (which I can forgive since it was part of the story... however it just didn't fit), he portrayed Paris as he ought to be. The ridiculously beautiful hunk of a man who was a complete wuss. I soooo felt the emotion, his innocence, his lover-not-fighter status and all his aesthetic beauty. He got meaty for this one! ORLANDO BLOOM, I SALUTE THEE!<br/><br/>
Well I guess here's the deal: If you really want to experience Troy as it should be, go out and get Fagle's translation and read it for yourself. If you want to actually see it...might as well wait for the rentals to come out. If you want to see really hot men go naked (forgot how many times I almost jumped at the screen seeing Brad Pitt clotheless and Orlando Bloom nakie), then by ALL means, do go and watch it. As for the $20 million spent... *sigh* all down the drain. If you want to see a comedic adaptation of Iliad without being too offended, then gooo ahead and watch."

","As it seems so far in other people's comments, Troy is becoming one of those movies that will undoubtedly get mixed reviews. Although, I personally enjoyed the film because I went in with no expectations. It is not the greatest epic ever, nor is it as horrible as some people are making it out to be.<br/><br/>Whether or not you're familiar with the Iliad should not stop you from watching this movie. Troy provides many action-filled sequences that are very entertaining, and gives you enough background on the characters to understand what's going on and who's who. Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, I believe, did a great job portraying their powerful characters. Peter O'Toole also stands out in this film as the king everyone comes to love as well as Brian Cox who is the king everyone comes to hate. Although Diane Kruger, Saffron Burrows and Rose Byrne weren't given much dialogue, they do a pretty good job as eye candy for the film and acting as the ""damsels in the distress."" Other than a few corny lines that are tolerable for an action film, the only real disappointment in this movie was Orlando Bloom. He's great to look at, but the delivery of his lines often times were over-dramatic, and his facial expressions laughable.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's a fun film. Don't count on complete accuracy to the book, or for the greatest film you've ever seen. It's a summer blockbuster, that's well worth watching."

","Well, I was among the ""privileged"" few to see Troy before it's official release. My purpose in writing this review is to instill in your minds at least one negative thought before going to see this ""epic"" for yourself. I know I would have appreciated the same considering I went in ready to be amazed. Amazed I was not.<br/><br/>I guess I should begin by detailing the few good qualities I believe this film possesses. Well, it's ""inspired"" by an incredible story. The cast was, to nobody's surprise, attractive. And, well I've honestly been sitting here for ten minutes trying to come up with another positive remark. But, that's all I've got.<br/><br/>Now for the rest of the movie. Orlando Bloom, I have one word of advice, change professions. You should not be allowed to act, legally. I hope they didn't invest too much of their 200 million on you. That's about all I can say about Orlando without getting mean, you'll see for yourself soon enough.<br/><br/>As for Brad Pitt, well, his performance was better than Orlando Bloom's. My hopes that he would carry the film did not come to fruition. I must say though, he did look really good with his shirt off, especially the scene where he was conveniently covered in vaseline.<br/><br/>In Brad Pitt's defense, he didn't exactly have much to work with (the same goes for Orlando Bloom but I'm definitely not defending him). David Benioff successfully took one of the greatest stories of all time and desecrated it. Come May 14th, Homer will be rolling in his grave. It pains me to think that many future movie-going patrons will pay to see this movie without ever having read the remaining works of the Iliad. And to you higher education students, don't see this movie instead of reading Homer's masterpiece, you'll fail any test of your knowledge of the text. The skeleton of the story is there, I'll give you that. But why, David Benioff, with the works of the Iliad to work from, did you have to steal lines from Gladiator? Homer will see you ""in this life or the next"".<br/><br/>I had every reason, going in, to believe that James Horner, with his incredible resume, would not disappoint. He did. Let's face it, if I'm not humming the theme song as I write this then he failed. This is an ""epic"", where was the epic music?<br/><br/>As for the direction, I'm not sure there was any. Wolfgang Petersen was MIA. I have to ask what you did with the budget money. Seriously, where did you stash the money? Warner Bros. is going to find you. If you spent much of it employing a special effects company, I guarantee you they are laughing their asses off as we speak.<br/><br/>I'd like to finish by saying that my opinion is, of course, not going to mirror that of everyone to see this film. This film will almost definitely, however unfortunate, exceed it's budget in revenues. I just hope you don't go in with the ""epic"" expectations that I did."

","I was fortunate enough to get in to a free screening of Troy two weeks before the official release.  For one of the summer's biggest blockbusters it fits that bill.  The action sequences are very good though not the best i've seen.  The acting is mediocre and the plot is somewhat muddled.  Brad Pitt does an excellent job as Achilles and more or less carries the movie on his own.  Orlando Bloom still can't act and was comical at some points without intending to be.  I have read the Illiad so i feel i had an easier time identifying the myriad of characters portrayed in this film.  With no background in mythology it may be difficult to keep track of all the players at times.  The drawback to having read the Illiad is that the movie takes some liberties with the telling of the story.  There are major differences between the book and the movie which will bother the purists out there like me.  Overall the movie is about what it should be; a summer blockbuster. Full of action and plot holes that never really lives up to the massive hype around it.  Worth seeing, but only once."
