","The best film in the era of Daniel Craig as James Bond. Supremely well acted. The best performances are by Craig, Dench and Bardem who are prize. Great action scenes, big issue that touches past Bond and M which little is known. Sam Mendes does a masterful job directing this installment of James Bond. Realmete with this film you can compare Danie Craig Sean Connolly."

","'Could we discuss the next part of your performance over that drink?' asks the glittering Severine (Berenice Marlohe) from a suave tuxedoed James Bond (Daniel Craig). And indeed, this 23rd Bond outing, superbly directed by the usually reliable Sam Mendes, does just that, pausing appropriately to settle down leisurely over a drink, for some flirtation, some tense verbal confrontation, some self-reflection and brooding just before cutting away to some clean-cut, thrilling action. The result is the uniquely named 'Skyfall' a Bond film so full of the vintage charm and charisma yet fashioned in modern, urban and instantly accessible style that it ends up being one of the finest films of the franchise.<br/><br/>Yes, Mendes' film is a solid revamp of the Bond franchise, bringing in welcome dollops of humor, luxury and sensuality that went missing from the franchise with the last outing. And impressively enough, there is enough emotion without slowing things down, enough tension and action without making it too frenetic and the pacing is so, so perfect that you seldom feel the film falling short or dragging too long.<br/><br/>Pretty much everyone would agree that the 60s were the heyday of the Bond films. Those Sean Connery-starrers were primarily all about the leading man and his ladies but each was fashioned with such a slick ease, wise-ass humor and layer-cakes of moments that we embraced them all as subversive classics. 'Skyfall' fortunately, is a film that reaches up to that caliber.<br/><br/>Clearly, the best thing about the film is the pacing. Mendes is in no hurry to let the film unravel. The story begins in Istanbul, with Bond and his side-kick Eve Moneypenny (a sharp-tongued Naomie Harris, smarter than ever), chasing down a man with a list. The action scenes come in neatly and the opening pursuit shifts from a hectic bike chase on the rooftops to the cliff-hanging fight on top of the train and it all looks truly spectacular.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough- MI6 is under attack from a former agent- a renegade named Silva (Javier Bardem) who has a knack for orchestrating terrorist attacks with a simple click of the mouse. But trust me, this has to be one of the smoothest Bond outings in recent years; Mendes smartly and adroitly navigates the action from Istanbul to alternately grey and sunny London and from the stunning Shanghai to the villain's lair- ideally an abandoned island and finally in Bond's ancestral home in rural Scotland's foggy moors, setting the stage for a truly dramatic experience.<br/><br/>And, boy, it delivers. For all the charm that it delivers, this has to be one of the most intimately dramatic Bond outing since ages. The plot is about how the ubiquitous computer can be used as a weapon for security breach but more importantly, this is a film that pairs both Bond and his nemesis in the same light- both are tortured souls, both were MI6 heroes who had been left for the dead in the name of protocol and duty and M, played superbly by Judi Dench, looms like a domineering matriarch over both the men. Silva's angst is against M's cold-blooded dedication to her duty, and Bond feels some of it as well but the latter clings to his morals out of loyalty to his nation. The stakes are downright personal and high and clearly each scene of action or searing tension feels immediate, urgent and the film gels with us on a personal level.<br/><br/>But none of it jars. Smartly enough, everything is on an even keel- the action feels perfectly urgent but it does not stretch, the drama is poignant and painful, the humor comes in like a fresh breath into the taut proceedings and it all works impeccably as smoothly as the click of a mouse itself.<br/><br/>'Skyfall' also proves quite what everyone is saying since 2006's 'Casino Royale- that Daniel Craig is the best Bond we had since Connery. This is a film where he is never as before- instead of the hardened, brutal action hero we were handed last time, here is a more relaxed Bond, clearly at greater ease, flirting with women and sparring with M and Q (an impressive Ben Whishaw) with equal dry charm and sarcasm. He makes his one-liners blaze and his quieter moments are played out with a subtlety. He rules the film without trying too hard. It is a solid, compelling act.<br/><br/>And he is matched by the villain as well. Super performer Javier Bardem shows up in an unforgettable role as the menacing Silva, a man whom you might cringe at yet a character who stays with us as long as he is there in the film. He flips between smooth talking to a nasty edge with superb ease and his confrontation with Bond is clearly the highlight of the film. <br/><br/>This is also an action film where the cinematographer also stands out. The work of veteran lens-man Roger Deakins is clearly one of the best things in this film. Deakins bathes each frame, from the action and suspense to the more reflective and emotional sequences with a fantastic play of light, shadow, shade, texture and perspective. Everything looks stunning, perfectly placed and in balance yet urgent and explosive.<br/><br/>'Skyfall' is clearly a Bond film for the ages. The layer-cakes of vintage moments are perfectly underlined with a modern style- the scene between Q and Bond is a moment of self-reflexive humor, clearly revealing the generation gap between the two and the one between the new and the old Bond. Clearly, this is a film that has something for both the fans of old and fans of new. And that is a grandstanding achievement itself.<br/><br/>Thank you, Daniel Craig. Thank You, Javier Bardem and thank you, Sam Mendes, for making me believe in James Bond again.<br/><br/>Now, give us some more. <br/><br/>Ah! It was worth the wait."
"larrys3","9","55","76","14 February 2013"," Powerhouse of a Movie
","Since the site has 1164 reviews as of this writing I'll just throw in my own two cents.<br/><br/>Two of the world's greatest actors, namely Judi Dench and Javier Bardem, lead the way here. Daniel Craig, I thought, turned in another strong performance as the droll fearless 007.<br/><br/>There's also wonderful support from Ralph Fiennes, as the new Intelligence Chairman, Ben Whishaw as Q, Albert Finney as the caretaker Kincade, and Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny.<br/><br/>I found the film to be filled with humor and the special effects terrific. The movie is also very capably directed by the accomplished British director Sam Mendes.<br/><br/>Perhaps, my only criticism would be the grand finale which I felt was somewhat drawn out and could have shortened the 2 hour 23 minute duration.<br/><br/>I was surprised at the very negative reviews on the first page of IMDb. I found, overall, this new Bond film to be a powerhouse and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"kumar_amit-517-866321","3","1543","2537","31 October 2012"," So so so bad. Critics need replacing
","My 1st review! I was so disgusted with this film&annoyed critics praised it I cracked and had a rant. <br/><br/>Numerous Plot holes, contrivances, poor storytelling, character logic&motivation;<br/><br/>1. The stolen agent list macguffin; Made famous in M:I then overused in films&TV shows; CharliesAngels2 etc - halfway through the film they just forgot about it<br/><br/>2. Hacking magic! Hacking can be done well; goldeneye,swordfish,diehard4...Not just an easy contrived plot device. Can we have a proper explanation &the rules&limitations of Silva's hacking ability in this fiction? For all I know Silva can make satellites fall on people.<br/><br/>3. The irony of the 'can Bond operate in an internet world' theme...he failed twice and got M killed...so he can't? <br/><br/>4. How out of place the above theme is; Bond is mature but always current. His a walking encyclopedia (watch the start of any Connery/Moore film). In the last 2 films he was using advanced mobile phone tracking systems...adding hacking does not suddenly make Bond take on the 'modern' age. Are economics or funding civilwars outdated?<br/><br/>There was hacking&computers in 1995's Goldeneye..all of a sudden, NOW, there are no more shadows? Did MI6 stop evolving in the late eighties?<br/><br/>5.They have a meeting to discuss MI6? This was relevant in Batman, a vigilante was trying to inspire people- It was intertwined in the narrative&theme. Skyfall enquiry was just Sam Mendes ripping off Batman<br/><br/>6. Silva's planned capture; Another overused device that was coincidently in Batman. So what did Silva achieve? A conversation with M? When this is revealed shouldn't we look back and have everything make sense? But, NO, I was left wondering why they tried to kill Bond twice in China.<br/><br/>7. Why was a hacker in a cell controlled by a computer? Why is Q so stupid he plugged in the laptop to the building? Why was the trap door on the inside of the first glass door? why was there a trap door? How did Silva evade an armed MI6 guard 20 meters from his cell?<br/><br/>8. Super calculating (hack crazy)Silva's plan at the end was a firefight? With a backup plan of another firefight?<br/><br/>9. So they figured out Silva was dressed as a cop and no-one told anyone? The irony of M defending herself (reading a poem) knowing her own ex agent was about to shoot up the place was lost on critics&writers alike.<br/><br/>10. Could Bond not take a Sim free phone or'radio' &call backup when Silva arrived at the end? Instead they had their Home Alone moment- even Macaulay Culkin eventually called the police<br/><br/>11. Silva is supposed to mirror Bond. But compare Bond's 'betrayal' to Silva being handed over for torture... Some forced connection is made considering they never met before. Silva tells a story of 2rats so we know what we are supposed to think.<br/><br/>12. Bond's betrayal is M ordering Naomi to take a risky shot. Bond later tell's M he heard the order... why didn't he get out the way then? he just kept fighting like an idiot. &did Naomi only have 1 bullet?<br/><br/>13.You can't make Bond survive 2 gun shots and a fall like that. His already an established character. The Punisher&Bourne are special BECAUSE they survive. It can't happen to them again mid film/ mid franchise.. <br/><br/>14. Bond follows an assassin&lets him kill innocent people! How is this in his character?! The previous 2 films already rebooted Bond to show WHY he doesn't let innocents die.<br/><br/>15. Naomi is a forced character..appearing randomly to remind us she still exists so we can think it's 'clever' when she becomes Moneypenny. Money penny gets demoted from field agent to secretary?!! not even analyst. If she is that hopeless why is she on the most important mission ever? I think Sam Mendes hates women. <br/><br/>16. Bond doesn't even blink when the girl he just bedded a few hours ago gets shot in cold blood. He identifies Severine as being sex trafficked&abused- He then just jumps in her shower. I had little problem with Bond tricking a woman into bed in live and let die- but the sky-fall scene should land him in the S-offenders list. <br/><br/>17.They traced the shrapnel in Bond's chest to a 'special'bullet that only 3 people use? His a 'ghost'...but we have his full flight manifesto. This is how they advanced the plot? wait a minute....didn't that bad guy shoot up half of turkey..? A contrivance& a plot hole in one plot device, that takes some doing.<br/><br/>18. One minute he can't shoot...10 seconds later he shoots everyone in a 360 arc? so what happened? oh we are just abandoning that theme mid- se.. <br/><br/>19. Quite a few instances of Bond just standing in front of a landscape shot with his legs apart 'being deep'. I thought he was urinating at first. <br/><br/>20. Q is both a quartermaster&a programmer for the sake of the illogical theme.. but these are completely different skill sets...?<br/><br/>21. Knowing all this...what is the list doing in Turkey? on a laptop hardrive? why are only 2-3 agents on the case? They couldn't even do the liberty of making something up for the audience. Imagine Thunderball didn't show how SPECTRE got the nukes...<br/><br/>Why couldn't Silva just hack the list? Oh because it isn't connected to the internet you say...but the MI6 heating system is?<br/><br/>The script makes no sense, the themes are inappropriate, Bond's character&decision making has been altered &they have confused mature with dinosaur. Die another Day was almost a Bond parody, but this one is simply a mess,&a betrayal of Bond.<br/><br/>Shame on critics too impatient to appreciate QoS for not spoon feeding them everything & praising sky-fall because of poorly scattered themes& metaphors on a plot that makes no sense, just because it makes them feel clever"
"ChiSox3514","8","58","84","23 December 2012"," Back on the Bond Bandwagon
","As a lifelong James Bond enthusiast who has been extremely disappointed with the franchise's latest efforts (with the exception of Casino Royale), I was extremely pleased with this film. It strayed away from the storyline of the previous two films and I couldn't have been happier after the mediocrity of Quantum of Solace. This film has all the constituents from the Bond films that have preceded it. Big explosions, ridiculous stunts that not a single person in the history of humanity can survive, and let's not forget to mention the beautiful women that would make both genders stop and stare. So what does Skyfall have that the other Bond films don't? For the first time, we get a glimpse into our mysterious hero's dark past. Where he came from and what made him the person he is today. <br/><br/>Although I've always been the one to say that Sean Connery is the greatest Bond ever, I can now confess that Daniel Craig now holds that honor. Sean plays the comedic, smooth, and witty Bond to perfection while Daniel plays the mysterious, dark, and lonesome secret agent flawlessly. I will always choose a darker portrayal over a comedic one because it takes a certain mindset to depict someone of that nature. One of my favorite scenes is where Bond is sitting in a bar drinking alone. I don't care who you are or what your background is, if you are drinking by yourself in a bar, then you have issues that are haunting you. Whether you can admit it or not, you are in a dark place and that is exactly where this Daniel Craig portrayed Bond is. And I love it.<br/><br/>Aside from Daniel Craig, you have a cast that includes some of the finest actors that have ever graced the big screen. Javier Bardem plays a blood thirsty ex-MI6 agent out for revenge. His performance is equally as creepy and twisted as his portrayal of Anton Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men"" and it is an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Judi Dench reprises her role as M and Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney give important and memorable roles which I won't go further into detail about. Also two prominent figures from James bond history find their way back into the story line. Sam Mendes shows why he was the right choice to direct a film of this magnitude and along with the contribution of Oscar Nominee John Logan, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade come up with a memorable narrative after the disappointment of their last collaborating effort, Quantum of Solace. <br/><br/>I look forward to what the future has in store for everyone's favorite spy. If Skyfall is a sign of things to come, then I will remain incredibly optimistic about the future."
"cosmo_tiger","9","193","302","5 February 2013"," For a life long Bond fan this is just about the best movie in the series. Has the feel of a classic Bond movie. LOVED it. I say A
","""He knows us. He's one of us. He comes from the same place as Bond, a place you say doesn't exist, the shadows."" The world's greatest secret agent is back, but is the need for an agent outdated in today's modern world? After MI-6 is attacked and M (Dench) is brought under scrutiny by the government Bond (Craig) alone is left to find out who is behind the attack while M is trying to both help Bond and defend the need for an agency that has been compromised. I know that a review is really not needed here, being the 23rd Bond movie either you will watch it or not. I am a huge fan of the series and was really looking forward to this after hearing this is the best Bond movie yet. I have really loved the Craig movies but for some reason they never had the feel of a Bond movie to me, I wasn't sure what was missing but they didn't have the same feel. Knowing that they were re-booting the series I was lenient and with this one the re-boot is complete. This had much more of a feel of a classic Bond movie and by the end I was excited to see the next one. I got chills watching a few times and especially at the end. This had possibly the best opening and ending to a Bond movie ever. I could go on and on about this but I will just say if you love Bond you will love this, if you have never seen one then this one will make you a fan. Overall, From Russia With Love is my favorite Bond movie but this a very close second, and I think may be more re-watchable. I wanted to watch this one again as soon as the movie was over. I give this a very high A."
"steviorussell","5","657","1078","1 November 2012"," So Disappointed
","I should preface this by saying that I absolutely loved QoS (more than most)and Casino Royale. I'll start from the top.<br/><br/>The Opening Credits: <br/><br/>Visually the opening sequence was absolutely brilliant. Perhaps the best yet. However the Adele song choice was a poor one in my opinion. It's pap. Neither sexy (Goldeneye, Goldfinger) nor adrenaline pumping (Casino Royale, QoS). Sure the girl can sing... but so can Madonna.<br/><br/>Friendly Fire: <br/><br/>He gets shot with an assault rifle, falls 100+ feet and ends up at the bottom of a 50ft+ waterfall. Of course Bond doesn't need to be realistic but let's at least have a far-fetched explanation for his survival please. A small Turkish boy with a first aid kit who happened to be fishing at the bottom of the waterfall. Anything!<br/><br/>Macau: <br/><br/>Why no proper shots of Macau? Even just a decent panned intro. It's such a perfect setting for bond scenes.<br/><br/>The Komodo Dragon Killing:<br/><br/>No need for an Attenborough lecture. As convincing as fanged unicorns. <br/><br/>The Bond Girl:<br/><br/>A sex slave who very quickly gets shot. What a big letdown after Casino Royale and QoS. <br/><br/>The London Feel <br/><br/>The film had very real shots of an overcast and murky looking London and the whole film felt inherently British. Really nice.<br/><br/>'Silva': <br/><br/>I'm all for a fruity bond villain but what an anti-climax. Great intro, cool teeth but otherwise fairly bland. Certainly no Ernst Blofield or 'Leshiffre'. <br/><br/>Weak Plot: <br/><br/>The biggest failing of this film was the plot. It went from a mission to recover a stolen hard-drive to a mission to protect an old dear (who could've easily been killed several times). As for the motive, fairly tenuous and uninteresting: <br/><br/>Blondie signed up for the Mi6 many years back, M sent him on a mission, things go wrong on the mission, Blondie gets captured (we don't get shown any of this) and years later Blondie feels as though he wants to kill an older, moodier and fairly unendearing M. <br/><br/>The House Siege: <br/><br/>This was cool. Easily on par with scenes from Shooter and The Bourne Identity (tall order). <br/><br/>The Chapel: <br/><br/>Be honest. When Silva walks into the chapel were you thinking:<br/><br/>'Please don't shoot moody old M!'<br/><br/>Or were you thinking:<br/><br/>'NOOOOOOO! Please don't shoot the cool old guy with a sawn-off shotgun who's been giving Bond some lip! He's the only new face that's been given a proper character!' <br/><br/>As for the axe to the back - not exactly bond-like. <br/><br/>Conclusion: <br/><br/>Ingredients for an epic film. But an extremely weak plot and an undeveloped villain made it difficult to care about the final outcome."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","87","134","5 December 2012"," How safe do you feel?
","Bond 23 and 007 has to literally come back from the dead when a stolen hard-drive makes M (Dench) look bad at a time when a face from her past comes homing into blood thirsty view.<br/><br/>There is one sure fire fact in cinema that nobody can dispute, that of there never ever being a James Bond film that all Bondphiles will agree on. From each corner of the spectrum will come arguments that said Bond film is not gritty enough, not fun enough, not enough sex, not enough action, not enough fantastical stunts and etc etc etc. Well that's fine of course, we all have our peccadilloes we prefer in our Bond movies, but we do live in different times now, the world has changed, and so has Bond. You may not get the ultimate Bond you want, but this is a 21st Century Bond and a new era of 007 is upon us, something which makes Skyfall even the more bolder and braver because it marks the 50th anniversary by blending the old with the new and mostly achieving brilliant results.<br/><br/>Skyfall allows us to bathe in nostalgia whilst also forcing us to re- evaluate just where we are at in terms of our beloved super secret agent. One of the great things about this Bond is that there is a bubbling under current of time's importance delicately perched on each side of James Bond's shoulders. Is he (and M etc) outdated? Or is the future still in need of such operatives/organisations? Director Mendes and his team don't take any of the easy options that were clearly available to them to answer the question, they instead build a film around Bond and M as characters, embrace the traditions of the series and hit us hard in head and heart.<br/><br/>The plot of Skyfall as written is simple, absolutely nailed on it is straight and true to Hollywood conventions, but what fills out the simple plot is a series of Bondian delights, thrills spills and emotionally splintered kills. The stunning pre-credits sequence sees Bond traverse the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle and then fight on top of a speeding train. Only to then find himself expendable. Which leads to Daniel Kleinman's title credits sequence that is filled with ominous portents of death and blood, in turn backed by the wonderfully Bondian of old title song warbled by Adele. It's clear at this point that this Bond movie is nodding to traditional values whilst promising to deliver some emotional pain. And so it proves.<br/><br/>A washed up Bond enters the fray, and he convinces, he's dishevelled, unshaven and unfit, but he's still a tough bastard who can drink hard and stare a scorpion down. He'll be back soon, we know this, and he will be in wonderful physical shape, and loyal to his surrogate mother for sure. Ah, but there's the adversary on the scene now, a villain to finally give Craig's Bond something to fret about. It's Javier Bardem's (perfect) Silva, a cyber terrorist with a shock of blonde hair, a nasty dental trick and a devilish sexiness that unnerves during an interrogation scene; to which Bond cheekily opens up some wink wink possibilities. There is other sexual tension in the film as well, not just a steamy shower scene, but the ongoing banter with Naomie Harris' (excellent) Eve that positively fizzes with smirking innuendo.<br/><br/>But ultimately this comes down to the love between a man and a woman, the kind that is so different to the type that has so often underpinned a Bond movie. Bond will kill or be killed for M, and how marvellous to see a director really able to give Judi Dench the direction she so deserves, and Bond, in Craig's magnetic and gritty hands, responds in kind to deliver a last half hour as good as any in the 50 years of Bond on film. As we know, all turf is Bond's turf, but this time it really is HIS turf, and as a little back story comes seeping out, Bond gets to exorcise some demons whilst kicking considerable ass. Get ready Bondphiles, this has the emotional wallop only seen in the best Bond movies of old.<br/><br/>All the Bondian trappings are still here, exotic locales, gorgeous women, speeding vehicles, fights, stupendous stunts, bizarre lairs and balls out machismo. It's also funny! I myself commented when reviewing Quantum of Solace that it was pretty ace as an action film, but for many it's not Bondian enough, and the truth of the matter is Bond still needs to have a degree of fun, no matter how grim and gritty the story line is. Thankfully Skyfall is often a blast, with Craig (surely convincing even the most stubborn of dissenters how good a Bond he is) having the confidence and skill to lace his Bond's macho broody instinct with a desert dry wit and shrug of the shoulders nonchalance. Other side of the camera the tech credits are high, with Deakins proving to be one of the aces in the pack. His capturing of vistas, be it a neon city scape or a mountainous valley, are eye delights, his colour tones are beautiful, I promise you, nobody these days does golden browns like Deakins.<br/><br/>It's not the masterpiece that I or gazillions of others hoped for, and it does have flaws (new Q a bit too geeky safe, finale lacks a substantial battle with the villain) and it remains simple in plot, but it's Bond's birthday and the birthday boy has been done proud by the makers. It's a new era Bond for sure, but that most definitely isn't a bad thing, it knows its past and it now knows its future, and without doubt we all still know the name. 9/10"
"will-338-33056","4","549","934","1 November 2012"," Weak plot and boring!
","There were so many problems with the film that I felt let down. I feel that Casino Royale was the best film to date; Skyfall was just a disappointment.<br/><br/>The first 10 minutes or so were great, Bond's on a mission and there are some memorable scenes (digger coupling the trains), but there are major plot-holes. When Bond is fighting on top of the train for the hard- drive, Eve says that she has a shot. <br/><br/>Bond can hear the whole conversation between Eve and M, so why doesn't he get out of the way (or at least co-operate to provide an easy shot)?! M mentions that the choice was either possible success (taking the shot) or guaranteed failure (leaving Bond to fight). You'd have more chance with a TOP MI6 AGENT than a risky shot.<br/><br/>I must be missing something, because QOS shows Bond finishing his FIRST assignment, where Skyfall shows him to be old, out of shape, and at the end of his career; there's a MASSIVE gap between the two films. It's almost as if the last two films and the reboot have been ignored.<br/><br/>The Aston Martin from Goldfinger, Q's mentioning of the exploding pen (Goldeneye), and the appearance of Q (In the previous two films, Bond has not met Q) seem to make it clear that CR and QOS have been forgotten, and so Skyfall was used purely for a ""50 year special"", looking back at the previous bonds.<br/><br/>When Bond leaves a trail leading to his house, why on earth wouldn't he call back up to meet him there? If you have the Head of MI6 under protection, you would need some actual protection - the plot makes no sense!<br/><br/>Why did Silva want to get captured? He just escapes! If he wanted to kill M, he could have done that with the explosion in her office (with a delay), so what purpose did his capture possess? None!<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointment with Skyfall; possibly the worst Bond film to date. I expect more from Bond, and I hope that the next film forgets Skyfall!"
"jmoney-2","9","253","432","10 November 2012"," Familiar, yet original
","For a film that happens to be the 23rd installment in a movie franchise, the latest James Bond thriller, Skyfall, is surprisingly original. Though it marks the series' 50th anniversary by paying homage to many of the previous movies, Daniel Craig's third outing as 007 is unlike any Bond movie we've seen before.<br/><br/>The surprises start early. At the end of an opening action sequence that may be the most elaborate ever (it's actually three or four action sequences rolled into one), we are hit with an unexpected twist that puts Her Majesty's top secret agent out of action. While he's sidelined, a terrorist begins targeting MI6 and its covert agents. Bond must struggle to get back in the game so he can set out to uncover who's behind the plot.<br/><br/>What follows is a movie that turns the Bond formula inside-out. While there is an element of globetrotting, and exotic locales are definitely featured, much of the movie actually takes place in the U.K. That's just one of the ways this Bond movie zigs where most others have zagged. And, without giving too much away, the movie's finale is set-up as an almost mirror image of all those we've seen before.<br/><br/>This is also a film that takes place in the real world. Buildings still blow up (it is a Bond movie after all). But when they do, we quickly see Wolf Blitzer reporting the explosion on CNN as breaking news. In this version of the Bond Universe, when things go wrong, M is called to testify before a committee hearing.<br/><br/>The more plausible setting fits with Craig's take on the classic character. In his first two Bond films, he presented the secret agent as a real flesh and blood human being. You can believe this guy really exists. This time out, he takes that characterization even further. Not only do we get to see him made weakened and addled by the physical rigors of his job, but we also dig deeper into his back-story than ever before. If Casino Royale began a reboot of the series, then Skyfall completes the Bond ""origin story"". In this movie, we learn more about who Bond is and how he came to be the man he is today, than we did in all the previous 50 years of 007 flicks.<br/><br/>Of course, most Bond movies are only as good as their villain, and Javier Bardem's Silva may not be simply the best Bond villain ever, he may rank pretty high on the all-time movie bad guy list, too. Bardem simply outdoes himself as an evil mastermind bent not on world domination, but rather, revenge. With Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes as a guide, the scenes between Craig and Bardem are engrossing to watch. It gives us something else we haven't really seen before in a Bond movie: two great actors going head-to-head.<br/><br/>There are also Bond girls, naturally. Naomi Harris livens things up as a spunky field agent. And the gorgeous Berenice Marlohe plays the obligatory woman-with-a-tragic-past. But the real female lead this time is Judi Dench's M. She is in many ways front and center in a story that deals with loyalty, principles and the moral ambiguities of national defense in the terrorist age. In a non-romantic way, she is also Bond's true love interest this time around.<br/><br/>Skyfall looks back on the first 50 years of Bond, then shows him to us again in a new light and sets him up nicely for his next 50 years. As they always say in the closing credits, ""James Bond Will Return""."

A Bond movie with a 1982 touch of a mortal movie---it's a cocktail and it may work :) Casting song with it's graphics is ausum- Adele has put a real soul in it....you can watch the movie only for that All in all, in spite of it's cons...this movie will go down as something...people can hate it, people can go crazy over it, people can say it's garbage, people can absolutely love it: it depends on their relationship and understanding of Bond Don't watch it for being greatest Bond movie ever, don't watch it for being a competitor to Dark Knight; watch it for being Skyfall"

","It has been a long ride for the Bond series, since the creation of the character there have been 15 novels by Ian Fleming, plenty of spin-off novels, comics, cartoons and video games and the film series is now 50 years old. There have been an extraordinary 23 official films, but few as extraordinary as Skyfall.<br/><br/>After a mission goes wrong in Istanbul, MI6 loses a hard drive containing a list of all NATO agents within terrorist cells, and James Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed Killed in Action. M's (Judi Dench) competence is questioned and the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) plans to replace her. Making matters worse, a cyber-terrorist targets MI6 and M personally, getting a hold of the list and causing an explosion within MI6's headquarters. An older, more damaged Bond then returns to duty to serve Queen and Country, having to prove he is in shape before going on the search to find the terrorist.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a long-awaited film thanks to MGM's financial woes, but it delivers. Skyfall takes a darker approach as we've seen with the past couple films and it's very character driven, yet Sam Mendes and the screenwriters still provide a massive injection of fun. Like most Bond films, Skyfall starts with an incredible chase sequence in Istanbul and continues strongly from then on, including a very stylish silhouette fight in Shanghai. The action scenes sequences were pristinely shot and practical effects were at the forefront.<br/><br/>A challenge for the Bond series has always been real-world relevance. The series has faced down all challenges, from the end of the Cold War to the War on Terror. Skyfall tackles the changing nature of espionage. MI6 is no longer the shadowy organisation that the British government denied existed; it has to face the realities of the 24-hour media age we live in and the democratic accountability that incurs.<br/><br/>The nature of the threats have changed, Bond faces a cyber-terrorist and along with the new Q, both could cause more damage than Bond can. In the real world, we have seen what Anonymous is capable of and seen how the Stuxnet worm affected the Iranian nuclear program. But there is always a need for people in the field to investigate. As M says, she is scared of this new world because many of the West's enemies are now faceless and nationless, and this element can work in the series' favour. Versatility has always been a Bond hallmark, which is why it is so enduring.<br/><br/>Skyfall also goes full circle for Bond, as the filmmakers reintroduce popular characters, gadgets and humour. In Casino Royale, Bond is a young man who is bold, arrogant and reckless but can get the job done; in Skyfall, Craig is playing an older Bond who is both physically and emotionally vulnerable.<br/><br/>The idea of an older Bond was briefly touched on in the unofficial film Never Say Never Again, but that was more to accommodate a 52-year-old Sean Connery being in the role. In Skyfall there is actual thematic reasons behind it. Craig gives another excellent performance, cementing his reputation as both a great actor and a great Bond, and the script treats him more as a character than an archetype. Along with M's character arch, the film tackles a theme of facing the past so it can be cleansed.<br/><br/>The casting of Javier Bardem was a coup for the series and we as Bond fans are rewarded with a great villain. Bardem makes out Raoul Silva to be a man with seemingly camp mannerisms, but the master planner has a very sinister delivery. He has a complex, tragic background but he is not like other Bond villains looking for control, world domination, money or even self-preservation: he simply wants revenge.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a great milestone to celebrate Bond's 50th birthday on film, and the Easter eggs for fans aren't overbearing, but rather nice touches. The last anniversary Bond film, Die Another Day, was a disaster and regarded as one of the worst Bond films. It felt like it had to keep referencing the previous films. Skyfall features a few major references to previous Bond films: Bond getting injured (The World is Not Enough), Bond faking his death (You Only Live Twice), the gun that can only work with Bond's palm print (Licence to Kill) and a similar villain to the one in Goldeneye. But these are references you would want to find, not being forced upon you.<br/><br/>Skyfall felt very much like end of one chapter and the start of a new one. Mendes and the writers were able to reintroduce many tropes of the Bond series and still give them a modern and believable twist. For a film that has a 143-minute running time (the second longest Bond film), Skyfall never felt like it dragged and it was an exciting, entertaining film.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"

","""Skyfall"" is loaded with jaw-dropping awesome stunts and special effects, one of the most beautiful and tragic Bond girls ever--the stunning Bérénice Marlohe, and a brilliant theme song from the fabulously talented Adele and producer Paul Epworth lushly orchestrated by J.A.C. Redford. There is sizzling homo erotic tension between Daniel Craig's perfect Bond and Javier Bardem's Silva, a villain the likes of which have never been seen in this franchise. Dame Judi Dench's marvelous ""M"" is set up for retirement from the onset of the film. Dench, who has portrayed M for seven Bond films--a record- -is given the screen time she deserves to honor her character. While Craig's ""Casino Royale"" remains my favorite with its bloody and raw portrayal of the spy business and most tender Bond romance since ""On Her Magesty's Secret Service,"" ""Skyfall"" is full and satisfying and among the best films of its kind released this season."
"xbrad68","10","53","86","11 November 2012"," Roger Ebert gave Bond 4 stars and I do as well
","Skyfall is a special James Bond Movie. Suddenly there was a 964 Astin Martin and Bond said ""we're going back in time"" to M, thats very neat. The story line has a car chase near the beginning, Bonds obituary shown in the trailer so no spoiler intended. There is Bonds road to recovery and testing. Bond thinks he passed by the skin of his teeth. The Villain brags that bond failed all of the tests, range, psychological, medical other. The bottom line is that the head of British Intelligence saw Bond as fit for the field. The screenplay is very good. One of my James Bond short stories was called Golden train with a fight on the top of a train tunnel and a sniper aiming at the train written in 2010. Commander James Bond celebrate 50 years of the Bond movie franchise with style the most successful movie franchise ever."
"xeroqube","1","447","821","7 November 2012"," A Truly Awful Movie.
","One of the worst films I have ever seen. Every single scene was flawed and had errors. From beginning to end the movie had mistake after mistake. Now most movies have one or two mistakes and you just over look it but when it happens in every scene of the movie, you can't just wave it to one side.<br/><br/>For example, when Bond leaves the London underground and starts running to save M. Here we have TWO errors. Firstly, M does not do MP's committee meetings and secondly, why does Bond run half way across London to get to her? Why not stop one of the police officer's to either drive him or to give him the car? There are so many errors, like I already said in EVERY single scene of the movie.<br/><br/>Few others that I still remember are such as the opening scene, why does Eve who just mistakenly shot Bond with an automatic rifle not then open fire on the bad guy? How did Bond even survive such a drop? How did he end up in the arms of a beautiful woman on a beach? How did Eve even miss shooting him jumping on the train earlier? Why did the bad guy who had an automatic pistol and had Bond pinned down behind a wooden market stall decide to jump on a motorbike rather than to kill him? Why did the police bikers even drive straight towards a man firing a weapon? How did Eve even turn up with a vehicle just as Bond left the building? So many errors and so many gaps and that's just the first 8 minutes! I can go on and on and on. EVERY scene had massive errors, Even the Aston Martin DB5 scene, how comes Bond has it? Why would he even run away with M and get her killed? Are the SAS on strike? How did Bond leave the casino in Macau after killing 3 bodyguards? Does a large casino only have 3 security guards? Why even would they fight? Surely they would have just shot him as soon as he enters the casino? Javier Bardem's baddie character was ridiculous and comical. It was totally unbelievable, even an 8 year old wouldn't believe the storyline. Poor acting and the camp/gay innuendos were painful to watch. I couldn't believe what I was watching.<br/><br/>This was an appalling movie. It relied on Judi Dench to hold it all together. Sadly I am not able to give it a 0 so I will give it 1/10. No action in the movie what so ever after the opening scene. Two men hugging on top of a train has been done so many times. Pathetic movie and the only people who will enjoy this are the brain dead. Shame on critics who were saying this was the best Bond movie ever, you should be ashamed of yourselves.<br/><br/>I used to like Daniel Craig as Bond but thanks to this movie I now dislike him too. Well done to Sam Mendes and Co, it takes a certain amount of talent or the lack of it to single handedly destroy Bond. The hero in this movie was the final credits, the real baddie in this movie was the man behind the camera."
"aristonltd","4","472","872","31 October 2012"," Boring
","I thought Skyfall was awful. Worst of all it was just boring, something I would never think I would say about any Bond film.<br/><br/>The movie starts off well enough, a good chase scene in an exotic location and it sets itself up for what could have been a good story. The trouble is after the first 15 mins the story seems to go nowhere.<br/><br/>MI6 is in trouble, a list of its agents goes missing and has to be recovered. Bond who everyone thought was dead comes back to save the day. All good so far. Now for some very thin reason Bond has to go to Shanghai. I wonder if this scene was added to boost box office figures in China because it was totally irrelevant to the story. Next scene Bond meets the 'baddie'. Not some master criminal but an ex MI6 agent out for some revenge. This plot had already been covered in Goldeneye with much better results. The Baddie looked more likely to Blow Bond than Blow up MI6 and there was even a joke along that line.<br/><br/>The story now moves to London. I applaud the decision to have a Bond movie in the UK, especially in the Jubilee/Olympic/50 year Bond year but frankly it just painted England like every foreigners stereotype. Cold, Wet, and miserable. Now it is about a plot to kill M, this has also been covered before in 'The World is not Enough' and the movie never returns to locating the missing list of agents.<br/><br/>Why didn't the bad guy just kill M at the beginning of the movie and spare me sitting through 2 hours of boredom? I gave this film 4/10 because it has an unexpected twist at the end that the production team have managed not to leek prior to release. If it were not for that then Id probably have given it only 3/10.<br/><br/>Craig is now showing his age and in my opinion there are many better suited actors to the part. People moaned about QOS but frankly this movie is the worst Bond film ever."
"FSfilmblog","8","65","108","2 February 2013"," A Bond for a new era
","A James Bond film made for the modern era, you'd be hard pressed to find any other film series able to stand the test of time and still feel relevant. When it looks like it's lagging behind the competition of the other spy action thrillers, the makers have taken note and re-invented the mould, making it more real and exciting.<br/><br/>To me, Bond had too much of a rigid formula, the cars, the chases, the girls, the gadgets, the megalomaniac villain's and the spectacular set pieces/stunts. After a while though, the older films seem to suffer from a sense of deja vu. It's a case of been there, done that. The structure of the films have become stale and repetitive. Same plot about a group of criminals/organisation hell bent on world domination/destruction, with a beautiful bond girl in tow, Bond and or Bond girl gets capture, ridiculous car chase or stunts with a million of cheesy one liners. Frankly, I had pretty much given up on the Bond films. They have become predictable and tedious with only the change of location to give the film any sort of distinction.<br/><br/>The plot of Skyfall is unlike previous Bond films, starts with the routine chase resulting in Bond being shot and wounded, believed to be dead by MI6. When an attack on MI6 headquarters manifest through a cyber attack and a bombing at the headquarters, Bond returns to uncover who is behind the assault. Struggling from his gun shot wound, Bond has to prove his fitness mentally and physically through some rigorous tests. Sent back into action without being fully fit, Bond embarks on the mission to expose the mastermind. What Bond discovers is a villain who happens to be ex-agent who has a vendetta against M and will stop at nothing to kill her.<br/><br/>First thing you'll notice is the lack of gadgets and the usually bond girl (there is one of sorts but you'll understand when you watch it). Also with a villain who is suave yet as equally menacing as Hannibal Lector, we have a loose cannon who isn't after the world but revenge. It's spy vs spy and the story is more of a evolution of the characters that inhabit the world of Bond. Nods to older Bond films crop up from dialogue, props and even the classic Austin Martin car makes an appearance. It's a homage as well as a resurrection of well known characters.<br/><br/>What we are given here is a Bond with more layers to him and more emotions. Daniel Craig has moulded a Bond who is more relateable. Signs of physical and emotional weakness shows us a Bond who is no longer a super spy with little or no vulnerability. Other characters are given more screen time and provide an emotion gravitas (We are also introduced to Q, a young model who is still wet behind the ears).<br/><br/>In the hands of Sam Mendes and Director of photography Roger Deakins, there has never been a more beautiful shot Bond film. During Bond's fight with a criminal minion we see only their silhouettes, but the eye is drawn to the beauty of the neon Shanghai backdrop. The reserve can be said for the grime, dour and rainy streets of London which captures our the United Kingdom perfectly.<br/><br/>It's a satisfying and enjoyable film, with plenty of action and a surprising emotional core to the narrative. A great development in characters with seeds being sown to allow for a more relateable and mature story telling and for future characters to come to the fore. Skyfall has made me fall in love with Bond films again so here's hoping there's no more rigid formula and routine mundane narratives of past."
"c_tisseyre-107-838331","9","475","891","27 October 2012"," A Thrilling, Fun and Beautiful Film. A True Resurrection.
","It's the Bond film we've all been waiting for. After the stunning reinvention of Casino Royale and the misstep that followed with Quantum of Solace, Skyfall feels like a true resurrection of the character and the Bond universe, and an incredible addition to the storied franchise. From its spectacular opening scene in Istanbul to its sensational climax in the Scottish Highlands, the film grabs hold of the audience and never lets go.<br/><br/>With the great Sam Mendes at the helm, Skyfall is propelled by a veritable narrative purpose. Mendes values story and character over anything, and he gets Bond. His action sequences are thrilling, artfully directed, and a joy to watch. He directs with finesse and nuance the powerful character-driven scenes. He understands the soul and essence of Bond and respects the spirit of the franchise but also breaks new ground with the treatment of the story.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the script tells a moving, thematically resonant and intelligent story, and features superbly written scenes. It is more focused than Quantum of Solace, which felt oddly disjointed at times. Writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan elegantly balance humorous moments with truly dramatic ones while never straying from the emotional heart of the film. Best of all, they further develop Casino Royale's brilliant idea of delving into Bond's vulnerability and the result is a fascinating and flawed character. The human and moral stakes are high and much more personal this time around. The audience feels emotionally invested in the story. In the end, the film is a reflection on aging and on not only why the world needs Bond but also why he must and will endure.<br/><br/>Visually, Skyfall is a true wonder. Roger Deakins' cinematography is aesthetically magnificent and serves the story well. Deakins shoots Istanbul, London, Macau, Shanghai and the Scottish Highlands in a tasteful, artistic and original manner. It is by far the most beautifully shot Bond I have ever seen. Thomas Newman's score is terrific and rich, cleverly using the classic Bond theme in new and interesting ways and incorporating Adele's already-classic theme to create a memorable piece of music.<br/><br/>Finally, the cast all deliver fine performances. Daniel Craig gives a thoughtful, moving and nuanced performance, which constitutes his strongest interpretation of the character to date. Judi Dench offers a much more intimate and personal take on M. Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe are memorable. And what to say of Javier Bardem, who steals every scene he appears in? He is funny, unpredictable, frightening and most interestingly, tragic. A fantastic Bond villain.<br/><br/>If you had any reservation about seeing this film after the lacklustre Quantum of Solace, fear no more. Skyfall redeems faults of the past and is one of the best films of the year. It hits all the right notes. Sam Mendes has infused Bond with a deft sense of fun, pathos and class.<br/><br/>It's a great time at the movies."
"anders-rock","9","397","743","25 October 2012"," Wow!
","This is one of the best Bond movies I have ever seen. The story is superbly put together and has some interesting twists, the action is well done and contains none of the shaky cam which plagued the last film. The actors all do a great job. Some might still be put off by Daniel Craig's rough version of Bond, but I like it and he even has a few good old fashioned one-liners here. I wasn't sure about Javier Bardem as the villain at first. I thought he was a tad too flamboyant but eventually he grew on me, plus he had a very interesting backstory and as you might have guessed already, Judi Dench is fantastic as usual as M and she even has more to do in the story this time arround. This is not a completely formulaic Bond movie. Craig's bond is still more emotional than Connery or Moore ever were and for the first time we get some relatively detailed descriptions of his childhood. And something happens to Bond in the start of the movie that affects him for the rest of the film. But despite all that there are tons of James Bond trademarks like the martini, the introduction and even Q. Some might not like this new very young version of Q but I found him to be funny and very likable. They will never top Desmond Llewelyn's original performance, and instead of making a cheap Llewelyn clone, they make a completely different character which I think is the only right thing to do. This is not only a great Bond movie but just a downright great film."
"griffolyon12","10","67","115","8 November 2012"," 50 Years and Still Strong
","It's James Bond's 50th anniversary, and the 23rd Bond film, Skyfall, proves that there's still some bullets left in his Walter PPK. <br/><br/>The plot of Skyfall is simplistic, a hard drive containing the identities of every secret agent embedded in terrorist organizations around the world is stolen, but it's how director Sam Mendes turns the film more so into a chess match than a whodunit, that marks this entry. The flamboyant villain, Silva, is an aggressive mastermind, manipulating the actions of MI6 through cyberterrorism, forcing M, MI6, and Bond to play defense the entire film, trying to keep out of checkmate, and in the end Bond and M retreat to Bond's boyhood home, Skyfall, to try to get Silva to drop his defenses.<br/><br/>The thing about Skyfall, is that it is different than any other Bond film before it. It's a somber experience, almost melancholy. It's not cranked up to 11, it's not a simple bad guy wanting to take over the world story, in so many ways it's a character piece. The biggest action sequence is the Istanbul opening where 007 chases a bad guy across cars, motorcycles, and trains, and the rest of the film gets gradually smaller and smaller in scale, until all that is left are Bond, M, and Silva. It's the way their pasts come back to haunt them that is the spine of Skyfall. <br/><br/>Bond still clings to the death of his parents, M is questioning her past decisions to sacrifice agents when the ends justified the means, and Silva is bitter over M having sacrificed him on a mission long ago, like she does with Bond in the opening. Unlike any other Bond film, it's about the relationships that these characters have with one another that shapes the narrative and the action. Bond's trust in M is tested, leading him down a certain path of action, but then it's reinforced, and then he stops at nothing to protect her from Silva. That is the true brilliance of Skyfall, it doesn't shy away from showing the humanity of these characters, or how their actions have repercussions, but rather it shows how they use those repercussions to carry on and finish the mission.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig proves he is once more a more than capable 007, utilizing a dry sense of humor to deliver lines that Roger Moore would have hammed up. Like he did in Casino Royale, Craig finds a way to make Bond relatable and human to the audience. In the film, James Bond is portrayed as slightly older, having lost his edge, and not necessarily hip with the times where espionage is mostly done by computers and not field work. As a matter of fact, Bond is injured throughout most of the film, not at his physical peak, due to gunshot wounds sustained in the opening. Therefore, he's not really a superhero, but rather a human being who is constantly outmatched throughout the entire film, but as he proves by the end, it's not age or old school methods that define the job, but his commitment to see it through. <br/><br/>As well, Judi Dench delivers her best turn since Goldeneye, Bond girl Naomie Harris really adds some much needed levity at times to keep things from getting too dark, and Ben Whishaw fills Desmond Llewelyn's shoes as Q. The true standout performance though is Javier Bardem as Silva. He's not just creepy or flamboyant, though he is a man whose sexuality is in question, but it's the way that he fully commits to the role that makes every line and action that he performs creepy and flamboyant. His performance has been likened to Heath Ledger's Joker, but I really think Silva is his own messed up breed that Bardem plays so brilliantly, perhaps besting his performance as Anton Chigurgh in No Country For Old Men. Not to mention, the fact that the script really builds up his character, where everyone talks about him in fear, with him manipulating in the shadows for the first half of the film, so that when we finally meet him, we're terrified of him.<br/><br/>All in all, Skyfall is a marvel. Featuring superb action scenes, a traditional Bond theme song supplied by Adele, one of the better scripts ever written for a Bond film where every character has an arc and a purpose in the story, and some of the most stunning cinematography ever shot for an action flick, Skyfall is a home run. Not only that though, it's a great, personal film that is smart, tense, exciting, and surprisingly emotional. It uses the 50 year history of these characters to stir the emotions in the viewer, and in so many ways, if this isn't your first Bond film, you will be even more rewarded for it. But quite simply, the Bond family has outdone themselves here. Skyfall is a true blue James Bond adventure that surpasses nearly every other film in the storied franchise.<br/><br/>I give Skyfall a 10 out of 10!"
"slimsusie","2","261","488","13 November 2012"," No glamour or escapism in this boring Bond movie
","My first review on IMDb, couldn't resist offering some balance to the obvious early march of fanboy reviews! Always been abit of a Bond fan and I was looking forward to being taken away to some exotic locations, to escape for a few hours, and some edge of seat action but these things were missing from Skyfall.<br/><br/>Production standards have slipped terribly on Skyfall with stuntmen clearly visible (motorbike chase)and some of the worst sets I have ever seen. The Skyfall Lodge (Bond's family home) is especially appalling and some people even laughed in the cinema when they pulled up in the old Aston.<br/><br/>The Q character doesn't work at all, not convincing in any way with the fake glasses and daft hair...EON please rethink this for the next movie and also forget the Moneypenny actress because she cannot act, least not in this character anyway.<br/><br/>Some of the SFX were good but the opening chase scene was way to long and instead of building suspense most people just got bored.<br/><br/>The french actress Berenice was superb as was Rory Kinnear, though for me Craig struggled to capture my attention like he did in Casino Royale.<br/><br/>Bardem was underused or poorly directed and never intimidating as a true 'baddie' should be, and why oh why did they dye his hair? it was so so unconvincing.<br/><br/>I have yet to meet anybody who thinks this is a great movie let alone 'the best Bond ever!' I am staggered that some people like this Bond but I guess we are all different! I wonder how these figures are calculated as most of the last few thousand votes have been poor but I am new to IMDb (great site by the way)so maybe it takes awhile for the early enthusiast votes to be corrected by more 'normal' viewings?! And I suppose there will always be the fan element hell bent on 'talking a movie up' whereas someone who has watched a film they dislike generally will just want to forget about it!"
"phd_travel","1","351","666","1 November 2012"," Bond on a budget starring the old folks home
","There are so many things wrong with this movie. Most of the elements of a good Bond movie aren't there.<br/><br/>The locations aren't well used. The Istanbul roof top & Bazaar chase has already been shown in ""Taken 2"" and the TV show ""Missing"". Dejavu. The way they showed 'Shanghai' and 'Macau' at night it could have been filmed anywhere. The Scottish countryside shown was so grim.<br/><br/>Where are the cars and gadgets? Nothing but the old Aston Martin. Just that pistol and tracker. The new Q is so ineffective. <br/><br/>The villain played by Javier Bardem. He is more comical than sinister. With the blond fright wig, the campy overtures and the most frightening of all, the dentures this must the most absurd bad guy in Bond history.<br/><br/>The climax feels cheap and conventional. They must have run out of money for the second half. Such a stupid idea to bring M to that run down Scottish house. With the home made defences and geriatric defenders, it felt like Home Alone meets the Golden Girls. Might as well have asked Betty White or grandma to join in. <br/><br/>The new Bond girl Berenice Marlohe is exotic and fascinating to look at. But why only one? Writing her out of the show so early and not having another was a mistake. The Bond girl is supposed to end up saved by Bond with a hook up at the end. Unless you consider M a Bond girl.<br/><br/>The focus of the movie is M. Judi Dench was always too provincial looking for MI6. The only good thing about this movie is that Ralph Fiennes is replacing her. Finally. There was no need to dedicate a whole movie to her farewell. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig is just so haggard he looks worse than the villain. It's time to replace him with someone younger and handsomer. Baffled by the good reviews. Be warned we are being short changed."
"Ankhenaten91","10","41","68","14 February 2013"," The best Bond in 40+ years
","Let me say that I am am James Bond fan. I have seen all of the movies and multiple times. They have been a part of my youth from seeing For Your Eyes Only in a theater as a little boy and almost every other movie since then the same way. They hold an important place in my familial history as it's a common love of a good number of my clan who may not agree on much but sure love 007.<br/><br/>Skyfall is the single most entertaining Bond movie I have seen in theaters ever. I can say this because as I am 34 I wasn't alive to see the Connery movies and of course they are considered (rightfully in my opinion) to be the gold standard.<br/><br/>The ongoing problem I had with the franchise as a whole was that from my perspective the movies had become dull and boring. They were becoming parodies and Pierce Brosnan has just so smooth and snarky he just didn't fit the bill for what I wanted to see anymore, the issue was that I didn't know what it was I wanted until I saw Casino Royale.<br/><br/>What I got in CR was Daniel Craig as a (dare I say it?!) rebooted Bond. He was newly minted in his double ""0"" status and learning his way through things. But Craig brought a brutality and a menace to Bond, something I'd always wanted because after all he is a KILLER first. I remember hearing the groans when he was hired and how the internet blew-up with scorn and fear and I kept hearing about Layer Cake and how that one movie had gotten him the gig. So, I jumped up and rented the movie and was simply riveted by the performance he gave; cold, calculated and straight-up cool. After that I knew that I was interested to see what they did and boy I was happy with the outcome.<br/><br/>Skyfall sees Bond as a well footed and established agent, he isn't learning the ropes now, he's maybe now a bit long in the tooth for a field agent and coming to grips with what he and others wonder if he can do it much longer. It is this sense of humanity that I love so much about the movie. Bond is shot in the first 10-15 minutes and thought dead. He comes back to MI6 when Silva (Bardem) attacks and threatens the lives of M (Dench) and deep cover agents true identities around the world (typical Bond plot so far right?). The kicker here is that Bond is weakened and unfit for active duty but it is his resolve and intensity that is called for to save the day.<br/><br/>To say that Craig is my favorite modern Bond is pretty obvious, he is amazing in a modern age in a franchise that has embraced a more realistic approach (no invisible cars here). It is Javier Bardem's Silva who is the truly remarkable performance here and needs to be seen to be appreciated. My thoughts on the matter are this: Silva is Bond's Joker in that he is the perfect mirror image of him. A former agent himself and just as cold blooded he is a true menace and a match both physically and mentally for Bond. Not sense Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight have I been this entertained by a villain. It should be noted that this is the first post-Dark Knight Bond movie and I think it shows in the writing and in the execution. We like seeing our hero's struggle with their own mortality and the days of capturing spacecraft with another spacecraft to try to start WWIII are over. This is a Bond movie that knows the history of the franchise and respects it but is throughly modern in it's approach.<br/><br/>Some will say the movie lacks action, and while I don't feel it misses it I can see why they say it does. This isn't a ton of car chases or gadgets and crazy evil plan movie that people have become accustomed to and for that I think it's the reason so many are turned-off to it. It's more human and for the first time in any of the Bond movies makes James and M actual people. There is history here and there is a soul and that is the most compelling part of the movie.<br/><br/>In summation this is the first Bond movie that isn't a traditional Bond movie. This could have been a stand alone film and stood up just as well without the connotation or expectation of what a Bond movie is. Sam Mendes should be commended for strong direction and for making this better than a Bond movie 10/10."
"majd_selbi","7","271","515","30 October 2012"," Bold and original, but not the best of Craig's 007s
","MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>Sam Mendes's take on 007 is a remarkably well done film, both technically and entertainment-wise, it has the characters, the action, and the Bond allure which is a constant throughout the movie.<br/><br/>It captures you right with the opening sequence, which is absolutely thrilling and beautifully choreographed, the whole movie is nicely choreographed and very well shot (Roger Deakins's cinematography is a stand out). The key characters are well presented, with each of them having their own layers, and the movie dives specifically into Bond's psyche, which gave us on the way, the right dose of Bond origins (not too much, not too little). The lead acting is fantastic, Craig as Bond, which in my opinion is the best who portrayed the Iconic spy, Dench as M, and Bardem as Silva, which by himself takes the movie to a whole new level both as an actor and the character itself, since among the Daniel Craig-led 007's, Skyfall is the first film to bring us a true villain, an archenemy, one that is actually in-par to Bond himself. Skyfall also brings new additions and takes some out that leaves a lot to be explored in sequels (several new characters that will most probably be reprised again, and yes, there is death). And there is a very, very nice retro touch to the film that pays homage to 50 years of James Bond.<br/><br/>This however does not mean the film is perfect at all, it does have several issues of its own, issues that stand out. The overall story does not hold itself very well, specifically the final act, which might be considered a bit... stupid. Some characters and the architecture surrounding them did not Solid nor necessary, the whole Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) charade felt imposed and like a plot device just to introduce a an action sequence, a fling, and shed a little light on the villain. To me, the most un-Bond thing about Skyfall was that, 007 was more of a hit-man than a spy, he had one, maybe two ""spying"" missions, which included lots of killing, the rest was a shoot-em up, more like an open war movie than an espionage one.<br/><br/>And as for the temporary feel of the film (in the time of its release), the trailer had a very negative effect, it gave out almost every key scene and one liner in the film, leaving almost nothing to surprise you at the theater, this however cannot be held against the movie's lifetime position since trailers do not live forever, opposing to Bond films which actually do seem to live forever.<br/><br/>If I have to place this film among the other Craig-led Bond movies, it falls somewhere between ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum Of Solace"""
"Kaiko","9","433","838","23 October 2012"," Bond is back
","Some people thought Daniel Craig was too much like Bourne and the Bond style film had been abandoned. If you were worried about that fear not - Bond is back.<br/><br/>The film has great stunts & thrills - you'll see this in the long opening sequence. Bond is not burdened with gadgets and still has lots of energy.<br/><br/>Ignore the plot credibility (not as far fetched as some plots like Moonraker) and usual level of general film fiction where it comes to computing.<br/><br/>All the characters are great, from the MI6 team members to the villain (Silva) who acts like a traditional Bond villain. It is very easy to provide details and reveal the plot - the way the trailer was edited means it has not given too much away.<br/><br/>This film will provide thrills & you will laugh more than you did with Craig's last two films.<br/><br/>Classic Bond is back and it was a joy to see it, if you are a Bond enthusiast there are lots of treats in store."
"risk-alan","1","204","385","12 November 2012"," Sucked in by the Bond hype - A boringly separatist movie
","Like thousands of others I am a Bond fan and although we all have differing views on what Bond should be, we all expect a good Bond movie to be an escape from our day to day lives. A glamorous life full of suspense and intrigue. Skyfall has no suspense, intrigue or glamour (save for Berenice) and as such is not escapism and not a 'Bond film'. Casino Royale was a Bond film and a very good one at that, so this mess isn't Craig's fault.<br/><br/>Like others I also saw terrible sets especially Skyfall Lodge which looked like something from a sixties TV series, crossroads or it's a knockout!<br/><br/>Also I noticed clear as day Craig's stuntman on several occasions, completely ruining for me the roof top motorbike chase. Continuity errors all over the place not worthy of a Bond film from any era.<br/><br/>Q was miscast and his specs were embarrassing, all wrong wrong wrong.<br/><br/>The new Moneypenny should never sleep with Bond and Naomie Harris cannot act to save herself.<br/><br/>Berenice Marlohe is amazing, an incredible actress and totally stunning. My one point out of ten is all for her!<br/><br/>Another weird thing about this Bond.....nobody mentions 'Britain' only 'England' - is this a future proofed Bond ready for Scottish independence?! England is mentioned several time but not Britain anymore even though we saw union jacks but no George flag. A small point to some but a major puzzle to some, what is this all about?<br/><br/>Never ever did I have all these concerns watching a Bourne movie or even the brilliant TV series Homeland, in these productions you never stop to think 'this isn't real' because it is all done so well that you just get wrapped up in it all. Not so this film for me, so so many errors that I couldn't wait to get out of the cinema. Above all this film bored me and depressed me, something I have never said about any Bond film before, not even Q of Solace.<br/><br/>The real puzzle for me is who likes it? My straw poll of 11 people has brought up 8 who disliked it and felt tricked, with the rest not bothered either way so how come all the hype? How come all the glowing professional reviews? It's almost 'the king has no clothes' situation isn't it? Or maybe all the pro UK stuff in our Olympic year of celebration has made everyone lose their objectiveness.<br/><br/>Either way I have yet to meet anyone who thought this was a great movie."
"timb-arsenal","1","170","320","8 November 2012"," Skyfail
","Let's be honest here, most Bond movies are tongue-in-cheek and pretty stupid and that's part of it's appeal. It's a fantasy world of beautiful women, gadgets, real stunts and cheesy one-liners but this so called ""Real Bond"" doesn't work for me. Were Pierce Brosnan, Roger Moore and Sean Connery cyborg robots? I must have missed something.<br/><br/>Bond movies have their own style and special formula with the usual ingredients, similar to a Big Mac. In fact, others have made a very good living copying Bond, from Austin Powers, Johnny English, Spy Hard, Ispy and many more. But how do you copy this movie? It was like watching a straight-to-DVD Steven Seagal movie. Dare I even say worse than a Seagal movie.<br/><br/>Now most 'professional' film critics will say this is the 'best Bond movie ever' so that they can kiss butt to get more free tickets and invites to premieres, none of them are going to be honest. So as an average movie goer who has to pay to see the film I expect my money's worth. This movie was like paying for a Big Mac but just getting the bun and nothing in the middle.<br/><br/>Skyfall (or as I not-so-cleverly renamed it Skyfail) was boring from the beginning to the near end, only part I enjoyed was Bond in the very end. The cold and bleak landscape of Scotland was perfect for Bond. Unfortunately, the other characters at the end bored me. The baddie arrives in a military type helicopter with John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom blasted out from a speaker which was brilliant but where did he get it from? Surely they aren't available on ebay, are they? Most people will say they enjoyed the opening scene which in time they will probably realise was pretty awful and rather boring. An Audi slides on its side a few yards and somehow re-rights itself. With just a minor scratch on it, this is the 'action scene'. My teenager son causes more damage to his car on a Friday night. The Bikes even drive pass the same place twice which is unforgivable in any movie.<br/><br/>The Bond girls in Casino Royale (Eva Green and Caterina Murino) were gorgeous by anyone's standards but since then the Bond girls have been rather rough looking.<br/><br/>You don't get your money's worth in this movie nor do you see anything new. All you get is a director who thinks he knows best how to make a Bond movie and that the tried and tested formula is somehow wrong. <br/><br/>We live in a tech world, the information age, but somehow Bond who has always been ahead in the tech department has now been left behind. He seems more interested in drinking and gambling than saving the world with a toaster that can turn into a 'Little Nellie'<br/><br/>Oh, how i miss you 007!<br/><br/>As a child, growing up with Bond I had the toys, The sleek silver DB5 with the ejector seat and the white Lotus that was a necessity come bath time. What do the kids now have from Bond I wonder? Gambling chips? Or some video game which is more violent than the movie?<br/><br/>It would have been nice to see a Bond movie on its 50th anniversary going all out with major action sequences as you would expect in an action movie such as Mission Impossible, Bourne or even a Terminator movie. Instead we are spoon fed a ""Downton Abbey"" version of Bond, we definitely had the cast all that was missing were the costumes.<br/><br/>The cast: Daniel Craig and his potato-field-like face looked more like Bond in this movie than the previous two. Javier Bardem was a let down and looked like a 70s porn director. Judi Dench gets to swear again, somehow they think it's cool to have an acclaimed actor swearing. Ralph Fiennes thought this was a WWII movie, all that was missing was his German SS costume, Naomie Harris has no real input, she's just chucked in to the grinder to appeal to a wider audience. Berenice Marlohe was somehow weaved into the story to let Bond order a drink and have sex, Albert Finney plays a Scot as bad as I would, Ola Rapace gets his part thanks to his real life wife and Ben Whishaw tries hard to play a geek with the usual geeky stereotype but ends up releasing the villain from his fish tank. Believe it or not but Q used to be intelligent... that's how he got a job at the Military Intelligence Department.<br/><br/>In my opinion, a Bond movie should look and feel like a... dare I say it,... a Bond movie. This was sadly a poor scripted, a poor acted and a poor attempt at making an action movie. In time this movie will go down as the worst Bond movie but right now the hype around it is causing a smoke screen. (That's how Bond saves M. Somehow the baddie shoots a few rounds at M and then out of nowhere decides to leave after going to all that trouble in finding her!). <br/><br/>Albert Broccoli and Ian Fleming must be turning in their graves. It took 50 years for some sorry excuse of a director who thinks he's an artist of some sort to ruin it. Very sad time for Bond fans. A disappointment as a Bond movie or even a stand alone movie.<br/><br/>I give it a 1 for the helicopter scene and thank you Mr Hooker for waking me up.<br/><br/>Don't try to reinvent the Big Mac by taking the meat out of it."
"talktoneill","5","176","333","4 November 2012"," Way Way over-hyped...
","Someone said to me 2 weeks ago just before Skyfall came out, ""Is it just me or is this the most hyped and over-marketed Bond of all time?"" I hadn't really thought about it, but once it was pointed out, I realised that for about 2 months before the release, you couldn't move for the billboards, bus-side ads, TV and radio spots, over-hyped theme song etc etc. I concluded it must be partly because it's the 50th anniversary, but I always worry when a film is this over-hyped, because it's very very difficult to meet expectations this high. Also, there's a danger people will have decided they love the movie before they even see it, and I think that's what's happened here. It's the Emperor's New Clothes. This is an average movie, at best.<br/><br/>There are so many reasons why this doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Dr No, Goldeneye or Casino Royale, I'll just mention a few:<br/><br/><ul><li>Ridiculous Villain with a ridiculous plan: Are we expected to believe that this guy can put together a team of world class elite mercenaries, set up the most advanced cyber-terrorism organisation in the world, and all he wants to use it for is to kill his ex boss? It's just a limp, implausible plan.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Major Plot Holes: As already mentioned by other users here, there's just so much that doesn't stack. Silva's whole plan is based around letting himself get caught, knowing where he'll be imprisoned, and knowing how to get from there to where M will be at that time? Surely if he can hack into any system in the world, including triggering a gas explosion in M's office, he could just arrange to break into her house at some point? Also, he's managed to plant explosives in the tunnels below the Underground, right at the point where Bond will be standing, at exactly the moment a train is passing overhead, and he did this years in advance? (minor point, that train was completely empty of people. Just lazy direction)</li></ul><br/><br/>Quote (approximately anyway): ""This guy is a ghost. Nobody knows anything about him; his real name or where he's from..... But we do know he'll be flying to shanghai in 2 days on flight 235 landing at 21.00"". I mean come on.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Agents List: Did Silva actually steal this? If so, why? Just to get M and Bond's attention? And once he's started releasing the names, does he stop? Clumsy plot line.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Komodo Dragons. Enough said.</li></ul><br/><br/>I'm not saying this is a bad film. It's beautifully shot, has some decent action sequences, and explores new and interesting sides to a very well known character. But there's far too many problems with it up there with the best Bonds, or to put it in IMDb's top 250."
"jkentlayton","1","145","272","12 November 2012"," ""Badly done!""
","I have been a James Bond fan for years, but this movie was just badly bolted together. Why?<br/><br/>1. How did Eve, who was chasing the train in the truck and barely keeping up, suddenly get two or three minutes ahead of the train in time to set up for when it emerged from the tunnel? The timing simply doesn't work. 2. M orders Eve to ""take the shot"" three times. Bond heard them, and Eve's complaint that the shot wasn't clean. So why didn't Bond simply drop to the roof of the car and let her have the shot? If she missed, he could easily resume his fight in the next tunnel. 3. Why didn't Eve take a second shot at the henchman on the roof of the train after she shot Bond? The henchman had enough time to turn to her and all but wave a 'thank you', yet she didn't bother. 4. Bond survives the fall from the train how exactly? He is on the roof of a train moving at approximately 40mph when he is shot, catapulted backward, and falls hundreds of feet into a river. Because he is unconscious, he can not enter the water at a safe angle, and should have been killed. As if this isn't bad enough, the unconscious Bond is then swept over a high waterfall. The title sequences explain nothing of his escape, and when they end, Bond is in a hut on the beach bedding some girl. Not explaining his survival is a critical error which borders on ludicrous, yet somehow the audience is meant to take it all seriously. 5. It is clear that Eve is a poor field agent. Later, Bond suggests that she simply doesn't belong in the field. However, this raises the question: how did she acquire field agent status to begin with? 6. Bond always attempts to keep collateral damage amongst civilians to a minimum, and protects the defenseless. However in this film, he allows the villains to do their dirty work before he intervenes. 7. To this Bond, as developed in the last two films, women quickly became anything but 'disposable pleasures'. The death of Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale was a terrific trauma; when Ms. Fields is killed in Quantum, he is again visibly angry. However, in Skyfall Bond not only makes no attempt to save Sévérine (not even attempting to fight the henchmen to provide a distraction until the backup he knows is en route arrives), but he shows absolutely no glimmer of distress over her death. In fact, his first response is a fast, and badly delivered, quip about it being a 'waste of good Scotch.' 8. Silva had tried to take his own life by a hydrogen cyanide pill. Instead of killing him, he merely felt a burning sensation and had most of his teeth and jaw fell off. Such 'suicide pills' kill; they do not merely give one a little heartburn and bad teeth. 9. What was the point of Silva setting up his own arrest? Ostensibly, it is so that he can talk to M one last time. But why not just travel to London, abduct M from the hearing, and talk to her before doing her in? 10. If Q was good enough to have invented the security on Silva's computer, how was it that he was unable to stop it from freeing Silva? 11. How did Silva know that within just a few seconds of the blast an empty train would be coming through to conveniently fall on and crush Bond, allowing him to escape? 12. The 1964 Aston Martin made its triumphant return in this film, but unfortunately it did so in a way that created continuity errors and glaring reboot issues. It is not a 'company car,' so it must be the same Aston Martin that Bond won from Dimitrios playing cards in Casino Royale. However, it has all of the Q-branch add-ons from Goldfinger If this had been Dimitrios' car, why did it have the Goldfinger configuration from Q Branch? This thoroughly wrecked the film's continuity with the reboot. 13. What was the purpose of taking M to Skyfall? In the film, it is openly suggested that the plan is a trap to catch Silva, with M serving as the bait. However, if it is a trap, one would expect Bond to create a scenario where they would have a significant advantage. It is poorly explained why he doesn't want backup (he depended on them for extraction from Silva's island); he also takes no weaponry with them. Instead, the unlikely trio is forced to create a ""Home Alone"" style defense of Skyfall which is doomed to failure before it even begins 14. Why did the monk's tunnel lead, not all the way to the chapel, but into the middle of the moor? A half-tunnel is barely worth the effort to build. 15. When M and Kincade enter the tunnel to leave the house, Kincade closes and locks the door from the other side. Yet, when Bond decides to leave, he has no difficulty simply opening the door. 16. Why would M and Kincade, while secretly fleeing the attack through the moor in the middle of the night, use a flashlight to illuminate their path? This could only be a dead giveaway of their position to Silva and his henchmen. Why not just pull out a Las Vegas-style neon sign and have M cry out from the moor: ""Oh, Silva, come and get us!"" 17. Silva's death scene was preposterous, and very nearly Monty Python-esque. Bond stabs Silva in mid-back with a blade; it would have severed the spinal cord, causing instant paralysis before death. Yet Silva bizarrely laughs and staggers toward Bond. 18. There were many continuity mistakes introduced into the film through sloppy editing (such as M's handbag in Mallory's office).<br/><br/>Very badly done film."

Was there no budget to get a Aston martin one 77? <br/><br/>The hacking stuff was boring and full of plot holes, they obvious did not have a budget for a decent evil lair (that island was fake and the room with the servers was cheap) so they used the digital terrorist as an excuse. <br/><br/>Moneypenny was boring and way to ugly for a decent bond girl. <br/><br/>James being an alcoholic and screwing whores, then gets her killed, nice plan there who the f is the bad guy? Almost looks like he planned this, so nobody would find out he screwed a prostitute. <br/><br/>They go to some remote place instead of some military base, lets go to some place where the bad guys can just blow up the entire house and have a nice bbq after that. Why use Q gadgets if you can make bombs out of plastic bags and light bulbs. Who needs a Billion dollar budget for intelligence just use haunting rifles and improvised booby-traps.<br/><br/>They at least could film someone walking with a flashlight in the distance but they obvious said to some one: ""You, go there and just go nuts with the flashlight so it is clear to the viewer. And why would you walk there with a flashlight? You could put a giant glowing sign on your head, with: ""we are here, please shoot us"".<br/><br/>At the end he is crying like a little baby about a woman who gave an order that almost killed him.

","This film effectively kills off the character we all know and love. The plot is shot full of holes, the villain a camp idiot, no Bond girls to speak of, unless sex slaves are your thing (truly vile of Craig not to have objected to that storyline), pointless and seriously unfunny dialogue, unriveting action scenes most of which we've seen done better elsewhere, and telegraphing of practically every prop placement. Oh, wait, there's more: an awful and forgettable Bond film song sung by that large, breathy lady who fudges the top notes and has merely rehashed Goldfinger. And a limp ending. <br/><br/>To be fair I liked the opening credits (minus the song) and I thought Bérénice Marlohe acted well, and Ralph Fiennes enunciates well. The shots of London were OK and the skyscraper neon dazzled - even if the plot at that point fell apart faster than the shot glass. <br/><br/>I wanted to like this film. I wanted to give the mumbling Craig one last chance, but he just isn't Bond, so what do they do? They write a blancmange Bond so Craig will fit right in. Meanwhile we are left holding ticket stubs asking what was THAT all about? It was about a lot of things that had nothing to do with our James. Almost everything that kept the franchise going for 50 years has been interfered or radically dispensed with on purpose! No gadgets, no credible Bond car (they destroy the iconic one - unsubtle flagging of what they are doing to our Bond?). Moneypenny is now black and totes a gun (I kid you not - how do they explain away her colour? But worse, she is (it's all so wrong!) attractive and (sob) beds Bond - words fail.) Dench's M is, as usual, flat and unconvincing but at least she's out of the next films - a good career move, one that Craig should take. Q is a horrible little boy you can't possibly believe a hacker even if you accept the stupidity of casting Q as one...and with big black glasses? Come on...<br/><br/>Maybe Bond should always stay in the 60s, 70s. I mean you don't update Hercule Poirot and have him ponce about in the 21st century.

","This is right up there with Mortal Kombat 2 and 2012 as the worst movies I've sat through in the theater. Nothing made sense and they insulted your intelligence time and time and time again.<br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead.<br/><br/>The first hour was actually pretty interesting - albeit bizarre. That Bond survived the fall without any explanation was odd but hey, I can live with one miracle resurrection - it's a Bond movie. The sequence in Shanghai was also pretty well done and the silhouette fight was great cinematography - but again - Bond lets the bad guy shoot his target? But who's the target? And if he wanted to trail him to know who he was working for - why would he kill him? But OK, he finds a clue and goes to Macau, where he redeems a chip that obviously isn't for him. So, instead of being interrogated by the Casino staff/thugs - a woman comes up to him and more or less gives up her boss, with her handlers a few feet away. What? OK so then there's an obligatory fight in a kimodo dragon pit, which is short but fun, and then off to Japan's battleship island to meet...possibly the most inconsistently motivated villain of all time.<br/><br/>Silva's entrance is menacing, the story about the rats in the barrel is sinister, and he's flamboyant enough to say 'this guy creeps me out'. But he reveals nothing about his operation, and this is the start of where his motivation just dissolves.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie is about an agent list and hurting MI6. We learn on the island that he was somehow hurt/betrayed by MI6 and that he wants to share his revenge with Bond, who also, in a very roundabout way, was also betrayed (said he was up to field service when he failed all the tests). Bond of course rejects this offer, and then after a brief fight, has an army come rescue him - because of a radio transmitter. Really? No one searched him before getting on the island? It was in his coat pocket! But OK, we're then learn that M gave Silva up to get some of her agents in return, which really upset Silva. So Silva breaks out of prison in one of the most ludicrous scenes imaginable, and this is where it all starts to go pear shaped.<br/><br/>Silva reverse hacks MI6, and he wanted to get captured. Ultimately, he breaks out with armed guards surrounding him with no explanation how that happened. Then he goes through the tunnels of London...to arrive at a tube station with some handguns, and eventually crash a parliamentary meeting and shoot M in the face. But wait - he clearly had a bomb - he blew up a tube line. OK, he wanted her death to be up close and personal. Why not back at MI6? He clearly didn't need to be captured by MI6 to get to the station, and he'd proved earlier that he could hack their most secure networks and gain access. Why not walk right through the front door and put a bullet in her face? But then Bond saves the day and they go off to the Scottish highlands (a nod to Connery being a Scot) to hide/lay a trap. Except - MI6 knows where he's going. Why isn't there an army waiting for Silva when he gets there? Oh but wait, the motivation changes continue! During the house fight scene, Silva's henchmen (and there's NO explanation as to where these guys come from) shoot at M, even hitting her. So, she's either not supposed to be taken alive or Silva's men are idiots. But it gets better! Silva then shows up IN A HELICOPTER. Why? To blow up the house with a 20mm cannon! So, when Silva had ample opportunity to use a bomb, he didn't - he wanted her to know it was him who killed her. Now, he's spraying a house with cannon fire with no idea who or what he's shooting at. So now his motivation is he wants her dead at all costs. In that case, why not bring a few RPGs? or a missile? After all, they did just commandeer a MILITARY HELICOPTER! Of course, Bond survives the house being turned into swiss cheese, blows it up with two sticks of dynamite and compressed propane, and then runs off into the wilderness to save M - but before he does, he gets into one last night and plunges into FROZEN WATER, has a fight underwater for what seemed like a few minutes, then somehow gets out of the water, shrugs off hypothermia with again, NO EXPLANATION, to find Silva confronting M.<br/><br/>By now, Silva wants M to help him commit suicide. WHAT? Since when did he have a death wish? Why? Cause he tried to kill himself when he was being tortured and it failed? What's his motivation? Didn't he just try to turn her into Ragu with a 20mm cannon not 10 minutes earlier? Now he wants to die by her hands? And we're supposed to believe this? No. Sorry, but I can only have my intelligence insulted so often. Bond surviving death multiple times with no explanation is insulting. Having Silva's motivation change THREE TIMES is insulting. Having MI6 look like the Keystone Cops is insulting. Foreshadowing EVERY SINGLE TWIST/ELEMENT is insulting. Please, if you don't want your intelligence insulted, DO NOT see this movie."

This film lacks all of the traditional ingredients that make Bond, 007: It doesn't have witty one liners, it barely had any Bond theme music or sound snippets, it doesn't depict 007 as a womanizer, it doesn't have any cool Super Spy Gadgets, and it doesn't even show the cold open animated graphic of 007 walking in to the screen (through the Gun Barrel of his enemy), turning, and shooting, etc, etc...<br/><br/>Barbara Broccoli, I once watched an interview where you noted that you're father did not want the Bond Franchise sold to any of the big studios, in fear that they would change the successful recipe that made Bond such a successful over the past 50 years. Well...at this stage, after producing 3 Bond films in a row that resemble all of the other ""Spy Want-a-be"" movies out there, you might as well...because they couldn't possibly mess it up any more than you already have. <br/><br/>I could go on and on, but this review is boring me almost as much as the movie did.<br/><br/>1 Star! ...and that's being generous."
"tomgillespie2002","5","250","494","6 January 2013"," Competently directed but full of plot holes and strange narrative decisions
","After a botched MI6 operation in Istanbul, a lone mercenary, Patrice  (Ola Rapace), escapes with a computer file containing details about  undercover agents working within terrorist organisations. James Bond is  accidentally shot by his partner Eve (Naomie Harris) and believed to be  dead. Back in London, M (Judi Dench) finds her position threatened by  Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), who urges her to retire in the  aftermath of Istanbul. When the MI6 headquarters are bombed following a  threatening cyber-message to M, Bond returns, facing questions about  his mental state and his physical ability. But when Patrice is tracked  down, an assassination leads Bond to a casino in Macao, owned by cyber-  terrorist Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former colleague of M's.  If I can say off the bat, I've always been in favour of this re-  invention of Bond. As the 'old' Bond films were progressing, they were  becoming gradually more ridiculous and fantasy-laden, leading to the  inexplicable invisible car in Pierce Brosnan's last film as Bond, Die  Another Day (2002). The films seemed to be losing sight of Ian  Fleming's source novels, and although they remained commercial hits,  Brosnan's outings (with the exception of GoldenEye (1995) were becoming  increasingly dire. Casino Royale set the tone early with a moody black-  and-white sequence that gave birth to Daniel Craig's colder, brutal  Bond, less concerned with how his Martini's were made than going to  extreme (and illegal) lengths to bring down his target(s). Royale's  reinvention showed a darker side to the beloved character, yet staying  with tradition, still kept him at an emotional distance.  Director Sam Mendes made the bold decision to reveal more about Bond's  past and childhood, risking fanboy wrath and damaging Bond's almost  mythical characterisations. The main crux of the film focuses on his  relationship with M, a stern authoritarian that risks career and her  own soul in putting national safety and the success of a mission above  the lives of her agents. Bond, being a willing soldier, follows M  blindly, and when Silva announces his intention to enact revenge on M  for a former betrayal, Bond takes M to his childhood home, Skyfall.  Bond facing his childhood allows time to develop on Bond's tormented  psyche, but it all seems quite out of place. One of the most intriguing  things about Bond is his almost suicidal willingness to risk all for  his job due to his almost complete lack of emotion, but Skyfall is  unable to make any grand revelations so it all comes to nothing more  than a distraction. (Saying that, the only previous Bond film to try  and engage Bond emotionally led to one of the most devastatingly cold  climaxes in the series' history in the underrated On Her Majesty's  Secret Service (1969)).  As well as the Bourne series, it seems that Christopher Nolan's Dark  Knight trilogy (2005-2012) is a major influence on this film in  particular. Mendes delves deeper into the workings and hierarchy of  MI6, rather than just a boss sat behind a desk, and adds a modern, more  'real' bad guy in Silva to the mix (even stealing the Joker's voluntary  arrest in The Dark Knight (2008)). Silva is a technical genius, able to  hack MI6's database with relative ease, and also proving himself more  resourceful and intelligent than Bond and M realise. Bardem is  wonderful in the role (as you would expect), but sadly his character is  not. Labelling him simply as a cyber virtuoso seems like a very lazy  way to allow Silva to repeatedly outwit MI6 and their own technical  marvel Q (Ben Whishaw) to the point where you wonder if Britain's  finest could really be so stupid. The film is therefore full of  plot-holes and distracting MacGuffin's that stretches out the running  time to more than it really needs to be.  Skyfall also asks a lot of the audience, especially when it comes to  suspending their belief. Before the frankly bizarre opening sequence  appears and we are treated to Adele's drab title song, we witness an  already wounded Bond get shot with a rifle and fall over 300 feet from  the Varda Viaduct into water, only to emerge alive and romancing a  mystery woman. No explanation is given as to how he manages to survive  the ordeal, and given the revelations about Bond's diminishing physical  prowess, it seems rather insulting. As questions are raised by his  superiors over Bond's ability to his job given his age (it must be the  grey in his stubble), Bond is put through various tests in which he  struggles with, yet half way through the film, this seems to be simply  put aside as he competently shoots and fights his way through various  bad guys. Again, no real explanation given.  Like I stated before, the most suitable word to describe this film  would be underwhelming, especially with the critical adoration that the  film was lavished with. The action scenes are dull, with nothing  matching the free-jumping opening of Royale. They are also quite  strange - was anyone expecting a henchman to be eaten by a CGI Komodo  dragon? How about death by underwater funky chicken? It all leads to a  very unsatisfying climax at Skyfall, where a simple shoot-out and foot  chase fail to justify a 2 hour-plus build-up. It feels like the entire  film is building up to an explosive climax that never comes. I found  the whole experiencing really quite baffling, with the attempts to mix  the old with the new Bond never really convincing or flowing. The film  is competently directed by Mendes however, and everything looks  suitably crisp and clean. What direction all of this means for Bond, I  don't know, but given the film is currently the 14th highest-grossing  film of all time, and the film somehow being lauded by critics and  audiences alike, it won't be too long until Craig dons the suit once  again."

","What a shameless mess of a movie. I loved Casino Royal and was relieved that the Bondfranchise finally seemed to be getting it right again after the embarrassing Pierce Brosnan episode. Casino Royal was a good movie, it was dark, gritty - good acting, good solid action and the plot made sense. Quantum of Solace was not as good, but not bad. This one however is just painfully retarded. It revels in coincidental, stupendous and illogical twists and turns, there's just no sense to it. Just random pretentious bull. <br/><br/>Bond should really have died in the first bit. And stayed dead. That would have saved the movie and been the honorable thing to do. Now they just made a disgrace of it all. <br/><br/>I am deeply disappointed. Sam Mendes! What happened? American Beauty is one of my favorite movies of all time! How could you? I am sorry to say so, but shame on you! Daniel Craig? You revived 007, rising again like a Phoenix - back into the ashes it is. Talking about a fall from the sky. Javier Bardem - tu quoque? I have never seen Bardem act so badly. It was painful. Was this the same actor that made my blood turn cold in No Country for Old Men? This performance was not even worthy of being compared to the shadow of a fart of the character in that movie. <br/><br/>NEVER will I watch a Bond movie again. It is beyond ruin and redemption now. SHAME ON YOU! The makers, that is, and the people who rate this up to over an 8. What is wrong with you people? Seriously."
"christopher_reifer","1","74","136","4 December 2012"," Bad movie worse plot.
","This contains spoilers.<br/><br/>I have never before wrote a comment on IMDb.com. But after seeing the high rating of this complete insult of a classic character called James Bond i had to say something. <br/><br/>Let me start by saying this movie have taken plots from like 10 different movies. Involving Bourne, Batman, Die Hard, Swordfish, Charlie's Angels Mission Impossible and more. Stolen agents list villains getting caught intentionally and a bunch of other stuff you seen in so many movies. Its Bond in a midlife crisis with everyone doubting him.<br/><br/>The Bond chick dies rather quick and seems terrified of the bad guy in this movie. Why? who knows. Never really no explanation there is no explanation to the bad guy Silva at all. He is just a bad ass former agent from M's days in Hong Kong who she sold out and is know out to get M. He has these super hacking skills which are not explained neither. He is just hacking the hell out of MI6. <br/><br/>And of course a very obvious Moneypenny made an entrance and she is black not that its a problem it's just that it screams affirmative action I'm half black by the way. Then you have a washed up Bond?? When was Bond ever washed up ever? Crying over M who gave the clearance to take a shot with Bonds life at stake she didn't seem to care very much. <br/><br/>You have a young Q coming in and say we don't use gadgets no more. The gadgets are a part of James Bond it spiced the movies. The movie all trough was a disaster it was bad from beginning to end. This was even worse then Quantum Solace. <br/><br/>You know i wouldn't have mind the bad plot if i had gotten some comic release or some proper James Bond moments. There were none. Where are the sarcastic comments the witty comebacks to women at cocktail parties?? James Bond is truly dead after this. i remember the golden ages of Connery and Moore. One scene when Bond was caught by a women i recall and, she went i got you now mister Bond, Connery responded well enjoy yourself. Comments like that made me love Bond. There was never no super effects or nasty close combats. He was a spy with a gun who dressed act and looked as a gentleman. Not like this brute who runs around beating people like a Van Damme movie is very emotional and don't seem to be very good with the women at all. Which makes me think why does he get these women?? And oh lets not forget running around half the movie with his shirt off. Don't know how many looking in the mirror without a shirt on scenes this movie had.<br/><br/>Anyways i hope they stop making Bond or first get a new Bond and a better plot."
"SkidMcCormick","10","259","522","27 October 2012"," Were You Paying Attention?
","Right, let's dispense with the rubbish I've had to endure over the last few months: ""James Bond wasn't funny in the last 2 films"". Oh, yes he was, you just weren't paying attention.<br/><br/>""Sam Mendes only ever does dramas, he'll be crap at action"". Wrong again and Road to Perdition hinted on what he can bring to the table. Plus, if you had reservations about Sam, then you're an idiot! ""Is this Daniel Craig's last outing as Bond?"" No. He's contracted to do two more. In fact, why do people think this is the last Bond??? After the hype and mild disappointment that was The Dark Knight Rises, Chris Nolan will have to contemplate that he's missed out on the Big One here. Yup, Sam Mendes, Oscar winner supremo for American Beauty was by far-and-away, the only man for the director's chair (with a solid recommendation by Craig himself). What I love about Uncle Sam is that he's not afraid to be bold (we see more blood in this film, despite the 12a rating, but it's subtly done) and he's definitely found some niches with DC's reluctant hero (which Martin Campbell kick-started with Casino Royale). A pivotal ingredient of a Mendes film is the cinematography and with Skyfall, my jaw was dropping at Shanghai (a nod to You Only Live Twice). In fact, my jaw dropped a lot (and that wasn't even Bérénice Marlohe!) And despite the absence of David Arnold, composer Thomas Newman, doesn't disappoint. <br/><br/>It's the 50-year-old debate: Who Is The Best Bond? Daniel Craig: 3 films in & by the time you see Skyfall, there is no doubt in my mind that DC's Bond is the most fleshed-out and three dimensional. His cavalier attitude, his down-and-dirty assassin on the mission, and a very affectionate lover of the ladies, are some of the reasons he scores all the ticks. Sean Connery just wisecracked and shagged birds, but had that physical prowess which DC has equalled, if not bettered; George Lazenby was more of a pantomime; Roger Moore started out well with his debut, but romanticised 007 to the point where he wore flares and befriended steel-toothed villains who were baying for his blood; Timothy Dalton brought back the hard edge Bond was missing and very underrated (kudos to Jason Segel who acknowledged him in I Love You, Man); Pierce Brosnan carried on that darkness with GoldenEye, which was sadly lacking in future outings, along with a suspension of disbelief audiences couldn't buy any longer. DC is Bond, he now owns the role. He's comedy timing is impeccable, his reactions to the littlest things will have you laughing and he knows how to wear tight fitting clothing (thanks to TOM FORD). More importantly, DC can act which is what this role demands...and if like me, you've all watched the Bond films (as DC & Mendes did), Skyfall has done a tremendous job in avoiding past mistakes. The screenplay acknowledges why James Bond is the World's Most Successful Movie Franchise. From the opening credits that references past entries, to Adele's amazing vocals (someone shoot Madonna & Lulu for me; oh and Jack & Alicia too), Skyfall is peppered with nods that may anger or erupt knowing laughter from its devoted fan base. For the record, I laughed, quite a lot.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, is probably the best entrance you'll ever see for a Bond Baddie. He is also by far, my favourite villain of the series and will be a hard act to beat. I really cannot say any more about Bardem, as he is one of many high points that Skyfall has to offer. A stroke of genius from Mendes to give him blonde hair (not only did he remind me of Scaramanga) but the hair does reveal a back story. Javier is proof that grade-A actors do get the best villainous roles, if they're written properly (remember what the Cohen brothers did for him a few years ago?) As I write this, I'm still grinning at Javier's comments...hahahaha! A great actor, just love him and so much going on in that masculine skull of his.<br/><br/>Nothing will touch Bond. Sure, you'll have the wannabe franchises out there (did someone say douchebag, toothless vampires? Not me) who will claim to be the movie event of the year (more like non-event) and the likes of Marvel Comics may one day, catch up. Stan Lee has to look at the accidental success of 007 in relation to his own creations. Sure, I love Spidey, Captain America and Daredevil, but I'm not a sweaty arm- pitted virgin with a fondness for pies and acne; I'd much rather be the man who's dressed to kill, with a Licence To Thrill and smells of the most decadent cologne that my wages will allow. No shame in admitting my inverted snobbery and can thank Ian Fleming for that. If he were alive today, I'm sure he'd approve of Skyfall (considering it's an original screenplay that relies on his healthy diet of sex, guns, snazzy wardrobes and fast cars). Happy 50th birthday, James Bond (you don't look a day over 40!)<br/><br/>Bond will return in October 2014 (I've already booked my tickets!)"

"Ksmithbrewer001-603-535593","8","21","34","9 February 2013"," Best Bond film of the decade
","*May contain spoilers*<br/><br/>This is clearly the best James Bond film of the decade. Casino Royale was entertaining and kept me interested through most of the film. Quantum of Solace fell flat in many areas. And now Skyfall revitalizes the James Bond franchise. The movie begins like the previous movies; with James Bond(played by Daniel Craig) chasing a target through the streets of a foreign country. We see some of the same action sequences. I don't know how many times people can see the good guy narrowly escape death, but it never seems to get old. Well, not to directors anyway. Back to the movie, there is another agent with him and when the time comes she is ordered by M to take the shot that seemingly kills Bond. No surprise he isn't dead and there is no attempt to tell how he faked this death. While he is enjoying death he sees on the news that M16 was attacked and he makes a trip back to London, to rejoin his former agency. This is where the plot takes off.<br/><br/>Much like Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, what I liked most about this particular Bond film is its attempt to give us a look into Bonds origin and life before he became 007. You also have to see Bond rise from retirement, old age and injuries, like we see Bruce Wayne do in The Dark Knight Rises. If you haven't seen the film already then get ready for intense action scenes,a bleach blond evil-genius, and an explosive ending. This movie really delivers and Bond lovers will fall head over heels for the newest installment to the legendary Bond franchise."

","I have to say, this movie was not what I expected. I enjoyed it only once but it's impact remains. Kudos to the producers, you have taken the Bond series to another plain, much more intricate and enchanting. <br/><br/>I recently watched Die Another Day with Pierce Brosnan and I couldn't help but notice movies back then (just 2002, not that far away) portrayed James Bond as an invincible character, that is in control in any situation, no matter how absurd (think of Icarus chasing him over virgin ice on the North Pole, conveniently stopping from killing him just so he can pull out a para planner and something that looks like a surf board). Now, Pierce Brosnan makes one amazing Bond, I have nothing bad to say about him! But I will admit I do LOVE the new approach with Daniel Craig - sophisticated, yet still human. You know, think of that scene with the chair in Casino Royale...<br/><br/>Skyfall was different for me, because Bond chose to stay away... he would rather be in Turkey, middle of nowhere, than making a difference. NEVER does Bond abandon his Country, his Queen or MI5! We definitely have a different perspective of his character, he still is that amazingly charming, secretive and seductive Bond, but with an edge. It shows a vulnerable side of him, but even in his ""weakest"" moment he is still able to save the world.<br/><br/>So far, no Bond girl has ever been .... removed from the movie in the middle of it. Naturally, I presumed to see Severine live and be saved by Bond, yet we see another twist in this movie, another motivation for Bond to make things right. I wish Bérénice Marlohe starred till the end, she makes one striking Bond girl.<br/><br/>I did not expect not expect to see M die at the end of the movie.... I came to appreciate her strong, to-the-point righteous character, seeing her go almost brought tears to my eyes. Almost. I can still see her order that shot, knowing Eve is never going make it. There are so many forces at play, James is but a figure on her chess board. Best figure non-the-less! <br/><br/>To me Daniel Craig is the GREATEST Bond ever. He is one amazing actor, I really enjoyed his permanence in Archangel. I hope he remains James Bond."

There is nothing in this movie what is expected from a bond movie. No new gadgets, No story ( List of agents for a bond movie and what happened to that list after half way through the movie?) . The climax ( I was thinking am I watching a bond movie or in a wrong cinema ) feels cheap and conventional. They must have run out of money for the second half. Such a stupid idea to bring M to that run down Scottish house. With the home made defenses and geriatric defenders. This movie may be numerically a box office success but leaves behind a 50 years legacy in shreds. This is by far the absolute worst Bond movie I have ever seen. There is no plot, there are no emotions to be invoked in the viewer (I couldn't feel for any of the characters, not even when M died in the end), there is no main theme - everything just seems to be randomly put together I really wonder how could critic give any rating to this movie.

","Major spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>I am writing my first review here as a kind of therapy hoping that I can put my suffering from seeing this film to bed.<br/><br/>For the record, I thought this movie was well filmed and aesthetically very appealing. Several scenes were great on a stand-alone basis. And I have really liked other Bond movies, e.g. Casino Royale.<br/><br/>But this one... I felt I was being treated as an idiot watching it. Just a few examples of what disturbed me:<br/><br/>1. Nice of Patrice to delay his escape in Istanbul so as to perfectly time Bond's exit from the house<br/><br/>2. Please confirm those were sea mermaids saving Bond in Turkey after he with two gun wounds in his upper body lifelessly fell towards the bottom of a lake<br/><br/>3. Whoever came up with the party trick of drinking scotch with a scorpion on the hand should be invited to my next party.<br/><br/>4. A badass hacker blowing up MI6 remotely by somehow fiddling with the utilities? Can he make me breakfast too, through the internet?<br/><br/>4. Cool to be one of the three guys in the world using some kind of uranium bullets in your handgun. And eh, a totally credible means of plot-wise somehow connecting Bond with the bad guys<br/><br/>5. Cooler still to have Bond meet Q at an arts museum, staring at a painting (Turner?) to allow for some heavy symbolism about an old ship doing its last trip while a kid in his 20s tells Bond about how things are done nowadays. Was this new vs. old symbolism supposed to be a theme of the movie?<br/><br/>5. Compliments to the CIA who knows everything about a notorious assassin including where he will be in two days and his flight number.<br/><br/>6. Patrice going through security at a commercial flight bound for Shanghai with enough guns to take out a city. <br/><br/>7. In Macau, some proper fighting and a human-eating-animal species not seen since the jurassic age is just another day at the casino<br/><br/>8. Did the people who used to live at Silva's island have to tear down the place before they left it? Looked like it had been a nuclear war<br/><br/>9. Wow, that rat speech by Silva at the island really did the job of portraying him as a real complex Bond villain<br/><br/>10. The hacking scene at basement where MI6 hangs out - anyone surprised that Bond made some sense out of the web of numbers? Looked like the matrix to me. Impressive by the way that the guy let himself out of the glass cage and managed to kill the guards, but maybe he hacked himself a gun out of the wifi net<br/><br/>11. Btw, we really needed that scene with Silva's distorted face because he seemed far too normal up until that point.<br/><br/>12. If you counted how many men were walking up to the Bond's old house ahead of that eternally long shooting scene, and then counted how many were killed by Bond and his entourage, how big a difference would you get?<br/><br/>13. Following the first round of thugs having been taken care of, I was surprised to see Silva among the second round in the chopper. I thought he would come later in a F-20 figher jet playing Mozart and shooting missiles while insisting on M being kept alive<br/><br/>14. Yep, always use a flash light when you run away from bad guys in the darkness<br/><br/>I could go on but my suffering is gone :) Don't watch the movie unless you too will want to waste half an hour on therapy!"

Even the pre-release review of the film was exceptionally good.<br/><br/>This can actually backfire on the film because people would step in theaters with equally high expectations and it better live up to it.<br/><br/>I was one of the spectators going in with huge expectations after a poor show in 'QoS'. I sat through first half of the film thinking that something would happen soon and change the course and the pace of the film but soon after the second half also got over and we vacated the theater. I was shocked (not disappointed) at what I just saw.<br/><br/>Let's come straight the point – it's not a Bond movie. Why - for the absence of the most obvious and synonymous elements associated to a Bond film.<br/><br/>There are no gadgets. OK fine you don't make them anymore, but I am sorry we still want those exploding pens. He introduced a young Q, but this new lad rubbishes away the gadgets mockingly. I am sure when he was introduced in the film, people thought he has gotten some really nice and cool stuff in his hat. But all he pulls out is a radio transmitter? Sorry! We are here to see James Bond and not John McClane. Even Nolan didn't dare change any elements with respect to the gadgets when doing a complete refresh of the Batman franchise. So how did Sam assume on his own that we do not want gadgets anymore in a Bond film. That's over confidence on his part.<br/><br/>There is no Bond girl. Surprised? Why am I saying this is because the 'supposed' bond girl in the film shares screen space for no more than 10 minutes, has no characterization, no substance and falls for a mere shot of whiskey. Lame? Sam, did you ever get a chance to see Halle Berry, Michelle Yeoh, Eva Green in previous films? Money Penny, I am sorry does not qualify as a bond girl.<br/><br/>Then comes one of the most important aspects of a 007 film - the villain. To be honest I found this one very unimpressive. This one can easily mix with guys who play evil in films like Speed, Die Hard and so many. Yea OK, he was realistic in his 'aspirations' but for a 007 villain we want a Gustav Grave or Hugo Drax or Elliot Carver as a minimum. An awe worthy henchman could have been a nice addition here but sadly none exists. Remember Jaws, Stamper and Xao? In all the earlier movies, plot solely revolved around the 'aspiration' of the bad guy and have been benchmarks in their own terms. Many a times they have been weird but yes always unique and very thoughtful. There is always an element of suspense which is finally revealed towards the later stages of the movie on what the bad guy intends to do. Sadly here it's just revenge.<br/><br/>Action sequences again, lack the spirit, energy, creativity expected out of a Bond film. Opening sequence which is being talked about a lot is actually not so exciting after all. I beg your pardon but what's the fun in crushing Beetles just to move your earth mover a feet ahead? Not required. The climax I would say has been conceptualized as a grown up 'Home Alone'. Yeah it's shot well, you see a lot of silhouette in the dark and some nice colors emanating from the fire created in the backdrop but so what? It lacks the punch, the energy and the thrill! So wasted.<br/><br/>After the movie ended, I for a while almost believed that so much media adulation is probably the last resort towards saving a skyfalling film.The media has been bought over for this one!<br/><br/>We don't want the bond to age beyond his gadgets, cars, flamboyance and exuberance. I think Fleming will give me a nod here. Movie making is all about creativity but creativity should not infuse a change that takes away the persona of the character from how it was conceived. Why bond is what he is, is because of how he was earlier and how we grew up watching him. For all the kids in this generation this Bond is no more different than any other action film character.<br/><br/>So the people who pick up the next franchise should be careful because we are writing the fall of Fleming's character in times to come."
"montferrato","1","93","179","3 November 2012"," End of a Cycle. New Formula, Ideas and Approach Needed. We want Bond Back¡¡¡
","I do love James Bond movies. As soon as the movie was released in Spain, I wanted to watch it. So, yesterday, after a light dinner with a friend, I went to the cinema. At first, I was extremely comfortable with the movie. A list of secret agents has fallen into the wrong hands, and Bond has to recover the list whatever the cost. M has her head on the line, so, she becomes ruthless and drives her agents into a coldblooded rampage of killing and destruction in order to get back the stolen list, including a very uncompassionate approach to her own agents if she believes they stand on the way to the mission's success. All starts with some scenes packed of good action in Turkey, where two MI6 agents pursue the bad guy, one of these agents being Bond. Finally, after a good chasing and some fights on top of a train, Bond is shot accidentally by the other agent (a pretty black woman) on M instructions, and Bond is considered missing in action, supposedly dead. Of Course, Bond is not dead, returns to duty after some colourful and self-destructive holydays in South America, where he drinks tequila shots with a scorpion on his hand(very nice scene), and is unleashed against the bad guys again, going to Shanghai to capture the mysterious bad guy who previously eluded capture in Turkey. We have some very good scenes of a shooting in a Chinese skyscraper, the appearance of a very beautiful Asian woman, a Macau prostitute, and some interesting moments in a strikingly beautiful and decadent Chinese casino with an arena full of Komodo Dragons and bad guys, which is great¡¡. Then, Bond sets sail with the beautiful Asian woman in a magnificent sailing yacht, and reaches an abandoned island where the bad guy (Javier Bardem) lives. The good part of the movie ends here. From now on, all loses credibility, does not stand scrutiny, and all is utterly ridiculous. A sensation of boredom invaded me and the rest of the audience. We do not hear any more about the list of agents, or any other tangible or meaningful plot. A bad guy with mommy issues for M, who feels betrayed by her just appears out of the blue, and all he wants is personal revenge. A bad guy with mommy issues is just unfit for a James Bond movie. We wanted to see a bad guy full of plans to control or destroy the world, with some intelligent design that Bond will try to thwart desperately in the last minute. However, we are just given a poor chap who calls M ""Mom"" (I nearly jumped from my seat and puked when I heard this¡¡¡¡), suffers from Oedipus complex and feels betrayed, engaging in a sort of vengeful killing spree. From this moment the movie rapidly decays into unbearable nonsense, and feels almost like an insult. The end is just so bad¡¡¡¡ Basically Bond takes mommy (see M) to his ancestral home in Scotland in order to kill the bad guy with old hunting rifles. The Bad guy arrives with a bunch of thugs and a helicopter, torches the house, and then Bond kills the bad guy with a knife without fighting, M dies, and the movie ends. In order to compensate the very poor script and ending, a new M and a new Money Penny are given to us, setting the atmosphere for the next movie. Casino Royale was very good. Quantum of Solace was not so good. Skyfall is very bad. The decreasing quality of this franchise is evident. It does not work anymore and a new formula is desperately needed. The only good point is that we have got possibilities of a new and fresh start for the series; we have a new Money Penny (The Pretty Black Woman who accidentally shot Bond), and a new M (Ralph Fiennes, who could make a good M). So, I hope they make something sensible and good next time. This movie was the end of a cycle for the Daniel Craig-Judi Dench franchise. A new approach and new ideas must be developed, and we all want back the true James Bond, and not the big BS they gave us this time."
"Avianon","8","122","240","24 October 2012"," A good anniversary Bond
","This is one of the better Bond movies as I see it. The directing is excellent, as is the cinematography and music. Javier Bardem is great as a baddie, though he could have used a bit more background. He is over the top, but it suits the genre. In comparison, we get more background for Bond and M.<br/><br/>The plot is good and has a good flow to it, though the movie feels ever so slightly bloated in the beginning and the end. The action is well paced and free of annoying shaky-cam work. The dialogue is witty (more so than usual), though too much of the good stuff is given away in the trailer. It definitely feels less of a Jason Bourne movie than the last two.<br/><br/>Location-wise, Skyfall spends more time in Britain than any other in the series as far as I can recall. I like this change and it's nice to see more of MI6.<br/><br/>In all it's well worth watching and a great Bond movie."
"jorob35","Null","11","16","13 February 2013"," Skyfall
","Skyfall is an excellent modern espionage film, and a worthy predecessor to Casino Royal. The thematic elements of the film are quite provocative and relevant to our era. In an age of abundant technology, Skyfall challenges our perception concerning state of the art tools. Bond, the protagonist, is armed throughout the movie with relatively simplistic weapons. Furthermore, Bond accomplishes feats considered impossible for his physical condition. 007 however is a master within the field, and relies on his intuition, expertise, and mental fortitude to accomplish seemingly impossible feats. He does so with a sense of sacrifice, enabling personal resurrection despite circumstances where he remains expendable for a larger cause. Silva, the antagonist, represents modernity's rampant spiritual hypocrisy. Striking meditative poses and delivering lines such as ""Remember your sins"". He shows that spirituality can encourage unethical deeds, even though its obvious he hasn't followed his patterns of thought to logical conclusions. For instance, Silva has no sense of forgiveness, and would rather plot and scheme ultimate acts of vengeance. His terrorism is oriented around technology, revealing our over-reliance on modern contrivances. Overall, I enjoyed the acting, direction, editing, score, and film aesthetics ""with pleasure"". An unanswered question remains, whether the global society is shifting towards consolidation or diversity, how do responsible groups maintain an ethical way of existence?"
"krycek19","1","58","108","2 December 2012"," Skyfail!! Fire Daniel Craig!!
","I think what I hate most about this insult to the Bond franchise, is the critics bull-crap about this being the best Boind movie ever. Have all critics been paid off by the Bond people to write such positive reviews?I cannot find a single negative review of Skyfall written by a professional movie-critic anywhere online. It's either that or that the critics are to spineless to say anything bad about this atrocity of a movie.<br/><br/>This is NOT Bond!! It's depressing, ugly looking, ugly shot, Daniel Craig looks too old for the part.<br/><br/>There are no Bond-babes, no exotic locations, no gadgets, no jokes, the villain is pathetic, there are major plot-holes. The same can be said about The Dark Knight rises, which Sam Mendes was inspired by.<br/><br/>How about being original for a change? These days all movies have to look a like.<br/><br/>Only good thing about the movie: M dies!! Daniel Craig has ruined Bond. Fire that grumpy old-looking ugly guy whose face and nasty blue eyes is best for villain parts anyway and find a 30 year old dark haired good-looking guy who can play Bond the way Bond should be played."

","The Short: Skyfall is exciting, tense, action packed and surprisingly beautiful. The perfect way to conclude 50 years of the incredible Bond legacy.<br/><br/>Bond is back, baby.<br/><br/>Skyfall is here; the highly anticipated next chapter in the much loved and respected Bond film legacy. And to much delight, Skyfall is no cash-in...this is a full fledged, action packed, and thoroughly conclusive Bond experience like no Bond film before it. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig returns as the stoic James Bond, but this time he is a more vulnerable James Bond than before. The story takes Bond to and company to very interesting places, and the set pieces that follow are incredibly memorable (partly because of the superb cinematography). The finale is especially incredible; it oozes style. Judi Dench is as classic as ever, Ralph Fiennes is excellent, and Javier Bardem is an incredibly complex and sinister: he is equal parts flamboyant and insane. The only weak link here is Naomie Harris. Her introduction is far too brief to get the time to like the character, and her humor is pretty bad. She becomes better as the film moves along, but nothing to the level of past Bond girls. <br/><br/>The action scenes are incredibly well shot and feature some of the best choreography since the Bourne trilogy. Like before, the finale is one of the best of the series, no doubt. It is explosive, intense, thoroughly satisfying and concludes a chapter in the Bond universe. The second half of the film also brings back some classic Bond ideas, and I'll keep it at that. If you have been in love with Bond series as long as I have, ever since childhood, you'll be giddy in your seat! <br/><br/>The soundtrack is also really great, and the new music added fits the mood well. Adele's intro song is surprisingly good. Also, the classic intro scene style is back, and it is very, very cool. <br/><br/>Now, Bond's latest isn't without some faults. Like mentioned before, Naomie Harris isn't great. Some of the humor is really hit or miss. There are a couple of small plot holes. All of these are little things, but keep this movie from being perfect. That being said, these things won't hurt the experience for all, and they do little to mar the overall experience.<br/><br/>Summing up my feelings for Bond's latest is simple: Skyfall is such a good film. Aside from a few nagging little issues, Skyfall couldn't be better. It's filled with memorable action scenes, great characters, impressive cinematography and an unforgettable finale. It carries that same level of cheesiness that Bond films are well known for, and that same brand of humor is back. It's classic Bond in a new era, directed with expertise and style. <br/><br/>Bond's latest mission is a success.<br/><br/>4.5/5 - Fantastic, a must see."
"jeyneseybaby","2","52","96","9 December 2012"," A confused film full of complete morons
","For me the problem with this film is that it's trying to be two very different things. Bond as gritty realism is good. Bond as camp nonsense is good. This is trying to be both and I don't think it can do that successfully. <br/><br/>As a person I am very rational, so I may well find it harder than most to suspend disbelief. I can do it in most circumstances but EVERYONE in this film is a complete moron. James Bond is a moron. M is a moron. The politicians are morons. The police and security are sedated, cross-eyed morons. The baddies are all morons. Every single person working at MI5 is a moron.<br/><br/>Yes, obviously you can and will have that implausibly unrealistic situation where trained assassins can't shoot each other with 50 bullets from 10 foot but in my opinion you have to at least TRY and have a reason they can't hit each other. That, I think, is why you have to have Bond on location on his own, so it's one on one or Bond is outnumbered. When you have the story play out in the good guys' HQ, you're basically saying that they're ALL completely incompetent, to the level (and sometimes beyond) the slapstick parodies of the genre like Austin Powers if they can't keep one, unarmed man in a cage, when they all have guns. He might as well have just waved his fingers at them and sent them out for Orange Sherbert because that would have been equally realistic.<br/><br/>It's disingenuous, to the point where I'm disengaged and consequently bored. Basically if you paused the film at any point where a decision is made and said ""what's a sensible thing for the good guy to do here?"" they'd do the exact opposite, usually to a point way beyond what you think is the most stupid thing possible. <br/><br/>The case in point for me: ""One mental case is trying to kill us, what shall we do?"" The answer is not ""drive into the middle of nowhere, with no weapons and not tell anyone. That is moronic. <br/><br/>What's worst about that, I think, is that it's done from a lazy standpoint where having something look cinematic is far more important than the narrative. I don't think most critics who like this film would let a stand-alone film get away with being this lazy and cynical.<br/><br/>I read in another review on here that ""you believe this man *bond* could exist"". Yes, you can. But that's only because there are real people who are also morons. Some of them are alcoholics. Some of them can fight. Some of them may be able to hold their breath under ice cold water for about 2 minutes whilst triangle choking someone, without going into convulsions, having recently been shot with radioactive bullets.<br/><br/>A few other quick points. - As has been mentioned elsewhere, jumping someone in the shower that you've barely spoken to, who's lived their life from a pre-teen sex slave, is not cool. It wouldn't be cool if she wasn't a sex slave. - Bardem was charismatic but still, none of the hacking plot made any sense either, as has been pointed out in the highly ranked reviews. - The opening credits were great.<br/><br/>But again, to sum it up, either you're going for gritty realism, or you're going for completely nonsensical slapstick. If you're going for realism, don't make some of the most intelligent people on the planet into complete driveling idiots that couldn't make a sensible decision if their nonsensical, not-even-caricatured (because a caricature at least has a foundation in reality), lives depended on it.<br/><br/>Why it's most disappointing though; the film did not need to be this stupid and nonsensical. You can have just as much fun but make it at least tenuously believable. Chase them into the Home Alone lair or something - don't have them choose to go their of their own accord. It's not that difficult.<br/><br/>So if you like this film, never be snooty about anything like Harry Potter or Twighlight because in the context of the world this film exists in, this Bond film is infinitely more stupid and nonsensical than either of those films. However, if you aren't a snob and just liked it for the nonsense it was, that's all good! My girlfriend is one of you and she's alright with me. :)"

All the critics reviews pointed to this film being fantastic the best Bond ever.Well its not ! Far from it i don't know if other movie watchers are saying its good because the critics say its wonderful so it must be good isn't it ? This is not a Bond movie its not even a good action/drama movie.I've heard the reviews for Taken 2 it sounds awful but i think i might go and see it the critics have got this so wrong. Skyfall has a poor script and plot that is sidelined half way through the film.No gadgets no bond girls no exotic locations the whole film looked like it was shot in SD quality it was so grey and murky. This was the first Bond movie I've seen at the Cinema since Thunderball (yes that years ago) i usually watch movies on DVD/bluray but felt because of all the hype that Skyfall would be worth going to see. Well its not save your money and wait till its on TV at least you can record it and FF the boring parts."
"TheHonestCritic","4","3","3","2 July 2020"," The title of this ""film"" is dumb, but does that leave an impact on this ""movie""? Well.....
","""Skyfall"" (2012), once again, I hate to even call it a Bond movie because of one issue, Daniel Craig. Seriously, what in the world were they thinking casting Daniel Craig as Bond?! We'll get to him in a minute, but, let's get back to my review. This ""movie"" has standard to abysmal acting, boring sets/locations and a mostly dull yet predicable soundtrack. The iconic character of James Bond is ruined, yet again, by Daniel Craig's presence. Honestly, if you think he's a good Bond, seek help. That being said, he is a good actor and has acted well in other movies. But, James Bond is about the worst character you could have had him play! The other really bad performance comes from Ben Whishaw as Q. Once again, a horrible casting decision. Ben Whishaw sucks as an actor overall, especially in this role as he butchers the character of Q! When I was subjected to watching this ""film"" in the theater, as soon as I found out that he was playing Q, I almost shouted: ""WHAT?!"" Thankfully, I stopped myself because I didn't want to talk in the theater. He is, by far, the worst Q actor of the series. Desmond Llewelyn will always be Q, John Cleese was a close second and Alex McCowen was somewhat boring but passable. Ben Whishaw, just leave the series and the same to you, Daniel Craig! The only decent performances are from Judi Dench as M, Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory (later on the new M) and Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, the main villain. Once again, a bad ""movie"" with a good villain! All of the other actors and actresses are dull and mediocre at best. As for the sets/locations, most of them are passable. You cannot go wrong with areas around Europe. But, some of them, especially Bond's old childhood house are boring. Finally, the soundtrack is overall a disappointment. The only really good song was the opening theme, performed by Adele. Sadly, the rest of the soundtrack is average to cliched. Now for the good elements in this ""film"". The story was well written and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. Had a real actor played Bond besides Daniel Craig, it probably could have really shined! Alas, we have a potential gripping story partially ruined by Daniel Craig and Ben Whishaw. The other positive thing is the special effects, all of them were well-done. Being a movie made in 2012, that doesn't surprise me! ""Skyfall"" had potential to be a decent movie, but once again, Daniel Craig's presence ruined it. I rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Bottom line, just stick with any other Bond movie besides the Daniel Craig films. You'll be much better off watching the real Bond movies instead. Trust me!"
"ironhorse_iv","8","8","11","28 June 2017"," The name is Bond. James Bond. & this movie is awesome, because of him! Skyfall is worth watching.
","This was a great new gift for the 50th anniversary of Eon Productions series. Directed by Sam Mendes, ""Skyfall' tells the story of exile secret agent, 007 AKA James Bond (Daniel Craig) having to come back to her majesty's secret service, when MI6 comes under attack by a mysterious and sadistic cyberterrorist villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) who wants vengeance against Bond's supervisor, M (Judi Dench). Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, this spy film is not as gritty as the previous Daniel Craig's versions of James Bond movies, 2005's 'Casino Royale' & 2008's 'Quantum of Solace'. 'Skyfall' does have all the gadgets and tools that longtime fans have come to see, such as intense well-paced action pieces, sexy suggestive long making & great memorable supporting characters like Q (Ben Whishaw) and Eve (Naomi Harris) paying homage to the series' iconic status. However, if some of the criticism of the last two films, is how much similar, Daniel Craig's bond is to the Jason Bourne's series, both in lack of quip and exceptional martial-arts department. Then, this movie will get criticize for how familiar, beat points of the plot is to the comic book movie 2008's 'the Dark Knight', with a tiresome and beaten down hero, going after a superior, intelligent, villain with large explosion and double-trickery. Despite that, I have to say, the movie is thrilling from start to finished, even if they abandoned some well-worn formula plot threads like opening gun barrel. Still, I thought, the movie could had explain, some parts of the film, a lot better, like how in the hell, did James Bond able to survive the opening action sequence in Turkey!? His out of the blue unexplained presence, later in the film was a bit jarring. I get that it's supposed to represent the rebirth of Bond, but it felt like a cheap hook that something that an older Sean Connery film would do. Not a modern day movie, like this. Another thing, I didn't like about the film is the idea of him, having heavy petting time with a woman who just reveal that she was an ex-child sex slave in China. It was a bit disturbing and dirty. At least, he could had wait for a better time to do that, when it isn't awkward. However, that never happens, as the woman named Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) barely gets any screen time. Because of this, I found the love-interest in this film to be, one of the weakest parts of the film. I thought, they could had established, a lot more with her character rather than a disposable plot device/sex object. One other thing, I was deeply surprised that they abandoned, was the complexity of the subplot of the breaches list of security, in favor for a simpler plot of man wanting to kill his ex-boss. I found the detour to be, great. The unique 'Home Alone' booby traps ending was a barn-burning finale. I also like how, it finally debunked the James Bond code name theory. In the end, this movie was worthy as the last hurrah for Judi Dench as M, whom played the role, over 17 years old, since 1995's 'GoldenEye'. She was amazing. Javier Bardem as the antagonist was also great. He had the right amount of charm, and creep to pull this Oedipus complex role, off. Raoul Silva will indeed immediately rank, very high as one of Bond's greatest villains. As for James Bond, Daniel Craig pull off, another defining performance. I love that they show, that the agent does have some flaws and sense of vulnerability. Skyfall really provides him with the opportunity to showcase his ability as a great actor. He's brutal when he needs to be, and charming and suave when the situation arises. He also has the comedy chops, when the film, ask for it, like jumping out of an helicopter with Queen Elizabeth II, during the 2012's Summer Olympics opening ceremony, during marketing. It's a lot better than the straight-case brooding over serious, hero, we got in the previous movie. About the controversial homosexuality/bi tendencies of Bond. He's clearly doing that, just for show. Nothing to get work up, about. He's still, pretty straight-forward, at least, as the recent films goes on. Anyways, 'Skyfall' isn't a Bond movie, without a good, supporting cast. Like, I said before, the rest of the cast was OK, with Ralph Fiennes's Gareth Mallory and Naomi Harris's Eve, standing out. As for Albert Finney's short role as Kincad. He was alright in the ending, but how cool, would it, be, if the director's original choice, Sean Connery was given that part. Anyways, as far, as the movie looks, the cinematography was alright. It was gorgeous, but I seem, better from cinematographer, Roger Deakins. Some of the locations used in the film like Hashima Island, kinda does stand out. Still, I could do, without all that CGI added for the Scotland landscapes. As for the opening title sequence. It was very well done. Visually, it was nice to look at, but the opening theme music by British singer, Adele titled 'Skyfall', really took the cake. It was so beautifully sung. It was an excellent song, that it is worthy of the many awards that it took; including Best Original Song at the Oscar. Not be undone, but composer, Thomas Newman's soundtrack wasn't half bad, as well. Overall: 'Skyfall' is one of the best action movies I've ever seen. I thoroughly enjoy it. This 23rd film in the series is worth the title of 007. Author, Ian Fleming would be, so proud. Highly recommended."

","Both by the film's magnificence and the multitude of negative reviews for this Movie! And I'm not just saying this because I thought this was a masterful film, which it was, but because the reasoning behind these arguments is just ridiculous. From misconstruing what's actually happening in the movie to not being able to accept a change in Bond. First off, Bond wasn't made to stay the same forever, change is a real thing people, ACCEPT IT. Secondly, this is a story that's different than previous films. Skyfall is much deeper as it hits Bond's childhood and exposes his dark past. Sorry if this is too hard to comprehend so far.<br/><br/>The plot holes that exist are minor and are really only noticeable if one is really trying to bash a film without real reason. The key to a successful film is if it depicts a moving story and enthralls its viewers, and if one does nothing but to criticize a movie without an attempt at appreciation at any level is, again, appalling.<br/><br/>Away from the blind opposition, Skyfall is made great through its exceptionally well-acted cast on all sides, especially Dench's and Bardem's performances (I mean what do you expect). The cinematography is done exceptionally, because if Roger Deakins has anything to do with anything, it's gonna look beautiful, shown here at the Casino in Shanghail and especially in the building surrounded by neon lights. Thomas Newman is another veteran who does the score the justice that such an iconic theme deserves. The production design, especially between the Shanghai and Scotland scenes, adds to the momentous effects the film is able to create. The plot is more than intriguing, as it continues to develop and captivate the attention of its viewers more. Mendes has been an impressive director since '99 with American Beauty and Skyfall showcases his mastery is still applicable now.<br/><br/>Do not let the negative reviews on here push you away, Skyfall is no waste of time and will create an experience that you surely will not forget soon."
"skydiverphil","2","57","108","6 November 2012"," A random accumulation of action sequences without any storyline to connect them
","There is one good sequence in Skyfall, namely, the fight between sniper guy and Craig in Shanghai, which is shot in a hyper modern skyscraper at night, with alternating illumination from the neon display from the opposite building. Kudos to the director for this artistic image. <br/><br/>We start with a high-speed chase of some villain who's stolen a revealing list of MI6 agents through Turkey, ending up on the top of a train. It's been seen before in QOS, but OK, it's a good intro. Why Bond doesn't assist reincarnated Moneypenny in taking a better shot, given that she apparently only has one bullet in her magazine, is beyond me, as is his resurrection from a hundreds-of-feet drop first from a railroad bridge, then down a waterfall. Now we know he's Bond and all, but even Batman had to be nourished back to health now and then. Having respawned, we witness fraternity pledge Bond making Ian Fleming turn over in his grave by chugging scorpion urine. Meanwhile in London, it's Hauptsturmführer Amon Göth who's switched careers to become M's boss, offering the full defined benefit retirement package to her, while we're treated to multiple shots of the English Bulldog figure on M's desk, stubborn as obstinate as she is, and hell no, there's still work to be done in the ""Shadows"", a term that couldn't possibly stem from Batman, right? So then we have MI6 blown up, Bond breaks into M's home, drinks some more whiskey, fails boot camp, and as the logical consequence is sent to Shanghai. Batman's Scarecrow has apparently taken Q's position and outfits Bond with 1. radio and 2. gun since we're all old school now, the subtleties of irony indeed. So it's off to Shanghai and Macau for an episode of ""Fail your mission "", so let's let the sniper take his shot, do not stop him from killing watchmen, do not find out who he works for but let him fall to death anyway, let's go to the casino, drink with a prostitute transvestite, re-enact Gladiator with overweight Chinese bouncers and unusually voracious Komodo dragons, lose 4m Euros and let the Villain take you hostage in the bargain. The gay super-hacker behind it all turns out to be a former MI6 agent who's been tortured by months of sex with women, then seeks relief from the not-so-inexperienced Bond (poor Ian Fleming!), then goes Wilhelm Tell on the Bond girl, then Bond saves the day, surprise, and Blondie is locked in a panopticon complete with convenient escape tunnel to confront Mommy M about his wretched childhood, oh and he also has bad teeth. M doesn't want to talk to him, so his whole being captured only serves the story by offering him a free flight to London, where his mission, Joker-like, is to kill Mom in the courtroom where she's being grilled with icy Britishness. A tube train derails, with scenes reminiscent of Call of Duty. The old Thomas Crown trick still works, dress as a bobby amidst them and you can escape Bond. Anton Chigurh then shoots the two(!) guards that stand watch as the Prime Minister presides over M's court-martial, but Bond is quick to the scene and uses magical fire extinguishers that spew a lot of smoke to get M away to safety, for MI6's computer systems have been hacked by a guy who uses encryption that only six people in the world know of, and which the Scarecrow had invented. Interesting. I think I know who I'd arrest as my prime suspect. But no! young Q has more up his sleeve, throwing breadcrumbs at Blondie and the gang, to no avail however as they're right on the trace of Bond and M...<br/><br/>Notice how I've almost forgotten about the stolen MI6 agent list? Don't worry, though, it's all on YouTube. <br/><br/>Now for a completely different movie, ""Home Improvement"", starring James ""B"" (B for Batman), Scottish butler/nanny Alfred who lives in Scottish Wayne Manor, complete with way-too-short escape tunnel. And lo and behold, all the King's Men (MI6, the British Army, SAS etc.) could not be mobilized to the defense of Bond's mother, who this bad gay guy for whatever reason that we're never shown really wants to kill. So we board up the house with crates, stick firecrackers in doorwells and saw off shotgun barrels until the classic Apocalypse now! scene is made a pirate copy of, with a chopper and 70s music and with bad guys galore. To cut a short story short, Wayne Manor (aka Skyfall, a typically Scottish name), the boyhood home of Tuxedo B, is set ablaze by Blondie and what appears to be a chemical plant's worth of pyrotechnics hidden behind those Gaelic walls. Oh and the chopper crashes, huzzah! But all is not over in the siege of Skighe Faughlle, for Mommy and Alfred are hiding in the church (where else?) and Bond has escaped through said tunnel, which leads him straight into combat with Blondie's henchman, they both go under the frozen lake, Bond's gills enable him to survive for minutes beneath the ice and not freeze afterwards, Blondie finds Mom in the church, then offers her a double-suicide, but Bond is back again from the shivering Scottish waters and knifes Chigurh. Mommy dies too, because she's realized by now that the James Bond franchise has departed way too far from Fleming's novels. Oh and Bond is bequeathed her ceramic bulldog instead of something meaningful, inspiring, or even funny.<br/><br/>Then we're treated to a cheesy, but not so bad homage to the Connery and Moore Bond movies as a homage to 50 years of Dr. No and as a reminder to please go and buy some 50-years-of-007-merchandise, since Voldemort now runs MI6.<br/><br/>No contingent plot, no gadgets, too few Bond girls, ridiculous villain, countless unanswered questions, too much departure from realism make this the worst Bond movie alongside with The Living Daylights."

","So, we have a James Bond film that stars Judy Dench, Javier Bardem, and Ralph Fiennes, along with a song by Adele. This movie should be a success.<br/><br/>And, good enough, it is.<br/><br/>The movie stars Daniel Craig as James Bond, but, to tell the truth, it doesn't seem to be ABOUT Bond. Yes, of course, he's the reason why we want to see the film, but the plot of the movie hardly revolves around him. Rather, Dench, who plays the Mother character, has a sort of Norman Bates-like fellow trying to kill her, and has herself and Bond in a vengeance plot that affects quite a lot of innocents.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Norman Bates-like character. I love Bardem as an actor, especially the chilling role of Anton Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men"". Here, the creepiness levels are through the roof; having an unhealthy obsession with Mother and cyanide eating at his brain, he's quite a twisted, but interesting villain.<br/><br/>The references to older Bond films are genius. Everybody in the theater actually clapped when Bond's old car came out, and everybody laughed when Bond gave a cutting line about the Union Jack bulldog. And of course, Eve Moneypenny was another great throwback to the old days as well.<br/><br/>Let me talk about Bond. Whereas before we had a cheesy, perfect, and charming 007, this time we have a complex Bond who is armed with only a gun (of course, a Walther PPK) and radio. It makes this Bond seem more human (or as human as a top secret agent can be) and he does have a sort of charm and humor about him one typically associates with Sean Connery.<br/><br/>The plot itself is rather clever. While there are a few throwaway moments, like that woman working for Bardem and the new Quartermaster, they are usually enjoyable in their own right. The main plot is strong, seeing some of the inner workings of MI6 and it's connections with the British government.<br/><br/>So, combine this with classic and new Bond themes, a brilliant changing of the guard in MI6, and some big name actors, and we have one of the best Bond films to date, up there with Goldeneye and Goldfinger. It truly balances out the bad films this year, and reenergizes a classic fictional hero.<br/><br/>And frankly, I believe it deserves more than the 8.1 IMDb ranking it has at the time this review is being written."
"seder-4","1","38","69","22 November 2012"," Took everything that bond was and threw it in the trash
","Where do I start, Well I am a huge bond fan and I really found this movie to be a crap to my face and the franchise. the Craig movies in general were made as reboots as an answer to beat out the Bourne Identity movies which were beating bond in the box office. I am not a huge fan of Craig's bond movies but i don't mind Craig. The movies are just too far from what i loved about the bond movies. Going this pseudo realistic route is just outright stupid.<br/><br/>Anyway let's review this crap. The actors themselves are great in the movie. All of them are fine actors who are doing their job. The story itself is horrible and for what it is, poorly executed . Bond isn't saving the world in this, just trying to protect M. <br/><br/>Let's talk about Q. I actually didn't mind him. As much as i thought i would hate a young Q he worked as a character. until they decided to render him useless. Q gives bond 2 gadgets 1 being a gun that is attached to his DNA and only he can use(comes in use once). 2 being a small button that transmits his position if hes in trouble(this is not a gadget that is new). This is IT! Bond asks ""that's it"" and Q replies and i swear this is the worst thing said in the movie and i almost left because of it ""What did you expect, an exploding pen? We don't do that sort of stuff anymore"" That basically mocked Goldeneye (My favorite bond movie)the gadget used in a great scene in the movie. I felt as if they were mocking the fans who wanted gadgets. Q then says please don't break it 007. Keep in mind Q just met bond. How does he know bond is usually breaking gadgets. I did like how Q is now able to talk to bond during missions. that i thought was a good addition.<br/><br/>They also introduce the car from the first 007 movie ""Dr. No"". But it doesn't fit in the time line as that car is fitted with the gadgets used in that movie. The movie took place in the 60's that could put bond to be around 80 years old since the new movie takes place in present day. He does win a similar car with casino Royal i believe but there is no way he outfitted it for use because there was now Q lab during these new movies. <br/><br/>The villain played by Javier Bardem is a decent bad guy but he is totally a rewritten ""006"" from Goldeneye. He has almost the same reason for being bad. problem with his character is he was introduced way too late into the movie and get's almost no screen time. You never really get ""him"" as a character. You don't fully understand him. He's just thrown in their and has a couple clever lines and then dies.(very anticlimactically)Anyway they decided to keep the bond tradition and give the villain some kind of scar. But it was done with Horrible CGI.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of CGI I feel that it is lazy, ugly and really distracting to a movie. If you are going to go with effects, use practical effects. Anyway this whole section has to do with the action and horrible CGI. From falling people to Komodo dragons to Helicopters. For a movie that is trying to be realistic, having a komodo dragon come out (looking like it is straight out of a video game) and eat a thug that was fighting bond is just the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. It was seriously the ugliest CGI used through t the movie. There was also an intro scene with a motorcycle chase i have to point out, that had the worst Green screen when the camera would show bond riding the bike. It looked awful. Also who ever thought silhouette shots looked cool is an idiot especially overused ones.<br/><br/>There's another scene where bond goes to his old house...yes i said his old house. They did it they tried delving into more of his back story to make is feel for his character and humanize him more. I cannot stand this. I loved that most of his past was a mystery. this adds so much more to your own imagination. Well that's killed instantly as they tell you his parents names and a bunch more i did not want to hear. Anyway they use this house for what I like to call the ""Home Alone"" scene and the WORST scene in the movie. Bond who is known for taking out hordes of people on his own is subjected to hiding and planting traps to kill about 9 people. It was ridiculous and so hard to watch.<br/><br/>That scene leads onto another scene where bond chases the villain but then a thug and bond drop into the ice (where realistic bond should have hypothermia or frozen to death) and then leads to another scene in a church where M dies and you are suppose to feel bad but you just don't. Because the movie spoke about her being replaced anyway. So in any shape or form she wouldn't be in the next movie. anyway the villain dies with a knife throw to the back and he's done. like i said, anticlimactically.<br/><br/>After This movie I can tell you I don't want to see another new bond movie unless they go back to their roots. Maybe if they get Christopher Nolan considering he really wants to make one and he understands what bond should be. Also he doesn't use CGI.I give this ""5 Moonrakers out of 5"" just kidding 1/10 stars. Enjoy giving them money and making them realize this is what sells."
"alcibiades-ej","1","34","61","2 December 2012"," Pitfall
","Until Skyfall, Daniel Craig, as James Bond, was an inspired characterization. In the earlier two Craig/Bond movies we had a glimpse of the inner Bond, along with a manly grittiness which lent a degree of realism to the character.<br/><br/>In Skyfall, Bond is barely recognizable as our hero. Indeed, his appearance is that of an aged alcoholic. He reeks of weakness and his incompetence is manifest. He undergoes testing to confirm his mastery of the tools of his trade--and fails utterly. He cannot even hit a man-size target with a handgun at 20-30 feet.<br/><br/>The best that can be said of Skyfall is that the first half of the movie was reasonably interesting. The remainder was boring and unforgivably predictable.<br/><br/>My girlfriend observed that it was as if the director loathed the James Bond character. Consistently, Craig/Bond was shown in the worst possible light: His clothes were ill-fitting and from a bygone age; he was weepy, unsure of himself, and a physical wreck. His visage was of one who had recently spent long masturbatory hours at a peep show.<br/><br/>Finally, even in a Bond movie, it is an unacceptable assault on our credulity for our hero to be wounded by one round to the shoulder, another round to the body from a high velocity rifle, take an uncontrolled fall for a couple of hundred meters into water--and survive."
"RocketeerFlyer","9","13","20","1 March 2013"," Over Hyped? YES...Best Bond Film? NO WAY...But it's Very Different & I Loved It!
","OK...There's a lot of 007 Fans here (or not) 1217 Reviews & Counting, Wow!!!<br/><br/>There's a number of people here perhaps looking for attention who are clearly NOT Bond fans.<br/><br/>Is it the Best Bond film ever? NO WAY!!! Many of the Press & Reviewers did get caught up in the 50th Anniversary hype.<br/><br/>""Goldfinger"" Is the Best Bond Film Ever (it's pretty much the perfect Bond film in my eyes) This is closely followed by ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", ""Goldeneye"", ""OHMSS"", ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" (my first Bond film seen in a Cinema), ""The Living Daylights"" & ""Casino Royale""<br/><br/>Followed by this film ""Skyfall"" which just pips ""Moonraker"" (a crazy cash in on Star Wars but God Bless Cubby for it! Entertainment with a capital 'E' that was), ""LTK"" & ""Quantum of Solace""<br/><br/>How in the world reviewers can rate this a 1/10 or 2/10 is beyond me.<br/><br/>Yes it was over-hyped due to it's 50th Anniversary and it has a very different feel & look to every other Bond previously seen but I think this was deliberate...you didn't like it? fair enough but 1/10 or 2/10 get real! There has NEVER been a truly poor Bond film IMHO. I'm not a huge fan of ""A View to a Kill"" (Roger was past it by then) or ""Octopussy"" when compared to the rest in the series but boy are these still hugely entertaining and worth a decent 6 or 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Yes there are Plot Holes here there is no denying this (but many many films have this...you just have to go with the flow) Do they forget about the stolen list of agents on the Hard Drive? (which as one reviewer pointed out has been done many times before) YES They simply went on to concentrate on the threat to London & M? but who cares! I agree they should have tied up that situation....God help us if they the secret services ever did this for real!<br/><br/>Next unreal moment...Bond gets shot and falls from a moving train into a river. OK, no one would ever survive this...No way No how, but do I care? Nope because the film would have ended right there and then (unless M took up the role, now that would have been a truly different Bond film) <br/><br/>The Bond films (for the most part) have always been FANTASY Spy Thrillers. <br/><br/>Would Silva have escaped MI5 / MI6 in real life? No way...but who cares! again the film would have pretty much ended there and then.<br/><br/>The Komodeo Dragon Scene...Crazy, yeah really (even Bond I think does a double take or gestures to the villain that there's one heading for him) But again who cares! probably a fun crazy homage to ""Live & Let Die"" (crocodiles) it was a spoof scene within a Bond film! kinda liked that in a crazy way.<br/><br/>It looks like 007 could be heading back to fantasy land which is Great!<br/><br/>Someone I liked was Silva (the villain) over-the-top, crazy and brilliant like the old fashioned Bond villains but boy was he underused, he doesn't show up until approx an hour in, then goes missing, the story is structured like this so I understand it but it's a waste of a super villain...for those wondering why he had that crazy looking blonde hair, well you need to see the film again & listen up.<br/><br/>Q...many didn't like the kid, I had no problem with him, in fact it's probably geeks like this that may well save us one day. If i were in control of MI5 / MI6 or the Pentagon i'd head-hunt the best computer programming geeks out there (or 100) I Miss Desmond Llwelyen though (Legendary Q)<br/><br/>Moneypenny...personally I loved the way they've introduced her. Some didn't like her but I don't understand why, great chemistry with Bond & she's truly gorgeous.<br/><br/>It's a shame the main Bond Girl had only 15 minutes of screen time (or thereabouts) I could see why as this story really didn't need her after that but her death was still a surprise to me (especially the way it played out)...It's been awhile since we lost a Bond girl (does Gemma Arterton count? if so then OK not so long)<br/><br/>This Bond Film works...it's different...it looks great...there's less action (it's true) & focuses much of it's running time on political spy issues similar to those seen on TV's ""24"" & ""Spooks"" If the next film is like this then yes i'd be a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Hoping we get the gadgets & Bond girls back, some unusual locations, some out-there villains & plots to destroy the world again!<br/><br/>This was a film giving us some background to Bond's past & pretty much to give Judi Dench as 'M' a neat and fitting send off. I loved the Bond opening sequence (Bikes & Train) and the end sequence is highly unusual for a Bond film but I loved it as well as Albert Finney's character (hope he shows up in a cameo for the next one) Oh and welcome aboard Ralph Finnes :-)<br/><br/>My Rating is an up up and away 9/10...Forget those 1/10 reviews they just want to get to the top of the IMDb worst reviews list which is just sad."
"thealmightybasstardo","1","28","49","27 November 2012"," I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a rusty fork... Contains spoilers!
","So, this was it then, supposedly the greatest Bond film of them all... what a disappointment it was. It was the worst film I've seen since Inception and quite frankly that's saying something (in the time betwixt them I have watched The Room, Birdemic and Highschool Musical. So what was wrong with it then? let me show you... First off the opening scene which on paper must have read like one of Archer's wet dreams but on screen seemed far too contrived for my liking. Car chase, to bike chase over the rooftops, to train top confrontation. It was simply too much thrown at the audience in too short a space of time, even Michael Bay would have felt ashamed for it. Then after the insultingly gratuitous action that theme music by the risible Adelle where she never seems to be able to find the right notes to conclude her melody. Oh well, surely it'll pick up a bit now though you must be thinking? Well, don't get your hopes up! Next we discover some lack of originality as someone not fit for duty is called into service (anyone remember The Avengers earlier this year?) and a gun that only fires for Bond (the lawgiver from Dredd, also out earlier this year?)... anyway, the fun doesn't stop there as there's a wonderful scene where Bond fights an assassin in Japan with some digitally projected jellyfish in the background that were much more interesting than the fight itself, probably included as by then the director had realised how weak all of the plot fluffing was... Anyways, following on from the scene with the jumping on a poorly rendered CGI kommodo dragon (which was this movie's attempt at the Indy fridge scene) we eventually get to meet the villain. Sadly this scene is so filled with inappropriately forced innuendo that it really detracted from the meaningless rat story and the unrealistically stealthy helicopters but never mind. The scene in the London Underground looked like it might actually turn out OK until they removed the signs from the escalators that prevent you from sliding down them for the sake of making it more unrealistic I suppose. Unsure of how to make the scene worse the director simply drops a train on top of Bond. Maybe the director thought Die Hard 4 was a work of art? Whatever the reason I eventually sat through enough to be at the end where the bad guy rocks up in a helicopter blaring music, much reminding me of a certain Nam flick and also... The Avengers (out earlier this year). Sigh. Then finally the big climax, the payoff for the whole 2+ hours of my life that I'm never going to get back again - a quick unspectacular knife in the back and Bond gets to keep a cheap bulldog toy. Whooo. I am never going to watch another new Bond film again, this was enough to kill the whole franchise for me. I would have thought that for around $200m you could make a better film than that but it seems that I was wrong and Tommy Wiseau's farce that was The Room seems increasingly like $6m well spent..."

For me this was the best bond movie, it is certainly a bounce back from the last bond movie, but i am not going to get into that right now. Daniel Craig plays an amazing bond, rugged and tough, how it should be. I was unsure of Javier Bardem as a villain but man he is good.

","Okay, since I've watched all of the Bond movies to date, I didn't want to miss this one either, especially since many critics gave it a high score rating. Well, this is the absolute last time I've listened to those sellouts.<br/><br/>Where should I begin? The opening theme performed by Adele is irritating. The tune makes my head crack. And what's up with the lyrics? ""Let the sky fall, when it crumbles, we will stand tall, face it all together"" - really, Adele? Couldn't you have found even cheesier lyrics?<br/><br/>Then there's the plot. What plot, you may ask? Exactly. There is no story. We're introduced by Naomi shooting Bond who then falls motionless into the water and is carried by the water down stream. The bad guy who Bond was fighting and who carries a list of undercover agents escapes (did Naomi only have 1 friggin bullet in a semi-auto gun?? Apparently yes...). Regardless, Bond somehow survives (we don't know how, the story never reveals that mystery) and once he learns that the MI6 building has been under attack, he returns to England to resume his agent duty. He is then led to Silva (the bad guy) who appears to be a hacking genius and can change the stock prices or detonate a building just by pressing a button on a keyboard. Well, if he's such a criminal mastermind who literally controls the entire world with only his keyboard and mouse, then why the fudge does he go on a head-to-head combat with Bond in the end?? Someone please explain this to me as I seriously don't see any logical points in this.<br/><br/>Also, the ""plot"" begins with a list being stolen and is dominated by hacking geniuses such as Silva and Q throughout the film. However, in the end, we have no idea whether the list was recovered or not, we have no idea what happened to Q or his computer-whiz associates - it's as if these things never really existed. Also, somewhere at the climax of the ""plot"" we are introduced to a character named Kincade who is supposed to be Scottish. Where's the Scottish accent then...?<br/><br/>Thirdly, the amount of foreshadowing this movie contains is just hilarious. For example, Bond gets a gun from Q who tells him the gun can only be used by Bond because of DNA sensors of some sorts. Yes, you guessed it, there is then a scene in the movie when the bad guy has a clear shot of Bond with his own gun. Of course it doesn't fire and the bad guy is dragged by a giant lizard-like creature into the shadows and killed. Another foreshadowing is when Kincade displays all of the available guns to Bond and says that if he should run out of bullets, there's always the trusty knife. Well, here's a $1000 question for you - guess who this exact same knife kills in the end...?<br/><br/>This is by far the absolute worst Bond movie I have ever seen. There is no plot, there are no emotions to be invoked in the viewer (I couldn't feel for any of the characters, not even when M died in the end), there is no main theme - everything just seems to be randomly put together. And with a budget of 150 million dollars, what else can you expect....?"
"jimyliverpool","1","37","68","9 December 2012"," :*( money grabbing. Sadly what is now expected from Hollywood.
","I am both a Bond fan and an aspiring writer. If I watch a movie it needs to look good, have an exciting story line and well-developed characters. I have never reviewed on here before but felt a need to counter all the people that have been totally drawn in by the endless advertisement and flashy selling techniques that are what this movie depends on. <br/><br/>Hollywood movies spend 200 million on equipment,cameramen, editors, impressive locations, big explosions and a director who, when asked in the interview for the job ""what do you think about much loved Bond movies that are adored around the globe?"" likely answered ""they're rubbish"".<br/><br/>Why is so much money available for all this but the writing seems to have been done by a few guys thankful to be given 3 meals a day to keep going?<br/><br/>A lot of reviews on here have already been through the huge list of plot flaws, far more than you would normally expect in a big budget movie. But to add to that how many distractions do you need from following the story line? Its not enough that you can't turn around for an advertisement for months before the release but then during the movie you can't help but notice a Daniel Craig in the peak of physical fitness drinking Heineken.<br/><br/>And on the subject of Daniel Craig I don't think he's a bad actor but how many times do you need his top off? Not being sexist. Fair is fair Bond films normally have lots of flesh in so why not something for the ladies? But this just gets distracting. He's staring in the mirror with his top off, then he's sitting in bed with stubble, drinking Heineken, with his top off; then there's a lengthy shot panning up a sparkly looking building to a private swimming pool where he sits with water dripping off him, with his top off for a good 30 seconds not doing anything; then Moneypenny is treating his wounds with his top off while he tries some clumsy flirting. Oh. . . did I mention a long solemn stare in the mirror? With his top off? <br/><br/>Characterization. Are you writing for a bloody soap? (trying not to swear). The bad guy: ""oh, i'm gay and making jokes"", ""now i'm angry at M"" , ""Now i'm depressed because I took my teeth out"", ""now i'm manically laughing"", ""now i'm running away underground and don't really have a personality"", ""now i'm angry for the rest of the movie and have forgotten the characteristics I was given in my opening scene"". <br/><br/>I was just waiting for them to discover that M was actually his mum who he had sex with and James Bond is his incest created son. The acting was good but the way his character was written would have worked in a soap.<br/><br/>Moneypenny was obvious and clearly there just so the writers could think they had been clever in 'keeping her secret' till the end even though it was obvious after a couple scenes. The Bond girl was an afterthought to try and keep a male audience as was obvious by killing her 20 mins after introducing her. We live in Britain, not just England, Hollywood has never done America any favors when it comes to being viewed as ignorant by everyone else. All in all a somewhat clumsy attempt to make a general action film, only using the name of bond to generate more money."

"thefilmdiscussion","10","84","168","9 November 2012"," ""Skyfall"" drops proudly among the greatest Bond films
","Daniel Craig has now starred in the two greatest James Bond movies ever made (let the criticism begin), and although he also starred in the worst (""Quantum of Solace""), it wasn't all his fault and can be forgiven. But enough comparing, because ""Skyfall"" needs no comparison, and would embarrass its competitors anyway. Sam Mendes has delivered a riveting thrill machine of a movie, with a rich character at its heart – James Bond. That's right, the cold, calculating killer reveals even more of his soft side as we delve deep into his past. The emotional feeling we get from the famed agent is entirely due to Craig's acting, who has brought more to the psychological side of Bond than the rest of the players combined. Sure, his films may lack some of the quirk and humor of the earlier offerings, but the character is still finding himself (six years ago he didn't even know what drink to order). And trust me, there is plenty of humor, and a dash of quirk, in this fantastic entry. ""Skyfall"" gives us a compelling story that we can actually wrap our heads around, as it is nearly as simple as revenge. We get a wildly sinister villain from Javier Bardem (who reminds me of Ledger's turn as Joker, and Bardem is equally Oscar-worthy), a multi-dimensional M from Judi Dench, the introduction of Q and Money Penny, as well as some throwbacks towards the films of old. Directed by Oscar-winner Mendes and filmed with a master's touch by Roger Deakins, this is a Bond film that redefines Bond films (after ""Casino Royale"" rejuvenated them in 2006) and offers up something for everyone. Two amazingly choreographed (and photographed) action scenes and Adele's soul-stirring theme song, with the accompanying and superb opening credits, are the icing on the cake. So I suppose the 23rd time's the charm. ""Skyfall"" drops strongly in first place as the best of Bond.<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond"

"A_Different_Drummer","7","41","77","11 September 2013"," Not a Bond film, this is the Anti-Bond film
","It is one thing to deconstruct a film genre, a genre that has reached the level of dynasty, to make it better. It is an entirely different matter to do so merely because you can, to show off your own power, and to leave the genre in tatters. Sam Mendes is incapable of making a film that is not dazzling to the eye. He is a visual artist of the highest calibre and possibly one of the greatest directors living today. Similarly the lead actors are incapable of delivering a performance that is less than stellar given the scripts they are handed. But the praise ends there. This is not a Bond film. This is an anti-Bond film. Notice kind reader that every task Bond is handed in the script ends in failure. Don't shoot the messenger, just watch the film. Notice that at some point Mendes became momentarily self-aware of what he was doing by bringing, out of nowhere, using the magic of film, the Aston Martin DB7 from a half-century ago, fully fuelled and ready to go, with the old Bond theme for accompaniment. But he just couldn't go through with it. The moment (the self-aware moment) passed and he went back to Plan A, the Anti-Bond film, and, in one of the most gratuitous but Freudian moments ever seen, blew the car to bits. Just like he blew the Bond formula to bits. I know what you are thinking. You thinking that an artist has license to do all this if the end result is entertaining and satisfying. True. But this film is as satisfying to the viewer as a car wreck. Visuals aside, it is hollow and leave a strange taste in the palate. Shame."

","I went into the theater with such high expectations & when I left I was disgusted with the film. Yes, it is an okay action movie but it is NOT a 007 film. The last two movies have been bad but this one is so much worse. If your a true bond fan you will more than likely be disappointed with this film. It holds no elements of a Bond film. It's missing all the KEY elements that all the other Bond films have, like the other reviews have posted, there are no gadgets, no girls, no plot, no humor.<br/><br/>They bring in a young Q & he issues James his gun & a radio transmitter & then has the nerve to make fun of gadgets & says that they have done away with gadgets. I thought he was joking! How can it be a Bond film without at least one gadget?! Throughout the film I kept thinking, ""They would never do this in a real Bond Film or That would never happen in a 007 movie!"" The girl? Where is the girl, where is the romance? They spend 5 minutes on a girl then she gets shot in the head & he does nothing about it, doesn't even blink an eye. The ending, since when does the villain get what he wants? The villain wanted M dead & that is what he got. Bond didn't save the day.<br/><br/>This film is just sad. I really keep hoping that the next film will be a real 007 movie but they keep messing it up so badly. The film critics that gave this film good reviews should be ashamed of themselves. I have come to the conclusion that Bond is DEAD, they will never make another good film."
"tomwalker1-510-253215","10","76","154","24 October 2012"," Skyfall - A Masterpiece
","So, last night sitting in the Royal Albert Hall and literally trembling with excitement... the MGM lion roared... Two hours and twenty five minutes practically flew by.<br/><br/>Hyperbole aside, Skyfall is a bonafide masterpiece.<br/><br/>Whilst most are familiar with the capsule synopsis that's been floating around since late last year (which really doesn't need to be repeated AGAIN), the decision to mine the relationship between Bond and M is a masterstroke. Judi Dench and Daniel Craig have unbelievable chemistry together (you utterly believe they've been working day-in-day-out together for years), and the banter they share as they set off on their redemptive journey together is the beating heart of the film. <br/><br/>Emotionally, this is the most mature of any of the Bond films, and draws upon some of the greatest (yet curiously overlooked) Bond moments. There are shrewd elements of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Licence To Kill and The World Is Not Enough in Skyfall's DNA, and the central relationship between Bond and at this point a mother figure of an M (who he will mercilessly kill to protect) is beautifully realised. Suffice to say the final act in which Bond and M face their fears and demons is *shattering* in every sense of the word and lifts the film into the highest echelons of the series.<br/><br/>Of course, the rest of the cast are every bit as brilliant as the press reviews have stated. Javier Bardem turns in frankly an award-worthy performance as Raoul Silva. Not in memory has there been a Bond villain whose determination is as terrifying as his character. Silva is alternately camp, hilarious and horrifying. His screen time is admittedly limited, but he makes every gesture, word and action count tenfold. His introduction is just sublime, modulating between flirtatious, businesslike and viciously brutal with as little as an eye movement. Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe bring a refreshing touch to the Bond girl routine, actually adding presence rather than simply visual appeal. The new MI6 crew are also a HIGHLY welcome addition. Ben Whishaw clearly had a hoot in the role of the 21st century Q (his interactions with Bond are one of the many highlights) and Ralph Fiennes seems born to fit into the MI6/Bond world.<br/><br/>There will *certainly* be those who will balk at the fact Skyfall doesn't cling ultra-tight to the Bond formula. Well, thank God for that! Sam Mendes and the writing team intelligently pull the conventions apart, before reassembling them just enough to be recognisable (with a satisfying wink) to the fans but not enough to alienate newcomers to the franchise. The film is primarily a 'buddy movie' of sorts, but a captivating one that exhibits all of the best parts of Bond fitting around a riveting political/spy thriller whose central Wikileaks-esque story is ripped from the headlines.<br/><br/>It's the Bond film I've always been waiting for - and hopefully the team behind it aren't planning on a single collaborative effort. Skyfall is something very special. A cursory look around the room saw faces contorted in rage, horror and devastation, but also the undercurrent of humour generated a thunderous round of applause whenever skillfully applied. Judi Dench and Daniel Craig give BLISTERING performances (a finest hour for them both) and I only hope some of the more priggish award ceremonies actually pay attention to that fact this time.<br/><br/>An unashamed 10/10. Skyfall will be a LEGENDARY Bond film. Without question."

It actually worked.<br/><br/>Not too much explosions (well there are..) not too much cgi-crap etc. and it got cooler every minute.<br/><br/>Really interesting bond for a long time.

"ekhg","1","26","47","26 November 2012"," What's the point in strangling a guy that already cannot breathe?
","My first reaction after watching the movie was ""Wow, was this really the new Bond?"". I'm a huge JB fan, but this one's so bad on so many levels that I don't even know where to start with my critical remarks. A lot of discussion has been going on lately about the direction in which the Bond series was moving, and I could forgive the screenwriters for turning one of my favorite heroes into a pathetic drunkard who badly needs target practice. But the problem is that the whole plot in Skyfall is so absurd and inconsistent that the story looks more like a parody of JB. At the beginning we learn that a list of secret agents has been stolen and MI6 has to get it back at all costs. But at some point this thread is simply discontinued - and there's no mention of the missing agent list whatsoever! Oh well, who cares. Now we have to deal with some maniacal ex-00 agent with a bad hairdo and a grudge against M. He's the uber villain, super hacker, criminal mastermind and obviously wants revenge, but because the movie must be about 2,5 h long, he obviously doesn't want M. dead too early. Otherwise he could have just blown up the MI6 headquarters with her inside or he could have broken into her apartment (if Bond can do it, why not the uber-villain?) and shot her in the head. And even when he's so close to killing her during the session with the politicians, he simply walks away because, what, there's some white smoke in the room (?). Earlier, his plan was apparently to get captured by MI6, but again, what was the point? To have a little chit-chat with M. and show her his denture? But there's too many illogical points to mention them all. One of the funniest scenes is when Bond strangles one of Silva's henchmen in the pond. Nothing wrong with that, except they were both under water, so what's the point if the guy already couldn't breathe... The whole plot was truly preposterous and that's why I was hugely disappointed with the latest Bond. What a waste of time. Recommended only if you can turn off thinking for more than 2 hours."

Oh yea James Bond does not drink Heineken. License To Kill was the last great Bond, yes I know who played Bond, but this was the last of the true Bond style.

"leonkramer","1","31","58","21 November 2012"," They Didn't Even Try
","Wow, this movie sucked from A-Z.<br/><br/>Since James Bond plays in the present time and you can't see space ships or flying cars, I suppose that we live in the same reality. Yet Skyfall differs from our world so you can only get the feeling the producers just did an extremely awful job researching.<br/><br/>Skyfall reminds me of Casino Royale. There insanely rich guys play poker for all their money in a setting, in which any skill that exists in the game of poker was eliminated because the initial blinds are insanely high already. Just poor research, but was it a one time flaw?<br/><br/>In Skyfall the plot is about an encoded list that has been stolen and obviously has been decoded by someone, who must be the very best hacker on this planet by far, i.e. an former 00-agent. However, anyone who spent only some effort in computer technology and encryption knows that there are very common encryption mechanisms that are just not decipherable in the current state and that are not even the most advanced.<br/><br/>So, we can only assume that MI6 just sucks ass at using computers. Okay, are at least the bad guys smarter? <br/><br/>You decide: Bad guy enters a skyscraper in Shanghai, kills some guards and takes the lift to some higher level. There he gets in position with a sniper having a great view to an nearby apartment in which some Asian guys walk around. Then an old guy enters the apartment and sits down, having the bad guy in his back. He, the bad guy, pulls the trigger and kills the old Asian dude. Now you think the other Asian guys should be shocked and panic, but no, apparently they are part of the plan and instantly carry the dead guy somewhere. Well, now what the f**k is the logic behind this? Was killing that guy with a sniper from another skyscraper and killing a couple of guards on the way up easier than just killing the guy within the other apartment? Probably not, but hell, it looks damn interesting.<br/><br/>The whole movie is the same way. It's so far from reality, not cleverly done at all. The producers don't even try to explain anything to the viewers. Nothing makes sense. Who the f**k cares? It's James Bond, dude! Guarantee for success."
"Tooly01","4","38","73","4 November 2012"," Skyfallen flat on Its face. Don't believe the hype.
","I was eagerly awaiting Skyfall and after watching it I am totally disappointed. I was really pleased with Daniel Craigs Bond in Casino Royal and Quantum as he had been brought up to date and gave Bourne a run for his money.<br/><br/>Why oh why was Mendes given this, this is not a reboot its a reversion to the 60's Bond but brought into modern day. The cheesy retro theme just does not work unless you are a hardcore Bond fan. I mean come on, komodo dragons eating the bad guy...<br/><br/>I just didn't get it, was this a stand alone homage to the Bond films? <br/><br/>Picky I know, but Why would the new Bond drive round in Sean Connery's Aston Martin? There is only one Bond therefore that car wouldn't have been created with the ejecter seat etc. <br/><br/>There is hardly any action when broken down into the sum of its parts, don't expect the high octane fight scenes of Casino Royal/Quantum because they simply aren't there.<br/><br/>The ending is rushed and disappointing. The film is average at best and in my view taken a step back. The only saving grace was Javier Bardem, without him the film would have skyfallen flat.<br/><br/>I've given it a four as its a film that Bond fans of yester year will enjoy due to the nostalgic references. But take that away and its no Casino Royal, and I feel it's taking Bond in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>It begs the question film critics, what your reviews had been had it not been the Bond franchises 50th birthday."
"consummatedata","4","29","54","10 November 2012"," Bond. Blah Bond
","This isn't a classic Bond film or even a good film.  Bond films are exciting and sexy. Villains plot world domination.  Settings are exotic. Even the weaker movies have memorable set pieces  and scenes so well executed that they transcend their genre. I defy  anyone to list 2 scenes in Skyfall they'd watch again and again.  This Bond aims for gritty and emotionally grown up but fails to create  a consistent world. It makes no sense.  It starts to fall apart at the end of a well shot opening scene. M  chooses to place the success of the mission on an inexperienced agent,  Eve, shooting from miles away at a moving train rather than trust her  favorite agent WHO HAS NEVER FAILED, ordering her to ""Take the shot.""  WtF? In that case, why not 2 shots? Or 10? Kill them both and guarantee  success? M loses credibility before the film begins. Also, Bond can  hear the order (we think) through his earpiece but makes no effort to  give Eve a clean shot. Why? The way Mendes shoots it, everything is  unclear and frustrating. Oh, and in this new gritty Bond, he gets shot,  falls several hundred feet, gets swept over a waterfall but survives.  With a sore shoulder.  Next, lots of people drive around London in cars. They frown. It rains.  Sometimes they get into the cars or out of them. They walk into  buildings and along corridors. They hand each other folders and talk in  raised voices on the telephone. The pace is hotting up.  Meanwhile, in a homage to Bourne 2 (almost every scene reminds you of a  recent action flick) Bond has a new personality and instead of being  Bond, he's 'vulnerable' a beach bum who drinks beer and doesn't shave.   But, wait! Bond IS back. Sort of. 40 minutes in London while people  talk and get in and out of cars and look at computers. He wears  trainers and sweatpants and jogs on a treadmill and they have meetings  and use computers. The big plot device is that someone is a bit cross  with M and wants to punish her.   Bond, still scruffy and unshaven, goes to China, in a beautifully shot  scene. Bond let's the bad guy assassinate some other guy. Why? Who?  Dunno. No one seems to.   Now Bond has a shave. Does this symbolize something? Maybe. It might  just mean the casino has a no facial hair policy.  Bond meets a beautiful woman whose life has tragically been lost to the  sex slave trade. If she helps him Bond promises to save her. She dies 5  minutes later. It's his fault. He makes a quip about it. Eh? This is  the new emotionally grown up Bond the movie has just spent an hour  setting up?? In a new first, Bond comes across as a borderline sex  pervert. He surprises this terrified, sex-slave woman in the shower? In  any other Bond movie I'd accept it. In this Bond world I thought it  presumptuous and wondered if she'd call a date rape helpline.  Underused Baddie island. Interesting one-take baddie entrance but the  style overpowers the words. Bond hints at previous homosexual  experience. I couldn't care less one way or another, but the moment  took me out of the film and I found myself thinking ""Craig does look a  bit camp sometimes, like a man who spends too much time getting facials  and working out at the gym.' The homo-erotic 'tension' doesn't go  anywhere. It isn't referenced again.  We catch the baddie and go back to London. The inquiry scenes continue  to set up this new Bond world, but they forget to make them  interesting. Dench quotes Tennyson. Really? I'd like to see that being  reported in the papers next day. The greatest spy leak in history and  she's quoting poetry? Sack her. She's out of touch.  A 2nd 'action' scene as Bond chases the villain in the underground.  Bond catches the villain but in a stunning 'twist' an explosion causes  a train to come off the tracks and explode through a wall. Is this  gritty, grown up and emotionally mature, or a pantomime? The villain  knew months in advance the exact spot Bond would catch him and the  exact moment a train would be passing and blow it up... and that the  train would be empty? Right.  Aston Martin, nostalgia time. We established 2 films ago that this  rebooted Bond has no history. Now he has a car from 50 years ago?? Do  the writers at least integrate the car into the plot or drive it  forward? Nope. We're meant to just enjoy and go 'Look! The car!'  Last scene. No volcanoes, Fort Knox or world domination here. A shoot  out. In a cottage.   M dies. Good. The world will be safer without her. Lazenby's Bond may  be derided, but when he holds his dead wife and cries at the end of  OHMSS, the scene still works today. I don't buy the Skyfall scene at  all. When sex slave girl dies, Bond couldn't care less. He makes a  distasteful quip. When M dies, Bond gets all teary. Why? Maybe because  it's the end of the film?   The last few minutes are OK. Fiennes, Wishaw and Harris are all good  additions to the series and there is hope for the next film. But why  are we rebooting a series rebooted 2 movies ago? Did they decide Casino  Royale didn't work? It feels like directorial ego. And it makes no  sense: weren't Q and Moneypenny and M around when Bond drove his Aston  Martin? In this new Bond world it seems not.  I'd forgotten how much I care about the Bond franchise until I saw  Skyfall. Keeping it alive is a big responsibility. They need to do  better, fast, and understand what makes Bond... James Bond."

","I'm having a hard time expressing myself when it comes to this movie. It was a great movie all in all, but I feel like there's something missing. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem played the villain fantastically, the way he spoke and acted gave you chills and made you believe that there was something beneath his facade. (I don't think it's worth mentioning that Daniel Craigs acting was good, that has already been acknowledged).<br/><br/>After almost two hours in, I felt that I had so many questions unanswered and I started to worry how the movie was going to answer all of them in just half an hour. But I wasn't disappointed. Yet I was still hoping for something more, in a way.<br/><br/>There was just bits missing that would have made the film so much more better (even though it was great). For example getting to know more about Raoul Silvas life would have given him a stronger role in the movie. But I believe that the thing that i was the most disappointed about was Q. Bringing the character back after a few years sure brings peoples hopes up. And I was really expecting the cool gadgets that we've seen in the earlier movies. It was always fantastic to see the awesome stuff that a 007 got access to that made the spy life seem so cool. But in this movie I feel like they under-did his role a bit. A gun responding to fingerprints is cool, but the last time we saw Q, Bond got an invisible car with rocket launchers and a ring that could break glass. Sure they try to make the movies more realistic today, but I still feel that giving him a bigger role would have brought the movie up a bit.<br/><br/>Although I don't want to complain to much. The movie was great, go see it, you will like it and its a bit darker side than the previous films."

I was really, really looking forward to Skyfall, but wound up being sorely disappointed. So many plot holes, unexplained outrageous happenings, cheesy moments, *witty* banter lines that wound up flat-lining and a reversal in evolution for the Bond character, that I wound up leaving the theater feeling extremely disgruntled. <br/><br/>There were a few things I did like about the movie, including Ralph Fiennes' character, and how he was brought in. I liked learning about Bond's past a little bit, and I loved the Astin Martin.<br/><br/>I'm glad the movie is doing well, and I'm glad that many people seem to be liking it.

","For all the money and talent available to make a Bond film Skyfall comes off as phony and weak as any of them ever made. Whereas Moonraker was silly guilty pleasure Skyfall is just silly without the guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>The most significant line in the movie spoken by the new Q (a god-awfully written character) when he states that he could ""do more damage with his PC by 6:00 AM while in his pajamas"" than Bond could do in days of field work. This line represents the attitude of the writers. They feel that they can just write anything and since they wrote it on their PC it is wonderful.<br/><br/>If the writers ever did go out into the field and do field work they would know that it is impossible to just magically make a gas explosion timed to go off when M has her car stopped on the bridge. And just why was M's car stopped? No explanation is given...there was no attempt at a set-up of a terror threat (or else that was edited out).<br/><br/>The writers would also know that it is impossible to just magically have a ""virus"" program suddenly open all doors, etc., in a building. They would also know that Q is acting like a rank amateur plugging in an unknown PC into the whole network without even contemplating that this may be a bad move. Way too coincidental but ...hey...when you wake up and just magically type magical characters then it is all so easy for villains to do this!<br/><br/>The end of the movie is actually one of the more atrocious Bond endings ever. It is pure video game fantasy. Let's have an isolated building in an isolated area be taken by assault and we will...over a series of very staged scenes...blow up room after room culminating with sending a helicopter into the building for final destruction.<br/><br/>Then...somehow on a beautiful chilly day in Scotland...at night...the moor is iced over! And not just thin ice...noooooooo...it is ""breakeable only by bullets"" ice. Not only is it night and iced over when one is below the surface of the ice one can see upwards perfectly.<br/><br/>To cap it off...after escaping from the water Bond makes it to the chapel to save M...and he is completely dry. He is completely composed like he is ready to order a martini. No hint of hypothermia here! And he throws a knife with such force from across a room that it impales perfectly in the back of the villain killing the villain in seconds! Just like in ""Skyfall...the Video Game!""<br/><br/>Given the run time of the film there are massive amounts of other inanities that can be pointed out but why beat a dead horse?

"lgarthy","1","22","40","12 November 2012"," The WORST Bond film of all time
","I won't rehash some of the very poignant observations that many of you have made. I am astounded that the critics had any positive reviews of this atrocious film. The take home point is that if you want to make movie critics happy,add some Freudian element that make the film's characters appear to have depth. Similarly, you can add a background story to a well-known character (who needs no background story).<br/><br/>The film is a complete mish-mash of half-realized ideas and stolen story elements from other movies. I was not hugely fond of the first two Daniel Craig vehicles. Not because they were bad movies, but because they could not decide what direction they wanted to go with the Bond character. Did they want to make him more like Jason Bourne, like John McClain, like any of a half-dozen action movie or espionage protagonists who were NOT Bond?<br/><br/>In this film they decided to rip the very heart out of Bond and replace him with a psyche. It does not work. Does Bond save anyone or anything in this film? No! He lets ""good"" or ""neutral"" characters who are within his power to save, die. And for no other reason than he doesn't care. I was offended at how Bond lets people die in front of him (some pretty significant characters as well) without so much as a care. He has no passion. No drive. No motivation whatsoever, except for a very contrived (and kind-of spooky / gross) Freudian love affair with M. Yuck!!! He is NOT Bond! And the villain is a carefully constructed anti-hero. His mother-complex makes him homosexual. Oh, how sophisticated is that thinking? Mendes, you really stink!! The plot is otherwise a complete disaster. Let's steal from Mission Impossible (the first movie version) and do it badly. Let's steal from the Dark Knight, from earlier Bond films, and do them all incredibly badly! What did I learn from ""Skyfall?"" Critics can be bought. A franchise can be destroyed and we, like sheep, will pay for it.<br/><br/>To put it simple, colloquially,(and more intelligently than this film does); this movie SUCKED BEYOND ALL POSSIBLE SUCKINESS! If you doubt me, shell out the cash and see it. It will be some of the most intolerable 2 hours and 25 minutes you have ever spent. I"

","I do not normally write reviews but felt compelled to for this movie. The characters and performances are first class. The action scenes are to the high bond standard you would expect but still have that feel that this actually could happen. An adventure story is so much more enjoyable if you can truly immerse yourself in the story and his film although 2.5 hours long holds your attention throughout. I really would recommend it to all even if you are not a Bond fan few would doubt it is a fine adventure / thriller in its own right.<br/><br/>I personally thought the Silva was one of the most disturbing but likable of all the Bond Villains. Daniel Craig brilliant and you can see he puts so much into his performances and write deserves praise , I hope he continues with the role for the next 4 or 5 films.<br/><br/>I think that as Craig ages he could bring a natural end to the series.

"natalisek","10","43","86","25 October 2012"," A wonderful turn of the series
","After Quantum of Solace people behind the Bond franchise probably found themselves at the crossroads – where to go and what to do next? Shall we chase Mr. White and his Quantum or do something else entirely; perhaps going back to Bond's roots would be more successful strategy? After all, Bond's got his heart completely crushed and had some kind of revenge, isn't it time to get a bit light about everything that happens to him? The decision of filmmakers presents itself this year as Skyfall, a most wonderful 180 degree turn of the film series.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a beautiful and playful reload of the reload Bond film experienced since the coming of Daniel Craig. Skyfall adopts careless mood of the pre-Craig era with as many bows to the fans and various fetishes of the series: Q and his catchphrases, Miss Moneypenny, Aston Martin with guns under the hood, physically defective villain, frightening with his ambiguity and offering Bond a traditional game; and M, of course.<br/><br/>Bond in his family house, wearing a kind of cardigan and with a rifle reminds of an aristocrat out hunting, a likely symbol of good-old England, the empire spreading good and fighting evil. Not only Bond deals with his childhood trauma by burning down the house, the filmmakers mark their return to the traditional values of Bond film series, and to the black-and-white vision of good people and bad guys. Thus also constant collision of black and white in the film (e.g. at the hearing scene: M is the blonde wearing black, Prime Minster is a brunette in light clothes, Severine has lighter complexion comparing to Moneypenny but they wear contrasting to their skin color dresses, black silhouettes fighting against bright neon lights , etc.) However blurred and shadowy the villain appears both on screen and in the descriptions of characters, no more villains with inner conflict, as it is clear who is bad and what is good and how to act.<br/><br/>At the same time the characters are symbolically discussing the problems of their creators: who is better – the old guy or the young spotty kid, should we stop the bleeding and how safe do we feel with our new approach to security (or – Bond). Being old and young, experienced and innovative, end and start, leaving and carrying on are constantly being talked about, with the formula finally announced – old dog with new tricks. A wonderful combination, I find.<br/><br/>Having suffered enough, Bond enjoys both his weakness and strength, is drinking and looking good, in tuxedo as well as in tight jeans, and finally is not taking the beautiful girls seriously. Well done, Bond, never thought you could after two previous films! Only one question remains – what next? Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace were great and interesting with their attempt at fashionable seriousness, are we going back to the ridiculous again? To the invisible cars and exploding pens? Will the filmmakers be able to balance newfound playful mood against some kind of credibility, find a worthy story, an interesting mission and a matching villain? What an intrigue! Can't help but wait the return of Bond, James Bond."

","Very disappointed in this poor excuse of a bond film. i never write reviews on movies (in fact this is my first time) but because this movie was so lame i just had to warn all the other bond fans. there is no plot, no cool gadgets that a new young Q gives him. money penny is not the same color, bond has sex with a sex slave girl just for her to g get shot 5 minutes later and doesn't act like he even cared. I demand my $25 back and want to be reimbursed for my time and gas. i know there isn't much to write, or make movies about these days but you people need to be more creative. no 007 can get shot off a moving train and fall like 150 and live. he is not super human and there was no explanation of what happened. This will be the last bond film i see until i read better reviews"
"durgapmisra","10","18","32","14 November 2012"," Retro-tainment!!
","My first viewing of Skyfall left me a little frustrated at the slow pace in the first half. However the story did catch speed in the second, and by the end i felt it was overall slightly better than Casino Royale. On reflection , however, there was a lot to appreciate from this Bond movie. An ageing James Bond , with his powers in apparently terminal decline, refuses to give up against all the odds, even against a fitter, though older , villain.A lot of the action is without any fancy gadgets . Similarly, M's unwavering belief in Bond's ability to do his bit when the time of reckoning comes is commendable. The reference to Lord Alfred Tennyson's Ulysses was heart touching, and remains my favourite scene from the movie. The movie showcases Bond as a human being first and a secret agent next, and shows a human side of him which many thought never existed. The movie has a lot apart from just action sequences ( which are aplenty , mind you) and that makes me feel in retrospect that this is the best Bond movie I have seen in my lifetime (have only seen them in the last decade)."

","50 years of Bond! I've been a Bond fan since the beginning. This is the best Bond Film since the days of Connery. Daniel Craig is finally allowed to be James Bond and not a clone of Jason Bourne as he was in Casino Royale and the dreadful Quantum of Solace. Given this chance, he makes a good Bond.<br/><br/>Skyfall combines the elements of the classic Bond films with all the modern ingredients and the film is highly entertaining. Bardem makes a menacing villain too.<br/><br/>The other thing I appreciated was being able to see the action instead of the awful Bourne like cinematography that was used in Quantum.<br/><br/>Bond is back.....Bond is alive......Looking forward to the next!"
"FlorianKloepfel","4","40","81","20 November 2012"," An outstanding disappointment
","What a weak movie! after the fascinating Casino Royale the newest film of the bond series is the weakest film of the Daniel Craig Bond era. the screenplay and the storyline are unacceptable... sometimes there are so stupid scenes that I thought that can't be true. It was a big disappointment from the beginning to the end of the Film. Sometimes the film is like a psycho- thriller and there are references to other films like Die hard or the Nolan films which are also abolutely problematic. The action scenes are without tempo and without creative elements. There are no gadgets and the simple storyline gives the film not much tension. The film is also twenty minutes too long. <br/><br/>I think that Sam Mendes has absolutely failed to create a bond film. It was a major surprise for me and a very disappointing experience. I love Casino Royale. Bond, please come back...<br/><br/>sad for bond fans and sad for normal viewers..."
"annoyingorange-43220","6","9","14","13 July 2015"," most overrated Bond film ever
","the 1st bond movie with Daniel Craig (casino royale) was a terrific film . the plot was great. the 2nd one (quantum of solace) was pretty good. but this film was SO OVERRATED ! the bond villain doesn't come until more than an hour in the movie . <br/><br/>If your expectations are to watch a fun mindless, action summer blockbuster, then I suppose it does it's job. If you're looking for a great spy/action film, with intrigue, suspense, great character development, a cohesive plot, then you will be disappointed. Skyfall gets a little messy and it seems like there are just a bunch of scenes and scenarios strung together because ""they would be cool"", kind of like an action-film-by-committee check-list was used. Casino Royale raised the bar for me, and Skyfall, just feels like a bit of a mess, lacking the sophistication and depth that was set-up with the franchise reboot of Casino Royale."

","James bond operates on a mission to kill a bad guy who seems to be able to hack everything. One of the best parts of the movie came in the very be beginning that always catches my eye in bond moves especially Casino Royale which I recommend seeing. in this beginning scene bond is running after a person who is probably a criminal and he gets on a train and starts wrestling this criminal, and in the meantime his partner on the job is trying to get a good shot on the criminal. then she takes a risky move and shoots... it hits bond he goes down criminal gets away and how did bond survive after the shot and falling to the bottom of a body of water ? no one even the creators probably don't know so. but to the story Daniel Craig playing James bond is extraordinary in the movie and Judy Dench playing m was great. Speaking of M she has a amazing dramatic part in the end where the hacking criminal kills her and then bond gets the criminal back with a throwing knife, you should really see it . these two make a great pair and showed it in Skyfall. another thing is I love the song.

"ViktorDrake","1","9","14","28 October 2014"," The 2nd Worst Bond Film Ever
","First of all, like a million others on here I'm a massive fan of James Bond. There's been some brilliant Bond films, and there's been some truly awful Bond films. So where does Skyfall fit in the Bond canon? Well, it's not the worst Bond movie : that accolade still resides firmly with Die Another Day. However, Skyfall is sadly the 2nd worst Bond film ever made in this reviewer's opinion.<br/><br/>The Pros. <br/><br/>1. The name. Skyfall is a great name for a movie.<br/><br/>2. The theme tune. A great, theme sung by Adele, that harks back to the Shirley Bassey classics of yesteryear.<br/><br/>3. Errr, that's about it.<br/><br/>The Cons. <br/><br/>There are far too many to mention them all, but they all fall into the camps of either lazy film-making, poor script-writing, pathetic attempts to turn Bond into a Superman/Terminator/Jason Bourne-on-steroids type of character, or just ludicrous plot contrivances that serve no other purpose other than to set up another scene. Examples in no particular order - <br/><br/>1. The stolen list of undercover agents – it's the whole reason for the story, and yet how it was stolen is never mentioned. It also completely vanishes from the storyline half way through, never to be mentioned again.<br/><br/>2. Bond crashing his motorbike into the bridge wall to be thrown onto the top of a train. No chance in a million years that would've worked. Why do it? The other guy just climbed up and jumped (vaguely believable), but Bond has to do a Superman effort.<br/><br/>3. Bond getting shot through the shoulder with a depleted uranium round. Apart from a quick wince, does it affect him AT ALL? Of course not. He can still climb, fight, punch, hang on to things, and adjust his cufflinks without batting an eyelid. Hmmmm, yes very believable I'm sure.<br/><br/>4. The fall from the train. The fact he survives a fall like that is hands-down the most ridiculous thing in a Bond movie since the invisible car. A fall of half that height into water would kill you. Instantly. Oh and then Bond goes off a waterfall too! He must've been cursing his bad luck that day! It still would've been a thrilling shot if the distance to fall was 30 feet, but no, the film-makers have to ramp it up to Terminator-only-surviving proportions.<br/><br/>5. The totally unbelievable overall plan and hacking ability of Da Silva. Hacking to MI6's heating system to blow up M's office. Riiiiight. And he KNEW she'd be out at the time. Just like he KNEW they'd retreat to the underground bunker place. Just like he KNEW he'd be taken straight there when he was captured. Just like he KNEW he'd be put into to a ludicrous glass cell (with no bed, no toilet, no facilities at all) in a room with single trapdoor that was computer controlled and also the only door between the most secure place in England and the public London Underground railway system. Just like he KNEW the exact times EVERYTHING would happen, right from being captured near China, being taken to the new MI6 headquarters, seeing M, Q and Bond cracking the code, him being able to escape, and then being also stopped by Bond in EXACTLY the right spot and at the right time to blow a hole in the underground tunnel with just enough time to say a smart one-liner before a train comes crashing through. Imagine if M was caught short and was bit late seeing him - his whole timings would've been shot. I mean, how gutted would he have been! Pathetic storytelling that expects the audience to have an IQ in single figures.<br/><br/>6. The abandoned island that Da Silva apparently cleared of people by saying there was a chemical leak. When did he do that? 50 or 60 years before? It must've been at least that long as the place looked like it had been deserted for at least that amount of time.<br/><br/>7. Hydrogen cyanide doesn't melt your face. It's not corrosive so Da Silva's disfigurement is there for no reason other than to try make him look like ""proper"" Bond villain. (Personally I'd have just not stuck him that ridiculous wig, but hey that's just me).<br/><br/>8. Bond's idea of taking M to Scotland is fine if he plans to simply hide her away. But he doesn't - he plans to lure Da Silva to him, and at no point does he consider taking some guns, or some additional people with him. No, instead he trusts that there will still be a few old hunting rifles at his old family home, and that's it. No backup, no weapons, nothing. Good thinking Bond.<br/><br/>9. Why does Bond's Aston Martin have all the Goldfinger modifications on it? In this time-line he won the car in Casino Royale, so it wouldn't have any of the Goldfinger mods on it. Plus Bond himself says that the Aston is 'not a ""Company"" car', meaning it's not an MI6 vehicle, so it would just be a normal car.<br/><br/>11. The ludicrous way that Patrice who shoots Bond with the depleted uranium round is apparently ""a ghost"" with no known country of origin, and yet MI6 know exactly where he'll be in a couple of days and even what flight he'll be on! Handy huh? Lazy film-making.<br/><br/>12. The stupid plot device of M and the Gamekeeper using a TORCH in the middle of a pitch black moor! No other reason than to explain how Da Silva suddenly finds them.<br/><br/>Basically it's a very weak and lazy film, with more plot holes that a swiss cheese. My opinion – watch Casino Royale, or even Quantum of Solace (provided you have a sick-bag handy due to the hideous shaky-cam), to see Craig as Bond as he should be. Avoid Skyfall at all costs."
"ranazenguia","1","36","72","7 November 2012"," No, and that's without a doctor ...
","Best Bond ever? No because it is not Bond at all.<br/><br/>Bond is back? Which Bond and from where? Again: No because it is not Bond at all.<br/><br/>Good action movie asides from what one thinks of Bond? Hardly, it is unevenly paced and insecurely directed. it starts fine, but comes apart rapidly. The scenes in Scotland are downright boring.<br/><br/>The people who say ""What is this - mission Impossible 5"" are right, because this is not James Bond at all. Despite some obvious production value (placed in polishing stuff that is completely average otherwise - except for the really well choreographed opening), it is not especially classy, and as action movies goes it is only just about average. Certainly not above in any way.<br/><br/>I didn't think Casino Royale was ""real Bond"" either - but that WAS at least a good movie. Quantum of Solace was ""Bond as a British jack Bauer"", and it just didn't work.<br/><br/>This looks mostly like Die Hard 5 with a Bruce Willis AND a director who should both have retired.<br/><br/>Would give it a five if it didn't pose as a Bond movie. But posing as a Bond movie it fails. Utterly."
"joatley","5","30","59","11 November 2012"," Confused and poorly executed
","This is the worst kind of awful movie and an extreme failure. In this review, keep in mind that the production company blew through $150 million on this thing.<br/><br/>What do we get? Bad acting/directing, poor cinematography and editing, and not to mention an absurd plot, bad screen writing and bad executing in general. <br/><br/>This is a clinic on what not to do when you're making a movie.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS START ***<br/><br/>Let's start with Bond. This is a bit of a character study because Bond is going through a lot of trials. If executed well, we would have gotten a great character arc of growth and development. However what we get is a Bond that is unable to display any emotion at all. Why do we care about this person? Is he a human or a plank of wood?<br/><br/>What are Bond's motivations? Why is he still in the business? Is he depressed about it? Is he uncertain about his own motives? Is he actually interested in any of the women he meets? Is he lonely? Unfortunately there's no indication. So how can we relate to this character when he seems to have no dimensions and no emotion?<br/><br/>Maybe you don't want this in an action flick, but when you decide that you want a lot of character driven stuff in your movie and you make it 2.5 hours long and don't have many action scenes (there really aren't many) you better have an actor who is acting.<br/><br/>Q. The Q gadgets are absolutely depressing. It's actually a joke in the movie how ordinary Q's inventions are. Why is this good? Remember those whimsical and funny contrivances Q had that would help Bond out of a fix in an amusing or novel way? Yah they decided that wasn't necessary here. So what's the point of having Q at all?<br/><br/>Q presents himself as a 1st class computer hacker. Pop Quiz: what's the best thing to do when beginning a forensic analysis of a foreign computer? Hook it up to the British Intelligence's LAN? Yah you failed. The worst part is, the villain was relying on them to do this as part of his plan. That's right, the villain's circuitous plan depended upon British Intelligence making a mistake they would never do in real life. As a writer, do you write this and then say, ""ooh that's awesome!"" This is so stupid it hurts. ""My new character Q comes off as extremely incompetent - great time to write the next scene!""<br/><br/>The plot is horribly tired. Throughout there is a feeling of been-there done-that. There's not much originality here. But it's not a paint-by-numbers plot like you'd expect, the characters make decisions that don't appear to make sense. The villain's plots are elaborate and nonsensical. Now this may sound like a typical Bond villain, but in this case it's much more immediately elaborate and nonsensical (think sharks with lasers attached to their heads). The responses by M and Bond are equally nonsensical. The movie feels like a patchwork of fail.<br/><br/>There are some pieces of a good movie in here - the Macau part was really interesting - just what you want to see, an intriguing Bond location with gambling, etc. But we are only there for a little bit before getting whisked away to the next location. The action scenes are well done, but even these seem tired, there was nothing really exceptional about them.<br/><br/>The villain seems to be very well executed as a character. His introduction is OK, and he does have an interesting story arc. It's too bad his actions are too illogical for him to be a convincing character.<br/><br/>The cinematography left me wanting. The camera was not dynamic enough, the shots were too tight, there wasn't much composition going on, and the camera placement was disorienting. I could go on quite a bit here, but it's not worth it.<br/><br/>The title sequence with the great hit Skyfall was really good, it's an opening to a movie that I would like to see.<br/><br/>There were not enough femme fatales in the sequence, which is a mistake. I'm sorry but the whole concept of Bond is the male fantasy - beautiful women, cars, guns, parties, beaches, gambling, etc. Traditionally, the sequence features femme fatales more strongly - it's the juxtaposition of beauty and death. To replace this theme with anything else means you don't get it. Although since the movie doesn't really feature a prominent romance (another mistake) I guess it makes sense not to have the female figure displayed prominently in the title sequence.<br/><br/>Instead we have a lot of CGI blood, which hints at the movie's latent theme of betrayal. But this theme is mishandled, Bond seems to completely forgive M for ordering the risky sniper shot, so there is no sense of betrayal or conflict in Bond as there is in the villain. We also get close-ups of Bond's eye, hinting at a potential character study, but we are not allowed into his personal world. <br/><br/>The meaning of the title track (which has a strong message of maintaining dignity during great tragedy - especially ""at Skyfall"") is not represented in the movie. Indeed Skyfall turns out to be Bond's childhood home, which he's happy to see blown to bits. There is no betrayal, tragedy or regret for Bond in this movie, so why is he so sullen and devoid of life? If you're going to have a brooding Bond, at least give us a reason why. <br/><br/>*** SPOILERS END ***<br/><br/>Why am I extra disappointed in this movie? It's because Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb have both failed me. As of this writing, The Rotten Tomatoes score is 91% and the IMDb score is 8.1. These scores historically suggest a not-to-be-missed movie. Is that what Skyfall is? No."
"marksayers1-521-836129","1","37","75","5 November 2012"," Largely Really Bad
","First off I would like to state I am a big fan of James Bond films, Goldeneye and Goldfinger are the two best one's in my opinion, and Casino Royale was very good also. Having said that, this film was so bad that I actually walked out of the cinema at the end and vowed to not watch the next one, not out of spite, but because I think it will be just as bad.<br/><br/>This is the worst bond film that was ever made, I didn't like Quantam of Solace but at least it had some entertaining action scenes. I actually created this account like some other authors on here, just to express my distaste at such a bad film.<br/><br/>The positives: Daniel Craig was an excellent actor in this and did a great job. I thought the new Q actor in the film was good, the bond girl (if there was one) was good for the 15 - 20 minutes that she was actually in the film for before disappointingly being killed. Judi Dench also put in another fine performance.<br/><br/>The negatives: Almost everything else was terrible. The plot was weak and disjointed. Naomi Harris may have been good in other things (I remember her doing a fairly good job in 28 days), but was truly awful in this. It would be hard to imagine anyone in the future ever doing a worse job of MoneyPenny. <br/><br/>MoneyPenny is supposed to be a secretary that is usually flirtatious, naive, fairly attractive and have a very small role. Instead she opted to take centre stage as some kind of secret agent, who attempted to be a spitting image James Bond in just about everything she did. I personally did not think she was attractive, but I would understand if anyone disagreed with me on that. Nevertheless she was not right for the part (you couldn't have picked anyone worse), and the worst worst thing about it is she is almost certainly going to be in the next one.<br/><br/>There was no chemistry between bond and any characters in this (except Judy Dench for a short time). And all the things about James Bond we are not supposed to ever know, are supposed to have almost all solved.<br/><br/>This film had 0 originality in it also. It was so unoriginal that I might as well have paid to watch snippits of all the films it had ripped off (I would have enjoyed watching that so much more!). I could almost name in every scene which film the scene had ripped off.<br/><br/>I am absolutely startled that any reviewer could consider giving this above 5 stars. And why there were so many positive critics about this. I usually love most films more than most people, but this was terrible.<br/><br/>After this criticism it is only fair that I say what could have been done better. Bear in mind, that I am not a producer so what could be done to make a great James Bond is a little beyond my pay grade.<br/><br/>1. A bond girl who actually lives for at least most of the film, and has some chemistry with someone. 2. A more original car, or at least some sort of original device in it which you would not usually get in a car (on a basic level even if it is just a electric board that resusatates your heart. 3. A better, more dramatic, more believable near death scene. 4. A better moneypenny actor and better moneypenny script & character type (this is so easy to do), and she shouldn't be in the film much at all. 5. A better car chase (again I understand why some may like the car/motorbike chase in this film), but I still think a much better one is needed. 6. Better plot - So much work is needed on this though 7. Better Villains (not another former MI6 agent), something more original. Jaws & Oddjob were brilliant, perhaps someone who previously had some association with bond to build chemistry would have worked. 8. Originality 10 fold increase at least. 9. Some elements of surprise 10. Something that gets you off the edge of your seat a bit more. Violence, Romance, Comedy, Tension or Emotion in isolation or a mix of some sort. 11. Probably a lot more things also, but that's all that is in the top of my head fresh after seeing it.<br/><br/>1 star is a bit harsh on this film - it perhaps deserves 2/3 stars in my honest opinion. But given the budget, the critics saying: 'best bond ever', 'best Bond opening ever' and the time it took to produce this was truly awful. I also want to lower down the 8.2 star rating on here, as this is at least 5 stars to high.<br/><br/>Apologies for any bad spelling/gramatical errors, and an apology if I upset anyone who liked MoneyPenny in the film. I'm sure Naiomi Harris is good in other things (such as 28 days), but she is not made for this role at all. I thought there was other poor acting/scriptwriting for some bodyguards for instance also."

"Clockwork-Avacado","2","36","73","5 November 2012"," Skyfall Plummets...
","Okay. Fiftieth anniversary of the world's biggest franchise of all time, just got a new director after some internal troubles. Let's think of something that will really annoy all the Bond fans; let's make a Bond movie for people who don't like Bond films. Let's make a trendy, poorly edited, shoddily written cyber thriller, occasionally allowing a cannibalistic regurgitation of something from a ""real"" Bond film, but do it as a joke, because people who get references from films which are over twenty five years old (Live and Let Die?), are quite frankly, weirdos. Let's overwhelm the story with techno-babble, people who can't exist away from computer screens, and plot twists which are so perverse that the casual viewer fails to take anything in, but just nods along with mindless music, jerky editing and a Bond so devoid of character that we don't really notice the fact that he can seemingly survive under ice cold water for minutes at a time, can fall hundreds of meters after having been shot, and survive, in spite of a complete lack of any medical care. And Bond playing drinking games with a scorpion? Well, sure. That's not out of character at all. Let's introduce a teenage Q, who apparently invented a complex computer coding system (how old was he then, six?), and can provide a point of reference for the audience, rather than this cold, thuggish Bond, who races around from implausible scenario to scenario, with all the presence of a squaddie (crew cut and all), who can't convey any emotion - all his ""romantic"" scenes are played as though he's on another planet; no wit, no double-entendres, which even Brosnan could pull off - Overall, a Bond who exists to flash his chest, and occasionally make a ""tough"" remark, whilst looking ""cool"", because in this film, characters are ""suave"" by wearing a tuxedo, or posing, not by actually being witty or sophisticated. In other words, simple, clichéd storytelling, full of archetypes which proliferate a plot which centers around visual effects and explosive, and to be honest, soulless action set pieces. <br/><br/>The pre-credits sequence sees some relatively interesting stunt work, again rather ruined by a complete lack of understanding, and some poor editing - Bond is shot by Eve, and yet he has a working earpiece through which he can hear M's orders. Why could Eve not just tell him to duck, allowing her a clear shot? How can Bond not be located? How far is he actually carried by the river? Oh, wait, I forgot. Action sequence = switch brain off, stick tongue out, enjoy... <br/><br/>A stream of completely uninteresting action sequences follow, all with poorly edited, speeded up choreography, not to mention no sense of threat or danger, because everything is so computer game like, where trains can crash through solid supports, and remain relatively intact, and Bond can run and jump like a superhuman, in spite the fact that this should be us seeing a Bond at his most vulnerable... Javier Bardem as Silva gives us another horribly miscast villain, with Mendes confusing vaguely creepy and ineffectual with tough and intimidating. I find it hard to believe that this theatrical, camp poser was ever an agent of the same level as Bond, as everything dramatic or physical he does is offscreen, and all we see him do is swan about, again trying to look ""cool"", whilst also trying to feel up Bond - one of the worst moments ever in a Bond film, which quite frankly does little to persuade us that this guy is strong, or threatening. His motivation, his desire to kill M, is uninteresting, and yet a simple enough way to get audiences hooked - threaten a main character, but not Bond, because we all know he's never going to die, and this cheap, sensationalistic attempt to provide depth to M's character, or MI6 as a whole is ultimately undermined by a script which revolves around the kind of dialogue which really exists simply to sound impressive, and as a result, characterisation is non existent, leaving us with some two dimensional characters whining or growling dialogue which sounds so clunky that it's no wonder Craig has buried himself under a wall of impassive nonchalance. <br/><br/>The finale treats us to another example of good intentions gone wrong. Let's have some detail of Bond's past life, let's give him some depth as a character, give him a birthday present of some believability. But instead, we see his childhood home, and really learn nothing about him, as Bond is instead wrapped up with posturing against an admittedly impressive landscape, and maintaining a ""manly"" silence. How about some character dialogue, or investing some time in giving us an exploration of what has driven Bond to become what he has been, instead of ""My parents died when I was young, here's my house, this is my housekeeper."" However, this is one of the strongest moments in the film, as we get the sense that we may be building up to a suspenseful climax, of hunter and hunted. Instead, we're treated to grinding, strident music, explosions, fast cutting which completely fails to take advantage of the environment which has been built up, and instead descends into a fiery, blaring crescendo in which we don't really care about anything other than seeing how proficient the film's pyrotechnics are. And also; let's blow up my entire house to finish off some villains. Hold on whilst I crawl into some shoddily constructed underground tunnels below it for safety...Right...Didn't know that 007 was his IQ... Overall, this is a disappointing movie, which somehow manages to be poorer than both the other Craig films, a mindless, shapeless blob onto which we can occasionally hear someone call this guy with a crew cut and stubble ""Bond"", and someone occasionally playing the James Bond theme tune...Oh, someone must be watching a real James Bond film nearby..."

"ihmemies","3","39","80","26 October 2012"," A fine mess mirroring our time
","*** CONTAINS SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>The attempt at making a smaller-scale Bond with the plot revolving around a personal vendetta did not work. Some Random agent gone nuts - which MI6 hosed - wants payback. I could not make myself care about the man's issues or reasons. The dialogue throughout the movie was dreadfully dull and uninspiring - same goes for the characters. There wasn't even one real joke or attempt at lifting the mood which at least in older Bond movies was the norm.<br/><br/>They murdered the Bond girl. Just like that to show how evil the Random agent gone nuts supposedly is. Thanks to the same guy we also get the most remarkable computer-related doohickey for quite some time. The plot's pacing heavily leans on terribly executed and utterly unbelievable magic, which the writers probably mistook for ""hacking"". I can't fathom what they had in mind but repeated use of awkward magic steadily maims audience's immersion into a thousand pieces. <br/><br/>After that treatment, probably the most touching part of the movie was the destruction of the Skyfall manor. Every engraved wood panel and chiseled stone block was, unlike this movie, a piece of art in itself. And they leveled it all for the purposes of making fleeting entertainment for Western consumers.<br/><br/>About cinematography: Thanks to digital video capture, dark scenes were immaculately clean, but the image fell apart in brighter outdoor scenes. I don't appreciate the looks of light sources and lighter tones in digital video. It is too big of a tradeoff to get a cleaner picture. Colors were quite realistic (read: boring) which suit the overall tone of the movie well.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the movie had some inspired shots, including a silhouette fistfight against a skyscraper-tall advertisement, sailboat in ocean and again some silhouettes against a burning manor on the moors. The highlight probably was when drowning Bond shot an underwater flare, lighting the water below thin ice and contrasting marvelously with the light of the burning manor above.<br/><br/>A true Bond fan does not leave a Bond movie unwatched, but it is difficult to invent reasons to go watch Skyfall with any great haste. Cinematography saves select parts of the movie, but overall Skyfall is not worth seeing even just for the visuals."

","Didn't think Skyfall was great or original as the critics make it out to be. It didn't seem like a Bond movie rather a mish mash of Mission Impossible, Bourne, Dark Knight, Speed and Harry Potter, peppered with a bit of Bond.<br/><br/>*****Spoilers<br/><br/>A ridiculous shootout scene, away from technology(?) I mean, why wouldn't the British Secret Service guard the top figure at MI6????? Does it make sense to have one person i.e. Bond cover for the Head of MI6? If she's captured wouldn't she would still have an awful lot to give away, I mean she knows everything about the British Intelligence System, doesn't she? It looks like the MI6 and Bond wanted M to die.<br/><br/>DISSECTING THE MOVIE<br/><br/>1. Opening sequence & train fight reminds me of an opening sequence to MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. Race through the streets looks like BOURNE & getting shot, it's not clear where Bond gets shot and how he manages to survive and live in Turkey (the sequence reminds me of Bourne)<br/><br/>2. Bond comes back into action, it's not very clear what motivates him so much & why are these agents always losing their MAN lists?? reminds me of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. If it's so easy to get into M's house why don't the bad guys just target her there? <br/><br/>3. Q - he's supposed to come up with gadgets, one finger-print activated gun? The new Q is so useless. I'm sure the real MI6 actually make gadgets like firing pens.<br/><br/>4. Scene in Shanghai. I liked the lift ride Bond took up, but there's not much explanation as to what the bad guy was doing, or why he was taking out an art dealer in the next building. <br/><br/>5. Macao, fight at Casino Bar. Why doesn't Bond pick up his tailor made gun at the end of the fight? It's the only gadget he's got in this film. And do Komodo dragons eat people for dinner????? <br/><br/>6. The girl knows shes going to get killed but still takes Bond to the island with her. What, to enjoy last time sex before her death??? Bad Bond. <br/><br/>7. The bad guy getting disfigured from a cyanide capsule - cyanide in a capsule, it can't be that powerful to melt the whole jaw, how can he keep it in his molar???? Think cyanide reacts with stomach acid. Good guy goes bad: after becoming disfigured ex-team member guy comes back for revenge - DARK KNIGHT AND SPEED <br/><br/>8. The underground chase scene, bad guy DRESSED AS POLICE, with the train reminds me of SPEED <br/><br/>9. Why an earth did Bond take M to such a secluded spot where she is completely open to an enemy attack and why an earth is just Bond defending her??? Isn't she the head of MI6?<br/><br/>10. James Bond and M fighting the enemy alone with him, it almost looks like Bond thinks that M DESERVES TO DIE & so does the MI6 who don't step in to help. Is this Bond's revenge as well towards M???? DON'T BLAME MUM.<br/><br/>11. The whole Highland scene, Making nail bombs in his old house miles away from anywhere (RUBBISH) & secret passage, under the ice fighting scene, reminds me a bit of HARRY POTTER & HAGRID <br/><br/>12. The bad guy dies so easily <br/><br/>13. Eve, really irritating, she was better in the action scenes, but bad after that, just bad. M just got killed and she looks so happy. Again confirms my suspicion that the MI6 ppl all wanted M to die and take responsibility for this unoriginal movie????<br/><br/>Doesn't seem like a Bond movie, except Bond going on to bed girls who subsequently die. <br/><br/>NOT MY BEST BOND, Not much of a spy movie, what is this??????<br/><br/>The characters, and acting between Bond and SilVa, the chemistry is good.

","This is by far the worst Bond movie of all time. Unlike the rest of the world I enjoyed QoS. The car chase, fight scene in Haiti, the boat chase, aircraft scene and the amazing fight scene in Siena, Italy. The editing ruined the film and the villain could have been better. As for Casino Royale it was an OK film, great opening but some scenes went on far too long such as the card game, airport chase where somehow the brakes fail but the tanker still stops (silly) and the Vienna scene. Now back to Skyfall,this movie is a huge let down and it seems that old friends from previous movies such as Road of Perdition have come together to earn millions and make a stupid film which with a few jokes could have easily been Johnny English 3. The opening scene is boring and too long, why is Naomi Harris even in that scene? She is annoying and the way she says the word ""shot"" is irritating. Sam Mendes blows up the DB5 so that it cannot be featured in future Bond movies which is a shame, unless it gets restored but will never be the same. The Shanghai scene is pointless. This movie had the same budget as the new Total Recall movie which has a good cast list, amazing stunts, epic CGI and a better script. So where did all the money in Skyfall go? The villain looks like the Batman Joker and the Tube blow up scene is just so stupid, how did he even know that Bond would stop at that exact spot? Javier Bardem with that awful blond hair gets in and out of cars and the Home Alone ending seemed to go on forever, I'm not sure if M died of her wound or boredom, this could have been a better movie with a better script and a director that wasn't trying to turn Bond into The Dark Knight. Soundtrack was dull too. Still not sure if Adele was singing about Bond or her pregnancy, the song and lyrics feel as if it was done during a lunch break. The film looks and feels cheap. Dr No remains the best Bond movie ever with The Spy Who Loved Me a close second. The old Bond films where a villain lives in a volcano and builds space shuttles was more convincing and more believable than this rubbish and that is saying something! I can understand there being no gadgets as Bond himself IS the gadget but it would have been nice to see some tech rather than a gun that has Audi R8 headlamps. Best part of the movie was the Macau casino dialogue scene with Severine, dark and twisted. Would have been nice if the new M at the very end of the movie asked Bond to escort The Queen to the London Olympics and bond replies ""I'll do my best"". But the people who made this movie have no sense of what Bond is about or movie making imagination. I've seen better wedding videos than this very dull movie."

"iamzaze","4","34","69","1 November 2012"," ""Best Bond movie ever!"" Really?
","I don't quite know where to start, so I'll tell you about my expectations. Casino Royale and Quantum of Sollace were two Bond movies that made Bond more human than ever and more non-gadgety, they brought him to the real world, they gave him bruises and missions that for the first time seemed hard to accomplish. So, I expected Skyfall to be THE BOND movie, the sum of everything that was good in the previous two, plus something unexpected, something that would again reinvent the franchise. These expectations were multiplied by everybody saying ""This is the best Bond movie ever made!"".<br/><br/>The truth about this movie is that it's very poorly written and in some situations, childishly directed. I can only conclude this, when the plot of the movie includes a retired agent of the MI6 that seeking revenge blows up the MI6 headquarters making sure M is safe watching it blow up, then lets himself captured by Bond just so he can escape from the MI6, get chased by Bond in the Underground network, detonate an explosive and unleash a rogue train onto Bond when he couldn't have known Bond would chase him nor be in that very spot at that moment. I'm not finished: he then reunites with his henchmen and goes straight to a court room where he tries to kill M and doesn't stop trying until the end of the movie. The whole plan makes no sense!<br/><br/>The movie then turns into a Scottish Home Alone starring Bond, M and Kincade. Although Bond got helped earlier in the movie by a squad of helicopters (after activating a radio signal by carefully taking the device out of his pocket, pushing the button, putting the device back into his pocket, with a close-up on the pocket so we can see what he did) now the MI6 is powerless inside the UK so everything relies on a not so in shape Bond and two old farts. Silva (the bad guy that appears in the second part of the movie, by the way) gets there by chopper with his henchmen in legionary outfits Van Damme would kill for. After some of the bad guys get killed or die in the Home Alone traps, Silva burns down the house but can then see that M and Kincade escaped through a tunnel and are now using a flashlight to get around (A FLASHLIGHT! while running for their lives).<br/><br/>I won't spoil the ending, but I will conclude. This movie is dull, it doesn't surprise you with anything, it's more linear than a straight line, it's full of clichés and tacky lines, it has a gun with LEDs and sound and the technology terms and interactions are just stupid.<br/><br/>To sum up: Daniel Craig makes a good performance, so do his colleagues, the movie is well produced (I can't forget the crappy green screen motorcycle chase in Istanbul, though), mostly well directed, the soundtrack is modest and the intro is great. They didn't screw up the Bond intro, yes."

Poor quality one-liners, nothing to keep you interested. Plot by numbers as you could pretty much figure out what was going to happen scene to scene, and be right 100% of the time<br/><br/>Femme Fatale Bond 'is' sexy women, but in Skyfall, you get a scene that suggests popping up behind a women (so to speak...) in the shower is okay, as long as you've spoken to her for at least 90 seconds that day. Hell she was even 'terrified' of her boss, so does Bond now take advantage of women suffering domestic violence?. The lack of gorgeous women in a Bond file is criminal, the shower scene even more so.<br/><br/>Gadgets None. Yes, none, and the only one he is given he losses in the first 5 minutes.

","I have been a huge Bond fan for as long as I can remember, I have seen all the films multiple times. With the latest one, Skyfall, Bond is starting to make his way back to his roots but only just slightly. <br/><br/>The plot revolves around a stolen list of MI6 agents that the agency is trying to retrieve while at the same time M's dubious past is catching up with her in dangerous ways. Bond goes from London to Turkey to Shanghai to Scotland with a fair bit of chases and action on the way. M takes a very prominent role in this one and James Bond's character, including his flaws and background, are explored much more deeply than ever before. <br/><br/>But is this what we really want from a James Bond film?<br/><br/>The key issue for me as a long time Bond fan is his style, the formula of Bond. Up until Die Another Day (included) the Bond films had a very uniform style of lighthearted escapism with all the little tweaks that make Bond Bond included. However once Daniel Craig took off with Casino Royale (and what continues into Skyfall) is a Jason Bourne/Mission Impossible style relatively generic action-thriller with some Bond elements thrown in. Bond had a formula that worked very well, there was nothing wrong with it. It is supposed to be a little lighthearted, a little shallow, chauvinistic, stylish escapist entertainment. You went to see a Bond film because it was fun, it was so detached from everyday life and every guy wanted to be like Bond. Now however they have gone down the route of making a very ""dark"" Bond film, here a lot of attention is on the characters and their problems and and the plot line which has usually been of Bond trying to save the world in some way is utterly secondary in Skyfall. However I as a true Bond fan want to see him in a plot driven save-the-world type of mission, I am not interested in a dark character drama that is close to being indistinguishable from any generic thriller. <br/><br/>That is the biggest flaw of this film: it is ignoring a formula that works so well and instead tries to be something new....but that new is just copying Jason Bourne and other similar films. Skyfall, as it is released 50 years after the first Bond film, is rich in references to the older films which are a delight for a Bond fan to watch out for but they really are more a depressing reminder of ""the good old days"" and stand as a stark contrast to the cold empty shell that Bond has become today. Particularly the female element, such a key aspect of all previous Bond films, is very toned down and it seems that M is more the Bond girl in this film than any other girl. <br/><br/>However to finish on a high note, the film had a very nice ending from the standpoint of a Bond fan, a hint of things to come which seem to be going back closer to what Bond used to be and should always be. <br/><br/>The film itself isn't bad, its a very interesting thriller. Its only that it isn't very strong as a Bond film but from the way things were heading in Skyfall, it seems that the next Bond film should be a bit closer to what Bond should be."

"kieran-j-lee","5","32","65","29 November 2012"," Disappointing, the critics lied to me
","For their fiftieth anniversary outing the producers and writers of Skyfall have elected, without a hint of irony, to plagiarise from their progeny and the other films these have influenced. The plot line is lifted from the first Mission: Impossible, the tone and character arc from Bond devotee Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, and the framing device from the Bourne series. The set pieces are largely borrowed from the aforementioned films and a number of previous Bonds. They even take one of Bourne's stars in a barely recognisable Albert Finney, a role that should have had Bourne's Brian Cox written all over it. There are a couple good lines but most of them seem to have been produced using the random Bond line generator and are delivered exactly when anticipated. In short what we get is a lazily conceived film delivered by a committee of Hollywood pretenders. Unfortunately what we don't get is a Bond film, just another post Bourne Hollywood-style actioner, save for a few bones thrown to the fans in the third act (Bond's DB5 and the revealing of a key 'new' character). Other than M, female characters share about ten minutes of screen time and all Bond has to do is show up to get laid in stark contrast to Craig's previous two outings (in QoS he never gets laid at all). Which is astonishing given that here Craig has all the charisma of a sack of potatoes. These 'Bond girls' only serve as vehicles for exposition, one doesn't even get a line of dialogue, and one wears just the right amount of lipstick to make you wonder if she's really just a guy in drag. The introduction of Bardem's villain is the highlight of the movie but any promise this scene brings is then completely squandered. There is some particularly poor CGI in the rendering of Bardem's make up and two Komodo Dragons. As the end credits rolled I was left feeling this whole sorry exercise's sole purpose was to introduce three rather dull new actors / characters to the franchise. As a life long Bond aficionado I am deeply saddened and now resigned to the fact, save for another reboot, we'll never see another decent Bond film again."

Unfortunately, the final scene reminded me of Daniel Craig's other recent movie ""Cowboy's & Aliens"" . You're the head of MI6, no matter how compromised MI6 is in the movie, you could still manage to bring some guns. What I'm trying to explain is that the movie is truly lacking Bond spirit... They destroyed the original Aston Martin so it probably will never appear again. We'll miss Judy Dench by the way. Since Q is back in the picture and is very young, may be we expect him to take role in several other bond movies like Desmond Llewelyn. Also, if you're a Bond Fan, you could understand that the movies was going to disappoint you from the music titles. The song is good. But the singalong scene is mediocre."
"amanmadan85","3","35","72","1 November 2012"," Is MI6 that rookie?
","Bond films are action entertainers and as action entertainers go, you must allow some leverage in terms of suspension of disbelief. But this movie took it too far<br/><br/>As I went to watch this movie, it already had an 8.3 on IMDb with over 15,000 votes. The critics reviews are also highly positive (some calling it one of the greatest Bond movies). I had higher hopes also given Javier Bardem was the main antagonist. Like I said, I don't mind pure entertainment for an action movie, I quite enjoy the Fast and Furious series as pure action entertainers.<br/><br/>My problem with this movie was it seemed like MI6 was being played for dumb throughout. There was one illogical scene and it was followed by another mind boggling where either MI6 would take a stupid call or the opponents would simply think them to be a bunch of useless amateurs and actually succeed with their plan. Now, the basic plot is completely fine and intriguing, it is the scenarios that were a complete let down. Sure, Bardem's character was intelligent, but it does not mean MI6 has to play dumb and let him get the best of the agency. Also, one generic point against most movies portraying cyber crime, you just show someone being a genius and don't even need to explain how one achieved his/her goals. But usually other such movies get canned by critics and viewers alike, strange everyone is looking the other way for this movie. Excessive romanticism with combination of Craig as Bond + Mendes is quite apparent, added no doubt by stellar performance by Bardem<br/><br/>For a series that projects adventures of one of the greatest spies in the world working for an enviable intelligence agency, the movie should have been slightly more cerebral, have some deduction or logic to arrive at certain conclusions rather than simply a series of action sequences wherein it never seemed like the bad guys were able to get one up against the best, but go one up because there were giant loopholes just waiting to be exploited.<br/><br/>Quite a disappointing movie with the only highlight being the title track and a few locales"

","Choice lines from the script: ""What's going on?"", ""I'm gonna get whoever did this"". Judi Dench as ever completely miscast - she seems to be advertising Marks and Spencers ready meals, not running MI6. And indeed, the film itself is about M, not Bond's struggle with global villainy. <br/><br/>I thought Daniel Craig had nailed Bond in Casino Royale, but here he does completely the wrong thing - he makes it look hard. And hard it is, to watch that is. One point - from earlier Bonds, kids of 8 or so learned to play fight and stay cool, to use only necessary 'violence', or invent a way out of a tight spot (in play). From this Bond, they learn to play broody, angry and vicious, and sulk when things go wrong. That's what the iconic Bond has lost.<br/><br/>And then they call in Ralph Fiennes, the world's stiffest actor, to replace the dead Dench M. Have they forgotten it was he who made The Avengers a turkey? Rory Kinnear totally humourless, as is this poor excuse for a Bond film which is more like an episode of 'The Bill'."

","'SKYFALL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The 50th anniversary of the James Bond series brings us the third appearance of Daniel Craig as Bond in it's twenty-third film. Judi Dench makes her seventh (and final) appearance as M in her biggest turn as the role yet. Javier Bardem also co-stars as the movie's main villain. The film was directed by Sam Mendes (of 'AMERICAN BEAUTY' fame) and written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (who also co-wrote the last four Bond films) as well as John Logan. The story revolves around a computer drive, with a list of British secret agents on it, falling in to the wrong hands. The movie is masterfully directed by Mendes and features more than a handful of spectacular action scenes that Bond films are loved for. One of the better films of the series.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Bond and another MI6 agent, named Eve (Naomie Harris), in Turkey in hot pursuit of the mercenary, Patrice (Ola Rapace), who stole the list of undercover NATO agents. Patrice escapes and Bond is believed to be killed. The MI6 commander, M (Dench), is being pressured to retire because of the incident when MI6 is hacked and eight agents are killed. Bond learns of the attack and returns to London, after letting everyone think he was dead for months, and is returned to active duty despite failing his aptitude tests (which M keeps secret, even from Bond). Bond then teams with Eve once again to find out who's responsible for the attack on MI6, as more agents are killed, and tracks the culprit to an island in China.<br/><br/>I've always found good Bond films to have great elaborate action scenes but to be light on pacing and excitement in between. This film is actually much faster paced than most others in the series. It's really exciting and involving all the way up to the last 40 minutes when it seems to drag a little and go on for too long. It appears to climax at about an hour and forty minutes but then unexpectedly takes another turn and continues on (somewhat needlessly) for another 40 minutes. The ending is still action packed and somewhat exciting but by the time it gets there it's ran a little low on steam. This is a flaw in my opinion but not a great one. It's still better than most other Bond films and Craig and Dench are outstanding in it once again (Bardem is also an excellent bad guy). The script is routine but a little more emotionally involving than usual, especially involving M's character, and Mendes is perfectly apt at directing a Bond film. It's a nice 50th anniversary piece, for the series, and fans will love it.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM"

To see James Bond CRYING at the end is just ridiculous! What utter utter nonsense! Why people are waxing lyrical over this film is beyond my reasoning...<br/><br/>I give it 5....and that at a push...

"lediscipledessocrates","4","31","63","4 November 2012"," Skyfall-Of Course it is.
","Sky Fall - Of Course it is ""Of course he is"" ""Of course she is"" ""Of course they are"" It would have been better had the director and Daniel Craig recognized the fact that some things are better left behind especially when you cannot pull them off with dignity or any meaning at all. <br/><br/>An attempt to go back to the roots , as they say, was conspicuously evident . The camera-work and cinematography was commendable when it came to picturising the combat and action sequences as also the breathtaking scenery of the Scottish Highlands and plains. For a brief span of time I did trick my naïve self into believing that perhaps the production team had been able to do what they had set out to , in the first place – Back to basics and more. Much to my dismay , however , it was nothing short of a calamity brought on by a misfired round of blunt bullets. To finally actually be able to hands and limbs moving while fighting without the camera moving violently so as to hide the actual movement was a relief. But what definitely was not a relief was the ordinary set of sequences on display . <br/><br/>Craig looked tired, stale and drugged. Haggard and worn down . We appreciate the fact the director tried to instill traces of human frailty but to create a B-Grade action movie star out of James Bond is something no Bond lover can appreciate. I , for the record, am not one. <br/><br/>The absence of punches and dearth of dry (or for that matter, any kind of ) humour , sets this movie apart from the classical franchise ; while a dreary and unkempt plot as well as shallow and clichéd characters hauls it out of the cauldron of artistic glory which houses ""Quantum of Solace""(2008) and ""Casino Royale"" (2006).<br/><br/>The traditional lovers of Bond movies would hate it for the absence of the ""traditional"" elements. While the Craigophiles would hate it for defacing the venerable memories of Quantum of Solace. If for argument's sake we admit that Craig and the two movies he featured in prior to this one , re-invented James Bond , we can then safely assert with unbridled confidence that this movie sabotaged the entire re-invention process .<br/><br/>The intention may have been good , I dare say; but the execution systematically destroyed the movie . A lackluster opening sequence , no variety or ingenuity . An intriguing Villain who fails to stand up to the ""Horrifying"" introduction afforded to him by the Marion Cottilard of this movie. (kindly refer to the scene where Bond catches her getting scared and compare it with Cottilard's death scene from ""The Dark Knight Rises""(2012) ).<br/><br/>Lacking the quips of Connery or Moore or even Brosnan , Craig is made to utter stale and un-funny dialogue which reflects that not only is this Bond not witty but is also shi*** . A ""Home Alone"" (1990) like finale could have been tolerated had it been as fantastic or even half as captivating and entertaining as the ""Home Alone"" finale actually was. Booby trapped floors, shrapnel infested light bulbs and no application of mind. Bond chooses to isolate himself when back up was quite easy to procure . He manages to get M killed . Or maybe he was planning his vengeance and successfully exacted revenge by getting her killed vicariously by misfit villain casted accidentally in the flick. This , if turns out to be the case would surely redeem he movie and superbly re-invent Bond. Yes Ma'am it would. Some shots also evidenced the fact that the Director was handed out a shoe string budget. The special effects were deliberately minimalized as a part of the artistic theme of the movie. That I admit. But what I can't digest is that how can someone shoot the train accident sequence so unattractively , almost reminiscent of the ending of ""The Burning Train""(1980) or more aptly ""The Burning Toy Train"" (kindly watch the movie for cheap thrills) .<br/><br/>The movie also suggests a slump in the artistic and qualitatively credibility of action movies arriving on the scene of late. The Bourne Legacy (2012) was boring , more like a Bear Grylls episode cut short by a amateurish Bourne Series trailer performed by Cover Artists not paid too well, if at all. ""Taken 2"" (2012) repetitive and cumbersome , it didn't even flatter to subsequently deceive . And now quite unexpectedly Skyfall comes along .<br/><br/>The unimaginative display of stereotypes makes it an ordinary movie and had it not been a Bond flick it would have qualified as a very ignorable action movie , with neither style nor any kind of taste."

","Firstly may I say I have never written a review before, I am far from being an expert film critique. Secondly I am not a hater of Daniel Craig and thirdly nor am I a hater of change.<br/><br/>There are many good and bad reviews on here and in general they talk about the action scenes, the missing bond girls and the lack of gadgets throughout the film etc... I honestly believe that whilst they are generally a bond tradition, they are highly irrelevant in this case. This is simply because the story line is so weak that no amount of gadgets and girls would have helped.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is amazing, the actors and actresses are generally faultless and the action scenes are good but with such a poor story line I felt myself not caring in the slightest what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>How can a film begin with Bond being so dispensable yet the rest of the film is all about him protecting his apparent indispensable boss. This may seem like a minor point but think about it. Is there any thought to the mi6 agent killed at the beginning of QoS? Or the bond girl killed with oil. No there isn't because as an audience we accept that there is an inherent risk to those members assigned to the security services and more importantly there is the bigger picture to consider. So we don't dwell on the deaths but rather swiftly move on with the rest of the story. Unfortunately with this film there isn't a bigger picture.<br/><br/>That is not the only flaw to the plot. As highlighted by many already, there is a rather impressive opening sequence all about Bond retrieving a hard drive, yet its whereabouts is never answered. <br/><br/>And the Bond villain himself. I agree entirely with the notions that he is similar to the joker and I think this is justified. But more importantly why have such a clever complex plot to get to M. If he is capable of all that, surely it should leave the audience wondering why he didn't just go straight for M.<br/><br/>Casino Royale was a great film and I could even take good things from the much weaker QoS but Skyfall is massively let down by a very poor plot with very poor dialogue."

","so, Bond is back and Sam Mendes made the brilliant job of cocking it up. Well, the script wasn't brilliant to begin with, but wtf? The only thing that is worth in this movie is the ending (which by the way is really good) but it's there to move you along to the other two Bond movies that Craig still has under contract. The rest of the film? Rubbish! the villain is bad, the girls? Well, (yes there are two) one is moneypenny and the other one don't bother to grasp why she's there because they didn't... So, you get an old Bond that drinks, takes pills and the ""mileage"" is starting to affect him; he pretends to be dead then comes back for queen and country. Fails the field agent tests but gets to active duties nonetheless. Searches for villain (really boring part of the movie), gets no gadgets from a new Q (zero past character build on that one also) and finds the bad guy - a former 00 and a computer genius that can do whatever he wants on a laptop (so he claims). Objective? Kill M. Why did he let Bond get to him? Dunno! Why didn't he blew up M along with her office? (yes he blew up headquarters) dunno! Why not release the list of undercover agents and destroy M reputation quickly? Dunno! And there's more stuff like this. NO COMMON SENSE... Conclusion: back to Charlies Angel's type Bond. Highly improbable, no sense, far away from Connery and even really worse than the last two. Oh, and Barden was terrible in this film, seamed uncomfortable and kinda off balance with the character. This is why Bourne movies (the first two anyway) were everything Bond used to be. And why Bond was getting back on track. The problem is that they have to make a new one every two or so years and take any script that comes along. But go for it anyway. Go for a coffee and get inside at the middle of the movie: you catch it really fast and you don't want to miss the end. The rest is just a pile of bs..."

","I thought Casino Royal was outstanding and found QoS to be far better than a disconcerting number of other but I am shocked by the number positive reviews this Skyfall has received.<br/><br/>I found it to be weak on so many levels. Firstly and most disappointingly was the storyline, I found there to be none. The original premise of the retrieval of stolen files to protect undercover agents (fine, although not without a hint of irony considering recent tube train blunders) which is a reasonable, formulaic premise but this gets forgotten very quickly and turns into a bit of a nonsensical drama.<br/><br/>Secondly, the villain who could hack anything, crash PLCs, who planned his capture and inexplicable escape to such minute detail couldn't simply off M at his leisure, was farcically weak, with no depth to the character and so hammy I was incapable of finding anything of interest.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the craziness of the head of MI6 going off radar (although not quite) and to be used as bait (without support) to bring out the villain just, along with the dire (and oh-so overly used rocky-esque comeback from Bond - poorly time considering it had just been used by Dark Knight Rises to similarly inept results) illustrated just how poorly conceived this storyline and therefore this film was.<br/><br/>I feel as if I haven't just watched a film, I have simply watched an appallingly weak delivery method to off M and re-jig the cast-line (Moneypenny plus).<br/><br/>This film has been marketed to within an inch of its life and I can only cringe at the staggering amount of money they wasted on this and not put it where it should have been put, into the storyline and script. What did surprize me was a little negative marketing got slipped in, at the start, where a bunch of Volk Wagon Beetles got wrecked on the train and even got named in the script, why? What possible relevance unless some cheeky chappy put a couple of quid to belittle Veedub or Veedub couldn't find it in their hearts to donate to the Bond cause. It has been well publicised that Skyfall had some funding issues causing it to be delayed, quite badly (considering Casino was 2006 and QoS was 2008).<br/><br/>The signs were there that this was going to be a fail but like all Bond fans I chose to ignore it. This will definitely not be on my DVD to get list. For the next one, which looks to be Craig's final film, I would prefer a return to the tension, grittiness and style that Casino had in abundance and stood Craig as one of the best Bonds."

It was ambitious to include such ""reckonings"" incorporated in the film, including major events such as going back to Bond's childhood home (which I was disappointed but not surprised to find was not mentioned by Fleming) The whole film seemed to boil down to one big hunt, in which the villain could easily have killed his target from the start, but prolongs the attempt, making his life very difficult despite all of the very advanced technology at his disposal. The CG was pretty dismal in parts too, by today's standards. The only part I liked is when the villain reveals his ""affliction"". Other than that, I was pretty nonplussed.

I was so upset with the whole film. Daniel Craig I feel does act well in this film but is severely let down by the script and directing. <br/><br/>If your looking for a good action film with a little bit of a story that doesn't quite make sense but your there more for the action then its OK! If your going to watch it with the expectation (as I had, thanks to all the hype of radio and TV (DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE)) that ""Bond is back"" and all that Jazz; expect to be disappointed!<br/><br/>The opening scene with the chase was good, but it felt like it should've been further into the film. You start off too deep into a scene that then turns out to be almost pointless. Bond is supposed to be trying to recover something for MI6 and ends up not doing anything close to it. <br/><br/>Forgive me but isn't the format for all bond films something/someone taken/killed, MI6 gets annoyed, sends bond, all ends up well due to bond. This film goes along the lines of something taken, MI6 annoyed, bond comes back and doesn't recover the stolen item. <br/><br/>This basically means that Bond Isn't Bond!!!!<br/><br/>The film in general is too comical, there are far too many references to other films. If they had been referencing bond films then maybe I could understand but they weren't!!! <br/><br/>I also have a bone to pick with the new Q. He's pointless and stupid in this film!!!! Q has never been like this in any of the previous bonds. He's been clever witty and game for almost anything whilst at the same time giving bond incredible gadgets and the usual ""I'd like it back in one piece please this time Bond!"" This new Q is atrocious. Far too young, doesn't fit the profile of a Q and completely lacks the pizazz of the original or even John Cleese when he played it.<br/><br/>I also don't see why this film had to be so unnecessarily long. It was far too long. If I were the editor I would've cut the film down by about 30-40 mins.<br/><br/>The bond villain isn't one of the usual crew from spectre etc but also hasn't got too much of a story himself. <br/><br/>Where are the bond girls??? This has got to be the first film without what I would call a proper bond girl. I mean come on!!! There are rules to follow when creating a new bond film and this one seems to break or ignore them all. <br/><br/>All in all I'm highly disappointed that this was made let alone that I paid money to see this.

The dragon boat casino set piece looks like old Hollywood films from the 40's with cardboard caricatures of Chinese villains and damsels in distress. The nail in the coffin was the long finale with the plot so old and silly that it's not worth mentioning. Daniel Craig looked so old and worn out in the first half of the film.

The gadgets scene is the biggest down fall of this movie if you ask me. I expected to see some creative gadgets and a car with guns on it...not in this movie people. James is being handed A Gun and a small stress Radio gadgets device, and to top it all off they leave you (the watcher) with the cheesiest Line. ""what did you want to get an exploding pen?""....YESSSSSSSS we want to see awesome gadgets at least i did. <br/><br/>I read some where that the budget for this movie was around the 200$ mil.

"rj456","1","13","23","16 February 2013"," Just Avoid It + I Am Wondering Why So Many Critics Liked It?
","Let me begin from the end by summarizing it and saying that it is probably the worse movie in the Bond franchise, here are some pointers: 01. The production said that the budget of the movie was around 200$ million dollars, unless the actors received 180$ Millions from it I have no idea how they came up with such an enormous sum, something is really fishy in their claim.<br/><br/>02. The script of the movie is just terrible! It's not A typical Bond film, one can barely call it an action movie, it's more like A soap, before I saw the movie I was wondering why it's so long (Almost 2.5 hours), after seeing it I understood! The dialogs between the main characters are just endless and tiring, about two thirds of the movie is filled with endless babbles. You can forget about funny anecdotes that use to be so familiar with Bond or the ingenuity that set him apart from the average Jo and his nemesis, for the third movie in A row now Bond is all about brawn no brain. <br/><br/>03. The plot is even worse than the script, here are few examples (out of many!). The bad guy ""Silva"" wants to kill ""M"" (revenge), why not just kill her? He has the resources, he has the ability, he is not shown as an idiot, so why suddenly act as one? His people also try to kill Bond A couple of times but once he captures Bond, he ""forgets"" that he wants kill him and instead he wants to give him ""A moral lecture"" A thing that which makes him look like the most idiotic villain ever. Another example, ""M"" and her people tell Bond that the fragments of the bullet that hit Bond are traced back to an ""international terrorist"" which has murdered the American ambassador in Yemen and the Americans are looking for him for 3 years!! Suddenly ""M's"" chief of staff says that they have sources that say that this person will be in Shanghai in 3 days and suddenly you see Bond waiting for him at the airport (seems like they even knew his flight number). Even the opening scene of the movie which was the most exciting in the entire film is full with holes and mistakes and is just far fetched.<br/><br/>I Can go on and on but in all it is really not A worthy Bond movie, and an insult to the intelligence of the viewers. And 3 movies are A long enough run to come to the conclusion that Craig is not the person to portray Bond, he is A good actor but he is just too serious, he has no sense of humor what so ever not to mention that he lacks the charm that Moore/Connery possessed. Craig looks more like A muscled bodyguard, A bouncer at A club when he should be portraying A suave, sophisticated cerebral assassin, apparently something he is not capable of.<br/><br/>There are many terrible reviews on this movie (seems like A record number here at IMDb) which makes me wonder why so many of the ""official critics"" liked it? Did they miss what almost most of us saw? Are they getting paid to write these positive reviews? (most likely!) Or maybe they are just terrible critics and we should almost ALWAYS avoid what critics say."

At the time of Quantum of Solace, I didn't even know there had been another Bond movie with Daniel Craig. I was surprised to see it on TV for the first time. It wasn't that good but it was somewhat entertaining the first time around. Then came Skyfall and it's nonsense scenario.

I'd really like to know what, specifically, they thought was good about it. I really enjoyed Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace was pretty good, although not great.

"Hellbunni","2","16","30","15 December 2012"," Great potential but very disappointing
","The movie had great potential but falls flat because of 2 main flaws<br/><br/>1.) technology in the movie is very inconsistent. It feels like the movie is trying to give nods to old bond movie tech, but the setting is in modern day, so it gets ""confusing"". For example, MI6 somehow has the ability to track agents out in the field (with pin point accuracy), but for some reason it's range is limited (suggests radio or air wave based tracking). They never explain what tech is used to track the agents, and why they can track them some times and not others. Since they mention satellites, why wouldn't they just use GPS chips? <br/><br/>Later in the movie, Bond gets a distress transmitter, that is radio based, really? radio based? and the size of the transmitter is huge! (size of a SD card) that Bond has to turn on manually!! But somehow, the range of the radio based transmitter is huge! He turns it on on the way to a remote abandoned island with nothing in sight, but MI6 is able to send agents there.<br/><br/>And somehow, everything is connected to the network and can be hacked. <br/><br/>2.) for some reason, everyone in the movie is stupid (or just makes the most stupid and wrong decision someone can make). It reminds me of the beginning of Scary Movie, where Carmen Electra is portraying a horror movie victim who chooses a banana over a gun, runs towards to woods instead of the city, etc... Here is a list of some of them<br/><br/><ul><li>Why is the list of all MI6 agents on a laptop hard-drive??? Why isn't it in a server locked behind heavily guarded gates and not connected to an external network??</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the beginning, when Bond is fighting with the bad guy on top of the train, and his partner has a risky shot and M tells her to shoot. Bond was fully aware of the situation and order (because he had a ear piece) but decides NOT to get out of the way to give his partner a clean shot!! Really?? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>same segment, you are MI6, you know the bad guy is on a train, send freaking backup! eye in the sky, something. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the bad guy from the beginning of the movie is hired make a hit. But, its so stupid for some many reasons. </li></ul><br/><br/>1. the target is in the company of the employer's location and company <br/><br/>2. assassin goes to this nice building and kills security guards to get to a nice vantage point, to shoot the target in the next building (but that next building is literally right next door (like 50 yards!)!!<br/><br/><ul><li>then MI6 building gets attacked, so they decide to move it to a more secure location. Except</li></ul><br/><br/>1. the attack was later learned to be hacking of the gas line, then what's the point of moving to a new location, when that new location can still and does get hacked so easily!<br/><br/>2. the new location had heavy security at the front entrance, but there are a million other entrances that someone can just way in/out of (with no guards or security measures at these other entrances) How is that secure???? <br/><br/><ul><li>later on the main baddie gets caught on ""purpose"" so he get in to talk to M. And more stupid stuff follows</li></ul><br/><br/>1. Q, being a ultra smart guy, decides to plug the enemies laptop right into their network!! (really??) and gets hacked<br/><br/>2. The bad guy escapes, and then attacks M who is at a meeting with the government. Why bother getting caught if you are not after anything at MI6??<br/><br/>3. a meeting with the head of MI6 and government officials, yet the place had really bad security (only regular cannon folder). Really?? 5 guys can just walk in and kill all the security guards without them putting up a fight or alarm?<br/><br/><ul><li>then Bond decides that its a good idea to use M as bait to lure out the bad guy. But more stupid stuff follows:</li></ul><br/><br/>1. why must it be done alone? why not get more guns, ammo, armor, etc... <br/><br/>2. the baddies come for M, its a long road to the house from the gate, where the baddies are wide open as they walk towards the house. Yet stupid Bond and gang does not freaking pick off the baddies. Instead they wait till they are at the house!<br/><br/>I really wanted to like the movie, but too many points in the movie I went WTF? really? Why would anyone with some common sense make those decisions??"

","I just had to comment after seeing so many glowing reviews of the same movie I just sat through.Come on guys are we that easily pleased these days.The movie is plain and simply boring.The first half an hour is well worth a watch but after that its a snore-fest,as i entered this snore-fest I found myself checking my watch a number of times,not a great thing if the movie is as good as many others have boasted. Bond gets shot (in the shoulder)by a MI5 marks-woman (Eve)and this somehow ruins his future,we learn later he heard the order being given to take the shot,so why the hell didn't he duck,dive or just plain old spin the villain in the direction of the shot.This is where his loyalty is tested,wow I feel so hurt for him.....NOT. The main villain (Silva) is supposed to let us believe that what ever he needs to demolish or take control of all he needs to do is flip open a laptop and away he goes,the world is his.Sorry but if this guy is supposed to be as professional as we are led to believe,then MI5 are on their last legs,the guy is an idiot,come on,a firefight to kill Bond. Im sorry guys but I found this movie,boring,dimwitted and a waste of 143 minutes. Oh how could I forget about the twists,if I was 10 or 11 then maybe id be astonished ( OK maybe even at that age I'm pushing it~) but again the same word comes to mind ""boring"". It also looks like Craig is soon to be replaced,they played on his age factor a fair bit in the movie too,id say he has maybe 2 more starring roles to go before they replace him. Its not the actors,its not the sets,its not the action (or lack of) these are all as good as all the other bond movies.Its the writing and direction that falls flat on this one. We go to a bond movie to be amazed,shocked,seduced and entertained and this one just does not deliver.Sorry but all I can give this is a 3 out of 10 and thats only for the first half an hour to be honest.Don't waste your money on going to see this in the cinema,rent it,at least you can pause,eat,drink and smoke or do what ever you do when you get bored.

","Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear. Mendes tried so hard, and I respect him for it, especially with him being one of my favourite directors. You could see with every scene in Skyfall him trying to inject his usual brilliance, the emotion and absolute conviction of what truth is to be said that makes his other films so varied, dynamic and meaningful. Most of the directing was fantastic. But the script and the story were too majorly flawed for it to be in any way a decent film. <br/><br/>Acting from the usually brilliant Javier Bardem was questionable throughout, almost parody-villain, and whilst the rest of the tip top cast tried their hardest, by the end their character motivations were so strained and to the point of absurdity that what starts as a dull and uninspiring romp just ends up becoming confused. The dialogue was wooden and in hurriedly tripping over its own feet to be sexy, sassy and 007 it became a caricature of a caricature of dialogue from previous films. The interesting exploration of who Bond really is that made Casino Royale so delectable has definitely been shrugged off, to be replaced by a Bond so depressed by his own existence you wonder what's the point in even watching him. <br/><br/>There were some fun jokes and moments of nostalgia that made you smile (though even the nostalgia was overdone) but other than that it was a complete and utter mess. It was better than Quantum of Solace, but that's not really saying much."

"robertbmtan","9","5","7","7 September 2017"," Finally breaking the ""Bond formula""
","For twenty-something films, Bond movies have always followed the same ""Bond formula"" (although who can blame them, it's mostly enticing and satisfying to watch: see Casino Royale). But not anymore. This is the first Bond film that captures everything a Bond film should have - the amazing score, spy action, feats of impossibility, classy and luxurious settings, a criminal mastermind, near apocalyptic scenarios...etc. yet doesn't feel at all cliché. For the first time, the tables have been turned against Bond from the very beginning: he is getting older, his abilities have deteriorated, and he is no longer equipped with futuristic gadgets we're all so used to. From there, the plot develops as a typical Bond film... or so it seems... until things really start escalating. Without spoiling much, I'll just say that the plot takes many turns that immediately sucks viewers in. Unlike many other mediocre bond films, the plot in this leaves viewers engaged and invested in the story. Moving beyond the plot, the characters in this film are also portrayed perfectly. Although some may think it's a bit cliché - a classy womanizing spy, a badass criminal mastermind, a beautiful and seductive damsel, this is a Bond film after all. And these characters are all so very classy, leaving viewers incredibly satisfied upon viewing. But what makes this film a true masterpiece is the cinematography. From the first scene to the end, the tone and environmental shifts create a surreal and artistic experience. Many shots are incredibly artistic, with amazing background contrasts, focus usage, closeups that capture the grandeur of a exemplary Bond film. Finally, the colors and tones of this film paint a truly unique experience, where the many shifts between cold and warm colors accompany the rise and fall in plot points, generating suspense and emotion to the film.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if you usually watch Bond films or not, I'd recommend this film to anyone who remotely likes action and suspense. The cinematography and plot are both atypical of Bond films yet excel spectacularly in the spy film genre."

Stays in your mind for weeks the first time you watch it.<br/><br/>Danny's finest 007 hours on screen besides Casino, in my opinion. Some picks of humour delights the audience very well on the journey, and there's the right James Bond feeling most of the way.<br/><br/>A Spanish guy named Javier Bardem is far out beautiful bad guy.

Entertaining and action-filled. A top 10 JB movie to me. Nevermind the aging of such 60's stuff.<br/><br/>*RM: ""The Spy Who..."" (1977.) Roger Moore as 007 to the fullest. A 70's classic people today still compares to year fellow movies like Star Wars, Close Encouters, or, for .... sake, Smokey and the Bandit. Way out there, as the 70's was, and a certain '79 movie sealed it.<br/><br/>*TD: ""The Living Daylights"" (1987.) Very hard to choose one of his (sadly only) two movies. I like both of them a lot. LTK gets to me deeper in between days, but this is more of the pure JB thing.<br/><br/>*PB: ""Goldeneye"" (1995.) All-in by Pierce Brosnan. He new his work was important and very well sought after. The other 007's of his sadly disappears in too much merchandise. And DAD is quite silly still, uh?<br/><br/>*DC: ""Casino Royale"" (2006.) No one could expected an entering like this. As his fore-runner, he knew that a first job was crucial. He did it, quite well.<br/><br/>So...now I've completed my 007 reviews. Over 1,5 years since first. Got some likes, got some dislikes. (But I hope it entertains someone out there.)<br/><br/>I adore you (Bond) movie lovers as much as you adore me, and any other kindred spirits!"

I don't suppose he could just walk in her apartment (like Bond did) and simply shoot her. And Bond who gets shot, falls off the train into the abyss, and is even shown drowning, then somehow makes miraculous recovery.

","A respectable entry after the lackluster Quantum of Solace, Skyfall is propelled by two strong performances: Craig's ruthless Bond and Bardem's ghoulish supervillain Silva.<br/><br/>Set-pieces are also vastly improved, although with the occasional misstep - a stupid, unexciting brawl next to Komodo dragons being the worst.<br/><br/>Skyfall suffers from the ""bad guy with ludicrously complex plans"" syndrome, which exploded in modern action cinema after the memorable shenanigans of The Joker in The Dark Knight. Silva's impossible machinations all go off without a hitch and yet turn out to be an absurdly convoluted way to achieve revenge for someone who can blow up a building half a world away with a few clicks of his mouse.<br/><br/>Good guys, on the other hand, are astoundingly thick. In the climactic finale, Bond and M lure Silva and his army to an isolated location and face them with no reinforcements aside for an old caretaker. I understand preventing civilian casualties, but why not bring, you know, MORE MI6 AGENTS? It's kind of their job. It makes no sense even for a series featuring henchmen with steel-capped teeth or deadly bowler hats.<br/><br/>I am also doubtful about delving into Bond's past. It's fairly well done, but in these long-established sagas the protagonist's past is best left vague, imagining it being part of the implicit pact between creators and viewers.

","Yes, a Bond movie takes the famous 'Citizen Kane' motif, but why? Well, it is a film that just lifts dialogue, action sequences, and tropes from other movies, so why not one of the greatest. Except it is a monstrous cheek and totally unworthy of a Bond tradition. It has action, but it is all rather too familiar (duel on top of train, motorbike chase around Istanbul, chasing along the Underground - yawn,yawn!). It has some jokes, but Roger Moore was better at it. It has wooden acting - Daniel 'one note' Craig. Everybody forgets that Bond has to go from suave seductive charmer to cold blooded killer in an instance - 'Dr No' and Zena Walker. Yes, only Timothy Dalton has come anywhere near Sean Connery. Lines are taken from a range of sources, including 'Buck Rogers in the 25th Century' - 'I've been ready since before you were born (Albert Finney originally considered for the first Bond!). Shots are copied - the final outside scene shows Bond looking over London from the rooftop as its guardian - Batman looking over Gotham City!!! Even 'Revenge of the Jedi' gets a look in with the Rancor Monster being doubled by the Komodo Dragon (which can never be exported by the way)! Plot holes galore and even the shirking of action killing - cue Tube train falling through the floor during rush hour but obviously having no passengers! And what about Javier Bardem locked up like Hannibal Lector? He escapes in an even worse plot hole than Anthony Hopkins! I could go on, but no, the film critics have lost all sense of critical judgment and objectivity - this Bond is only marginally better than the rubbish that was 'Quantum of Solace.' Give the role to Ola Rapace, who looked the part of Bond even though he ended up like poor old Robert Shaw, and the helm to a Swedish director - he might do better!"

When Casino Royale came out i was interested to see it but was hugely disappointed, the story was OK, but the acting was dreadful, particularly Eva Green (one of the worst actresses ever). I thought Quantum was a bit better (More Bondish) although the baddie was terrible. And now this dreadful pile of junk, of which i can't think of a single redeeming scene, it's so sad that some good film makers are associated with it, Sam Mendes was a good director, and Javier Bardem can be a great actor, although he had nothing to work with here. I'm not surprised Judi Dench died at the end, probably of embarrassment. As far as i'm concerned there are only 20 official Bond movies and until Craig leaves and some decent writers come on board, that's the way it will stay.

","I've been a Bond fan for a long time and watched it change over the years. Other than some lovely dark portrayals of Bond by Sean Connery, the character and the character of the films is largely tongue in cheek. In 1965 Sidney J Furie showed the filmmaking world how to make an authentic feeling and innovative spy film with The Ipcress File - he even managed to make Michael Caine act well. This film has never been beaten. Broccoli and co should have learned from this but didn't, going even more camp with Roger Moore and latterly Pirece Brosnan. In 1983, Irvin Kershner tried to show the Broccoli gang that they were heading in the wrong direction by making Never Say Never Again and bringing back Sean Connery – a much darker and more 'realistic' Bond/Spy film – and I think, vastly underrated. I also think that the Dan Craig guys 'borrowed' a lot from the style of this film. What really changed Bond for the better and made the character 21st century, was the film The Bourne Identity. Greengrass created a realistic style – modern and believable, no innuendo and no campness. Thankfully they killed off Clive Owen quite quickly who spoiled it all with his primary school acting, but was more than compensated for by the excellent Albert Finney. Now I mention this because Finney was also in Skyfall. I reckon that all any Director has to do with Finney is wind him up and watch him go. Similarly Javier Bardem (the Coen brothers famously saying to him that they weren't going to direct his performance as they had so much faith in his ability). However WTF did Mendes do to these fine actors? What wrong buttons do you have to press to make these fine actors act so terribly? Did they attend a workshop by Clive Owen? The performances were as bad as the film overall. Judi Dench plays everything the same way as she is flat and not quite all there so there's nothing anyone can do with that. And the supporting actors? Heck, straight out of drama school with not a gram of charisma between them. One of the problems the Producers, Writers and certainly the Director had was sitting on the popularity of the film and expecting the brand to do all the work. It's a display of arrogance and conceit that ruined the film entirely. The script by Purvis, Wade and Logan, was more full of holes than a pair of fishnet stockings – no journey (or 'arc' as they like to say) for any character, no rounded fullness no story even, just a few disparate badly joined up scenarios cobbled together with no real feel for length or interest. The script was insulting and I hope the writers are ashamed. The lighting was absolutely appalling – I've seen better lighting on 70's American TV shows. I bet the DOP took forever to light each scene and took a load of wages for bossing people around and being arrogant. Two areas of the film particularly bad for lighting were the underground MI5 – just fluorescent tubes lit from the top and the worst of all, that crazy bloody house burning and burning forever at the end. Man it burned at the same constant rate for half an hour whether you were right next to it or a mile away like in the church – Roger Deakins, you should be ashamed of yourself and your craft. Sam Mendes, go back to theatre directing, you clearly know nothing about pace and storytelling and most of all, Directing actors? You couldn't direct traffic. Definitely one of the worst Bond films ever."

"emandaniel","5","27","56","24 November 2012"," Bond fails to protect...or care.
","Don't look for a hero here. Bond fails to protect or even acknowledge the most vulnerable, saving his tears only for the one who used him the most. In fact, each of the main characters in this film, from Bond to Villain and M to Q, all commit tragic failures of judgment. Bond, M, and Q are simply horribly incompetent spies. Here are two of many possible examples:<br/><br/>Standing less than 20 feet away from Bond, an assassin prepares and then trains his rifle on an unsuspecting victim. Who is the intended victim? What does Bond do? <br/><br/>Later, only scant seconds before a rescue he expects, Bond engages in a William Tell style shoot off with Sévérine, the woman he convinced he could free from terror and bondage. <br/><br/>In both cases, the writers and director leave Bond without the slightest acknowledgment or remorse for the needless outcomes he could have either prevented outright or at the least, attempted to delay. In fact, he fails to prevent the death of anyone who relies on him. <br/><br/>Sadly, the two characters who's story line and portrayal we care for, Sévérine and Silva, will not be returning. However, Bond will be back. But if his character can no longer care enough to easily prevent an assassin before the shot, or to delay a game of death long enough to save a women he has determined has been trapped in the sex trade since age 13, why should we care whether Bond himself lives or dies?<br/><br/>This film has action you expect and will be entertained by and acting by Marlohe and Bardem which almost make the film worthwhile. But like Bond, I will not waste tears for those who knowingly put themselves in his care."
"patrick-olson86","4","24","49","12 November 2012"," Meh... One of the best Bond flicks ever? Hahaha...
","So, by now you've heard that this is probably the best Bond movie of all time and the greatest thing to hit earth since sliced bread. Don't get your hopes up too high.<br/><br/>It's a decent movie. I give it a 4/10. Traditionally, I read nothing about movies before they come out and I see them, this time was no different except I heard the hype from everyone and read headlines saying this was ""The Best Bond Yet"". Man, was I disappointed. Spoilers ahead: OK, first, the movie starts off great. Cool action scene and bond gets shot in the chest and drops a million feet into a river then goes down a waterfall. Of course he's alive because there's still 2 hours of movie left. But, how is he alive? No one knows, no explanation. I forgave it. But that was a sign of things to come.<br/><br/>Plot: Here's the bad part of the movie, the plot. Half-attempt at making a movie go longer than 2 hours with no plot.. they tried. Here's the plot: a list of undercover agents is stolen and bond needs to get the data files back. List is posted online and agents start getting assassinated left and right.. oh yeah then they totally forget about that whole part of the plot halfway through. So, what's next? OK, Bond, go kill the guy you fought in the intro. He does, finds a gambling chip in this dude's briefcase and goes to the casino. All of a sudden he's flirting with a girl (of course) who just so happens to be the bad guy's main harlot. So what next? Oh let's go to an island with no explanation as to why. It's deserted so the big bad guy lives in this island city with his thugs. The city is deserted why? Oh because the villain is a super computer genius (think Julian Assange here) and that's how he scared off the population... sure..<br/><br/>Wow, I could go on and on.. but I'll save you. The end of the movie was anti-climactic. With a big budget I'm surprised they did that.. a helicopter basically just shoots up a house, then bond blows it up with propane tanks, and the chopper crashes into the house, blowing it up even more... really? Towards the last third of the movie, I got this sense that the bond story was lifted from the Dark Knight movies... then I read a review where Mendes used those as influences. Excuse me.. I'm sorry. When that movie just came out this year, get a new idea please. This is James Bond, write an original story. Don't get into the whole orphan who lost his parents at age 10 who turned out to be a good guy/crime fighter and try to play it off as original. The audience isn't that dumb, but judging by the critics reviews, they are.<br/><br/>Some good things about this movie: Daniel Craig was good with what he was given, and Javier was good with what he was given too. There just wasn't much character development that the story left open. It was SO quick and anticlimactic that I felt I had gone back in time to the Timothy Dalton days.. that's not right. Why can't we just get a director to watch Casino Royale over and over again until they ""get"" why that one was so good? I might even take Quantum of Solace over this one, at least the story was semi-interesting.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes I believe was the director's name. He should be accused of hijacking intelligent property of the new Batman trilogy and the Home Alone series... And there you have it, the new James Bond that is the alleged ""Best Bond Yet"".<br/><br/>What a joke."
"fahiminaam-527-858400","1","24","49","12 November 2012"," The worst Bond ever!!!
","Waited for this movie with great anticipation, but was clearly disappointed with how the movie, script and franchise turned out.<br/><br/>This movie may be numerically a box office success but leaves behind a 50 years legacy in shreds.<br/><br/>I am convinced that Mr. Brocolli would be turning in his grave! <br/><br/>For all these years we got entertained by the action, the women, the guns, the gadgets, the cars, the humor, the villains, the locations, the opening/closing credits and the theme songs. <br/><br/>This formula worked for them for 5 decades. Why change now??? <br/><br/>Spoiler Alert <br/><br/>Skyfall only deals with the action and the theme song and leaves all the other fun behind! <br/><br/>Daniel Craig in my opinion is the best Bond after Connery, and both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace story lines could have been further cultivated. <br/><br/>Instead, we got served a lemon instead of a caviar! <br/><br/>Spoiler Alert <br/><br/>Silva (Javier Bardem) is probably the worst Bond villain ever! The story line basically boils down to one element alone - Revenge on M! What a pity!!! If the cyanide capsule didn't work, Silva should have targeted the Q Branch instead.<br/><br/>Why develop the computer infrastructure when all you could do was to blow up the MI5 headquarters? <br/><br/>Why would Moneypenny be a field agent responsible for shooting our most favorite hero and ending up on a desk job? <br/><br/>Where were the gadgets? The only element we see is a small radio transmitter.<br/><br/>The list goes on and on.<br/><br/>I guess this Bond left me rather 'stirred than shaken' instead of ""shaken not stirred"".<br/><br/>The only redeeming factor in the movie are the last 5 minutes which is quite reminiscent of Dr. No opening sequence when Bond enters M's office."
"josecarlosamador","4","24","49","7 November 2012"," Harry Potter sequel: SKYFALL! (I'll try not to spoil much)
","I watched this movie yesterday. At the end of it I was in doubt whether I had bough the ticket to the right picture or not...<br/><br/>First, I'll divide the movie in 3 parts. I) The first 20 minutes of it were action-packed joy: a 007 dressed in suit with his good old pistol fighting the bad guy. By far the best part of the film. It ends up bad for Mr. Bond however, being presumed dead after it. (The trailer pretty much covers this).<br/><br/>II) OK, now the movie starts to decay. After all the opening guns- blazing Craig plays the role of a cliché-like type of hero of the last two decades American movies: he is depressed, he no longer shows that love he has, he drinks, he doesn't shave, he no longer has a picture of the queen in his wallet. What do I think of this? AWFUL! This is 007, for God's sake!<br/><br/>Oh well, something bad happens in the good old continent - MI-6 gets attacked- and Mr. Bond decides to go back to duty, but he's miserable. He no longer is that charming agent full of manhood and ready to take on the entire world for his country. No! Instead, he looks like an old beggar who got some tooth cleaning treatment and a haircut. Still, he is put back to action.<br/><br/>Here you see a MI-6 with the same organization and strength of a lemonade selling tent managed by a 6 year old school boy. Really?! This is James Bond, not a Die Hard or an alien invasion type of film. Where did you get this plot? <br/><br/>Also, in this second part, he meets Q. The good old rat-lab Q with a bazillion new gadgets and fancy items, right? No. First, I'd like to say I don't mean to misjudge someone by the age, but the new Q was really new. Oh well, the one we used to know pretty much ended up in 007 Casino Royale anyway. I swear in this moment I spike of hope stroke my heart: despite the childish look of him, that just can't be taken serious by the spectators, I was hoping for a come-back at the wide range of weapons, the bond watch, the bond belt, the bond car, the apparently-daily-objects-guns-and-explosives, but again (and the movie leaves it very clearly in the dialogs of the characters) pretty much nothing. Remember the classic briefing in the lab where we could see a bunch of useless high-tech weaponry being tested on MI-6 staff in the background while Bond just ignored all of Q's advices and instructions? No, it didn't come back. This that was pretty much like a mark of every 007 movie just disappeared in the last 3 films.<br/><br/>Anyway, lets carry on. Bond goes chasing trails to find the criminal villain and ends up killing one assassin on the way. Nice, nothing great, but good. (Spoilers incoming) In a scenes Bond passively watches the killer he's looking for murder a man to only after try to arrest/interrogate him. That was weird, at least! It's just not Bondish, it's not English-heroic, as a fan would expect.<br/><br/>Following that, he mets a beautiful girl which you would expect to play the main female role of the picture, right? No. She plays a very short role in the entire film. To me, this movie just had no bond girl at all.<br/><br/>He ends up catching the villain, and here is where this second part ends for me. Here, judging by the length of the movie, I believe most realized there would be some master plan where Silva (bad guy) would escape, but this ain't much of fault. <br/><br/>I was quite disappointed at it. In this part, they should have developed the classic aspects of James Bond, as in the ones played by Roger Moore, but missed pretty much all.<br/><br/>III) In the last part of the film, the bad guy escapes with the use of a very intelligent plan previously developed. And here is where all the Harry-Pottish aspect kicks in. I'll just name what made it look like a romantic teenager romance/tragedy type of movie: a) M has a name, b) Bond has parents, c) Bond has parents that died, d) Bond has parents that died and that matters to the film, f) Bond has parents that died and that matters so much to the film that their names are displayed. g) Bond has to fight for his and M's lives in an old house, making it look like a Home Alone scene where he has to improvise a bunch of homemade traps to not die. h) In here the title of the film is explained: is SKYFALL a secret weapon, or satellite, or space operation, or enemy operation base? No! Fans will probably cry in rage when they realize the explanation for it. i) (Spoiler Alert) M dies.<br/><br/>In general this last part is emerged in emotions, tears and nostalgia. Jesus Christ! This is not Twilight, this is 007!<br/><br/>So, finishing this analysis, I just have to point out some of the strong points: a) The villain, played by Javier Bardem is original, and well made to be honest. b) The plot developed by Silva (Javier) is good, not great, but good. c) Good action scenes at the beginning.<br/><br/>Bad points: a) Overreaction in sentimentalism. The creation of an unnecessary connection between bond, his parents, M, etc. b) No strong bond girl play. c) No High-tech gadgets in general. d) The best action scenes pretty much just happened in the first minutes of the movie, investing too much in a drama/romantic Shakespeare type of plot for the rest of it. <br/><br/>In general this was a terrible waste of my time. The classic aspects of the good old 007 movies are just lost, forever probably."
"lonshapiro","2","8","13","13 December 2015"," It was not the worst James Bond movie ever, but...
","There are three ways I evaluate movies: expectations, entertainment value, and the critical perspective. With the big event pictures, the media campaign is in such hype-drive that it is easy to be disappointed. If I rate Skyfall based on my expectations and as a long time fan, I would give it a 1. But it had a few entertaining scenes (very few), so from that perspective it probably should get a 4. The big problem is when a movie does something incredibly bad at the very beginning or the character does something that goes against everything we know about him. When a director breaks the audience's belief system, we are no longer film fans, we become film critics, picking on every plot hole, unrealistic stunts, and tech gimmicks that 20 years behind the time. Because of the 10-15 gaping holes in the movie, the movie critic part of me gave it a 1. So the average of the three parts is a 2.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The director destroyed the credibility of the movie within the first five minutes of the film. The entire mythos of MI6 and 00 training gets thrown away in order to jolt the audience with a contrived plot twist and to set the bad guy's plot into motion. The idea of a trained 00 agent not completing a task because they are emotionally distraught destroyed my suspension of reality.<br/><br/>Another 10 minutes in, James Bond stands by and allows a possibly innocent man get murdered. Again, it was a shocking twist, but it was so incredibly stupid, evil and out of character that my belief in James Bond's character was killed. There was nothing left to do but walk out, but I paid for my ticket and stayed tip the bitter end.<br/><br/>From here the film would try to pull itself up only to fall with the next contrived, clichéd, or expected moment. There was something for everyone to hate in this film.<br/><br/>For techies, there is a ridiculous hacking scene that was stupid it was like the screenwriter had been in a coma since 1988.<br/><br/>For acting aficionados, there is a creepy Bond-villain scene that goes from amateur psychoanalysis to a bizarre homo-eroticism and ends as some weird quasi-oedipal revelation.<br/><br/>For long-time fans, Bond doesn't find clues to unravel the mystery, so much as stumble from one potentially fatal mistake to the next. The combination of strength and quick thinking that Daniel Craig showed so well in Casino Royale is no where to be found this time out.<br/><br/>For casual fans, this is an okay movie, but without a doubt the worst of the Daniel Craig films.<br/><br/>For real Bond fans, if you can get through the first 15 minutes without throwing your remote control through the TV (I'm writing this so late, my hope is that no is in a position to buy a ticket for this bomb), maybe you'll be entertained. <br/><br/>The reason I decided to write a review at all is because I noticed that Skyfall had a 7.8 IMDb rating, and wanted to advise people to watch Transformers 4 instead - at least the characters are more realistic in that one."
"Paynebyname","4","8","13","27 July 2015"," Wildly over rated, hopelessly inept
","Skyfall might have made a shed load of money but it was laughably bad. The Bond films have got worse since Casino Royale, which was a good first attempt at updating them.<br/><br/>QoS was lame and Skyfall was just as bad, if not worse. So clichéd, so all over the place, so riddled with nonsense.<br/><br/>I'm constantly amazed that proclaimed fans of Bond could be so easily seduced by the emptiness of Skyfall.<br/><br/>Bond the character is great, but the producers aren't interested in making him awesome through the writing or character development but rather by repeatedly telling people that he's cool, placating individuals with some empty loud bangs, ticking fan expected boxes and watering down the brand by selling aftershave.<br/><br/>A great example of the films woeful writing and woeful scene setting would be the sex scene with the woman from the casino. She tells Bond that she was sold as a sex slave at 13, which generates sympathy in the audience, and we then cut to a perfunctory and utterly irrelevant sex scene.<br/><br/>Why talk about the characters background and then not grasp that the story that you tell might resonate with the audience, making them feel a little uncomfortable and uneasy about Bond exploiting her for a quick shag.<br/><br/>But, as I've said before, the makers are now so lazy that they just want to tick the relevant boxes and that ticked the 'sexy Bond girl' box.<br/><br/>Personally, I feel for Martin Campbell. They give him Brosnan and Craig as newbies and he bangs in some good first efforts for them to get the franchise rebooted and then they hand it over to a host of pretentious directors (Sam Mendes included) who haven't a clue how to direct action or craft engaging characters.<br/><br/>But I guess as long as they tick box A and box B, so that critics and others can blindly proclaim a film/character 'cool' and 'badass' for no discernible reason, then they might as well keep churning out the crap."

","Seeing it top the box office in its first week and hearing the great reviews on the movie by professionals and magazines, and the admiration at the newly designed, subtle yet powerfully alluring poster - I had high expectations for this third film - and yet I was kind of let down.<br/><br/>As the movie began I was engaged immediately as the Bond that we all know began his daring mission. I was engaged in action of the movie, astounded by the feats he enacted, and I was impressed and in awe at the style and the coolness (achieved in the past two movies also) which Bond portrayed in his daily activities - that being jumping onto trains, or being shot at or...whatever else that Bond gets up to.<br/><br/>However, after the first hour or so I felt that the typical Bond movie stereotype (espionage, the roles of the seductive lady counter part, the action scenes etc. etc.) were slowly becoming more infrequent. The espionage was still there - of course. But the Bond story could have taken many different turns to make it a much more audience engaging story line - like Silva, his evil part seemed to end rather quickly like the whole 5 names every week thing died quickly, you only got to glance at his high tech computers and glimpse at the power that they had. Another thing that I thought was rather strange for a Bond film was the lady. The seductive lady, which Bond is, of course, attracted to immediately (his fatal flaw) meets him in an instance then dies the next day... she comes and goes like the bullets that he fires out of his gun. Shouldn't the plot, likening to the past movies, kind of follow this fatal flaw of his which ultimate leads to her death (or departure) in the end...? Another little bit which I thought very 'un-Bond' like was the skyfall scene. It is not like Bond to reside in a house waiting for the enemies to come, setting out traps for easy switch on kill-streaks. No, he's supposed to be getting out there on hands and knees and punching the living daylights out of the bad guys.<br/><br/>I rated it a six due to its not fulfilling my expectations of that typical Bond movie. Is that what the director was trying to achieve? to be different from the rest - who knows, but it didn't tickle my fancy. The six stars I award to it goes for the great beginning scenes and the brilliant acting by all cast members - they pulled it off smoothly and effortlessly."

"bayou_hannibal","2","14","26","26 February 2013"," The dumbest Bond movie since the nadir of the Roger Moore years
","Up until now, I thought that Moonraker was the worst Bond movie ever made. Skyfall might be worse. It's bad. Really really bad. I realize that taste is purely a matter of opinion, but I am simply aghast at the great reviews that this stinking turd received. I can't fathom any reasonable explanation for this, other than that massive amounts of payola were involved. There is absolutely no way that somebody with a modicum of intelligence and movie-going experience could watch this movie and come away from it thinking that it is some kind of masterpiece. My forehead is still pink from all of the facepalming I had to do during this idiotic movie.<br/><br/>Where to begin, where to begin? Skyfall has a script so bad, that it might as well have been scribbled out on a napkin by a bunch of drunk college students. Plot holes abound, and major events go unexplained. I'm supposed to believe that a villain has an entire island to himself because he convinced some people that there was a chemical leak? Nobody above the age of six could possibly be stupid enough to swallow that. This is the kind of moronic garbage that makes the Star Wars prequels look ingenious, by comparison. Almost every significant event is ripped off from another movie from the past two decades, but put to disastrous effect here. Specifically, Skyfall completely rips off The Dark Knight repeatedly. Let's count the ways<br/><br/>1. The protagonist is a dark, brooding, psychologically disturbed hero. Bond has a drinking problem. Bond fails his psych evaluation because of unresolved childhood trauma. Yes, folks, he is Bruce Wayne now.<br/><br/>2. The villain is a homegrown terrorist with Godlike omniscience, who has the ability to predict exactly where somebody will be standing years in advance. <br/><br/>3. The villain plans his own capture as part of an ingenious scheme, which could not possibly be accomplished without the Godlike omniscience in point #1.<br/><br/>4. The villain and his henchmen kill a bunch of people by impersonating cops.<br/><br/>5. The villain has a soliloquy with the protagonist, where he tries to explain that the two of them are actually a lot alike. <br/><br/>6. Every single person in the movie besides the villain is a complete retard. The villain is the greatest terrorist in the history of the world, but he is guarded by only two guys before he escapes into a subway hatch. Then, he rushes to a government building with about as much security as a Burger King and kills about a dozen people before escaping cleanly.<br/><br/>7. The villain has unlimited resources and tons of henchmen. At the end of the movie, he tracks down Bond and M with his own private army, while Bond and M defend themselves with booby traps and old hunting rifles.<br/><br/>8. The villain also looks ridiculous. This worked in the Dark Knight, because he's The Joke. Javier Bardem, on the other hand, has the world's most ridiculous looking blond hair dye job, which provides lots of unintentional comedy.<br/><br/>There's also the undercover agent list being stolen (ripped off from Mission Impossible 1). Idiotic scene after idiotic scene. IMDb, unfortunately, does not allow me to write a review long enough to list everything that is wrong with this movie. Suffice it to say, it is easily one of the most overrated movies of all time. This, unfortunately, seems to be the dominant trend in movies nowadays. Make a ""gritty"", ""dark"", ""realistic"" movie with a brooding hero, and everyone praises it as a masterpiece, regardless of whether the script could have been written by a five year old. This movie gets two stars instead of 1 because it has one or two really good, well choreographed action scenes. Other than that, it is a complete catastrophe."
"sunfender","1","14","26","22 January 2013"," conspiracy theory
","I think all those reviewers who gave the movie a 10, and a WOW, were paid. This is getting ridiculous. Organizing paid reviewers is probably where the budget for plot-writing went. As pointed out by so many genuine reviewers, the movie plot contains so many holes that it has nothing to get the audience excited about. Right from the beginning, when Bond and the bad guy were on top of the train, and Bond climbed into the earth-mover, the bad guy just stood there shooting at the machine, when he could have gone inside the train and taken someone hostage or tried to escape by parachuting like other movie spies do. And what about the shot by the MI6 sniper at Bond, she only had one bullet? after shooting Bond all she could do was stare at the villain? the call made by M was of course totally idiotic. there was equal chance of Bond winning the fight and the bad guy getting shot. The emotional burden of shooting your own agent would surely tip the scale towards letting Bond fight it.<br/><br/>There were many more bad plots, like the whole thing in the casino. why the casino bouncers wanted to kill him, and why inside the casino when they try to run a business? these kinds of plots would of course be forgiven if there were other attractions, such as good special effects (none) or action sequence (not so great). I understand the plot with the exotic girl was just an excuse to put a shower scene in the movie, so I can overlook the otherwise lack of reason for that subplot, but the worst plot was the bad guy getting himself captured and jailed in MI6. The reason for doing so? so that he could shoot into a committee room in Westminister, when the scheduling of which would surely be a piece of cake for a genius like him to find out in advance. Oh, but he wanted to look her in the eyes in MI6 jail to tell her how much he hated her. My bad."

Here's a thumbnail. Bond has a little mishap, decides to take some time off (for no reason we're ever told) then later sees MI6 under attack and returns, but (for no reason we're ever told) unable to shoot straight or pass any test for suitability as an agent. Of course he's put straight back into the field and helps an international terrorist achieve his goal of killing M.

Bond dallying with gorgeous women? – nope, a couple of women have tiny parts, and JB doesn't lay a finger on either of them. Fun gadgets? – nope, apparently we've got rid of those too. A clever screenplay, based on a brilliantly witty Fleming novel? – nope, since we ran out of novels, we don't seem to bother much about the repartee any more. Great, or at least adequate, acting performances? – nope, Dan Craig used to be able to act (didn't he?) but recently just struts about trying to be Vin Diesel with face perpetually set into a hard-man grimace, Bardem is stupidly OTT at all times, and even the wonderful Dame Judi doesn't seem to care much any more – and with a plot and screenplay like this, who can blame her? All we're left with is a lot of running around, shooting and missing, and explosions. A gazillion cheap B-movies have all of this and plenty of them have better plots, acting and screenplays too.<br/><br/>Just to return to the stupidity – the movie's defining feature. With the bad guy in his sights, stranded on a ladder, why does Bond not shoot him, instead talking about nothing much until the guy dumps a tube-train on his head? Stupid. When the bad guy gives his gun to M, imploring her to kill them both with the same bullet, why doesn't she just shoot him? Stupid. When they escape via a secret passage to the middle of a midnight moor, why do they wave a flashlight around so the bad guy knows where they are? You guessed it – stupid. Why does the bad guy 'want to be captured' so he can escape and launch a terrorist attack, why not just launch the attack? Clichéed and stupid. And the acme of stupidity. A nasty terrorist wants to kill M. Oh dear, whatever shall we do? I know! – let's take her to a remote Scottish country house. Let's make sure no-one but the terrorist (along with his small army of thugs equipped with helicopters, explosives and high-tech weaponry) knows where she is. Let's defend her only with a washed up agent who can't shoot straight, and an old gamekeeper type, the two of them armed with nothing much at all. Then, when she's unsurprisingly killed, let's say well done to Mr B (whose moronic idea all this was) and line him up for further doubtless equally stupid sequels.<br/><br/>How stupid does this stuff have to get before people stop liking it? How much more stupid is it in fact possible to get? I appreciate that people do like movies of this type, especially if money's been spent to make them look glossy, as it has here, but if making some kind of sense is important to you, better avoid this."

","Just stop with the re-booted Bond. Does this guy ever smile? Why so serious Bond? Maybe if we tickle him? Does he ever say anything funny or clever anymore? <br/><br/>OK, some toys, plenty of action, etc. and it fulfills all of it's low ambitions. But Craig is wearing thin with this whole serious actor bit. I like Shakespeare a lot actually, but this is James Bond, so please just stop making it more ""sophisticated,"" ""better reflective of the times we are living in,"" and all that other miscellaneous claptrap. <br/><br/>Next up--Goth Bond starring Johnny Depp. (I probably shouldn't have made that last comment, since now I'm sure production will start in a few months.) <br/><br/>Lastly, did anybody count bullets in the beginning scene?

"son_of_cheese_messiah","4","6","9","15 January 2015"," ""I expect the franchise to die, Mr Bond!""
","As many have observed, there is something seriously wrong with modern criticism if this rather ordinary outing is hailed as a masterpiece. I've lost count of the amount of films given huge praise which turn out to be mediocre at best or often very awful.<br/><br/>It seems the critics now respond to empty spectacle and superficial gimmicks rather than tiresome things like characterisation or a plot that makes sense. So it is with Skyfall, a succession of action sequences with just enough story line to string them along. The opening action sequence, although not the equal of anything in Casino Royale, is the best. Then the film falls more sharply than Bond does from the train. And you can tell that the writers do not over trouble themselves with such things as making sense, since they make not even a cursory attempt to explain Bond's miraculous survival.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem, who was so mesmerisingly menacing in No Country for Old Men, is here merely unintentionally funny. Sporting an awful blond wig and giving a high camp performance, he channels John Inman so much that you almost expect him to say ""I'm free!"" Not exactly a frightening villain, then, but worse, his gay overtures towards Bond are immediately forgotten, a sure sign of a bad script.<br/><br/>A convoluted and unbelievable plot, most of which is lifted from other better sources, and with numerous plot holes, fails to convince. And the bombastic special effects, including Bond dodging a careening underground train (curiously empty for daytime and apparently driverless- the unions should have words) and an assault on Bond's childhood home (a sort of overblown version of Home Alone, by way of Death Wish 3), although designed to distract us from the weak story are not good enough to impress for more than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing aspects is Bond's sheer incompetence. He stands by and watches an assassin execute his target before intervening (why? Is this new Home Office guidelines?), he fails to save his latest Bond girl even though he knows re-enforcements are only seconds away (her death is merely because the film has no more use for her- and his quip after her unsavoury demise ""a waste of good scotch"" is very poor taste), he even fails to save M at the end, thus rendering the whole film rather pointless. No doubt these unnecessary deaths are inserted for 'gritty realism'.<br/><br/>The ending, set in a Scottish chapel, is very weak indeed, with M's death, (succumbing to a bullet from an anonymous lackey earlier) in particular, being anti-climactic. I sincerely wish that M had pulled the trigger on the double suicide that Bardem suddenly wanted (why? he showed no such suicidal tendencies before) only with the proviso that Bond's head was in Bardem's place. That might put this tired franchise (and us) out of its misery."
"bukksfizz","1","7","11","3 March 2015"," A terrible film, I wondered when it would end, and wished it would be soon
","Unlike other reviewers, I found nothing to recommend this movie at all. The plot was poor, and dialogue, such as it was, was hopeless, the acting stilted and suspense non-existent. You can usually tell within a minute or two of whether a film will be worth watching, and this one was firmly in the No basket. So what did we get? It started with a whole lot of routine chase stuff, culminating in Bond falling apparently dead into a river, where we're treated to some gee-whizz underwater shots of his ""drowning"". Next second, he's walking smartly down the corridors of power, fresh as a daisy. How did this happen? Was it ""with a bound he was free"" the classic text so beloved of scriptwriters who've boxed their star into a corner? It didn't get any better. I kept looking at my watch, hoping it would end soon. The early bond movies had style. This one was a waste of space. I've awarded it a 1/10, but would happily give it no marks at all."

","After the first 2 DC outings as Bond, I was looking forward to this one. However as the the film progressed, I started to get a sinking feeling. This was 100% confirmed during the scenes leading up to and including M's demise.<br/><br/>The action sequences, great. The casting, great. The theme song, great. The story / script, did someone forget it.<br/><br/>Like most people, I've seen all the films, most at the cinema. Like most, we all forgive the implausibility of some scenes (action), because overall everything else makes up for them. Like most, we leave the cinema with a feeling that we have enjoyed what we spent our dosh on. But this time I left feeling let down, something was not right, something was missing, and in this case it was a story. Even Moonraker had that."

","When I decided to watch this movie, I thought this is gonna be a great movie because it has such a high rating here on IMDb. But I forgot that IMDb ratings are always wrong.. I'm not sure is it fanboys who always vote 10's and it doesn't matter how shitty the movie is or is it directors who pay IMDb for high ratings on their movies? <br/><br/>Anyways, I thought this movie is going to be realistic, boy I was wrong! Even Ironman is more realistic than this. And if someone asked me who is more realistic: Hulk or Daniel Craig-James Bond, I would say Hulk..<br/><br/>First of all Bond is immortal. Just look at the beginning of the movie. Did he notice the bullet in his chest? I think he didn't, he doesn't feel pain! It doesn't matter what happens, he just won't die.<br/><br/>Secondly the laws of physics do not exist in this movie. It reminds me of Japanese 1970's movies, where everything is possible.<br/><br/>Thirdly, did you see the computers? There's giant screens everywhere and MI6 has amazing future technologies which can access anything, anywhere, anytime and the computer needs only 2 seconds to show what you want (I guess it can read your mind)..<br/><br/>Okay, and the worst thing in this movie is the plot! Huge number of logical mistakes. For example: 1) Bond 'kidnaps' his boss, 2) brings her to his old home. 3) She dies 4) He's a hero ---- Lol wtf? He has to be in jail for: 1) Not listening to orders 2) Kidnapping 3) A person died because of his fault 4) Massive murders 5) Illegal property destruction 6) a risk of destroying the whole forest by fire etc. etc.<br/><br/>Yes, it has interesting plot twists, but the plot as a whole is really bad... <br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend watching this movie."
"simcoles-1","1","23","47","2 December 2012"," Top 10 Reasons Skyfall is Crap (CONTAINS SPOILERS!)
","Top 10 reasons Skyfail is crap: <br/><br/>Please note this review contains spoilers! <br/><br/>10. Dialogue. The dialogue in Skyfall is totally asinine, even by Bond standards. The one liners fell FLAT. <br/><br/>9. Emo Q.<br/><br/>8. Bond Wayne. I realize it was always implied that Bond was an orphan, but they've turned him into Bruce Wayne, complete with family estate and butler.<br/><br/>7. Javier Bardem. He just got on my nerves. Silva is one of the worst villains in Bond history. He's gayer than Mr. Wint or Mr. Kidd. He's more outlandish in appearance than Blofeld. He was a cartoon character with his white hair and bleached eyebrows and disfigured jaw. <br/><br/>6. Bond is only 45 or so (well, Craig is about that age but Casino Royale implied he was in his mid 30's) but he is depicted as an almost- cripple? Despite still being ripped like a cage fighter? I could accept this idea if Bond were 57 or 60... <br/><br/>5. No gunbarrell. Skyfall as far as I'm concerned is not an official Bond movie because it has no gunbarrell at all. And yet at the end of Skyfall they show the Bond 50 gunbarrel logo. This is such bullshit. You use the most iconic image from Bond as a logo but that image is nowhere to be seen in the film? If it has no gunbarrell it's not a real Bond movie.<br/><br/>4. The ""Bond is old and decrepit, both as a man and as a franchise"" premise of the film. <br/><br/>3. where's the cyberterrorism?. In the end it didn't matter where the battle took place, except that, you know, maybe if they took M to... say a secure bunker, surrounded by armed soldiers... she would have survived? You can cut your internet access to avoid being targeted by cyberterrorists. Not that cyberterrorists are capable of causing direct physical harm to anyone. Then again, who knew gas pipes had valves on them that were connected to the internet? <br/><br/>2. The game keeper. Why is this character even in this film, except to say, ""Welcome to Scotland!"" ? Why would he voluntarily stay to help Bond fight off a hit squad of dangerous mercenaries armed with automatic weapons and a helicopter gunship?<br/><br/>1. Stupidity shown by characters. Bond, takes M to the wilderness without any protection, to a place without guns, medical facilities or communications, while *deliberately* leading the terrorists to her and not requesting any backup. <br/><br/>M was stupid for not ordering Bond to take her to some army base or bunker to be secure while, you know, the police or the military dealt with Silva. <br/><br/>Q was stupid too, for plugging the computer they retrieved from Silva's island, directly into MI6's own network, when he knew it belonged to the world's most dangerous cyber terrorist? And was so shocked when said computer opened all the doors in the bunker, including that of Silva's glass cell? Nobody uses BARS and doors with KEYS anymore? The whole point of moving MI6 to an old WWII bunker was to isolate it from hack- able technology that Silva could gain access to. And they put the holding cell within easy access of an underground tunnel leading into the subway?! Yes, whoever designed this prison was sure on the ball.... If they had taken him down to the local police station and put him in a locked cell (you know the kind that has a key) then the movie would have been a lot shorter. <br/><br/>So anyway, Silva escapes, and they find out he's going after M at the courthouse, so they duly warn her to get out. But she doesn't leave. She's at a hearing answering to the charge that she has been irresponsible and incompetent, and doesn't take steps to ensure her own safety, or the safety of those present at the court? Yes, that is a VERY good way of demonstrating your ability to defend the public from terrorists. Furthermore, why didn't they alert the security at the court when they knew an armed, dangerous criminal was on his way there to kill M?<br/><br/>Bonus round: So, Bond was shot in the shoulder while fighting the baddie. But then he is accidentally shot by Eve and falls from the train. Yet later on he has only one bullet wound, the one in his shoulder. What happened to the shot from the high powered sniper rifle?! Did Bond seek medical attention for that shot but ignored the shrapnel in his shoulder? What kind of idiots does Sam Mendes take us for?<br/><br/>I can accept plot silliness or lapses in logic in a Bond film where Bond fights the bad guy inside his hollowed-out volcano with a bikini-clad girl at his side. Because that's just pure escapist entertainment so it works. Appalling plot holes in a movie that takes itself as seriously as Skyfall however do NOT work. This Bond film has poetry by Tennyson in it... but also has a *stupid* plot, full of *retarded* characters who make stupid decisions at every turn. It just doesn't work!"

The baddie reminded me of Bobbie Davro doing Brian Tilsley, priceless. The 'plot' is just half baked, why didn't Bond have a fag instead of blocking the shot to Patrice on the train? Why didn't he give his pals a bell before he departed for Scotland or even picked up an Uzi? How come the baddies intricate plot that brought military intelligence to its knees culminated in him wading in guns blazing? I also didn't realise cyanide is a major cause of tooth decay!

And as a woman, I would not want to bed a man, who is also attracted to men.<br/><br/>People who say ""Bond is back"" obviously disregard everything that defines Bond. He isn't back.

And I won't go on about the wooden acting (Moneypenny and Q) and stuntmen showing or the continuity errors and terrible sets.<br/><br/>What bugs me is that this Bond isn't an escapism movie anymore and this Bond isn't a spy, a secret agent. Most people have missed this difference and though some say this is Fleming's Bond I think those people cannot have read his little books at all. Skyfall's Bond is totally unrecognisable as Bond. By that I do not mean that he should have an exploding toupee and cloaking device, but he should be a spy and there should be intrigue, suspense and intelligence.<br/><br/>This cretinous Bond is boring, the plot is boring even with the M love mummy complexes added, all this stuff is very unBond and very boring.

"Majuro","5","25","52","12 November 2012"," A Bond Film Minus One Thing: Bond
","***********Spoilers************* <br/><br/>At the end of the film, we see Silva and M locked in a terminal embrace, and we hear the villain's ultimate desire: for them both to die together. But of course, JAMES BOND won't let that happen! And so he kills Silva.<br/><br/>But, alas, they both die anyway. <br/><br/>Skip to the beginning -- James won't let the tired old clichÃ© of an agent list fall into enemy hands.<br/><br/>But, alas, it does. <br/><br/>Skip to the middle -- James won't let the long-suffering (and quite stunning) Bond Girl die.<br/><br/>But, alas, she does.<br/><br/>So when did Bond get so impotent? And irrelevant?<br/><br/>This film is a noisy, action-packed piece of flash, which would be enjoyable as a stylish escapism and on a par with every good Bond film except it's hard to get past the realization that our hero has no substance, and does absolutely nothing to affect the outcome. Bond might just as well have taken a golf holiday, and the plot would've arrived at mostly the same result.<br/><br/>The Irrelevant Hero is what I call the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" syndrome. In ""Raiders"", Indiana Jones fails in retrieving the golden idol, then runs around searching for the Ark, chases Nazis, shoots Nazis, chases the Ark, but ultimately fails to steal the Ark. If he'd not even shown up, if he'd taken that week off, the Nazis would've found the Ark, opened it up, been killed anyway, end of story. Does it ruin a film? Not if there's enough flash to outdo the substance, but it'll never make it a great film.<br/><br/>And such is the case here.<br/><br/>Where's the hero Bond that protects the world, saves Fort Knox, eliminates Le Chiffre? Or even seduces the girl? (I don't consider stepping in the shower with her a proper seduction, more like an obligation) It's like the filmmakers are tired of their own formula. I like Daniel Craig, I think he's a good Bond, but the character development towards a ""New Bond"" has created a character that's kind of a screw-up, and at times an unpleasant one. A scraggly bearded alcoholic is not Bond. During the scorpion scene, I was reminded of the psychotically tortured Christopher Walken in ""The Deer Hunter."" Not exactly the self-assured hero we've come to love. I mean this Bond has no RIGHT to step in that shower with the girl, except that he could use the bath. <br/><br/>I understand those of you who say it's a necessary update. But to go so far away from Fleming's conception is just change for change's sake. I mean, why stop there -- why not make him a vampire then? Do we really have to turn him into Jason Bourne? Does he have to have a conscience, or even be thoughtful? A thoughtful hero and a mindless entertainment don't mix. I just want to have fun seeing him best the baddies, not share his pain. <br/><br/>So I missed James Bond in this film. Even the Bond from ""Casino Royale"" would've done fine. And there's just way too many ridiculous plot devices to overcome without that sort of Bond. True, by the end of the film, Bond does get into ""Bond mode"" a bit more, though only through a gimmicky plot contrivance that puts him at a huge manpower disadvantage. By then, I was mostly chuckling at the silliness of it all. (My favorite bit of silliness: Silva's amazing prescience that Q will try to hack (by quite stupidly connecting it to the entire MI6 mainframe mind you) Silva's program at the precise moment that M will be at Westminster defending her organization, which Silva has somehow been able to also foresee and plan for, right down to Bond chasing him to the one particular spot (and then stopping) where Silva can blow a hole in the roof and send in a subway train, timing the train's arrival to a precise moment as well. (I mean - COME ON!) The new, likable Q even says that the new MI6 is not about gimmicks and silly devices, too bad the screenwriters didn't eliminate them from their plot.<br/><br/>Please, bring back James Bond!"

","I can't even start and state how disappointed i was after watching the movie for the 2nd time (1st in the cinema, 2nd time on DVD). After watching it for the 1st time i left un-pleased and un comfortable from the outcome but now after watching it for the 2nd time, i and i have to say that everyone i know (family, friends) are saying that this might be the worse Bond movie ever (by the way many reviews here concur with what i have written and added much more). If these are the type of movies Mrs Broccoli is planning to make, maybe she should take out Bond for A retirement as Bond has nothing and i mean it nothing to sell, nothing to show for. The latest movie is just not reliable in any sense, the opening scene was so silly, Bond enters an apartment and sees a wounded agent, he looks for the bad guys that shot the agent and once he exists the building (in Istanbul) he is picked up by ""agent Eve"" and somehow the car of the bad guys is driving in front of them! They did not have to search for it, nor did they miss a step when agent Eve picked up Bond, and let me say that the scene just gets worse and even more unreliable as agent Eve shoots Bond, he hears her that she is going to shoot and he is in the way, he can Easily move out of the way (simply duck, or jump aside) but he continues fighting the bad guy just to get shot! This are just a couple of examples, the entire movie is full with holes, the bad guy is portrayed as a resourceful guy and at the same time as a complete idiot who makes all the wrong choices. The movie is suppose to be an adventure thriller (as the Bond tradition), but it is more like a drama. Even the scene that ends the movie is idiotic, Bond takes ""M"" and goes to Scotland to the mansion where Bond grew up, while they all know that the bad guy who has countless resources will follow them (they even leave clues for him to come to them), now with an old guy that is looking after the mansion and ""M"", Bond is suppose to fight an ""army"" (an un creative army just as the production-direction-script of the movie, complete armatures). If this ending scene would have had happened in some deserted spot on the planet it just might had been kind of acceptable but it is Scotland! Why can't Bond/M/The old guy pick up A cel phone and call for the ""Cavalry""?? Actually the folks at headquarter at ""M's"" office know where she is, so why not send back up? Bond is portrayed for the 3rd movie now like someone with no brains, but someone that counts on his muscles. Maybe these are the capabilities of Craig? If so i think the time has come to let him go and if they cannot re-create a decent Bond movie they should just stop milking this cow and stop torturing the public with these awful movies and send Bond to retirement, we the audience deserve better and I take comfort in the fact that we will always have the memories of Connery and Moore."

"metal_devil_2003","3","22","45","9 November 2012"," A very disappointing movie
","Let me start with the fact that I don't find this movie so bad because it's different from other Bond movies - it's just a bad movie. The main character could be anyone else and the movie would still be an example of how a bad script can ruin even the most ambitious project. Skyfall is flawed on so many levels it's unbelievable that someone thought this script is anything else but a pile of junk. <br/><br/>**SPOILERS"" The plot just lacks clear idea and goal. It starts off good with a nice over-the-top action sequence and the missing list of undercover agents and goes straight into the gutter. There are just too much plot holes and bad dialogues. We have the super ""scary"" villain Silva with MI6 training and astonishing hacking skills, who is said to always get what he wants but he lives on a deserted island filled with junk and ruins and he has a couple of computers on two tables and 3 guards to keep him entertained while his sex slave is away drinking in a casino with his other 3 guards. Come on... you can't be serious! We have M , who has no field experience, makes a lot of bad decisions and clearly she feels she's not responsible for any of her mistakes and the ""Shadows"" are to blame. You just want her to die already. Actually, she should have died right away but at least the writers made the right choice in the end. Q is a stupid teenager who invented the security system that Javier Bardem used to hack MI6 with ease because apparently Q has no idea of its flaws. And also, if he is not going to make cool toys for Bond then he's just a geek with a computer and nothing more - he's not Q. Mallory is a good character with potential and will be a way better M. He knows what is like to be under fire or captured and tortured and will probably take a lot better decision. MP also has potential. Yeah, her character in Skyfall is different but in the next movies she can make witty remarks about Bond's missions rather than just casually flirt. I hope their characters will be developed more in the next Bond movies. Bond looks tired, lacks his usual witty humor and all of his one- liners are chilched and appear to have been written by a 10-year old kid. He doesn't care about the girl, he doesn't care for his life. He's not saving the world, his initial return from the dead was because he though Great Britain was under terrorist attack but that turned into babysitting M. He had a good life away from MI6 and he was free. The entire plot of Bond protecting on his own the woman who betrayed him while she could have been surrounded by MI6 agents is plain stupid. Well, that's it for the characters. As far as the story - it just sucks. The plot with the undercover agents and the list never develops. The bad guy had potential but they made him look a little bit insane and completely clueless of exactly what he wants to do aside from making M feel miserable. And his plan to kill her was just hilarious and wasn't worthy of his advertised level of intelligence. The creators of the movie thought that if the script is heavily based on the ""shadows"" and the ""rats"" metaphors then Skyfall will be gritty and dark but it isn't. Going back to Skyfall does nothing for the plot and the character development making the title of the movie completely irrelevant. It's not truly Bond's home. Bond and Silva aren't brothers with M as their mother. They are just two agents, who were betrayed because their lives mean nothing to M and a couple of shots when M looks concerned aren't enough to prove any attachment she might have. <br/><br/>To summarize - we have a villain, who has been plotting his revenge for years but his final plan is hilarious. All the conversations are plain and stupid despite the creators trying to make it seem like Skyfall has deep meaning and is dark and gritty. Overusing the metaphor of the rats doesn't make the movie anything like the Dark Knight. Bond is miles away from his charming, witty and heroic self. There is no plan for world domination, there is no Bond girl to save - Bond is just babysitting M and he's doing a bad job.<br/><br/>I think 3 stars is a fair score as I liked the opening credits."

","I went with an open mind. I went with the idea that if it was at least as good as Casino Royale I would be happy.

The film, in my humble opinion is overly long, without a decent script, humour (up until the DB5) and a great ""baddy"" wasted. <br/><br/>Why can they not get it right. They did for Royale but this movie was only marginally better than Quantumn? <br/><br/>I had a novel end for the movie which when I mentioned to friends thought was better than the final draft.<br/><br/>Sorry, I have all the Bond films upto Royale.

","Once again, the specter of unmitigated HYPE rears it's ugly head. And once again, I fell prey to the liberal use of it, wasting my hard earned money to watch his aging dinosaur on IMAX, and to describe this film as a colossal waste of time is just as gross an understatement. Just as ""Casino Royale"" brought new blood and new excitement to the 50-year old franchise with the addition of the superb Daniel Craig (in this reporter's opinion, the best James Bond ever, superior to even my original favorite, Sean Connery), this turkey was more effective than a bottle of sleeping pills, at least for me. The only thing I enjoyed was listening to Adele sing the theme song. But after her stirring rendition, everything quickly went south. Frankly, the same old 007 tricks simply fail to work anymore... even the solemn reading of, ""Bond... James Bond,"" falls as flat as the proverbial pancake in this overpriced dud. Just how many times can we watch Fight To The Death opening scenes, casino scenes with a martini, shaken, not stirred, an ex-Soviet bloc Bond woman with a highly conflicted background, and a di riguer car chase scene before we holler, ""Uncle!""?? And that Tyrolean haunted house matte painting that doubles as Bond's ancestral mansion, looked as phony and contrived as the family manse in ""Batman"" (with the exception that 'Batman' was never intended to be anything more than a cartoon). Now I'm going to reveal the ending, so anyone who hasn't seen this loud, action-filled dinosaur, you can stop reading now... whenever just a shot of the old Bond automobile, the iconic Aston Martin DB5, receives more applause than the actors, you know you're in for a long sit (hopefully, you're in a comfy recliner seat). And when the only thing that even keeps your leaden eyelids open is watching the superb Judi Dench getting whacked (sorry Ralph Fiennes, as great an actor as you are, you'll never replace her) , and even the incredible Javier Bardem can't quite live up to his terrifying turn as the psychotic hit man in ""No Country For Old Men,"" you know that this expensive piece of eye candy has simply ran out of gas. While attempting to mix this new film with a bit of the old, the innumerable homages to the original Bond films makes us only long for the freshness of the original. But unfortunately, I just can't see this franchise, like the Super Bowl, go on forever. While 'Casino Royale' gave us a rousing, full blooded vision of what a retooled Bond film could be, this third installation turned out to be a classic, full bore... bore."
"richy1024","9","16","31","23 December 2012"," A skin tight suit will never stop this 007 from killing with his bare hands. The nation's favourite sign is reborn.
","From a parachute assignment with her majesty the Queen over Danny Boyle's inspiring set at the opening ceremony of London 2012 to the misty depth's of the Scottish highlands, Mr Bond faces his most injurious test by having to decide between the two most significant women in his life, thus providing us with a glimpse of who the true Bond girl is.<br/><br/>The consensus of Skyfall's Bond has seen 007's maturities establish with a distinctive rawness. We now have a rigid skinned agent whose experiences have seen sorrow and anguish in his past but seen a persona who has benefited from the audience's acceptance of the solemn tenor and less extravagant gadget themes throughout the franchise's fifty year stint. Daniel Craig has provided a new dimension to Bond, predominantly fitting within the criteria of the modern shift of seriousness within film. His wonderful talents pursue the conventional raw emotions that Bond feels in this outing. He crucially understands the material from 007's past and motions of the present determine the character's motivation. The 23rd instalment brings the modern Bond to his most atmospheric challenge yet. Skyfall sees Craig embark on one of icon's most testing missions. His loyalty to M (Judi Dench) is placed under detrimental restraint. Not only does he have to scuffle with a silky but uncomfortable nemesis in former MI6 employee Silva (Javier Bardem), Craig is set the challenge of performing even more charismatically on the eve of Bond's fiftieth anniversary, turning a domestic threat into a personal one.<br/><br/>This episode breathes an air of familiarity as we are invited into the notion of a qualified agent, suffering from an ageing atonement with an element of vulnerability and victimisation but his wise and highly articulate prowess in his field play dividend, sticking to his prehistoric loyalty to MI6. The mortal human factor is a blessing to see and but Craig's posture on screen counters this with beautiful arrogance and the mental determination of Bond. A titanic sum of thought has gone into this outing. The franchise seemed to be in a perilous state and needed to be reborn.<br/><br/>We are led to believe the perilous trip that Bond has journeyed since the days of Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan has led to this very moment. We develop a perceptive of Bond's continuation away from subsistence of spy life, learning of his life without parents and being invited into his personal routes before M's motherhood role took shape. This series seems to build relationships between each of the films since Casino Royale. On screen growth between Craig and Dench would propose a step-parent affiliation. Certain tags are given through the dialogue and symbolism in character gesture and movement. Besides M, Craig develops a healthy relationship with the very woman who places a rifle bullet through his canvas which rather convincingly reminds us of the characteristics between Bond and Miss Moneypenny.<br/><br/>Beyond the tone of severity we are taken on a voyage to relive some wonderful tones and mimics that remind us of the majestic overtones over the last fifty years, particularly in the Brosnan era. Preambles such as an academic censored handgun are imputed whilst annotations on exploding ballpoints are snorted at, in particular by the striking, and resourceful Q (Ben Whishaw). The selection of artiste for Q is rather smart, using a moderately nameless and inexpert big screen actor to play an archaic character, following the footsteps of John Cleese, Whishaw adds much sophistication to the role.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes' first attempt at a Bond is undeniably an endeavour he can be proud of. He has deliberated the story with a glorious attitude and tendency, blessing us with some gripping contrasts in China to elevate the superiority in design and technology, and then stripping back the intensity with raw sentiments across the landscape views throughout the Scottish highlands and the country's vast dissimilarities in culture from London. The sombre graphic of the narrative offers complexity and heavy watching is sometimes required but this is not too punishing on its audience after Mendes hurls Bond into a moving train cart and then allows him to briefly pause to adjust his shirt cuff, a gesture that relieves impetus in the scene without entirely concluding the anxiety. Aside from the rich style and glamour of China and London, 007 gets gritty in the swarming markets of Turkey, a replicate of his past lethally reminding us of From Russia With Love. Globe hiking has forever been as crucial to the franchise as the harmonious gadgets, with an elegant ray of the map across all of its geographical coordinates, sizable body counts, sports cars and crafty arsenal are expected within the genre, there have been a few blunders down the years and a couple of forgotten suit bearers. Mendes and Craig work magnificently in creating the epic that Bond enthusiasts have been longing for."

","So Skyfall has gone back to basics, done away with most of the cheese that usually accompanies a JB film. Also gone are the girls and gadgets. So what's left? Not a lot in my opinion.<br/><br/>Yes it's better than the truly dire QoS and has more of a solid feel than the most of it's predecessors but this film instantly forgettable in every way and I have absolutely no inclination to watch it ever again, whereas at least I'd happily watch anything up to and including Goldeneye again. It might be a 'better' film but it doesn't make it more watchable. I very much doubt it will stand the test of time. Put it this way, Xmas day 2013, if Live & Let Die was on one channel and Skyfall was on another, I'd be enjoying my turkey with Roger Moore.<br/><br/>OK, so let's forget it's 007 and not compare it to JB of old. As a stand alone film, it doesn't offer anything other than an slightly better than average action flick. I'm not even a 'Bourne' fan but even this doesn't hold a candle to the Bourne films. Oh, and Sam Mendes wasn't kidding when he said he was heavily influenced by The Dark Knight. The influences are clear to see but not in anything nearly as stylish or clever of TDK. <br/><br/>I really wanted to like this. I was a huge fan of the franchise when I was growing up and upon reading the positive reviews, I had high hopes even despite not being a big fan of Daniel Craig as 007. However, DC was one of the only things I appreciated in this film. The other was the cinematography. However, so many films have great cinematography these days that's it's starting to be the norm. <br/><br/>Massively disappointed and instantly forgettable are the best ways to sum up this very average Bond outing."

","The best I can say after watching this movie is that bond must die. Cubby Brolloli must be spinning in his grave. This has to be the worse Bond movie I have ever seen seen since ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" with Mr one hit wonder George Lazenby. A thin crust pizza style plot. Threads that go nowhere. Mediocre Bond women. No gadgets to speak of, (Desmond Llewelyn must be spinning in his grave). No one line quips after dispatching a Bond baddie. This franchise is going down faster than Blofeld's Ocean Lair in ""Diamonds are Forever"" which was Sean Connery's worse Bond movie ever since he had already said he was retired from Bond but came back after George Lazenby quit after his awful performance. Qos showed a great performance by Daniel Craig and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but in this movie Bond and M (played by Dame Judi Dench)seem as if they should be wrapped up by the fire sipping on Geritol cocktails and rubbing Ben gay on each other. It portrays Bond as a washed up substance abuser. He doesn't smoke in this movie (another Bond trait).The villain in the movie doesn't carry the over sinister look we all know and love and further more does not act the part. It's been 50 years now with mostly great plot lines. Please leave the franchise as people would like to remember it as part of Cubby's legacy, get back to the magic that makes Bond the way he is,or quit making Bond movies altogether."

Oh this movie's bad....where do I start? Well after a few reboots already cementing Craig as a good Bond in most people's eyes, then why oh why reboot again?! Just when we had got used to something of a format EON and this director decide to change everything yet again and this time for the worse. Someone said 'a reboot too many' and I would agree totally with that.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but maybe listing the good (what little there is) and bad might be easier on the eye! The Good: Berenice Marlohe - stunning, amazing acting in the club scene.<br/><br/>Opening chase scene initially, then too long couldn't hold suspense.<br/><br/>Rory Kinnear - always believable, a real asset.<br/><br/>Fiennes, although even his acting is shaky in parts.<br/><br/>Some good fight scenes like the lift one, though very choreographed.<br/><br/>Craig did his best.<br/><br/>M's death handles quite well.<br/><br/>The Bad: Appalling sets - especially Skyfall Lodge.<br/><br/>Terrible acting - especially Moneypenny and Q.<br/><br/>Awful plot - no plot really, done better in Swordfish and many others.<br/><br/>Stealing way too much from The Dark Knight - talk of 'the shadows', standing on rooftops etc etc.<br/><br/>Q character totally miscast and unbelievable specs.<br/><br/>Bond's Norman Wisdom suits and stance! Bond's running style - android punching the air! Bardem underused with stupid hair colour.<br/><br/>Daft homage to Kelly's Heros with the helicopter at Skyfall playing music. and helicopter way out of scale to the model house Stuntmen clearly visible many times - Craig admits to not doing stunts and boy it shows.<br/><br/>Continuity errors in abundance.<br/><br/>'M' mummy love triangle didn't work for me - very un-Bond Complete lack of glamour (apart from the lovely Berenice).<br/><br/>Complete lack of escapism - now this cannot be Bond.<br/><br/>Very very small cast - lots of money saved there EON? This cost much less to make than QoS and it shows.<br/><br/>Lack of intelligence required, and an insult to the viewing public who have wasted hard earnt time and money.<br/><br/>Catalogue of inhouse reviews and fanboy critics talking this movie up in the UK's year of celebration. Yet no amount of talking up can make a poor movie good.<br/><br/>As a standalone film I would give this a 4/10 but as a Bond film and because of the cruel hype I have to give it a 1/10 and that is for Berenice and Rory alone Still, at least we had Homeland to watch when we go home!"

"danhart2003","5","21","43","9 November 2012"," Over-hyped and overrated
","Horribly disappointing, especially after all the hype. It started well, but the second half was just awful... weak, uninteresting and unambitious plot. The antagonist 'wins' in the end, but his goal was so inconsequential that it doesn't even matter, nothing much is changed. His grand plan, his endgame... was to kill M. ONE person, that's all. He succeeds, and life goes on without any major repercussions. There were also some huge plot holes, with plans from both Bond and Silva not making much sense, and a huge loose end that was the focus of the first half of the movie left untied.<br/><br/>I suppose Skyfall was good for what it was, but sadly what it was was a mere side story focusing more on M than Bond, who is simply along for the ride for the most part. The scale I was expecting, that the title Skyfall suggests, that you might expect after the last two films, just isn't there. It's well-made, with some great cinematography, music and performances, but the story just let the whole thing down completely.<br/><br/>It felt like a re-reboot in a way, as if the series is moving away from the new timeline established in Casino Royale. In that film, Bond was a young agent who had only just gained '00 agent' status... here, he is portrayed as much older and wearier, suggesting a long time has passed since the events of Casino Royale and Quantum Of Solace. There doesn't appear to be anything to connect Skyfall with the first two films of new continuity, instead it opts for the self-contained and disjointed style of the old timeline. The introductions of Q and Moneypenny, as well as the multiple allusions to the older films, gave a feeling that the series may be headed back towards the classic Bond style, perhaps having been scared away from pushing on with the new era by the failure of Quantum Of Solace, which is a huge disappointment given what this could have been.<br/><br/>Overall, Skyfall is perhaps slightly better than Quantum Of Solace, but absolutely terrible in comparison to the wildly superior Casino Royale."

Despite his 'womanizing' he would certainly not make some glib joke about a drink, if his lover had just had her head blown off in front of him. This was a sick and totally un-Bondlike piece of misogynistic script writing that undermines the true literary character of 007, who would not have cared to much about the bad guy's intent to dominate the world, or kill 'M'in this case (what a weak plot)but rather his whole being would be set on avenging the girl - read the books! This could have been any 'thriller', with any 'hero' beating the bad guys - it is not a James Bond story. The good things about it? Well thank goodness JD has turned up her toes as 'M'(we all love you JD...but not as 'M'); but Ralph Fiennes as the new 'M'? Inspired!!! RF, I suspect, has read the Bond books as his portrayal came over in the movie as a 'Fleming' character. He's an excellent choice. Daniel Craig? No, sorry. Sauve, debonair, public schoolboy, Royal Naval officer...? Move on please Dan. You're a great actor...at other things. Oh, and product placement?

There are far better films out there these days so that the song 'Nobody Does It Better' from a previous Bond film now seems to have been superseded.

We meet the new Q in the National Gallery in front of a Turner and the script is still full of humour, we travel to Shanghai and Macau and it is still sexy and suspenseful. We meet the annoying villain played by Javier Bardem and it almost works... yet, when the action comes back to London and later Scotland, it starts to fall apart. The screenplay becomes uninspired and easy and the Skyfall, Scotland buildup and resolution are utterly awful. Barricade, bombs, gunshot and fire in the field yields nothing interesting (save a few nice shots from Deakins) and the Bond backstory is not explored to any usefulness. Javier Bardem cannot do anything with the revengeful plotter who becomes one-dimensional and the sagging story with no plot.<br/><br/>I enjoyed every Sam Mendes movie, but here you see the difference in writing quality and consistency. This is no Alan Ball!

They brought my enthusiasm to a screeching halt with this one. <br/><br/>To put it briefly, this latest Bondscapade felt like a horribly senseless run-on sentence penned in a group effort by Mrs. Applebotttom's kindergarten class during a fun, fun creative writing activity. I could picture the excitement in Little Billy's face as he would chip in to the plot, ""...and then... and then...!"" Well, they took this meandering storyline, sold painfully deliberate ad space to beer, liquor, and electronics companies, threw in a big scoop of overacting (thanks Bardem, Harris... good job!), and some pretty yet disconnected cinematography to pinch off a tidy little loaf that bears the name and thereby smears the legacy of the oldest franchise in the spy film genre.

The script jumps from one section to another without cluing any of the parts together. <br/><br/>As in all opening scenes of a Bond movie also in this one there is a good opening until the chase starts. There everything goes wrong and the director obviously had no idea how things work in Turkey. The scenes on the rooftops were badly made and one could notice the obvious computer editing - not really anybody was driving on these roofs apart from couple of scenes. The market scenes were impossible and unrealistic and the way the train scene ended totally ridiculous. Turkey is such a militaristic country that if NATO intelligence would be in stake the train wouldn't get even 1000 meters further from its departure without a dozen of helicopters and army commandos -fitter than Bond - chasing it. The chances that Bond would ever never survive a fall to shallow Turkish river are nonexistent. And if even if he would have done that either the Turkish authorities or the British intelligence would have him located instantly. Absolutely no way to get away from there.<br/><br/>Despite all these childish errors I still liked the opening scene mostly because what follows was tragic. Once the movie goes to the dialogues of the executives it becomes ridiculous. I am sorry but even in my office we use way more professional attitude at work than what M and her boss used in that movie. However even more ridiculous is that someone wants to execute M but instead gives her a chance to see only her office blowing in order to impress - really story for children. But the nonsense doesn't stop there. When eventually Bond remembers that his country needs him because his bosses office is blow he decides to give up the life of a looser to get back to work. So the director likes to give us a message, die for your boss but not for your country - because otherwise there would be one million reasons for Bond to get back his ass earlier than he did.<br/><br/>Indeed despite that Bond is physically ruined and mentally incompetent the office would assign him to trace the assassin responsible for the killing of fellow agents like there's nobody better to do the job. And when he finds the guy, instead of calling backup - because the assassin is literally trapped in a skyscraper with maximum security- he goes with the acrobatics and lets even another person die just to be left with a casino chip in hand. I will skip the casino scene because it is only ridiculous, full of meaningless dialogue, bad acting and clichés seen in almost every action movie. <br/><br/>In the next part Bond gets finally to the island where the bad guy is located. The bad guy who so far has been extremely smart turns to be a total idiot, living in an isolated island, very easy to be traced, surrounded with a bunch of muscled buffoons and turns also to be a gay. I didn't get the point of the last, but they obviously had to do something to distract the overall contradiction of the whole setup. The bad guy is caught and thrown to a cell that looks similar to the one Dr.Hannibal Lecter was put in the Silent of Lamps, apart that it isn't the same impressive and very unpractical and would have cause a number of security issues with its design. The bad guy has unimagined programming skills manages to get the British Intelligence computer systems virus infected to just to escape in order to find and kill M. I have a big question, why he couldn't do all that earlier when he was free and very powerful?<br/><br/>Finally we come to the point where every single level of authority in England must have been paralyzed with only Bond and his battler or uncle or whatever he was the only able people to help to save M. And the best place to do that is a spot which can be seen and traced so easily like no other. Furthermore that bad smart guy turns totally stupid when instead of bombing the whole place to the ground he decides to promenade around it throwing gradates through the windows.<br/><br/>The closing scenes are lacking any kind of emotion compared to the ones of older Bond movies. They seem more like a quick and dirty way to get us to the next Bond movie where there is a new M and probably also another Bond actor. I gave only four points because of the camera work, the music and the acting of Ralph Fiennes who I am sure will be the best M ever in the Bond movie to follow."

","I do not believe this to be the best Bond film, the problem I have is with Javier Bardem's performance.Up until his entrance the film has been outstanding with a great opening sequence and build up of tension Unfortunately I felt his performance was too camp and I found it hard to believe he had once been a great secret agent. Also in terms of the story I found it annoying that Bond did not try to kill Silver after he killed Severine.,instead slaughtering the hired help.If Bond had tried to kill him but ran out of bullets I would have preferred it<br/><br/>It would have been more visceral had Bond been more injured when the underground train crashed around him .Also when Silva has a few spots of blood on his face after the helicopter and house blew up I would have preferred to see him fight out from a pile of debris with his. face caked in blood"

","There are so many issues with this film it isn't funny. First, on the train when Bond is shot; why doesn't the agent empty the rifle on the enemy she missed? Silly. In the casino, Bond loses his gun, but after getting back to the top of the bridge, walks away without picking up the pistol. How could the antagonist escape from his glass enclosed prison? The scene at ""M's"" hearing with the shootout was silly. The antagonist couldn't escape that. The showdown at Skyfall was equally silly. Good effects, but stupid. Even if ""M"" could escape to the chapel, she would obviously hide and the grounds keeper would get several shots off. The antagonist would have killed ""M"" upon site without the drama. And Bond's killing him was silly. This movie is at best a ""B"" movie with effects. A truly terrible Bond film!"

"yong6344","1","22","46","5 November 2012"," Worse 007 movie, period!
","This movie has prompted me to write my 1st review in IMDb & not in a good way. Absolutely the worse Bond movie & I have watched all of them since Dr No. Lack of exotic locations, gadgets, Daniel C's Bond has 0 charisma, atrocious story line (if there is one) and tons of others. The opening scene is a little decent. Thereafter, everything just went downhill. Daniel C looks old in this movie. This is about the same age that Roger Moore 1st outing as Bond in Live and Let Die. Roger Moore's Bond was way ahead. Cool and suave. Even Sean Connery was better in Never Say Never Again. I know many people repeatedly view the likes of Goldfinger, The Spy who Loves Me, Goldeneye. I actually saw people walked out of the movie half way thru'. Someone in IMDb once wisely said: if they want to make a movie so different, they should use another name. NOT Bond, NOT James Bond. I strongly believe that the initial high score of 8.2 will not be sustainable. It will definitely nosedive soon. Time will tell. Not even worth a rental. Enough said."
"Antagonisten","6","17","34","30 July 2014"," Didn't do it for me
","I feel like a grumpy old man these days, realizing that very few movies ""do it"" for me any more. Skyfall is one of the movies that fail to excite me. While it's certainly competent film-making, it doesn't have that wow-factor and in the end failed to grip my attention properly.<br/><br/>The James Bond-franchise has felt a bit tired and outdated for a long time. While I felt that Casino Royale breathed some new life into it, Quantum of Solace was more or less a dud. This movie seems to pick up on the fact that this sort of movie is more or less an anachronism today, and they play a little with that in the story. The truth though is that I'm not sure Bond has a place in today's film. Especially not since much of what made Bond unique is more or less lost, this movie basically plays like a regular action-movie without any of the real characteristics of a Bond-movie. They have even let go of the gadgetry, and while Javier Bardem is certainly a competent actor, I think he makes a somewhat pale villain. While the Bond-franchise is struggling to get up to date, I feel that it's history is weighing it down.<br/><br/>Disregarding the Bond-factor this is, like I said in the beginning, competent film-making. It looks good, action-scenes are not bad (although not spectacular either). Daniel Craig is his stone-faced self, and Judy Dench is given a lot of space which is never a bad thing. Of course, as is almost standard fare today, the movie is far too long. 30 minutes could easily be cut out without diminishing the movie.<br/><br/>I didn't dislike the movie, it just failed to wow me. I think it has a lot to do with expectations, I want that exciting crazy feeling you got from the older Bond-films where villains where almost magically evil, and they built up entire cities inside mountains with little trains running through them. You just don't get that any more. I miss it, and Bond is a lot less compelling without that magic."
"adrian_wood2","5","17","34","7 November 2013"," First half good, second half poor.
","I thought this Bond movie was going to be one of the best i've ever seen. Craig as ever, fits the role really well. Plenty of action and suspense from the very start with a good plot. BUT....after about an hour things start to go downhill. The end scene was one of the more disappointing that i've seen in a Bond film. M gets far too involved in this movie. Dench acts as Craig's side kick, getting into almost as much of the action as Bond himself does. Way over the top. Lets be realistic....would a high ranking middle class female civil servant based in Westminster really go around shooting guns at arch villains? M needs to get back into his/her office where they belong! Where was the beautiful Bond girl that Bond needed to protect in the final scene? The final scene has plenty of action but the scenario was corny! Worth a watch but you may at the end be a little disappointed!"
"blackmamba99971","10","17","34","12 November 2012"," Daniel Craig is the man
","This was one of the best bonds films I have ever seen. Daniel Craig as the famed 007 agent who is on the run of his life against possibly the most evil man on the planet. Silver, (Javier Bardem) who was once an agent affiliate to the UK was given up by 'M' (judi Dench) to the Chinese militia rather than to use him as ransom bait. During his incarceration underwent torture for months to try and give up names of contacts. But as with all agents, rather than giving in, he decided to take his cyanide pill to end his suffering. However to everyone's utter amazement, survived the attempt to end his own life and became a new super evil for which he swore revenge against 'M' for his transformation. Bond who with other sections of MI6 became targets by the British minister because of continuous violent acts for which all were placed on trial. During this crisis it was learn-ed that silver was to try and kill 'M' at those proceedings. Yet bond with his usual style and audacity helped stave off the hit to try and catch silver once again. So to end this complete charade, bond led silver to his old estate where he grew up as a child. A place known as Skyfall manor. There the showdown of his life ensued with bond on top once again, but at a heavy price, for 'M's last days were counted with a mortal wound. I have to say it was a great chapter ending to bonds secret life, where he grew up, what 'M' learn-ed about him and why bond never liked his past in the first place. The music was top notch, the action left me riveted, and the story to his past had been nothing less but intriguing. Ralph Fiennes played an excellent character as well for his role as the new 'M'. A man who thought the old ways were still above the new as a sort of guide rather than to be a hindrance. Old and new collide in so many ways since the computer chip became the dominate species, but to so many others in the field, experience will always be considered as the end result. Fantastic film, highly recommended to all who are fans of 007."
"billygoat1071","9","17","34","3 November 2012"," New Classy Bond
","Daniel Craig's version of James Bond is probably the most engaging one so far. Casino Royale improves the series with grittier and much serious tone. Though, Quantum of Solace is simply just a straightforward action film. Skyfall brings back the spy's classiness and simply tells a compelling story. While the action scenes are magnificent and the filmmaking is fancy. There's also a fascinating performance by Javier Bardem. Skyfall is definitely one of the best Bond films ever.<br/><br/>Skyfall is kind of extraordinary as a Bond film. Classic Bond elements are there but the film tries to go deeper and have more dangerous conflicts. It can be a little bit tamed sometimes but it's best when it explores more about the villain and the threats for M. The film tells the story in a slicker way like how the characters are introduced and the action scenes are executed. The actions scenes are exciting enough. After the gruff high octane opening chase, the rest of the action is all hiding in the shadows and blowing up stuff. There isn't much of a romance, but it's not really necessary for this story.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is still pretty awesome as Bond and Judi Dench is always great as M. Ben Whishaw gives a nice introduction to the new Q and Noamie Harris is pretty likable as her role. But obviously, Javier Bardem is the standout of the film. He brings a lot of threat and strangeness to the villain. There's also a bit of sympathy beneath the character that he made effective enough.<br/><br/>The most impressive in the filmmaking is the cinematography that classes up every shot of the film. It also has a fabulous production design. There's almost nothing to mention about the special effects until you see the obviously CGI'd lizard. The original Bond theme plays often in parts and the Skyfall song fits well to the film.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a strong Bond film. It tells the story cleverly and adds more depth to the Bond character with elegant filmmaking and brisk, surreal action sequences. It's overall innovative to the series. It has the classy Bond swagger but aims higher with more compelling drama and exciting thrills. Some might get disappointed for not having enough Bond Girl moments but I think we can live without it for a while. In the end, it's an amazing experience that is stirring and brilliantly done."
"proxy55","Null","14","27","13 January 2013"," System.out.println(""HACKERS!!!!!!!!11111one"");
","I think Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond, but unfortunately this movie suffers from writing that couldn't be any worse if you gave some pencils to a bunch of monkeys.<br/><br/>Apparently an ex-agent who's completely nuts (Silva, played by Javier Bardem) is a master hacker able to control every network on the planet and make almost unlimited amounts of money by manipulating stock and politics. It doesn't make things any better that the hacking is portrayed in a way that will give everyone who knows a little bit about computers a major headache. It's about time the old farts in Hollywood stop pulling this magical computer crap out of their a*ses and make computers and hacking in movies more realistic - but I guess then they'd actually have to come up with a coherent story and explain things instead of saying ""hackers did it"". <br/><br/>Then on the other side, we got the new hipster Q (Ben Whishaw) who is supposed to be an expert on these matters and invented software that ""only six people in the world can understand"", yet somehow manages to not know the first thing about computers and get the MI6 network infected with Silva's malware.<br/><br/>Silva, a genius like no other, then proceeds to get himself killed in a personal vendetta that is so over the top that one can't help but facepalm throughout the movie. I wish a super ex-secret-agent hacker would destroy studios that make movies like this, but instead this trash gets five Oscar nominations (...which again says something about the current state of the academy awards).<br/><br/>To be fair, the acting, effects and music were good, but considering the complete lack of a decent story, giving more than 3 or 4 out of 10 would be delusional."
"frank-hynes","1","14","27","14 November 2012"," A good move has to be about plot not action
","I tried to like it but the plot had more holes than Homeland and that is saying something. It is as if it was written by the Baddie (Silva) as he seems to know every move and every turn in advance. When he pops out of the tube station a car just happens to pull up for him right on time. There is more chance of him winning the lottery. Everything is just so right on time. If he was that smart why didn't he go straight to his intended victim instead of wasting two hours of my time in the cinema! How come we have a Spaniard working for M15, for Queen and Country? Maybe his parents were British! If you have seen the movie, just think about it. There were bits of plot just stuck in there for the sake of action all the way along. If you were going to assassinate somebody you would not kill everyone you met in the building on the way to your target. Not very professional. It is the last Bond movie I will pay to see."
"jamaicajoe008","1","19","39","9 November 2012"," Skip this Bond, and wait for the next one - waste of time/money
","I saw this movie in India on Nov 1.<br/><br/>The whole premise of customizing Bond for his audience completely fails the notion of Bond. Yes, most of his fans must now have experienced a dent in their games: Bond can't shoot straight, fails fitness tests etc. Most fans have grown older: Bond lives now on pills. Most fans moved away from ancestral homes and wondering about it (as all people do in their 50s): Bond revisits his ancestral home. And then Sam hopes to give them a way out by a Bond who can miraculously suddenly start shooting straight, becomes full of stamina, and decides to let go of the past (his ancestral home) for the sake of the future.<br/><br/>From a character perspective, Bond was never about reality. Bond was always about seemingly real fantasy. No one in their 40s, 50s, 60s need Bond to validate their problems..they need Bond to obfuscate their problems - show ways of how those problems do not exist. Give something for the men to look up to and strive for.<br/><br/>From a story and action perspective, the movie sucked. There was no story, no continuity, no meaning. Craig does not come through as a distinguished gentleman from a posture perspective (one of the reviewers aptly described his standing pose as if he was urinating).<br/><br/>The humor was good through the movie, the idea of bringing that old car back was good, but did not last long. The climax was pathetic.<br/><br/>Except for the opening sequence, rest of the movie was full of crap.<br/><br/>And then, what's with moving the rolling target-finder sequence to the end? what was the purpose of it? In the past, having this sequence in the beginning set the tone for the rest of the movie : it signaled to the audience to settle down, that they are watching a ""Bond"" movie, and to expect a high standard of entertainment. Even if the movie were below average (like Tomorrow Never Dies), the audience could appreciate the movie a shade better because they viewed it with the Bond glasses. But having the target-finder sequence at the end wasted the whole movie. People could not connect to Bond through the movie, and when, in the end, the target-finder sequence showed up, they were too frustrated to care.<br/><br/>In the next movie, I think they should do some serious re-thinking of how to get Bond back on track, and avoid showing his legs if Craig still plays it."
"MovieCritic33-6","10","21","44","8 November 2012"," Right back to where it started from...
","When I first saw Casino Royale I remember enjoying it, then after processing it I felt as though the film itself was just not even comparable to any of it's predecessors. Not because it was bad, (although it's successor was not as intriguing),but because it decided to stray away from the Bond formula I came to understand, that and even the tone and style had a different feel to it. <br/><br/>I was also confused as to whether or not Craig's run as Bond was an entirely new take on an all too familiar plot, or if it was a continuation of the Bond series with a new ""Bond"" whose filling in the position of it's previous title holder. (Which if that were the case he would have technically only been the third 00 agent to fill in as Bond, seeing as all Bond's, but Brosnan, mention the death of his wife Tracy Draco. <br/><br/>I am pleased to say that I finally have the clarification I was looking for, and that all of Craig's previous outings as Bond have all boiled down to this one... A reboot is what this new franchise is, and a damn good one if you ask me. Although these past three Bond films have been rather grounded (unlike the fun and thrilling Moonraker), his instalments are still exciting to watch with even Quantum of Solace having its moments of sheer pulse pounding excitement. But I must admit that Skyfall in particular had it all and writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan really brought the story back to it's roots, and yes all back to where it started from. Credit must also be given to its director Sam Mendes, and cinematographer Roger Deakins. Skyfall brings back the classic bond, at times with humorous references made, and homages to the franchise that it just sends a shiver of nostalgia down your spine, that makes you say to yourself ""Bond is finally back!"" The classic Bond series mixed in with the modernist interpretation of the series, really make it one of the ultimate Bond films since (insert favourite Bond film here --->______________!) <br/><br/>Before I risk spoiling anything, I will conclude by saying this is a Bond film worth viewing, and is definitely is one for both fans of the franchise and those who have only been recently introduced."
"Jack_Slater","3","38","87","24 October 2012"," Craig delivers strong performance, but the plot is weak
","I attended a press preview of Skyfall, and was disappointed to say the least. What's worse, is that I was bored - and I'm a huge Bond fan. The final hour drags, and the denouement is a paint-by-numbers, clichéd setup seriously unworthy of the Bond franchise. <br/><br/>So, avoiding any spoilers whatsoever, a few thoughts: <br/><br/>As the credits rolled, I was impressed: Bardem, Fiennes, Deakins, Baird, Newman, Logan, and Mendes. Alas, it was not to be, and unfortunately the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. <br/><br/>Craig certainly owns the part as 007, it's the plot, script and tone that lets him down. <br/><br/>The plot is one of THE worst ever in Bond history, and I mean bad. It's weak. It's way too limited in scope. And it's painfully uninteresting. Whatever happened to Bond villains obsessed with world domination, nuclear endgame, or crashing the global stock markets? Instead, we get a personal vendetta that nobody really asked for.<br/><br/>I cannot believe that Sam Mendes signed up as director upon the strength of this story-line. Perhaps it was the draw of Bond, and so, he committed to directorial duties with any script, sight unseen. <br/><br/>Bardem is fantastic in his (albeit limited) sociopath's role, but is severely underused (as is new Bond girl, Marlohe). While Dame Judi is annoyingly curt throughout, and overused. (Never once in all my years watching Bond did I think: ""Do you know what this franchise needs, more 'M' in a lead role."")<br/><br/>As for the tone, it's a mishmash of stylish espionage thriller coupled with a dry, stale overview of Whitehall government policy review (no, seriously), and Home Alone!?!. Needless to say I was underwhelmed as to where the writers, producers and director decided to take Bond23. Carly Simon once sang ""Nobody Does It Better"", sadly, in today's competitive market of action, spy, heroes, stunts and humour, many others do, in fact, do it better (Bourne, MI:3, Dark Knight). Far better. <br/><br/>My rating: 3/10. A superb opening sequence. Javier Bardem as villain. Lavish cinematography from Deakins. And a nice cameo from a very old friend from the 1960s. <br/><br/>And one final thought: I really miss Monty Norman's iconic theme from the Craig-era Bonds. Why not play it in its entirety at the most opportune moments? It barely features in Skyfall, and that is such a shame."

Acton is limited and extremely choreographed. Went to see it last night and the gent next to my wife slept through the whole film. If this was not a Bond movie it would be dismissed as a very ordinary movie - no suspense In it at all - not even as good as Taken 2 which was ridiculed by the critics. If this is the best that Sam Mendes can do with a very popular movie brand then he needs to go back to the older movies and understand what made them such a success."

","Where to begin? I was really looking for to this movie with high hopes that it was going to be far better than first two crappy cliché movies. I was sorely mistaken. Right from the get-go this movie was horrible. Horrible one-liners throughout (I mean horrible!). Bad acting. Bad Plot. Not even Javier Bardem could save this movie. M, or as she should be call, Lizard Face, was terrible. Every line out her mouth was just pure crap. I mean not only was it not funny, childish, and cliché', but she acts about as good as Daniel Radcliff in Harry Potter 1. Not even Adele's open song was good! I love Adele and her music and voice are amazing! But the song wasn't good. Not even a little bit. Well, maybe a little bit, but that's it. Craig did the best he could do, but his lines were just garbage. The whole movie was utterly pointless. The bad guy's plan was to set up this insanely complex ruse (not original though- quite similar to the Joker's in the Dark Knight) just to get revenge on someone. Just utterly lame. Plus, it totally ignores the first part of the movie which is the missing hard drive. Did they forget that part during filming, or do they just think the audience is retarded and won't think about it? Q, wow. What a dumb ass character. He acts about as good as my 10 year old son. His lines have got to go down in history as poorer verbal intercourse than anything out of Star Wars 1,2,or 3. Here's an example, paraphrased, ""There's only like 6 people in the world who could've written computer code this good."" Bond, ""Can you?"" Q, ""I invented it."" Followed by stupid ass smirks from both actors. I mean wow. Really? Did he just really say that? I wanted to punch him in his ugly face so hard! Just horrible film making. And it was like this from beginning to end. If I could compare this movie to something else, it was be on the lines of something like Battlefield Earth. Out of of 144 minutes, I was entertained for about 12. Thanks for nothing guys. Next time I want to see a Bond film, I think I'll just watch Archer instead."

"darkraven_109","10","16","32","3 November 2012"," The Old Ways are Indeed the Best
","After a long four year wait for the next 007 film to come out due to MGM's financial issues, SKYFALL finally hit cinemas and it was more than worth the wait. It's obvious that the crew behind the movie took a lot of time and effort perfecting what could be considered as the best Bond movie in years. What unfolded before my eyes wasn't just a movie but an experience.<br/><br/>What made SKYFALL great was that it took everything that makes a James Bond movie great (exotic locations, action, a threatening villain, etc.) and improves every single one of them while at the same time adding new ones. SKYFALL finally returns the franchise back to its roots so no longer do we have the boredom and excessive BOURNE influence seen in the previous two installments; this is a James Bond film just like the old days where entertainment and story are balanced. The movie also serves as a love letter to the fans with the numerous references to the old Bond movies and its old-school style; anyone who's seen Bond since the start will love SKYFALL, all the way from the nostalgic theme song opening to the climatic confrontation at the end.<br/><br/>The cast fit their roles perfectly and redefined established characters in the Bond mythology. I have no doubt that Daniel Craig can be a great James Bond but it was only now that he was given a good James Bond script to work with; Bond is still the playboy and efficient MI6 agent but now, he's also a human being. The same goes for the rest of the cast; one of the new things added into the film which was rarely seen in previous Bond films was the complexity of the characters. They're still the usual mainstays of a Bond film (a terrorist mastermind, M, a bureaucrat, the Bond girl, etc.) but now they're all human beings with motivations that drive their actions. They don't rely anymore on simple politics but now they rely on personal issues to drive them. This addition only made the drama of SKYFALL more engaging and believable.<br/><br/>Another addition that I appreciated was the overlying theme of the secret service's relevance in the changing times. Such themes were mentioned off-hand and never fully explored in the Brosnan movies (especially GOLDENEYE) so now that it gets full focus, it helps the movie become more relevant in our time period. The problem with reviving old franchises is the task of making the aged characters work in a time period different from the one they were originally envisioned in; in the case of Bond, he was born in the golden age of espionage of the Cold War but now, in an age that relies more on a computer for intelligence information, those like him have close to no purpose at all. SKYFALL successfully overcomes the problem in a masterful way with its impressive dialogue between the old guard of espionage and the modern age believers. The dialogue between the characters is powerful enough to make even a James Bond fan (like myself) question the franchise's relevance now that the Cold War and the need for spies is long over; what makes the script great is not only in how it will get you involved in the story and its characters but it will definitely make you think and reflect a lot many other things.<br/><br/>My only complaint with SKYFALL was the CGI. The green-screen effects of some scenes were pretty obvious and while it doesn't dent the movie at all, it was a bit distracting and annoying to look at. Hopefully, in the next bond movies, the crew ditches or at least improves the CGI to make things look more realistic. I personally hope they go back to practical effects but that may just be me.<br/><br/>SKYFALL is the best thing that happened to James Bond in the new millennium. By far, this is the most emotional and exciting James Bond in recent memory and none of the drama in the storyline felt forced as everything worked well in the film's context as it did in CASINO ROYALE. Those who are worried that SKYFALL is only a James Bond movie in name will have no reason to fear. SKYFALL is an old-school Bond movie with all the improvements and additions the 2000's could provide and it works well, molding SKYFALL into a masterpiece in the long history of the James Bond franchise. It just goes to show that, indeed, (quoting Kincade in the movie) ""Sometimes the old ways are the best."""

","We've waited four years since ""Quantum Of Solace"", but 50 years after ""Dr No"" started the longest and most successful franchise in movie history comes the 23rd James Bond film and the third starring Daniel Craig as 007. I was 14 years old when I attended the spy's first cinematic outing; over the next couple of years, I read all 14 Ian Fleming novels; and, over the last half a century, I have gone along to the theatre to see each new film as soon as it was released. <br/><br/>What was new with ""Skyfall"" is that I managed to see it a week before its general release at a special viewing for cast and crew when all mobiles were taken off us, all of us were searched, and everyone sat through the credits before applauding a brilliant team effort.<br/><br/>The sense of excitement was rewarded by a superb movie. A cracking opening is followed by a powerful song from Adele which is followed by a storyline that is genuinely distinctive from other Bond movies: more intelligible and more intelligent.<br/><br/>Instead of the archetypal villain as someone crazed by megalomania, we have an adversary, subtly played by a blond Javier Bardem, who is motivated not just by power and wealth but by a very personal sense of vengeance. Instead of a Bond who easily outwits all foes, we have an agent with some obvious vulnerabilities, both physical and psychological, who does not always get his way. Instead of the usual two Bond girls, effectively we have three: French actress Bérénice Marlohe in her first English-speaking part, British actress Naomie Harris in what will prove to be a break-out role, and the redoubtable 77 year old Judi Dench playing M for the seventh time in 17 years.<br/><br/>The film is a triumph for British director Sam Mendes, making his first British movie after such more serious successes as ""American Beauty"", ""Road To Perdition"" and""Revolutionary Road"". I was shaken and stirred."

","What a crushing bore of a movie.<br/><br/>There's nothing even remotely original or progressive about this outing for Bond, and for me it actually plumbed new depths of disappointment that even Quantum of Solace hadn't reached.<br/><br/>It's the same-old, same-old, with the obligatory car-chase opening which, unlike the superb Casino Royale, attempts nothing innovative, such as parquet or scaffold-scaling.<br/><br/>The plot is a by-the-numbers yawn-a-thon along the lines of a rogue former agent, which sounds very familiar if you've seen Goldeneye.<br/><br/>There are even obvious mistakes, which, due to boredom in the cinema, I picked up on. They both involve characters (M, then Bond) failing to pick up objects that they miraculously have in hand seconds later despite leaving them where they lay. This is unforgivable for movies with huge budgets.<br/><br/>I despair for Bond, for although Casino Royale injected some much needed excitement and depth to the series (good plot, interesting characters, emotional resonance), the two movies since have trundled on as if it had never happened.<br/><br/>In fact, so much of the movie is spent referencing the old ones, that there is a desire to dig out the originals, which surely can't have aged that badly, could they?

"jjohns1979","4","18","37","4 December 2012"," Skyfall, and it's main character Emo Bond
","Okay, I can't stop thinking about this so I'm going to explain a few things. Basically that this was not actually a James Bond film. It was, as Michelle Alexandria pointed out, a film about his twin brother Emo Bond. The differences between the two personalities are hard to see at first, but after you notice a few things the pattern becomes clear.<br/><br/>Now what kind of guy is James Bond? He's confident, tough, resourceful, charming. You can always rely on him to do everything possible to save the world or rescue the damsel. He's tricky and can be deceitful, but usually only when the person he's deceiving is trying to deceive him, and always when the end justifies the means. Emo is not like that, he's brooding, sulky, blames others for his own failings, can not be trusted to deliver on promises, and has Mummy and Daddy issues.<br/><br/>The first sign we get that the hero of this film is not James but Emo can be found in the way he reacts to his perceived mistreatment by MI6 and M in particular. James Bond would have accepted that a decision was made (to take the shot) and that the outcome was unfortunate, and simply shaken it off and gone back to work. Or he would have been furious and left MI6, or at least found some way to outsmart M and get back at her. In contrast Emo Bond sulks in his beer for a while then comes back and attempts to milk sympathy from M and the rest of MI6. Emo Bond is always playing the victim card.<br/><br/>Next we have a chain of events that prove that the character in this film is simply unable or unwilling to save the damsel, or to deliver on promises. When Bond meets Severine in the casino he makes an implied promise that he'll be able to protect her. He understands that she has had a very tough life, and she makes the brave decision to trust him. Later Bond is given a gun and takes Silva at his word that they are playing a game of William Tell for this woman's life. James Bond would have known this game was rigged and would have had some sort of trick up his sleeve to save her. Emo Bond is either too stupid, too scared, or too apathetic to save her. Now I know women have been killed as a result of James Bonds actions as well, but this was just too easy. Especially considering the MI6 choppers were only 100 meters away. James Bond can be a bit of a d@#k, but Emo is actually kind of a f$%kw*t.<br/><br/>Also the two Bond's have different methods of seduction. James Bond is always the most charming man in the room. Once a woman finds herself talking to him it is only ever a matter of time before she succumbs to the sharpness of his wit and forcefulness of his nature. Emo Bond is the shy quiet type. He likes to sneak up on women in the shower for ""surprise sex"". Not very becoming of a super-spy in my opinion.<br/><br/>As for the issue of a rough childhood, well that's just not something James thinks about. He and Emo had the same upbringing, but while James focuses on killing bad guys, sleeping with gorgeous women, wearing the best suits, driving the best cars, and drinking the best booze, his brother Emo never got over a sense of abandonment after his parents mysteriously died. While James was able to channel that rage into a productive and powerful force, Emo continued to carry with him a sense of melancholy.<br/><br/>More bizarre though, was Emo's choice to seek out a surrogate mother in the form of work colleague M. James always had a professional, if sometimes strained or even insubordinate relationship with his work superiors. It was strange to watch his twin brother Emo, who shares the same DNA, become so emotionally, even romantically, attached to a superior operative. James Bond is a loner, like Dirty Harry, Mike Hammer, or that guy in the Searchers. Emo Bond is like Harold from Harold and Maude. In love with a woman that reminds him of his Grandmother.<br/><br/>Last but not least, when asked what he thought when he heard the word country, Emo Bond said ""England"". James Bond would have said ""Great Britain""."
"pggeldenhuys","2","18","37","3 December 2012"," Was this made in 1952?
","The only good thing about Skyfail, is the new Coke add before the movie. For the sake of not repeating what has been said before, let me simply state the following, what is James Bond? In my mind he's suppose to be ""The Man"", a slick, suave, highly trained, highly skilled, Secret Agent from Mi6, who with the aid of a really cool ""never been seen before"" gadget from the ever comical Q, defeats the enemy or at least makes their lives difficult. An agent who always accomplishes his goal, with a fair bit of womanizing on the side, funny one liners and super exciting expeditions etc. In short he is the guy every man wants to be and every woman can't resist. <br/><br/>In this installment he literally fails at every single task assigned to him, he loses the list, gets shot, has depression, turns into a drunk whilst AWOL, comes back, fails all the training tests assigned to him scoring 40%. Then Fails to protect/keep alive the only girl worth mentioning in the movie. Then he captures only to lose again the baddie (Who is a Spanish or is it Mexican ex Mi6 agent, how does that happen?) in broad daylight, then he barely gets M away to his ""fortress"" family home in Scotland, where there's only a single Scottish (With out an accent of any kind) gamekeeper with one gun, where he fails to keep M alive (Great choice), the only thing he accomplishes all movie long is to kill the baddie, with an knife after not sustaining hypothermia some how, who was already trying to kill himself, so no points scored there. Does this sound like our British secret agent hero? As technology move forward into a TRON like age, Bond and Q moves into the 50's. The best you can do is a gun with 3 LED lights and a radio the size of a small cellphone? The radio was invented in the 1800's pal.<br/><br/>It feels like this movie was shot in the 50s with a 70 year old director and his 32 year old daughter smitten with twilight, having said that Twilight was better, much better!<br/><br/>The movie ends with bond being assigned a new mission, from the new M. M must be thinking ""Now this is exactly the type of guy I want protecting our country, the guy who's getting old, can't shoot straight, has issues, is an alcoholic, poses way too much, has no skills other than running through walls, and the uncanny ability not to die, and to boot killed my predecessor . . ."" The only thing Secret about Bond is how on earth it managed to get its rating, at time of this writing its 8.1, did they pay 100 000 people off to go vote? Without a doubt the WORST BOND YET!"
"youtubemail908","1","18","37","6 November 2012"," Not bad but really boring
","First: Sorry if there are some mistakes in my text, I'm not English ;) ...<br/><br/>Before I went to the cinema to watch the new Bond-film, I looked at the rating of IMDb and it said: Well made Bond (8 points). It seemed that this new Bond would be like the old ones. Cars, women, action, action and explosions. So yesterday I was in the cinema and watched a 145 min long James Bond with a pause of 10 min. While the pause my friend and me were talking about the film and he said: ""Fuck, I hope there will be some action after the pause."" He was right. There was just one action scene in the beginning of the film, then ... nothing, just talking, talking and talking. Boring. But after the pause nothing changed. OK, sorry ... there were ... um ... maybe 4, no, 3 I think, action scenes plus the great fight in the end. Not really what we expected.<br/><br/>Let's sum: 3 little action sequences, 1 bigger action scene and a great ending. One car with machine guns, two sex scenes (2 seconds long) and 2 girls. Yeah ... that's what I want ... NOT! It was miserable and boring. Yes, it's more Bond than the two before will ever be but 145 min and 5 action scenes? 120 min boring talk? Not again!"
"imrational","7","9","16","12 November 2012"," Julian Assange as a Bond villain?!?
","Okay, there was a lot to like in this movie. We see the famed Astin Martin car used in Sean Connery's Bond movies, we have references to exploding pens, we see a new Q, get some backstory on Bond's history prior to MI6, some good action sequences...<br/><br/>Now for the problem. The mish-mash of threads/themes that churn on the screen like bad tequila and ice cream do in a stomach.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with a list of undercover operatives that has been stolen. This is never resolved. A simple line, like ""it's on the internet now, we've should pull everyone in"" would work, but instead, they only pull the operatives whose names are outed online. Instead, it is just left dangling.<br/><br/>We see Bond as being too old and probably washed up, yet, this is only his second adventure (Casino Royale & Quantum of Solace being linked together as one larger interlinked assignment). <br/><br/>I think the biggest theme which is mishandled is... the villain. It ends up being revealed that the villain is actually a former operative who was disavowed/sold off by his Majesty's government and with a legitimate reason for revenge against MI6 and M, but that reveal conflicts with the heavy-handed propaganda that the movie tries to force down our throats prior to that.<br/><br/>You see, the villain here is Julian Assange of Wikileaks fame, not a wronged former agent. This movie is here to sell the idea that the internet is a dangerous place and a hacker can manipulate events in the digital world and wreck havoc in the normal one. An island can be evacuated and taken over by a criminal organization without a single shot fired. Secret agents who are undercover and working to protect us can have their identities outed with the push of a button. Granted, this is realistic and would have made for a great villain/idea... but it is only left partially followed thru. The last third (after the capture of Assange) seems to have been done by an entirely different script-writer.<br/><br/>Yeah, Assange has revealed top secret documents and does pose a risk for governmental leaks, but he has also exposed many scandals thru his website that those in power do not wish to see the light of day. <br/><br/>Now, that would have made for a better Bond villain... have Bond be assigned to terminate an Assange character, let Bond learn that the ""villain"" is actually a good guy trying to expose government corruption and have him go thru the turmoil of deciding Queen and Country versus Doing the Right Thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, it is still in the top 10 of best Bond movies ever made... and I recommend seeing it."

","You are going to travel. London, Istanbul, Shanghai, Macao, and Scotland of course, the castle of Skyfall. And hurry up about it because Skyfall will be completely destroyed in the operation.<br/><br/>You have the stunts, the car hunts, the chases, and all the physical elements necessary in that film. Istanbul is one city splashed with this mission and that's the second time in three months, after Taken 2. But it is hardly really said. You recognize Turkey if you know it. Shanghai is more in the tradition of Bourne and his films. But no Eastern Europeans, not even Moscow nor Berlin. That is rather clean after all. The main damage is in London and Scotland. They even cut the Eiffel Tower out, but not Big Ben.<br/><br/>The British respect their borders and like their country. We are speaking of the MI6 of course but there is a big leak in the system and that leak does not come from outside but from inside, in fact from an agent who was one of the best, if not the best in his 1980-90 time, but he got caught and in the MI6, the famous M, the lady boss of the service, decided to trade him. When someone very faithful survives such a treacherous decision, you can expect difficulties.<br/><br/>And difficulties they got. But the main difficulty came from the government and Parliament who started criticizing the work of the service and the security of the country in the name of modern technology that should be used instead of secret agents and shadowy maneuvers. And no one has the courage to bring to light the simple facts. Yet this simple situation of a treacherous agent within the system is the main idea in this film: danger is not from outside but from inside and the solution can only come from inside too.<br/><br/>That's why this film is better than most other films in that field. It is not targeting foreign enemies but a national agent that turned bitter, sour, rotten, self-motivated by vengeance.<br/><br/>The point is not even to know whether he is going to get his vengeance or not, but how it is going to happen. And that you will have to look for it in the film. I hope you enjoy the marvellous Scottish castle that is destroyed like a house of cards built by kids.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","This movie was absolutely fantastic. Daniel Craig once again shows why he's the best James Bond ever. He's has all of the charisma of any of the past Bonds but has a grit to him that allows the movies to be a bit darker and more realistic. While I didn't enjoy Skyfall quite as much as Casino Royale, it was still much better than Quantum of Solace and is probably my second favorite Bond movie ever. I liked that they added depth to M and touched on some of the political element to MI6. I was a bit disappointed that Berenice Marlohe wasn't featured more. I've been hearing for the past month what a beautiful and fantastic Bond-girl she is and, while she is stunning, she was barely in the film at all. Overall, it's a great movie and more than just Bond fans will enjoy it.

","considering that ""Casino Royale"" was one of the most brilliant reboots of recent times and considering that the abysmally bad ""Quantum of Solace"" was a complete train-wreck of a movie, that could have broken the back of a less established franchise.<br/><br/>In ""Skyfall"" James Bond finally returns to his roots: there is a new Q (Ben Whishaw, properly nerdish), there's a Ms. Moneypenny (don't tell me you haven't guessed who it is) and, for the future, a new M (Ralph Fiennes, perfectly cast). A revamped Walter PPK and the return of Bonds Aston Martin are pure nostalgia. There's even hints of Moore-Bond-like humour and one-liners; again suitably without seeming forced or tacky. And there is action – plenty of fast-paced, memorable action. In short: ""Skyfall"" contains everything that makes a classic Bond picture.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the element which makes or breaks a Bond movie: the antagonist. Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre and his bleeding eye did an alright, yet not overly impressive job, and Mr. Greene in ""Quantum"" – well, let's be frank about it: a bug-eyed Roman Polanski look-alike with a strong French accent hardly qualifies as ""menacing"". Javier Bardem has played one of the most memorable villains in recent years in ""No Country for Old Men"", so expectations where extremely high. And Bardem delivers: the Spanish actor had announced that his Silva would be an amalgamation of various Bond villains and he didn't promise too much, the character having elements and nuances of almost every Bond-foes since Dr. No, be it Zorin, Scaramanga, Alec Trevelyan 006, Gustav Graves and even the iconic henchman Jaws, to name but a few. A classic yet unique Bond adversary, filled to the brim with the charm of the psychopath. If ever there was a Bond opponent worthy of making a return in a potential sequel (which, with the exception of criminal mastermind Blofeld, albeit played by different actors, hasn't happened before), his name be Raoul Silva.<br/><br/>Having said all that, what's new about ""Skyfall""? For one, the storyline not only continues to portray James Bond as a realistic figure (and not the cardboard-parody of, say, the Moore- and Brosnan-era). Craig's Bond isn't a near-invincible superhero but a person who has to deal with his inner demons, childhood traumas, and fear of aging, etc; troubles and tribulations that virtually every person can relate too. One of the few problems that some critics had with ""Casino Royale"" was the portrayal of Bond as someone who could be described as a borderline-psychopath (which, considering that killing other human beings is how he makes a living, isn't all too far fetched). ""Skyfall"" delves deeper into the psychology of James Bond, and especially his relationship to M (Judi Dench, more than ever a surrogate mother-figure to both Bond and Silva).<br/><br/>Nothing is perfect and there are minor flaws, which fortunately lie in the eye of the beholder. One could say that the introductory song by Adele Adkins is rather lacklustre, if not to say common. Speaking of product placement, like in previous installations, there's an annoying overkill of thinly veiled ads. Take it from the horses' mouth: despite Bond sipping away on Heineken-Pils, it remains a rather mediocre beer and so I personally will stick with Martini. Shaken, not stirred.<br/><br/>Some have criticised that there are ""merely"" two Bond-girls in ""Skyfall"" (not counting Bardem, whom joksters have described as the ""first male Bond-girl"") and despite Naomie Harris being cute as a button, the grimacing and facial contortions of Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) personally made me fear that she was about to suffer from a stroke at any moment.<br/><br/>But as said: nothing is perfect and so I give it 8 from 10 points and the distinct hope that tomorrow never dies and Daniel Craig will keep his license to kill, live and let die on her Majesty's Secret Service for a long time to come. (Forgive me, I simply couldn't resist)."
"parallel_projection","8","19","40","11 November 2012"," Resurrection at its finest.
","Going into this film (and it truly is a film, that's how beautiful it is), I had heard all the hype from overseas, and so I was expecting it to be good, but not this good. I was worrying that it was going to be too action-heavy, but its not: it takes the time to establish relationships between the characters, so when there is action, it actually matters. I'm really not qualified to say if this is the best Bond film, or even if Daniel Craig is the best Bond, but I can say that this is by far the best of the one's Craig has worked on, and I also believe Craig is incredibly believable as Bond--he's a person, with actual emotions and feelings, rather than just a spy.<br/><br/>Now even though I gave this film a perfect rating, it is not perfect--it's absolutely fantastic, but of course a few things could've been better. However, because of the way this film ends, I could not rate it anything but a ten. The ending is absolutely mind-blowing. To say much about it would be to give away the entire film, but I will say this: they have changed the future of the series forever (and by series, I mean the ones staring Craig).<br/><br/>Speaking of Daniel Craig, I have to praise him even further. He really is an amazing actor, and brings so much to this role. I think this is one of his best performances--he might've even been better here than in last year's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, although that's a close call. Like I said earlier, though, his Bond is the most grounded--he's still a tough, cunning spy, but here he manages to appear more vulnerable. Other actors did a great job as well: Javier Bardem is terrifyingly sly as Silva, Naomie Harris does a good job as the rookie field agent, and Bérénice Marlohe has a short but memorable role as the complicated Sévérine. Additionally, the dynamic between Ralph Fiennes and Daniel Craig is fantastic, as well as the dynamic between him and Ben Winshaw's ingenious Q. <br/><br/>The true performance, however, comes from none other than Judi Dench. This is by far her biggest role as M, as well as her most impressive performance in along time. In my opinion, her character's storyline makes the film. The emotion she was able to bring to her character while still staying stern in the presence of others is absolutely breathtaking, especially in the courtroom scene and the incredibly emotional ending. <br/><br/>The locations, too, helped make this an amazing film. From the chase scene in Istanbul-- which was one of the best I've seen in a while--to the towering heights of Shanghai; from the reinvented MI6 in London to the beautiful moors of Scotland, the sights are impressive throughout. Equally as impressive is Roger Deakins' cinematography, which was truly stunning and made the film all the more beautiful. <br/><br/>Skyfall truly is one of the year's best films. It may lag a little bit in the middle, but that's only a minor fault as it hurdles towards the climactic ending. One of the best parts for me, actually, was finding out the meaning behind the title, and, however subtle it was, it was a great moment and perfectly integrated into the plot line. <br/><br/>This is now a different Bond. I'm sure the writers realized what they were doing when the made one of the major themes resurrection, as after the alright-but-disappointing Quantum of Solace, Bond needed to be reinvented--again. They have made some sacrifices, but ultimately succeeded. This Bond is modern, but true to how the books make him appear. There are also some great references to older gadgets, like the exploding pen and ejector seat, although they don't necessarily feature in the film. Bond nowadays is more about ingenuity rather than gadgets, and he is all the more realistic and impressive for it."
"tyler-harrell","10","19","40","9 November 2012"," The Best of Bond!
","""Skyfall"" is unlike any James Bond movie you've seen before. While the film pays homage to the previous installments, first-time Bond director Sam Mendes reinvents the superspy's story, taking him into far darker territory. The result? Arguably the most well-crafted and thrilling film in the franchise's 50 years.<br/><br/>This time around, Bond -- who has been publicly pronounced dead but remains in hiding after a botched mission -- is brought back to ""life"" to recover a hard drive from a cyber terrorist named Silva (Javier Bardem). While his mission seems simple, loyalties are questioned between Bond (Daniel Craig) and his superior M (Dame Judi Dench), for she might be responsible for the previous near-fatal mission. And while M is hiding secrets of her own, she's also the target of Silva, who will stop at nothing to bring her and MI6 to their demise.<br/><br/>When ""Casino Royale"" was released, Craig immediately jumped to top of everyone's favorite Bond actor list for his grounded, man's man portrayal. He's got the chops with his physicality, sexual machismo, and cool demeanor. So what's left to develop? ""Skyfall"" presents Bond as an aging and wounded soldier, who doesn't blame the organization for his pain but rather accepts it as part of the job. Revealed to be an orphan, Bond seemingly continues to function as if MI6 is his family and M as his mother.<br/><br/>Dench paves the way as the true Bond girl of the film. Strong-willed and determined to get the job done, M's quip-filled scenes with Bond explore their professional yet symbiotic relationship that's based on trust and mutual respect. For Bond, it's not about his service to her Majesty, but rather filling the void in his otherwise empty soul. For M, she may come across as cold and manipulative, but like Bond knows the stakes of the game they are playing.<br/><br/>It's hard to discuss ""Skyfall"" without mention of its memorable villain, Silva. After delivering a chilling, award-winning turn in ""No Country for Old Men,"" Bardem gives another standout performance as the bleached blonde, impeccably dressed terrorist. Like every Bond villain, quirky mannerisms and odd physical traits are present. He's playful at times and whimsically sadistic at others. Like the rest of the film, Silva's motivation feels more believable than previous villains as he simply wants revenge on those who wronged him rather than being hell bent on world destruction.<br/><br/>The man responsible for delivering us such a thrilling entry to the series is none other than Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes (American Beauty). I was shocked to see that his new approach to the material isn't necessarily out with the old and in with the new. Mendes gives plenty of winks and nods to all the Bond classics: the cars, the girls, the gadgets, the exotic locations, the dry one-liners and the occasional over-the-top stunts are all present. He even resurrects the old but familiar character of Q (Ben Whishaw), to provide some comedic relief and self deprecating humor to the series.<br/><br/>But what Mendes does differently is that he presents the story as if it were actually a real world scenario. The atmosphere is dark, the drama is amped up and the characters feel real. The icing on the cake is cinematography. The action sequences are crisp and coherent and will literally have you jumping out of your chair. And whether it's the neon skylines of Shanghai or the grey skies of London, the shadowy landscapes set the stage for a bleak espionage-filled world. And also worth noting is the obligatory opening credit sequence that visually arresting and equally haunting with Adele providing vocals.<br/><br/>Mendes' approach to Bond will be undoubtedly compared to Christopher Nolan's Batman redux, both humanizing established material and presenting it in a sleek and stylish way. It's just a shame for future entries because the bar has just been raised high. Not only is this new Bond entry the most thrilling and emotional to date, but it is responsible for bringing new energy and excitement into a franchise that doesn't seem to quit ... just like the central character."

","If anyone reads this: please don't watch this movie, it's not worth your time or your money, and I'm serious. Let me provide a short list that could explain to you why.<br/><br/><ul><li>The plot lacks common sense, actually whoever wrote this script should be shot immediately: the whole story is based on the fact that a list of undercover agents went missing (this idea has been overused in spy movies since Mission Impossible anyway). The funny thing is, that in the end, the viewers were never told what happened with the disc...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The 'Bond girls' look too thin, and they are uninteresting, except for the best looking one: but she is on screen for only 10-15 minutes or so, and she dies when you'd start to think she's be involved in the story further. Shame...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>James Bond looks old, which they did on purpose of course to show that the world evolved since the ages of cold war / secret service etc. but they overdid it a bit.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The villain, played by Javier Bardem, had no chance to evolve/develop and turn into a character worth remembering: he only had a couple of scenes where he had a conversation with someone or talked at all. And oddly he reminded me of the Joker from the Batman series sometimes, with his laughs and funny faces, but again, the whole thing looked forced and lacked life.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>James Bond used to dislike M, his boss, and declined her orders in previous movies. Now he's not only trying to save her, but he started to look at her like she was his own mother or something. She died in his hands, and Bond was crying... Bond went completely emo.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending with the battle at the old house from Bond's childhood lacked any sense. The bad guys go straight into the house without any care for traps? Bond and company using old shotguns, rifles, whatever against a helicopter with machine guns? Really? Then when M and that old guy escape in the tunnel and return back to the surface they use flashlight just to be noticed in the dark instead of trying to escape unnoticed? When Bond escapes through the tunnel why did he leave to door open? Let me guess: so that he has to outrun the blast of the explosion, right?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ralph Fiennes had like 10-15 minutes on screen, and played only a minor role. I don't blame him, he shouldn't have been involved in this movie at all.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No 007 gadgets, no real humor, forced jokes, and uninteresting conversations all over this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There were some nice views/landscapes in the movie, but they were showing them for too long, like we were supposed to be amazed, and not focus on the boring story.</li></ul><br/><br/>If they were trying to kill this franchise once and for all, if that was the real goal of making this movie, I think they did a great job. I saw potential in Daniel Craig as James Bond in 'Casino Royal', but ever since then, both of his Bond movies were garbage. (Needless to say, this is not even comparable to Casino Royale, of course.) Daniel Craig just proved us that he's one of the most boring James Bonds ever.<br/><br/>After the lights turned on in the cinema, and I looked around, I haven't seen one smiling face or satisfied moviegoer. By the way, in the final seconds of the movie, it said that James Bond will return shortly. Well I hope this Bond won't."

","I check out reviews here at IMDb for many years now and it really shocked me to read that critics and some fans here liked this bond movie! I have seen all bond movies more than once and after watching quantum of solace i said to myself that the bond series just cannot get worse, but after watching skyfall i am sorry to say that it just did, i have no idea how they made such a bad movie but they just did! You can just enter and read some reviews that people have written here at IMDb saying how awful it is, they are all correct! In general let me say that the movie is to long, the script is full of goofs (you don't have to be smart to notice them), there are just countless mistakes throughout the entire plot, and the worse thing is that it is not really a bond movie, there is no glamor, no finesses, no sophistication or imagination what so ever and the scene that ends the movie is just plain silly, not reliable even for a movie that's suppose to be A fantasy thriller, it's actually embarrassing how uncreative the production cast was. A last comment, I do not understand why craig is receiving so many compliments, i doubt that he himself believes it as so far he is arguably the worse bond there ever was, the worse! And that says much doesn't it?!"

Only in Skyfall the intro comes to the end thats good, but what about in Quantum of Solace and in Casino Royale? Its gone.<br/><br/>And when began 007'agents to get superman power? He fell from tall buildings and bridges and stands up again and keep fighting! That is not realistic at all, specially when he got shot and fell of the train, that was quiet disappointing. And in Quantum he fell down many stairs and landed on the hard floor, but there to! Up and fight again, i mean that Bond have lost his character. And Q doesn't even show off all his new gadgets??? What happened to all the good old stuff? I mean that the new directors should go back in the next Bond film, the 24'rd should be Ian Flemmings James Bond. Don't need to go back to the very, very old Bond. But keep his character and his good jokes in hold and the intro. With license to write i say. We who want the old 007 Back!"

","The movie was fantastic about 3/4 of the way through the movie. The last quarter its like the writers gave up. Seriously the head of MI6 and a top agent need to go and isolate themselves in a house out in the middle of nowhere in order to avoid a small terrorist group?! They're MI6 they have the full force of NATO behind them! Even if they do decide to use themselves as bait MI6 was aware of their location THE ENTIRE TIME. They couldn't have dropped some troops or supplies off; maybe have them wait in the tunnel to ambush Silva's troops?! Furthermore the antagonist Silva became extremely inconsistent in the last quarter. He could have killed M at any time in the beginning and when he went to the courthouse he intended to kill only her. Then he decides he wants to kill himself with her... what the hell? You know what would have made the movie fantastic? Have Silva kill M at the courthouse, creating a very dramatic low point for Bond believing he is washed up, then MI6 bands together to kill Silva before he unleashes some terrible plot against the country that turned its back on him."

"Aidanak47","4","14","28","16 November 2012"," Skyfall - The emasculation of Bond
","I will focus mainly on the story. Story is the most important factor because even if an American pie movie has perfect cinematography and an inspirational score it still remains a American pie movie. So we start out adventure with Bond chasing after a goon who stole a list. Remember the days when Bond could go into a building, kill fifty goons, and burst out in a tank? Those were the days... nowadays however he has trouble killing one goon without having an elaborate free running competition. So naturally Judi Dench makes the smart choice of not trusting an agent who has proved himself trustworthy time and time again and instead places her faith with the woman who proved herself incompetent in the first five minutes. Bond jumps into action when he hears the secret service headquarters has been bombed. But Bond's an old dog now. He's over the hill. He's up for retirement. Despite the fact that he looks exactly the same as when he got his 007 promotion. He goes through an evaluation where he is found to be apparently unfit for duty and become an alcoholic. After all Bond needs more flaws! <br/><br/>I certainly won't deny that Craig can pull off a dark gritty Bond. However he still lacks the thing to make him a true Bond. He has no charm. Don't even try to deny it. Connery, Brosnan, Moore...they had a charm which always had you rooting for Bond. When his actions fell into the morally Gray you still wanted him to win because the man had a charisma that just had to be admired. I see Craig trying to sweet talk a girl but find my suspense of disbelieve breaking. I am sorry Craig. You don't have the voice and looks to pull it off. This feeds into Bonds character and we find it makes him less sympathetic. In Casino Royale this was somewhat forgivable. In Skyfall it has no excuse. I have not seen quantum so this may be an incorrect judgment however I noticed that Bond doesn't seem to be winning lately. Most of the time things just happened to work out or he got a helping hand rather than use skill and wits to win the day. Our new Q makes a comment joking about an exploding pen while giving Bond his only two gadgets. I don't quite remember Sean Bean laughing when that exploding pen ruined his plan and saved London from being incinerated but hey, what's that compared to a gun only you can shoot and a tracking device used to catch a man that wanted to be caught? Bond loved that gun so much that he forgets to pick it back up after it was dropped. And getting your own computer system hacked. Oh Q, you sure showed up those old baboons who believed that laser watches were actually useful. <br/><br/>Speaking of the villain. First time he does when he pops on screen is feel up Bond. This lead to a line which caused my eyebrow to shoot up. You already destroyed his creditability as an agent so why not call his sexuality into question as well? While I am sure this line was just jest I know it will be used to justify many theories regarding Bond's relationships. Maybe those women were all just appetizers for his afternoon sausage. Hell maybe he was actually getting off on that whole Casino Royale torture scene. Alright, I am getting sidetracked. After capture the villain reveals his motivation. The torture Judi with her old sins and kill her. Doesn't seem to pick up that Judi doesn't care very much about that. And his master plan is revealed. The evillest man who is madness incarnate, pure genius and according to the part time Bond girl ""Fear itself"" is going to....walk into a courtroom and shoot her. I mean sure previous villains also had moments of stupidity but at least they put effort into their plans and didn't give up halfway. Can't even wait five minutes to see if the best secret agent can escape a frozen pond. Well in the courtroom our Judi is getting lectured by some girl who seems to believe that the golden age of espionage is over and with technology no one can really keep things secret any more. So that makes the secret service redundant apparently. Of course it's up to Judi to point out the obvious and say that if a terrorist planned to chuck a nuclear missile in London's general direction then maybe he might not tweet about it. While she's at it she says a poem for the trailers.<br/><br/>After Silva forgot to put more than one bullet in his gun and leaves, Bond decides the smartest thing to do would be to take Judi to somewhere completely isolated. Here we get the thing no Bond fan ever asked for. His childhood back-story. Where we learn that James is Batman mixed with Jesus. However unlike the messiah, James decided his destiny was to shoot people and bang chicks. Wow, and all this time I thought he was an ordinary guy who worked hard to gain his position but in actuality he was the chosen one. Isn't that wonderful? Well James seems to give a damn about his past as much as we do. The last parts of the film are anti-climatic with the villain being defeated because he wasn't patient and Bond's cheap shot. Then we come to find that once again, Bond has failed. The film brings in a new M and a new Moneypenny and we see a callback to those old bond films you spent making fun of the last two hours. Props to M not getting on to Bond about why he brought his predecessor to an area she could be killed easily without telling anyone. I find it odd to celebrate Bond's 50 with a movie which is so mean spirited with the franchise itself."

","These have been patriotic times for the UK. The Diamond Jubilee. The Olympic Games. I went along with it, you'd have to be a curmudgeon not to. Or Morrissey.<br/><br/>But Heaven Knows, the new film Skyfall has me getting how our miserable pop star feels. I just can't buy into it. The applause given to this series' longevity seems a bit, well, Trigger's Broom. If you recall the gormless road sweeper from Only Fools and Horses, 'Thirty years I've used this broom! I've changed its head three times, and its handle four times...' Which means, of course, that it's hardly the same broom, is it? To me, these films don't stir the same feelings they did when I was a kid. Why should they, just because they feature a character with the same name in it? The first two Jason Bournes, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill Volume 1 - these get me going the way the old Bond films used to.<br/><br/>The phrase 'Only in a Bond film' once referred to the quirky, the classy, the bizarre, traits that lifted the series above other films.<br/><br/>But now the phrase means something very different.<br/><br/>Only in a Bond film would the 'hero' leave a fellow agent to his death to obey orders from his superior, and it's like we're meant to admire him! Craig's Bond disobeys his boss whenever it takes his fancy, but not in this case. We have a name for a bloke like this in England - jobsworth. Maybe that could be the name of the next Bond film, sung by Adele: <br/><br/>Jobsworth! / Get the T-shirt / From the foyer / That'll be another 15 pounds please... <br/><br/>Okay, we soon forget this as we're in a chase and there's some good banter going on, but only in a Bond film do I find it just a bit hard to hear the dialogue, as it's been since Die Another Day, it's just a bit muffled. Is to put the audience on the edge of its seat? Only in a Bond film does the hero slam into another car so it goes crashing into a bunch of 'natives', oh it's okay, he's British and they're not, who cares? Contrast later when you see just how polite and solicitous he is with Brit commuters on the Tube.<br/><br/>Only in a Bond film will the hero smash the bike he's riding into bridge hoping to somehow get thrown onto the train, rather than just pulling up to the bridge like you or I would.<br/><br/>Only in a Bond film will the lead actor move like a crab and no one really cares - it's cool! If you ever watched Octopussy and thought what the film needed was General Orlov in a fight on the speeding train in West Berlin, you're in luck, cos that's just how Craig looks in this scene.<br/><br/>Only in a Bond film would we get all this tripe about what a wonderful song Adele has come up with. It's not a good tune really, you wouldn't look at it twice if it weren't a Bond song. It's lushly produced, just as the film looks good, and some are fooled by window dressing.<br/><br/>Just as Sam Mendes' The Road to Perdition looked great, had ambition but just didn't move along, so it is here. These directors shouldn't be let near a Bond film. As with Marc Forster, who did the last one, I sense a slumming it vibe, as if to say, well, if this doesn't make sense who cares - it's only a Bond film.<br/><br/>This is the Craig and Dench show. Both their characters are talked down - with total justification! They both seem to be idiots. Craig is said to be old and past it - only two films back they were trying to make out he was the young kid on the block! He's only been on two missions, or only two we've seen. This is one way the film tries to tap in to Bond's iconography at the expense of him as a real person.<br/><br/>I think the nadir is when he cockily says he can save the trapped girl in Shanghai. Righty-ho! Sneaks on her ship, easily done. Walks naked into her shower before saying hello. He thinks he can just show up on his own to meet the villain. It starts to feel like The Man with the Golden Gun at this point, in terms of general believability.<br/><br/>CGI buildings on the island, like The Expendables 2.<br/><br/>When the helicopters show up to rescue Bond there's this daft jubilant bit of brass! Like, hey ho, he's safe! No matter the girl he went out to save is, er, dead! Only in a Bond film would the actress get so much publicity for screen time that amounts to what, about 10 minutes? The problem here is a subtext. The writer seems to be saying, hey, M is Bond's Mummy substitute! By taking her back to his own family home, her death allows him to grieve for the first time his parents' death. Seen in that way it's sort of clever, it's only as a straight narrative it's drivel.<br/><br/>Of course, the fans have plenty of reasons to explain away these plot holes (and there are too many to list); though you feel like you're arguing with the Tea Party. Or they say just go with it, there have been plot holes in plenty of Bond films. Well, up to a point, but those movies were fun comedy thrillers. Craig's Bond pitches itself as grim, realistic. I don't want to fess up to being a Bond fan when it means applauding the kind of rubbish we've been fed for the last decade or more. They say patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel, it's also the last refuge of the rubbish filmmaker."

However, I am still stunned at the level of completely unwarranted hype this mess has been getting. There are literally so many things wrong with this film it is mindblowing. I'm all for suspending my belief in films like this but not in almost every single scene and storyline, which as it happens have all been ripped off from Batman and Bourne. Again, I appreciate that most films just recycle the same old stuff but at least most films make an effort to appear original, Skyfall does not. How on earth is this film is getting a rating as high as 8.1 at this moment in time ? Complete trash. Don't waste your time or money!"

","I could witter on for hours about this! I knew Skyfall movie was being hyped stupidly but nothing could prepare me for this sort of disappointment. I loved Casino Royale and like most Bond fans I was dismayed with QoS but for me Skfall is even worse. Trying to do this concisely...<br/><br/>BAD: Opening chase scene from the midpoint - too drawn out removing any suspense = boring. The new Moneypenny, Naomie Harris = wooden as a tree trunk. Wafer thin plot. Zero suspense. Bardem woefully underused. Bardem's silly hairdo. Craig's stupidly tight suit.s Appallingly obvious stuntman in rooftop bike chase scene. Skyfall Lodge is one of the worst sets I have seen in any movie ever. To say it looked like a TV soap opera set would be a complement, it was really really obvious it was a plaster set ready to be blown up! Fake fog at Skyfall Silly final scenes with everyone stumbling around in the fake fog for what seemed like ages. Entry of the helicopter with music just overplayed and ill conceived. Complete lack of understanding of IT and UI's Q's silly glasses and the geekyness just didn't work for me - miscast. Worst of all for any Bond movie is the total lack of glamour and escapism. If you cannot escape whilst watching a Bond movie then things must be bad right?! Some very bad sets generally. Poor continuity - Keep an eye on M's handbag...<br/><br/>Reintroduction of the DB5 was embarrassing and there is no way Bond would leave it for ages in a dusty old garage in London and to go back and find it immaculate. Just not well done at all.<br/><br/>GOOD: Berenice Marlohe was incredible in her portrayal of a terrified baddie's woman, one of the real highlights of Skyfall. Opening chase really good, digger on the train especially.y The yacht going to the bombed island was a tiny piece of much need glamour so so missing in Skyfall. Death of 'M' has to be a good thing and it was quite well done Craig did his best to save this movie even in the Norman Wisdom suits! Final scene with Bond looking over the rooftops of London was great albeit a homage to dark knight looking over Gotham cit.y<br/><br/>All in all a very weird movie and no amount of positive reviews will make me think otherwise"
"hans-wind","4","16","33","11 November 2012"," Enough is Enough
","One morning later I'm still deeply disappointed about the latest Bond adventure Skyfall. I don't want to repeat what other users already wrote. It's not a single scene, the whole movie feels wrong. They just cram too much in, the identity crisis of Bond, that he becomes a drunk, the mother son theme, the aging hero versus the new technology, the hard action scenes and the hopeless attempt to rescue some minutes of the old school Bond. The plot itself is very week. A highly skilled bad man wants to kill M (sometimes). In order to do so he let Bond capture him together with all his resources. Of course he breaks free thanks to the master plan stored in his PC. Both heroes' then start a fight of who can behave more illogical until it comes to a showdown in a place called Skyfall. In the same way as the plot tries to put too much in every single scene does. There is for example one where in Bond's childhood home the housekeeper points to a hideout where Bond spend the time after his parents were killed. Of course you can add something like that, but it needs introduction and follow-up. The movie does nothing of that. The recipe of the movie is clear, mix the Badman franchise with the Bourne franchise. Both of the latter are great, made with determination, paying attention to details and introducing new ideas. Skyfall or the last 2 Bond's in general are just lame copies put together sloppily. One should also talk about thinks that are missing in the movie. There are no beautiful locations; there is no love, no sex, no style, no Bond girl in general. Istanbul the pearl they made a slum and my beloved and stunning Scottish highlands look empty, cold and gray. And so does the whole movie. Bond needs a fresh start. There will always be a place for Bond because he is in so many of our hearts. But first and for all Bond must be Bond."

","The 50 years of Bond stuff is funny and obviously done with a lot of love for Bond. Some scenes are brilliant and most of the time this is a good Bond if you'd watch it scene by scene. What makes it just a 4 Star movie is a plot that could carry a 30 minute short film but not a more than 2 hour feature. About halfway through it become predictable to the point of absolute boredom. In addition the path from one major plot part to the next is always heavily constructed and never feels organic and right. Its been a long time for Bond to face an evil genius villain played so brilliantly. Its a shame that performance is wasted on a plan that is about as exciting and new as dr.

","Ian Fleming would be quite proud of this fast paced, down to earth, yet larger than life Bond movie. Skyfall shows the more human side of Bond, which is something that is rarely seen outside of his drinking habits and taste in women. Daniel Craig shows that he's not only got the swagger and brute-force to be Bond, but also the fatigue and never-give-up attitude that comes with being a more tested and human Bond than any other actor has been able to do before. Is he the best Bond ever? I say so. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem puts on a masterful show as Silva, a true Bond villain who's brilliance is only matched by his unflinching cruelty. This potent combination of brawn and brilliance makes Skyfall the most relevant and personal Bond in years, and everyone, from causal fans to die hard Bond fans like myself, can thoroughly enjoy the it's excellence. There are 4 words that can sum up one of the best movies of the year, and my personal favorite Bond movie of them all: welcome back, Mr. Bond."

","Being a huge Bond fan, particularly the last two films, and reading the never ending good reviews I was expecting something epic.<br/><br/>Maybe this high bench mark has somewhat biased my opinion but instead of the best bond film ever, I found Skyfall to be one of the worst.<br/><br/>Basically it's boring, there's nothing new, and seems to be a swan song for Bond rather than a celebration of all that makes it great!<br/><br/>It starts out good, then suddenly becomes the slowest paced Bond film, and nothing but a rehash of old story lines. Once again an old MI6 agent has gone rogue. Once again someone has a personal vendetta against M and wants to kill her for a judgment call she made in the past.<br/><br/>One good thing about the film is, besides a stop in China for a stylish Kill Bill style assassination, it takes place in the UK.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is the best thing in the film but I think he's on screen maybe 15 minutes.<br/><br/>It starts out being about a missing list of agents, a la Mission Impossible, but the plot loses it's way and becomes an very overly complicated revenge plan to kill M and equally overly complicated and stupid plan to evade it. <br/><br/>I think what disappointed me the most was the constant references to how old and useless Bond has become. He's off work for 3 months and comes back suddenly as a 70 year old that can't shoot. MI6 is constantly said to be old and unneeded, isn't this in the same world with constant media hysteria about the threat of terrorists and need to more and more national security? Isn't there two more Daniel Craig Bond films after this, as it seemed like a curtain call film more than anything else.<br/><br/>The baddie we are told is a psycho, extremely dangerous and most importantly a master with technology. But Technology is hardly used at all and not really featured. There was a lot more in the last film or the ones with Pierce Brosnan.<br/><br/>Finally the big twist (don't worry I won't reveal it) is really obvious.

","This is a dark Bond film but not as gritty, sophisticated, and elegant as Casino Royale. It's been a big let down since the reboot of Casino Royale. Quantum of Solace and Skyfall are just awful. There are so many flaws in the plot and the Bond feeling just isn't there. The storyline overall is a very cliché and I've never been so bored from watching a Bond movie. Craig makes a great Bond and Casino Royale is easily one of the best Bond movies. But I think they've been just hiring the wrong directors since then. The cinematography is great but the direction isn't clear, action is subpar and the character development (especially the villain) just isn't there. They might need to bring back Martin Campbell to revive the series. I have no idea how the heck this movie got so many positive reviews from so called professional critics."
"grandmastersik","4","13","26","25 July 2014"," Worst Bond ever
","Completely unwatchable - that's how I'd describe this.<br/><br/>Many may have been conned how to think by the mass advertising, but to even call this mess a ""Bond"" film is an insult to the series... which has had a few stinkers and more than its fair share of cheesy moments.<br/><br/>Skyfall starts out at a pace to rival Crank and while those with brains may have been confused as to what the hell was happening, before I knew it, our dour-looking hero was sitting back watching hit men kill innocents with a sniper rifle before choosing to dispatch them.<br/><br/>But it gets worse: the wafer-thin few lines of dialogue that hinted at something resembling a plot then saw Bond exchange words with some model-cum-triad's moll, kill her bodyguards, and then sneak up on her NAKED whilst she showered, not to hear cries of rape or even an exclamation that he's still alive, but for her to part her legs before - one would presume - his irresistible sullen charm wowed her like pheromones brainwashing a bitch in heat! I had to turn it off.<br/><br/>Sure, Roger Moore and Sean Connery were ridiculous (and Moore was plain sleazy), but at least we saw them seduce the women. This new dude just turns up while they're in their birthday suits and, knowing that if he can kill three bad-arse villains she'd stand no chance, the women submit to his will.<br/><br/>I'm a man and I found this sexist.<br/><br/>So, without a real storyline, stupid action scenes that feel as if they're there ""for great justice"" and with a very depressive-looking Bond of questionable morals and judgement leading the charge, I can honestly type here now that this is THE WORST BOND EVER.<br/><br/>And yes, that includes the steaming pile of dog turd that was Quantum of Solace."

","Film critcs raved that this was a return to form -- a classic Bond film. That wasn't my take on it. Casino Royale beat it by miles IMHO. I found it a disappointment.<br/><br/>The visuals were terrific for the most part but the plot was clichéd and full of holes. I understand that Bond films are by nature fantastical but the longer this film went on the less fantastical and the more dull/ridiculous it became.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig's face looks like an immovable bag of spanners throughout whilst Javier Badem's bad blond dye-job simply does not work -- especially when dressed as a policeman. Who thought that was a good idea??? Where were the Bond babes? Eve didn't cut mustard and the other woman was like blink and you'll miss her. The only scene that sizzled ended up being the homo-erotic interrogation but they didn't have the balls to pursue that strand so instead we got more bunkum like ueber English Judi Dench quoting Tennyson and Albert Finney's Hoots, Mon, there's a moose loose about this hoose Scottish Caretaker.<br/><br/>It just didn't work for me."
"Ashwani_Kumar","8","13","26","15 February 2013"," One of the best of Bond in last 10 years
","Craig Daniel has dropped the larger than life image of Bond. This is amply clear in this movie at least. Gadgetry used is also not making him a superhuman. I find this better than those movies where machines used to work more than the human 007. Movie also takes into account the new development of world - the digital dimension of warfare ! And the good part is - suddenly Bond does not become a network's wizard. there's another guy to help him out here. I am expecting the next Bond-movie to have more on this stuff. But Overall, a very good movie. For Indian viewers - you may find it much like a Hindi movie plot albeit very well made."
"will-schwartz","10","13","26","18 November 2012"," Welcome Back 007!
","After the depressing letdown of Quantum of Solace in 2008, I was really anticipating an amazing return to the way the James Bond movies should be. And Sam Mendes delivered it on a silver platter. The movie starts off in an intense chase scene between Bond and an unknown character. With M on Bond's radio, she mentions the villain having a list they need and immediately you're hooked. With the exception of the first chase scene in Casino Royale, this is my favorite chase scene in Bond history. In the first 5 minutes you already have action, great characters, and exotic locations, which are three things a Bond movie can't prosper without. The rest of the cinematic shots in the movie are the same, bringing more great cinematography and locations. In one particular scene, Bond is fighting one of Silva's henchmen in a pit with a Komodo Dragon. Now any action star like Bruce Willis or Tom Cruise would have unconvincingly wrestled this beast to the ground, but does bond do that? Nope. He casually hops on it's back and propels himself out of the pit. Classy James, classy.<br/><br/>The seriousness of the last two films are still present in this newest installment, but they are combined with the old classic one-liners of the days before Craig. This is by far my favorite Craig movie yet, because in this movie they take Bond no where he's ever gone before; to a personal level. Craig carries this change in character with ease and makes you believe Bond is getting rusty. He's no longer the man that can jump of cliffs and buildings and land like a cat. Now, he clumsily falls like any normal human being. This is also a very different bond movie for Judi Dench who is wrapping up her role as M in her seventh bond movie. She seems to cancel out the majority of the screen time that the bond girls would usually have and replaces it with her undying determination to stop terrorists from destroying her country. M is as much of the main character as Bond and she handles that well considering that in real life her lines are read to her because she can barely see. Javier Bardem plays Silva, who is a villain to stand next to Goldfinger and Blofeld, only he's ten times more terrifying. His role convinces you that he can kill anyone and feel no pain. Even when he isn't on screen your still worried by his ominous and creepy performance. His main conflict is with M however. He believes it is her fault that he became what his is and there is where his delusional, twisted plot lies. He is one of the few antagonists that are actually equal to Bond. Supporting characters such as Q (Ben Whishaw) and Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) carry important roles that needed to be filled and played them well and should be noted. The bond girls in this aren't very important to the main story line, but they both carry their smaller roles well.<br/><br/>The cultural and memorabilia references in this movie are worth mentioning as well. In many scenes, Bond, M, and the new Q. They talk about exploding pens, ejector seats, and there's even a shot in this that is almost taken straight out of one the early Sean Connery movies. They don't hit you over the head with this idea, but it makes the true bond lovers smirk from time to time. Overall, I only had one or two minor complains with this movie that nearly weren't enough to change my review at all. These only had to do with speeding up the plot a bit, but it wasn't a big deal considering Skyfall is already the longest Bond film, clocking at 2 and a half hours. In conclusion, I must say that Bond isn't one of those movies you'll want to see for the heck of it. It is intense, but amazing. It is action-packed, but witty. It is the true follow up to Casino Royale. Double-0-Seven reporting for duty."

"justicewillprevail","6","13","26","13 November 2012"," Passable, pedestrian but pathetically overrated
","Like the many other negative reviews out there, I went into this film with great expectations. Sadly, like many other Hollywood movies since, this one suffers from too much special effects budget coming from the scriptwriters' budget.<br/><br/>A rudimentary knowledge of computers would tell you some of the plot devices used, are simply not possible (such as evacuating an island overnight, since Hurricane Sandy couldn't do that either). Others, like bringing a sniper in to kill a person who has been led into an enemy lair, seem purely redundant.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, the 2nd act takes a page from The Avengers plot (which wasn't great either) and the finale brings revenge killing to ridiculous levels of unnecessary complexity. A simple bullet, explosive or missile, at any point, would have sufficed.<br/><br/>Passable, pedestrian but pathetically overrated by whatever bots are pumping up the reviews. Watch this if you like mindless movies, yet have the mental fortitude to make it through more than 2 hours of drivel."
"trnjamesbond","2","13","26","12 November 2012"," The Names Bond, Mumbles Bond!
","I was very excited to see a new Bond flick. I went on a Monday so the crowds would be lower, but even still, the theatre was still almost full from with true Bond fans.<br/><br/>It started off pretty exciting, with the classic theme in the opening shot. You really didn't know what was happening as Daniel Craig walks down the hallway carrying his PPK. As I moved through this film, I was excited waiting for it to get better, but on the other hand after I got home I decided to write this review.<br/><br/>I really liked some of the aspects in this new instalment, but it just doesn't feel like a Bond film to me anymore, the whole serious Bond re-imaged version doesn't do anything for me. I kind of liked Casino Royale, it was a a different take on the franchise, but still, I think the ""Craig's"" Bond is a little too dark. Not cheery, silly at times, and exciting like the old films. I love the look of Daniel Craig as Bond, but I just don't like his character's style.<br/><br/>I find also that he seems to mumble and talk softly in a deep serious voice, half the time I have to think about what he just said. Everyone else around him speaks clearly, but when he talks, it's like listening to a person covering up their mouth with ones hand.<br/><br/>I have seen all Daniel Craig's other films and don't have a problem, but when he plays Bond, all I hear is blah blah Blah Blah blah! The Bond girls didn't feel like Bond girls, the villain Javier Bardem was not too bad, his little virus schemes were pretty cool, but that's also another down turn of this film, you would think the MI6 would be more intelligent in this instalment with the addition of Q, he acts like a computer genius but still doesn't realize that the Virus Hack that triggers all these situations is the fact of tracking the villain, So every time they crack the code something bad happens. You would think they would be more intelligent than this, it's the MI6! In the end I gave it a 2 out of 10, just for the acting, I'd say Quantum of Solace was better, and more entertaining.<br/><br/>Kind of sad for the 50th Anniversary. The action scenes were acceptable and entertaining, I had no feelings for the Bond girls, pretty plain and mediocre, Q had nothing to offer, It seemed all mixed up with technology, using prehistoric gadgets with new technology, the ending was also overlapping into the ""Connery"" years.<br/><br/>I don't feel that this reboot, re-image, whatever you want to call it is a good idea. Daniel Craig is a very great performer, but as Bond, he has the look, but no idea how to be him. I don't think it was his fault, I think that had to do with the writer. I know the original novels were more serious, but that's not the point, they filmed Bond all the way up to Craig's version as a spy that gets the job done, is silly at times, also can be serious.<br/><br/>I think that's what the studios want when they first took the novel and put it to film, they wanted something at the time that people would get. This Bond is just drowned out by all the other spy films of late, and will probably be forgotten. The Series has ran out of steam after Brosnan and will never be the same. But they try to re-invent Bond, well why fix something that isn't broke? The credits say ""James Bond will return"". I hope not, this re-image ruined it, and just makes me want to go back and watch the old films.<br/><br/>Also a downside is the fact that Bond doesn't save anyone in this film, he just doesn't get the job done. The Bond girl is killed stupidly and M dies. Pointless!"
"Stephenwright800","3","19","41","4 November 2012"," Very disappointing
","After the long wait and all the build up, what a disappointment. Story lines taken from Mission Impossible and Bourne, wooden acting by Craig, too much posing, and an intense focus on his age which made him more like Bruce Willis than the fit, sophisticated, charming and intelligent agent that we love. A lot of the problems come from Daniel Craig himself. While I have enjoyed Craig as Bond in the previous movies, he is too muscular for this one, and therefore too stiff. Brosnan would have played this story line better. There are certainly some great action sequences, a lot of stunning settings and some very funny one liners. There is also a wonderful twist to interrogation techniques! Ultimately, the key test for me with any film of this genre is the level of 'buzz' in the cinema at the end. There was none. I suspect that, as with Quantum, it will take a few viewings to appreciate the film but certainly a million miles away from 'the best Bond yet'."

Right from Direction,story,screenplay and most importantly the acting.Daniel Craig always looks in Anger and the expression doesn't changes.Apart from the starting scene there's isn't anything in movie. <br/><br/>I think this has to be three of the worst Bond movie ever.I really enjoyed Pierce Brosnan all bond movie and liked them too.Sean Connery being the Best Bond ever,i think Daniel lacks those Bond-ness.<br/><br/>The movie had some significance of Die-Hard 4.0 hacking concept and tried to made Javier Bardem(Raoul Silva) role as somewhat like Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" which they failed. Bardem is great actor with some great acts in movies like No country for Old men,Biutiful and that's what made SKYFALL somewhat watchable.<br/><br/>There were filthy gadgets shown in the movie,one that reads only Bond hand and second the radio which sends signal which army is in,so boring. In the end,Silva & Bond does barter system.Silva destroys Bond's car,Bond destroys Silva Helicopter.<br/><br/>There wasn't much action unless the traditional starting scene,even the last scene direction looks boring.Thankfully i was watching movie in morning show on weekend,so it didn't cost me much.<br/><br/>Advice:- Don't watch it on theaters,watch it at home if you have time or hardcore fan of Bond movie."

First of all, let me say this, the death of M is a big ugly step  towards the right direction. If you watched old Bond movies, you may  recall M used to be a mystery boss who wont even show his face, then  recent episodes had ""her"" becoming center piece of the story line. not  saying it derive the idea of making Mr. Bond as cool as possible, I  just cant see general audience interested in an iron fist old lady in  any kind of action movie, it doesn't matter how cool she is, oh, and  .... sorry to say this, but... Judi Dench is not cool.   Anyway, removing the element of M is a good corner stone for upcoming  007 movies, and the transition took whole 2 hours and 20 minutes.

"coreylikefeldman","1","15","31","25 November 2012"," Sexy women of Bond, or bound as sex slaves?
","James Bond films are iconic not just for adventure also for the beautiful bevy of Bond girls that act as sirens to our beloved 007. Skyfall has taken the newest profession of its featured Bond girl in this film to an all time low. The beautiful heroin is actually a victim of human bondage. This practice is repugnant enough, but to show case this exploitation of women as sexy; is blatantly disrespectful to all women, especially to those who suffer under these very real and very deplorable living conditions.<br/><br/>The audience quickly discovers that this damsel in distress; is actually and quite literally the branded property, of the antagonist in Skyfall. The heroic Bond promises the very terrified woman that he will avenge her captors and in the following scene successfully dukes it out with several of the antagonist henchman. In the next scene 007 slips comfortably into the shower with the woman in bondage and proceeds to sleep with her. <br/><br/>No woman alive can resist the charming allure of James Bond! This theme has been resonated in every Bond film since it's inception. There is nothing remotely attractive or heroic about sleeping with a sex slave! What's worse is that Skyfall does more than condone this horrific practice, but it glamorizes this morally irreparable and highly illegal trade of women and children. The audience learns that this siren has been in bondage since she was twelve years old.<br/><br/>This is cause for alarm and is something that affects millions of women and children every year. An occupation that is so cunning and omnipresent that it has roots in every community transcending the globe. These woman and children are bought and sold and exploited for sex. They have not entered into this trade by choice but are literally slaves sold to the highest bidder. <br/><br/>I'm not seeking to blame Hollywood for the woes of the world, but I am holding everyone involved in the decision making aspect of this film in contempt, from the; scriptwriter to the director, producer and studio honcho's who signed off on this. The many women of Bond have epitomized sexiness for decades. Bond girls are not supposed to be victims of human bondage!"
"rorge_retson","1","15","31","23 November 2012"," Not impressed
","Don't understand the high ratings for this movie. I found Skyfall to be predictable, boring, and sad in its roteness. So many plot points come out of the need to cater to the ignorant and slow viewer, it is unbelievable that this was made in a post-Bourne Identity world. (The Bourne Trilogy - it will remain a trilogy to me as I refuse to see the most recent potboiler - should have shown Hollywood that viewers have brains and appreciate a plot that requires small leaps of faith... unfortunately, this film insults, rather than has faith in the viewer).<br/><br/>Spoiler: For example, in the final sequence where Silva is looking for Bond, M, and Kincade, Finney's character uses a flashlight to find the chapel on Skyfall's property, when there is plenty of available light and no flashlight is needed. This makes it easy for Silva to find them when he is looking around to see if anyone has survived the blast. This was totally unnecessary. The writers could have easily just shown the chapel by itself, which would have been enough. These types of insults pepper the entire film. This should not have been a James Bond movie."

"dvc5159","8","10","19","8 November 2012"," ""He knows how to make an entrance.""
","The most iconic film characters have dark beginnings. So is the case of Batman, and so it is with James Bond.<br/><br/>""Skyfall"" is the 23rd official James Bond film, and could very well be one of, if not the, best one. We've come a long way from ""Dr. No"". Yes, Craig is still mostly brooding and tough, his steely eyes and cold voice resonates throughout the movie, but he portrays the character the way Ian Fleming intended it. Not unlike Timothy Dalton, but Craig is leaner and meaner, although some scenes of dry wit and humor do indeed make the cut. In ""Skyfall"" we explore his past and understand more why he has become the man he is.<br/><br/>The stakes are raised much more. Javier Bardem portrays Raoul Silva, a computer hacker/ex-MI6 agent, and what could possibly the best Bond villain since, I dunno, Auric Goldfinger and/or Franz Sanchez. Bardem's Oscar-winning performance as Anton Chigurh terrified me, and shades of it can be seen in the midst of Silva, but with more flair and uncomfortable, flamboyant glee. His only flaw was not having more screen time in the film than he had.<br/><br/>Judi Dench returns as M, the head of MI6. Unlike the previous six movies , M is given depth and resonance, played wonderfully and intensely by Dench that I actually cared for her and worried about the stakes at hand. You can see it in her that her past decisions have filled her up with guilt and she hides it all in despite her steely resolve, giving a new and fascinating depth to the character that will definitely make her more appreciated when I revisit the previous films. Along with Bardem, Dench steals every scene she's in with her superb acting qualities.<br/><br/>Nothing much to say about the other characters. I was wondering why Naomi Harris was underused, and then at the end of the film it hit me why. Berenice Marlohe, a stunning, seriously seductive and sultry beauty in true Bond girl fashion, too is very underused. Ben Whishaw steps into the role of Q the quartermaster. He's no Desmond Llewellyn but he definitely has some deadpan wit in him. Oh, and Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney (humorously) show up too.<br/><br/>Now this is why the film may not fare well with most Bond films. The film is, for the first time in a Bond film, directed by an Oscar-winner, Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"", ""Road to Perdition"", ""Jarhead""). The screenplay was written by Bond regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade along with accomplished Oscar-nominated screenwriter John Logan (""Gladiator"", ""The Last Samurai"", ""The Aviator""). You can guess where this is going. EON Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson did the right move hiring these crew of calibre.<br/><br/>Because, the film alternates between being a James Bond action/adventure, and being a character-driven Sam Mendes drama. Most people will not stand for this. At 143 minutes (the longest in the franchise) it might seem tedious and too talky for those looking for globe-trotting escapades. <br/><br/>But it worked superbly for me. This is the first Bond film where I truly cared for the important characters (007 and M; in Silva's case, dread) and their outcomes, and the decisions that define who they are and what they have become. This darker, more intense tone, I think, is probably inspired and influenced by Christopher Nolan's serious and brooding re-interpretation of Batman. I believe Mendes' strong, focused direction and the strong, well-thought out script by Purvis, Wade and Logan is to be credited for this. Yes, some plot points were kinda contrived, but Mendes' direction and the screen writing is so good, I forgive it for its flaws. I enjoy darker films too, so as long as the filmmakers know what they are doing.<br/><br/>It's not to say the film is low on action. Far from it. Mendes has proved himself to be a capable man of action. From a high-octane chase through Istanbul to a struggle in between neon-lit skyscrapers in Shanghai, from a race against time in London, to a sensational, jaw-dropping and emotionally intense climax in the Scottish hillside, ""Skyfall"" packs the thrills. And perfectly balances both it and the dramatics without either upstaging the other.<br/><br/>Of course, credit goes to the ever reliable Stuart Baird and his daughter Kate for cutting and crisply pacing the dramatics and the action perfectly and smoothly. The cinematography by the gifted Roger Deakins is hauntingly beautiful and stunning in scenes and is shaky-free, capturing the action in all their epic glory (I saw this film in IMAX, and I have to say, just WOW).<br/><br/>Last but not least, the music. British sensation Adele sings the title tune with her sultry voice, and it is a good song that is classic Bond. Series regular David Arnold does not return from this one, instead Mendes favorite and veteran Oscar-winning (there's that word again) composer Thomas Newman creates suitable themes for the sultry that would make John Barry proud, but when it comes to the action the music is engaging and Newman knows how to time it perfectly. It's the emotional and dramatic themes that strike a chord, though.<br/><br/>Is ""Skyfall"" everything I hoped for? Yes. And then some. I particularly loved how the writers and Mendes paid tribute to the classic Bond films. I did not expect it to be a searing character study as well. This film has brought James Bond back to life, no matter what anyone says. It's like getting to know your best friend's troubled past, yet respecting and still enjoying his tales for many more years to come. What Christopher Nolan did for Batman, Sam Mendes has certainly done the same for James Bond.<br/><br/>A perfect film to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the EON James Bond films. Bond is back. And Craig is here to stay.<br/><br/>Overall: 92%"

Then it added some new faces that I cannot wait to see again!<br/><br/>Daniel Craig's bright blue eyes (great body) and brooding demeanor are perfect for a man who has seen so much destruction as James Bond. That's why he's the best Bond yet. Big shoes to fill when he retires! But let's not think about that yet...<br/><br/>I say without reservation...see this movie.

If anyone is reading this, i won't ruin the surprise of his answer, or why the question was being asked. Go see the movie, and if you can, go see it on IMAx."

","Save a few action scenes this Bond movie is tedious and banal. No character development, poor pacing, and no real story to tell. Who directs a film like this anyway? I was all excited to see this film but I guess that's just good movie PR. The reality is Skyfall is a disaster. It's disjointed. I think someone had a few scenes in mind then worked backwards piecing together the plot. The result is terrible. Do not rush out to see this movie. In fact, I would not recommend wasting your time watching it on home video either. Even the writers must have been bored with it because they borrowed scenes from other movies. Do you remember Hannibal locked up in a clear circular cell surrounded by guards? Well the villain here is caught and put in the same cell. And yes he escapes too but this time he doesn't eat the guards on the way out. No explanation of how he escapes but then most scenes have no explanation. I hope Daniel Craig was paid well for this film. A few more like this and he can hang up his acting career. Overall a waste of time and money. Don't let it be yours as well."

I have never seen so many plot holes and idiotic, contrived twists in such an expensive production before. With so many brilliant screenwriters in Hollywood, one just has to wonder how they could screw this up so badly. The premise was cool, the execution terrible. Suspending disbelief is one thing, being asked to ignore your brain completely is another. Great job guys, the way this is going, the next Bond film will only be watchable by school children. Even the action scenes were boring, but that wouldn't matter, if the film wasn't riddled with so many ""Come on now, why?"" moments.

","One of the worst movies among the Bond series mostly because there are many parts of it that is beyond believable.. I found myself trying really hard to believe what was going on only to get disgusted with the absolute fantasy of so much of it. It's like Tom and Jerry. Bond could get run over by a car, and the directors will make him just jump back up and run again. Unbelievable story sequences throughout the movie made me cringe and want to leave the movie or throw something at the screen.. Bond using a earthmover on a moving train to bridge a separating train compartment. He gets shot at hundreds of times in close range and just gets minimally injured while bullet prints are all over his seat. While he climbs the earthmover's arm to reach the other side of the train, the villain withholds fire and just stands there watching it. Just plain dumb. He cuts himself to get at shrapnel and heals in 48 hours. He gets a bullet through his shoulder and then does martial arts against a completely uninjured villain. Then at the end a couple of gas tanks get blown up and it unleashes firestorm in his mansion. Then a helicopter smashes into the mansion and another humongous explosion - just so unbelievable - Hollywood over the top tricks that leaves the viewer more frustrated than anything positive. I would not recommend this movie to anyone... it's just a plain waste of time and poor direction."
"jdkraus","9","12","24","11 November 2012"," Bond continues to be the world's hero of entertainment
","James Bond has always been my favorite action hero. I have read most of the books and seen all of the movies. While the '06 release of ""Casino Royale"" revived Bond and ""Quantum of Solace"" proved a mediocre sequel, ""Skyfall"" gives Agent 007 a new clean slate. It holds a story of its own, pays homage to other Bond flicks, and introduces characters that all of us Bond fans have come to love over the past years. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig is back as Bond and once again, he embodies the soul of the man. He kicks ass, does the impossible, and even steals the hearts of some hot babes. Pure Bond. Judi Dench is perfect as usual as M. Ralph Fiennes, Naomi Harris, and Albert Finney give decent performances in their respective roles. Finney is particularly amusing. But in any James Bond film, the antagonist is what helps make the movie really memorable. Javier Bardem proves a true genius as ""Skyfall's"" villain. He plays a good psychopath (without relying on any reference to No Country for Old Men), and adds strong levels of flamboyance, wicked humor, and even devastating emotion. <br/><br/>It may seem a bit odd that Sam Mendes, a master of dramatic films like ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" would direct a Bond. Even so, Mendes does a stand up job of combining both character drama and stunning action sequences. In addition, his technical team helps him craft such a success. Thomas Newman delivers a lush score and Roger Deakins beautifully photographs each scene with care and precision. The only downer about this Bond is the overabundance of CGI. While some effects were photo realistic, others were blatantly awful. Agent 007 has entertained us as the world's greatest secret agent. And he has done so for 50 years. No other franchise has achieved such an accomplishment. Of 23 movies, ""Skyfall"" is one of the best. Let us hope that he continues to be our hero with installments of Bond 24 and 25."

"sean-devitt","4","14","29","27 November 2012"," Time for Craig to get out while there's still applause.
","After looking at the rave reviews I seriously wonder if I saw the same movie. This isn't all that good. Maybe critics are just relieved that it's easier to follow than QoS.<br/><br/>Poor Craig has landed the role of a lifetime but has once again been told to play Bond as a thug (sorry blunt instrument)jumping from fight sequence to fight sequence. Am the only one tired of motorcycle chases through crowds and fights on tops of trains? <br/><br/>I don't blame Craig at all. He isn't writing the script and he's just an actor being paid to do a job. I think it's clear he's not happy in the role and if reports of him wanting out are accurate (admittedly dated before the big box office of this movie)then I don't blame him at all.<br/><br/>The only acting he gets to do is when he's getting close ups and breathing deeply to show... some sort of emotional depth?<br/><br/>My other big problem with Skyfall is 'M'. Although I agree that Dame Judi Dench is a great actress I have always felt that she has been horribly written. The character always felt forced and tried too hard to show she was strong and ruthless but to me it always looked contrived and silly. <br/><br/>In reality she wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes as head of MI6. As well as routinely insulting, undermining and threatening her most loyal agent in every movie, she has also presided over MI6 HQ being blown up twice, got herself kidnapped, risked funding terrorism in Casino Royale,failing to get Le Chiffre, not knowing MI6 had been thoroughly penetrated by Quantum and risking her life in the field instead of staying at her desk in London and checking stuff! <br/><br/>For me the best part of the movie was when Mallory played by Ralph Fiennes (real James Bond fans will know who Mallory is) has the conversation with her that should have happened many movies ago!<br/><br/>In my opinion 'M' shouldn't be a character at all in the Bond universe. The characters should be 1) Bond 2) Main villain 3) Bond girl.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Skyfall is pretty much about 'M' (who shouldn't be a character but has been given one)and her relationship with Bond (who should be given a character but hasn't got one). <br/><br/>We have a villain in the form of Javier Bardem who seems to have drawn inspiration from Christmas Panto and the Joker in the Dark Knight. I guess they needed someone to light up the dullness and the nihilism of the reboot Bond.<br/><br/>Some have compared Skyfall to the 'The Dark Knight Rises' which I can see but Bond has always taken things from other movies. What does bother me is how they even stole whole lines from TDKR such as 'There's a storm coming'. It's not even subtle. <br/><br/>To say I found Skyfall disappointing is an understatement. Bond is not a character, 'M' shouldn't have been given a movie to herself and Javier Bardem looks like he's just happy to collect his paycheck and return to real acting in another movie.<br/><br/>At the moment this movie is getting great reviews but I think that time will not be so kind to this movie."

A James Bond full of mystery, tough... a perfect secret agent. Skyfall however almost shows a loser.. I don't want to see tears in Bonds eyes, or hear about his pathetic childhood. However, that's not what really disappointed me. <br/><br/>The plot did. I've read several user reviews and plot holes, so I won't mention them all, but a few that are TOO obvious or are not mentioned yet..<br/><br/>1. The capture of the operates list is not fully explained, why this is relevant? Even so, why will a super-villain, who can, in his own words, take down the economy of a country by his hacks, or who can access one of the worlds most technologically advanced computer-network with ease to create a gas explosion in the office of M (the only office with a gas-pipe-valve, which can be opened remotely), hire someone to steal a harddisk from a laptop, when he has access to the MI6 system?? <br/><br/>2. No one survives a fall, wounded and all, from such a hight.<br/><br/>3. When you cut out pieces of a bullet out of your body yourself,(which were in there some time, why not take it out sooner if it hurts), you will need SOME time to recover.

People want to watch bond using gadgets, blowing up stuff and charming women and stopping a villain causing some major catastrophe. But in this, the villain has weird goals.

"prospectus_capricornium","10","14","29","8 November 2012"," Just Got A New No.1 Bond Film!
","If I were to do a list of the greatest Bond films ever made, Skyfall would easily top that list. After several attempts to reinvent the character, Sam Mendes finally succeeded (not just in reinventing but most importantly) in bringing back the classic ""Bond"" back to life. While most moviegoers would expect the movie to center in action and suspense, Mendes triumphed in laying the greatest strength of this movie: making characterizations and themes co-exist alongside with the traditional action-packed nature of every Bond movie. I even had had the sense of watching a Christopher Nolan film because of what seemed to be a similar pattern that this movie trailed from start to finish, proving there's a lot more things to explore in Bond, and in Skyfall, Mendes proved what he can do more to raise the layers of the said character to a new high level, giving it renewed spice and flavor. Eventually, Sam's take on the said character was enough to pull Daniel Craig out of Sean Connery's shadow; Craig was finally able to define ""Bond"" in his own right and authority, without compromising the classic attributes of James Bond. Mendes's refreshing vision was able to give the franchise a whole new treatment without straying from the original essence and true spirit of ""Bond"", while also proving the saying ""the old ways are still the best"" ultimately true and in this installment's case, sensible. Some of the greatest shocker events in Skyfall were: the movie giving us hints of ""M""'s (Judi Dench) secretive past, Javier Bardem's comically ravishing portrayal of Raoul Silva (the main antagonist), and introduction of new characters like ""Eve"" ""Q"", which gave us glimpse of the characters we would surely see in the next installments. And while the presentation of Ralph Fienne's character (which is mysterious?), actually seemed insignificant from the beginning, it was actually proved wrong in the end, when the iconic role Judi Dench had played for seven 007 films, ""M"", was finally turned over to Fiennes, giving us hint of how vital Fienne's role would be in the next James Bond movies. Now Fiennes was left with the challenge of stepping out of Lord Voldemort's shadows (an iconic role he previously played in HP Series) and continue the legacy left by Judi Dench by playing the role of MI6 Head and Bond's commanding officer. <br/><br/>As for some flaws noted in the film, one could easily observe the absence of lots of girls, the intimate and steamy scenes we usually see in a Bond film and some predictabilities in later part (which couldn't be major and still tolerable). Ultimately, Skyfall's classical sense rested on delving on Bond's character—the invulnerability he also possesses —, the attributes that define Bond—his unmistakable charm, verve and intellect—, the escalated thrill brought by heart-throbbing action sequences, and the wonderful journey the cinematography of this movie brought us by capturing the exotic scenery of Istanbul, the magnificent night skyline of Shanghai and Macau and the breathtaking landscape of Scottish Highlands. Truly, Sam Mendes was able to give the movie the ""classic Bond feel"" while also introducing Bond in a ground breaking treatment people would easily find lacking in the previous entries in the franchise. And indeed, as the world celebrates Bond's 50th anniversary, Skyfall's milestones are just fitting and timely to top the celebration."
"DC1977","7","14","29","27 October 2012"," The best Bond film?? (MAJOR spoilers)
","First of all I want to make it clear, this is a good film but I was disappointed having expected much more after the rave reviews from many of the critics. In my review, I'm going to focus on these weaknesses and let others concentrate on the strengths the film undoubtedly has.<br/><br/>This definitely is not the best Bond film, I don't think its Daniel Craig's best Bond film either, I preferred Casino Royale. The problem is Skyfall tries too hard to be clever and includes too many elements in an attempt to please all the Bond fans.<br/><br/>It tries to include the classic one-liners, references to earlier films in the franchise, details of Bond's background whilst re-introducing the key characters that have been missing from the two previous installments and, on top of all this, setting the stage for the future of the series. The film suffers from trying to do all of these things perhaps as a 50th anniversary tribute to itself when it would have been better to have spread these elements over at least two films.<br/><br/>I've always felt the best Bond films had a comparatively straightforward and realistic storyline (this is why For Your Eyes Only is my favourite Roger Moore 007 film) and Skyfall avoids this by having a villain who is too far-fetched and cartoonish. Silva (Javier Bardem) is another version of The Joker from The Dark Knight. Ledger's character was a great success and the strongest part of what I felt was a mediocre film. It worked for me because I've never considered the Batman films to be taken seriously; it is part of a comic strip fictional parallel universe that allows these characters to exist without appearing out of place.<br/><br/>Silva just doesn't belong in the tough, realistic environment that the Bond films are now striving for. He is so reminiscent of The Joker both in his mannerisms and his actions (allowing himself to be caught and then escape as part of an elaborate plan) that he becomes a distraction. It is also completely implausible that a genius who can out-smart Q and the rest of MI6 would willingly follow M and Bond to a remote Scottish country home. Why would a villain who has clearly planned everything to finest detail then act so impulsively? The resulting climax, a Straw Dogs-like siege, is a disappointment.<br/><br/>I initially welcomed Judi Dench's departure from the series and then rolled my eyes in disappointment when her successor was revealed. I've never enjoyed her as M. She is undoubtedly an excellent actress and there is where the problem lies. Dench, rightly or wrongly, is a national treasure and it is inevitable that any act-OR chosen to play M will be making a more substantial contribution to the films. I've always felt that the character of M works best purely as a device for explaining the plot to an audience as Bond is sent off on his mission. Any further involvement whether it be additional screen time or the more personal angst and friction with Bond is both contrived and redundant. The best M was Bernard Lee, a gifted character actor who could be limited to a smaller, more effective role.<br/><br/>Now that Ralph Fiennes, another act-OR, is M, the opportunity to address this error has probably been missed. Audiences will be expecting him to be flexing his acting muscles as much as Dench did.<br/><br/>On a positive note, I had my doubts about the inclusion of a younger Q when it was announced but I was pleasantly surprised by Ben Whishaw's performance and I can see this continuing to work well in future films.<br/><br/>As for the new Moneypenny, I've always regarded her to be a secretary, an administrator, she is NOT a former field agent deployed to kill the enemy.<br/><br/>In the previous films Bond was always out of reach for Moneypenny, she knew it and so did the entire audience. How can the playful flirtatiousness work in future now that we know she's slept with him?"

The director is different and it shows (long pauses ,scenes which are quiet and with just dialogues, more character development for some characters while some seem woefully short, dark and bleak almost like a Harry Potter movie ), the music directors different and it shows as it has none of the classic Bond soundtrack being played in the background except about 3- 4 times,the title soundtrack is hardly used and many scenes are very very quiet). It was rumoured that Bond Franchise had financial problems with MGM,etc and it shows.Except for one chase in Turkey and 20 minutes in Shanghai/Macau there are no exotic locations,sets or for that matter even gadgets. You wouldn't be surprised if this movie is liked by the older generation as it resembles one of those 70s thrillers where one man takes on the system while being forced to go back to basics (ala Charles Bronson,Reynolds,etc). All in all it is a good movie although for me it is not a Bond Movie per se. I have no idea about the need to make Moneypenny black or introduce some gay elements to Bond/Villain exchanges! Naomi as future Miss Moneypenny is actually the brightest spark in a movie where Daniel Craig really looks old for a Bond role however why the need to tamper with something that is rooted with tradition? Regarding gay tendencies,maybe just a reflection of the Directors liberal streak.

I just want to say that the end scene (Bond at the Skyfall Castle) is so ridiculous and so flawed that it's laughable. It's Home Alone for Adults - AKA Home Alone 3. Sadly there is no Joe Pesci to liven the mood.

","Someone has decided to use my favorite fictional character to drive a plot he doesn't belong in.<br/><br/>Sure, the story of an aging professional woman coming to terms with the ethical sacrifices she'd felt compelled to make over a storied career sounds like an interesting one. You could tell that story by casting her in the role of metaphorical mother to two opposing sons, two outcomes, if you will. One good. One bad. Was her time on earth worth it? Were her sins forgivable? Has she engendered any loyalty? It all depends on which son wins the duel. Which of the two personified outcomes prevail would depend entirely on her objective worth in the world. Who will win? The good son or the bad? Both have reason to doubt her. Both fear and respect her. Both are defined by her.<br/><br/>Does this sound like a James Bond movie to you?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>Want to know why?<br/><br/>Because nobody defines James Bond but James Bond, that's why.<br/><br/>Because mothers and sons, family and regret, doubt and redemption are not what the 007 franchise was ever about or should ever be about.<br/><br/>James Bond movies are about what's possible when you subtract fear from the equation. About the value of knowing what to do in diverse situations. About all the intangible benefits of a little education and refinement. About how it's possible to act courageously and even violently without losing one's humanity or dignity. James Bond movies are about honor and duty, comradery and treachery, sex and decadence, greed and power, revenge and justice. They're about overcoming long odds through perseverance and cool-headedness. They're about the often unexpected shapes evil comes in, from the diabolical mastermind to the flattering seductress. They are about not allowing oneself to be impressed with evil, however monstrous its scope. It is escapist fantasy about living in the real world.<br/><br/>The joy in making new Bond films should come in adapting these themes to ever more modern sensibilities. Ever more modern circumstances.<br/><br/>'Skyfall,' the latest so-called installment in the 007 franchise feels as if it were written for someone's grandmother after a visit with a shrink. What does some aging mother's legacy turn out to be? Who gives a sh!t. I paid for a James Bond movie. You don't get to pepper a bunch of chase scenes into a film and expect me to let it pass as a Bond flick. No.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>In the present offering, we meet our protagonist, James Bond, hard at work as usual chasing some cat down who's boosted a hard drive that can expose secret agents all over the world. Better catch him! But because of a judgment call made by Dame Judi Dench's 'M,' Bond ends up shot and left for dead. She's sad but unapologetic. He's p!ssed enough to stay away from Mi6 HQ until it comes under attack by a master hacker named Silva, played by Javier Bardem. Bond comes in from the cold and proceeds to fail all the tests required to return to active duty.<br/><br/>Luckily, Mom's there to make it all better. This isn't my analogy, mind you; Bond actually calls her Mom or ""Mum"" throughout the film. She fudges his results for him so he can go run and play with the other boys.<br/><br/>There's so much wrong here I don't even know where to begin. Suffice it to say, James Bond does not miss on the shooting range. He just doesn't.<br/><br/>But the woeful ""humanization"" of the Bond character doesn't stop there. At various points in the film, he is taunted for his age by a lover, mocked as obsolete by a nerd (the new 20-something Q) and forced to feign homosexuality. <br/><br/>Seriously, who wrote this? It's not that he's challenged by friend and foe alike at every turn, it's that the challenges go largely unanswered. Bond as dumb lug who knows how to take his lumps like a good monkey boy. Ian Fleming is spinning in his grave.<br/><br/>Anyway, Silva's p!ssed at M and for good reason. No really, you'd be p!ssed and want to kill her, too. Honest to God, it was a total betrayal. M totally and willfully betrayed Silva and we're all supposed to just route for her on the grounds that that's just life in the intelligence business. Silva's just some weird gay guy with bad teeth after all and probably doesn't look nearly as good in a tailored suit as Daniel Craig. So who cares what his beef is. Right? Craig's the good son.<br/><br/>Are Silva's motivations explored further? Are the commonalities between Silva's and Bond's view of M's behavior explored? Are the ironies of the fact that the biggest new threat to the UK's national security arose directly out of M's leadership style explored at all?<br/><br/>No, no, and quite the contrary. In a scene remarkable for its lack of irony, M defends Mi6 to a governmental review board just as one of her own agents comes in to shoot up the joint.<br/><br/>The final confrontation between good son and bad plays out over about 45 minutes of retarded action sequences featuring Craig loping around in thousand dollar suits like a confused prom queen and bustling Mum off to the countryside to hide from the bad guys like a pair of useless weiners. If you've seen 'Patriot Games,' you've seen how this stupid movie plays out.<br/><br/>And last, but not least, Bond does not drink beer.<br/><br/>Vodka Martini, please. Shaken, not stirred.<br/><br/>You'll need one after this piece of crap."

","The problem with this movie is the storyline: very predictable, which makes the movie slow and boring.

Except for one very good flirtatious moment between the opposite characters and a few other good lines with Moneypenny this movie has no memorable moments. Without these, not even the good style of the movie can detract the attention from the weak plot. Lots of loopholes, useless scenes, ideas dropped half way the movie all these on top of the usual typically implausible Bond story.

For reference, the bond girl appears for a few scenes only, and no chemistry is developed. CGI quite poorly done on a couple occasions. Editing is poor, making even the classic Bond lines look silly. Opening credits and song - brilliant.<br/><br/>I would say Naomie Harris puts out the best performance of the entire cast - just the right combination of seriousness and playfulness. Judi Dench simply too serious for this movie, though her performance would have been great if the movie were a little more convincing. Daniel Craig - I would say it's a great Bond overall but doesn't have much material to work with here. Javier Bardem - great as well, but again forced into a character that is inconsistent along the movie. Nevertheless he does manage to create a little magic here and there. Q - quite charming until the technobabble which is of the silliest kind.<br/><br/>If I were to summarize, the movie manages to be it's own parody. A combination of ideas from various classic movies. One can enjoy it watching it like this, but it's too long for that. Try Johnny English and you will have more fun with that."

","The Bond franchise has deteriorated to nothing more than just a mindless action hero movie with this one. Bourne was better and so perhaps even Stratham.. The worst of the DC Bonds so far. No wonder Mme Dench called it quits... Where is the elegance, the intelligent and eloquent script, the ""tongue in the cheek"" one liners, the British humor? Fleming created a character from the real world of MI5/6 guys but expanded it to larger than life, crafty in every which way, outwitting his adversaries, seldom needing to revert to mindless violence and fiery explosions to achieve his goal. He had nifty gadgets from cantankerous old Q; a story in itself. Replaced by a nerd??? DC does not have that inherent quality of style and intelligence, he is all brute force and in this movie, comes out just about last in every physical encounter until the last ""stab in the back""; disgraceful 007!! Never hit a target with the trusty PPK. Destroyed the most iconic Bond car in the process at that. What a waste.."

Enough has been said about this by other posters so i shall not reiterate the points as to why this movie was terrible. The points are too many.<br/><br/>However what was even more horrifying was the fact that several modern critics actually liked it.

The very criteria of what defines a good movie has been thrown out of the window in favor of poor non-sensical script writing.<br/><br/>I've rated this movie a 3/10 for production, cinematography etc. If i was rating it in comparison to James Bond movies in general im afraid i would be hard pressed to rate it above a 1/10"

","I am a very big fan of Bond films and particularly of Mr. Craig. I still believe the best Bond was Mr Connery but Craig is the best in nowadays. Still, I was very disappointed with Skyfall as in my opinion it is the worst Bond movie since Craig came! Even QofS was much better. So the resume is simple, Skyfall starts nice with Istanbul and Shanghai, Mr. Bardem is prefect, but then it somehow turns into Home Alone in Scotland (WTF)! I hope this movie was just a preparation for the next movies to come. If not, I think it is the end of the franchise! The job done by Craig was not very impressive, Dench was poor, but Bardem saved it all. I would like to know where all the money for production went? I could not see it spent for the movie!"

","I consider myself something of a Bond (and movie) connoisseur. There are so so many things I hated about this movie. I was a little apprehensive when I saw all of the positive critical reviews. Do critics really ""get"" Bond? Let me begin.<br/><br/>Directing. I hated the pacing, the control of tension (or lack thereof). There were some good moments captured between the actors if you know what to look for, but I just felt the camera wasn't properly catching the energy of it.<br/><br/>The script/story: It was horrible. I saw somebody compared it to Dark Knight Rises. Yes that is true if a 1st grader wrote it after thinking Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises was awesome. They just used so many cliché plot devices, trying to be something they aren't. YOU AREN'T BATMAN, YOU AREN'T CHRISTOPHER NOLAN! You are writing for a James Bond franchise that has been around 50 years!!!!!!!! Please do what you are good at, instead of trying to copy the new kid on the block. I don't want to get into spoiler territory... but I have seen all the Bonds in the theater since GoldenEye and this as probably my least favorite. I could see the ending coming from at least 1+ hour away.<br/><br/>The acting: Good as always I must say. I liked the new Q. He was great in Cloud Atlas. (whoever he is, don't' feel like looking it up) Javier Bardem was great, but he was working with such a sub-par story. I did like the way he approached Bond from a sexually confused angle, that at least was new. But as a villain he just didn't have the je ne sais quoi of a typical Bond villain, and definitely not in the realm of someone like the Joker. We are to believe he is some villain with almost mythical abilities, but then he doesn't really exhibit that.<br/><br/>I could rip this movie for about an hour but I don't feel the need. Just at least after you watch it come back and give it the 1 star review. (if you agree of course). It seems like lately every time a big movie comes out you see nothing but wonderful reviews. Think critically! If you haven't seen it already, just wait and rent it. You won't be sorry. If you have any taste that is."
"mightypaco","3","11","22","30 October 2014"," Didn't like it the first or second time
","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>Seriously, I don't get it. The person I first saw this movie with and two other people at work defend this movie as a good movie and like it. I saw it in the theater and later on TV, wondering if I was in an odd mood when I saw it the first time. I wasn't. Here's what I didn't like about it both times I saw it.<br/><br/>1) First scene, Bond gets accidentally shot in the gut and fall off a train in the water. We have no idea how he survived, but then he appears alive later and in fairly good condition. Can we at least have some insight into his superhuman abilities? It just strikes me as unrealistic and a gap in reasonableness.<br/><br/>2) Next, the old menopausal bat that Bond takes orders from is entirely unapologetic that she gave the order for a different agent to shoot and accidentally kill Bond. She is not sorry for it, makes no apologies to Bond, etc. and does not even seem to care that he is alive or greet him in a friendly manner. She seems cold and almost upset with him and shows him zero warmness. She is a bulldog-faced old bag that I do not like or have any sympathy for. I find her to be butchy and annoying, yet in the latter half of the movie, all Bond does is try to save her. She doesn't deserve any saving! I can barely look at her face without hating her the whole movie. The movie basically says Bond is loyal to someone and an organization who couldn't care less if he is dead or alive and doesn't treat him well. I don't get it.<br/><br/>3) Towards the end of the movie, Bond falls through a frozen lake and fights with someone underwater for a long time. Then appears inside moments later to save the day, hardly wet and not cold at all or shivering with hypothermia. He just has a contented grin on his face, which strikes me as very unrealistic and stupid.<br/><br/>4) The old man in the house during the shoot out is supposed to be some bad ass, and I'm supposed to care. I don't. He's an old unimpressive man, and I just don't care. Also, if memory serves me, there are too many gun shots fired w/o reloading during the big bang up shoot out.<br/><br/>5) Bad guy spy removes his teeth and is transformed into some nasty looking face. It's just odd and feels unrealistic to me.<br/><br/>6) Much of the movie is dark and towards the end is a bunch of cliché explosions and shoot outs. It's just not terribly interesting and the plot just seems off and silly, not to mention the fact that Bond is saving the ass of an old unapologetic, unattractive woman, who should have retired years ago.<br/><br/>This is my first IMDb review, and that's just how I feel about the movie. It didn't strike a good chord with me, obviously, but I generally do like Daniel Craig."

"Completemerchantservice","5","11","22","22 November 2012"," James Bond loses his Mojo
","In discussion with other James Bond Fans, I heard we get a deep look into James Bond personality, inner traits, and his youth. I disagree and thought I would like to know more about James Bonds Thoughts, if that what the story was actually about. Even if the writers tried to deliver that message, they must me totally wrong about Bonds Attributes. The last real Bond was Roger Moore. The newer films just were poorly done. They painted Bond in Skyfall as a guy that will get very drunk, unsure of himself and questionable sexuality. I think the writers insulted Ian Fleming and should he be alive he would never of approved the script to pass. I thinks the writers might of used parts of their own personalities in Skyfall. so they can feel like James Bond based on themselves vicariously. <br/><br/>The writer left many questions unanswered and did a poor job connecting each scene to give the movie watcher a sense of smooth editing and being able to follow the storyline with our questioning the validity of each scene. The movie kept going off in different directions.<br/><br/>even though the film theme was meant to show how a Jullian Assaide Joker like character could hack into MI6. It was clear that even the theme was strange because why in the world would a ex spy with rich parents find an army of wacko's from batman to go along with a deranged revenge plot against M. It really was stupidly unrealistic. The deep hatred embedded in the soul of the Villain was present but awkwardly displayed. <br/><br/>The real James Bond ( Sean or Roger even George who I liked) their personality is unlike Daniel in Skyfall. No fault to Daniel. It's the writers fault. James Bond is suppose to be a respected Navy Commander, the top go to Spy at MI6. He is knowledgeable on many subjects and has a fun cocky way of showing it off. He's very classy, well dressed, elegant in manners. Drinks the finest, James Bond can flight to win and shoot to kill. Even when Bond pisses off MI6 he's usually right The opening scene before the credits was the best part of the movie, even though there were serious flaws in it. It was the best 5 minutes of the movie. James Bond loses his Mojo or expertise of being James Bond? The truth is James Bond is the greatest spy of all time and a super hero in his moves, how could it be possible that James Bond lose his nerve and shake when holding a gun. James Bond should be able to shoot in one direction and a enemy should fall out of a tree in the opposite direction by reflecting the bullet off of a flying helicopter that explodes, and then the bullet hits the guy in the tree in the eye. James Bond should have a cleaver lines like"" no more monkeys sitting in a tree."" In Sky Fall James Bond is a wimp for Bonds Style of kicking villain ss who said maybe 76 words in the whole 2 1/2 hour movie. James Bond movies should be full of James Bond Cleaver lines like "" Do you expect me to talk? no I expect you to die Mr. bond... Or Send the flowers to his funeral. James Bond is suppose to be an expert in everything and skyfall lacked any James Bond charm. charisma, and just an exciting spy to watch in action.<br/><br/>skyfall scenes had no flow at all. They didn't build any characters. The very attractive Bond girl was the best part of the movie, not only did she have the exotic look but when she spoke her acting was suburb in every short scene she was in. M is a heartless woman who doesn't care about her agents life's especially Bond. M makes bad decisions and not qualifies to run MI6. though her best line was when she said to the villain "" I barely remember you"".<br/><br/>The part where James Bond drives in the Austin Martin James Bond car was comically stupid. It made me think that maybe James Bond is actually a name give to super MI6 agents and James Bond is not a real person. Since Daniel Craig who drives a Sean Connery car was born when Sean drove the car that would make movie science if James Bond is just a name for the best if MI6 and passed down to future generations. But that theory didn't add up because we saw James Bonds Fathers Grave Andrew Bond.<br/><br/>When M dies , believe me she really didn't die, you will appreciate me telling the end of the movie for you, so you can carefully watch the scene. You see M was not shot or stabbed she only was fatigued due to age and burned hands are superficial wounds. My theory on this is based on the fact that M career was forced to end, and the only honorable way for her to pass is to die a fake death - when James Bond kisses her fake dead body you can see her face muscles move . Her las lines are"" why where you late Bond"" and quickly dies in his arm. because of M's many people where killed especially minsters and her career would of been totally screwed once she gets rescued by Bond, therefore here only way out was a fake death like Bond did in the opening scene . <br/><br/>I think the writers of the movie didn't do the proper research on who Ian Fleming character is James bonds fighting scenes comically stupid and unrealistic even for James Bond. The scene where Bond was fighting in a shadow looked like a puppet show. The next Bond a movie needs a talking James Bond with cleaver lines Inevery other scene"

","Note: This review has possible spoilers. Not big spoilers, but if you have not seen it, it may still have information you might not want to read.<br/><br/>The James Bond series has now reached a level of absolute 100% burn out. The series has become so exhausted and unoriginal that watching the new films is like briefly glancing at an object, and forgetting you saw it a few seconds later.<br/><br/>I did like Casino Royale, and thought it was an interesting change of pace from the usual destroy the world plots, but it was nothing more than a short lived bit of energy that quickly burned out by the incoherent Quantum of Solace.<br/><br/>The problems with Skyfall are many. It is overlong, very tedious in its middle act, and the villain's motives are not completely clear. Javier Bardem is very good in the role of Silva, but all he wants is revenge over M and MI6 for once sending him on a mission that went bad, but why should we care? We know M screwed him over once in the past, and that he wants revenge, but the film never explores any deeper motives than just revenge itself.<br/><br/>Even a bigger problem with Skyfall is that it copies from other Bond films as well as other movies. The fight on the train at the start reminds us of Roger Moore fighting on the train in Octopussy,the sex worker or prostitute in Macau asks Bond to kill her boss in the very same way that Andrea Anders asked Bond to kill Scaramanga in The Man With the Golden Gun, Silva's blonde hair is like all other blonde haired baddies we have seen in past Bond films like Christopher Walken in A View To A Kill, and the list of agents that are supposed to be killed is completely ripped off from the ""Death To Spies"" concept in the far superior The Living Daylights. Furthermore, the ending where the baddies march towards the hero's home reminds us of Patriot Games (1992) and Witness (1984). Skyfall has pretty much nothing new.<br/><br/>Skyfall has a plot that we have seen countless times in other films, and is also not fully explained. The film takes a serious approach which I find pretentious or phony. The plot is very superficial and unsophisticated, but the film pretends as though it is far more sophisticated than what it is. It only seems mature and sophisticated on its surface, but look deeper into it, and there isn't much you will find; just a villain who once got screwed over by MI6 and wants revenge; that is it in a nutshell, and we do not learn anything deeper. Big deal!!!! The whole thing is very dreary, and takes itself too seriously and without acknowledging what classics like Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me did, which is that James Bond is inherently silly. We cannot take a film (or film series) that is inherently silly and try and make it into a serious and deep Oscar type picture, or an intellectual art-house film, which is what they try to do with Skyfall. By doing so, they have created something utterly pretentious, too arty, dull and dreary, and very tedious. The tedium is the result of a very superficial plot being placed into a long and serious epic type picture; since there is not much to explain as far as the plot and because it is a long epic, much tedium turns out to be the result.<br/><br/>I will always enjoy the old films like Goldfinger, Thunderball, and Live and Let Die. However, the series is now lacking the juice, interest, and excitement that was promised in Casino Royale, but that we not only have not gotten back, but I am doubting we ever will. The series is just old, tired, and out of gas and originality. Casino Royale is pretty much the final bit of juice left over and that is now all gone. They will continue making Bond films for the money, but aside from the old classics (which I will always revisit), it is time for me to look elsewhere in film. After sitting through great and exciting films this past week like Lincoln, End of Watch, and Looper (all I saw after Skyfall), Skyfall seems even duller."

A poor attempt to make a raw and darker version of something that is supposed to be a tribute to a formula that mixes action, humor, love, drama, a display of modern technology and beautiful settings and locations...almost succeeded but not quite.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I could see what the makers tried to do but every aspect that was given attention in the movie was 'to short' and therefor insignificant. For example: a Bond villain needs to have the jaw of Jaws, a hook as a hand, a white cat or a tear of blood as a give away...I didn't get the villain in this movie. Maybe I was supposed to know this character from a book but mainly I found the guy very feminine and not very strong...apparently there was a history but there was not a real attempt to have the audience hate this guy...it just wasn't right. <br/><br/>It just wasn't right...<br/><br/>Sorry...hope in the next three years they will keep it real and do better job..."
"sean-cowan1","5","11","22","14 November 2012"," Mediocre action movie, weak Bond film
","For me this movie was quite good up until about an hour and a half into it, after Silva kills Sévérine the movie falls apart and goes steadily down hill until it just sort of ends.<br/><br/>The action sequences are fairly generic and offer none of the bond-esque flair we've come to expect. We go from parkour battles on top of cranes in Casino Royale and the awesome boat chase in Quantum of Solace to generic fist fights in dark alleys or on rooftops. Its not that action sequences are inherently bad, but they are NOT Bond action at all.<br/><br/>The new Q - I like the approach they tried to take with him, until he unveiled there would be no gadgets at all besides a dermal-sensitive pistol. There isn't even the Bond watch a staple of pretty much every film past. I thought the idea of a young, brilliant, arrogant Q would be a good direction, but none of the quibble between Q and Bond that defined many films past is present. Also given the personality of the new Q you expect him to not only embrace gadgets, but to constantly come up with new and wild ideas for them. We don't get anything close to that with this Q.<br/><br/>Silva's introduction as the villain is great, and at that point in my first viewing of the film I was thinking 'this is one of the better bond films yet'. Silva brings an interesting blend of eccentric flamboyance, psychopathic rage, and intellect to the table which hasn't been seen in a bond villain in quite the same combination before. His use of Sévérine as an object for his own entertainment and a statement to bond is cold blooded, and again at that point in the film I was expect the movie to continue ramping up the tension and explode with an amazing finale. Sadly I was severely disappointed when all that good stuff about Silva comes crashing down with a generic and bland 'intentionally gets captured as part of his ingenious plan' cop out plot. Its a dirty trick used in sub-par action films and its quite disappointing to see a bond film resort to it. They had all the elements for a great weird, psychotic genius of a villain and they squandered it.<br/><br/>The theme for the entire film is good ideas not properly realized, or just simply peppered in for fun and not touched on again. Sévérine the bond girl for example (I bet most people never even caught her name in the film) is extremely hot and exotic looking and her accent is quite sexy. She is on film for approximately 15 minutes. No character development is done of any kind, even the 5 minute character development from Tomorrow Never Dies for its bond girl crushes Skyfalls development (as there was none). Sévérine is just popped in for eye-candy and she isn't even on the screen long enough to really enjoy that aspect of it. Bond doesn't care at all when she dies. Its puzzling just like the entire movie. After all the effort in Casino Royale to make it known that Bond did love a woman once before (Vesper) and because of his line of work she got killed. Again in QoS the first bond girl, Fields is killed because of line of work. The next girl he doesn't even sleep with because of remorse for that. Then we see bond use Sévérine in the new film in much the same manner Silva does. It simply doesn't make sense. In the films before Casino Royale its always fairly clear to me that bond only sleeps with the women and doesn't pursue further for fear of them getting to involved in his job, or getting hurt. Casino Royale was supposed to explain that. But then Skyfall throws that idea out completely.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you want to see a mediocre action film that simply happens to have James Bond as the titular character, you will enjoy this one. If you are looking for Bond, real Bond, like in Dr. No, Thunderball, Goldfinger, or The World is Not Enough you would be best to simply watch those classic instalments than waste your time and money here."
"Mike_nandra","3","11","22","14 November 2012"," I fell ill after I watched Skyfall
","The above is the truth, after watching a late showing of Skyfall, I spent the rest of the night in bed cocooned in my feverish delirium trying to figure out what I had seen. The first 45 mins was quite entertaining, with some top-notch action pieces and banter. But once we left for Silva's island, the whole thing collapsed into boredom. It felt like a BBC production of say 'Spooks' or even the recent 'Hunted'. As if they lost interest and budget. I have read reviews of how it is the best bond film ever, best bond villain, best bond, etc. But despite the action the plot as mentioned in other reviews is about hard drive misplaced with agents names (ala Mission Impossible). And this is forgotten about half way thru the film. So the film turns into a revenge and M's swan song piece. Why did the film forget the main aspects of a Bond film that need to be in there i.e: A villain who is threat to the world in some way. Bond given mission by M. Bond has to deal with his henchmen/women who have their unique way of disposing people. Bond will bed an accomplice and/or henchwoman to get to said villain. Bond gets caught in an inescapable trap, but lucky for him him his Q's gadgets. Bond confront and kills his nemesis in his lair and just about escapes with leading lady. James Bond will return. This has been the simple building blocks of every bond film; what has made it different is the choice of villain/henchmen, the leading ladies, the locations, the explosions and gadgets.<br/><br/>Casion Royale and Quantum of Solace kept things fresh by using the revenge arc. They could have built on Silva's revenge and continued it throughout this film. For he is not that different to Bond or where you can see Bond end up after a few too many shaken martini's, more non-meaningful relationships, more suffering from his injuries and pains and basically M deciding he is of no use anymore. And Bond actually realising this, seeing Silva as forgotten broken comrade, a lost brother. And when has M ever concerned him/herself with Bond? His/her interest lied it getting the mission completed so he or she would not get the heat for it.<br/><br/>Thats where one of the main problems lies with Skyfall. Its dedicated to M (Bond's Mother figure) where we know she does not give a crap about Bond. And the viewer knows this and its somewhat unconvincing, boring of a sub plot. Another is Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva. Someone mentioned he looks like David Walliams in a wig. I have to agree but David Walliam in a blonde wig ala Dinner with the Schmucks was far more funnier then Javier here. Im not saying Javier is not a brilliant actor, but making him camp, giving him too much to say took the menace out of his villainy. He had far more presence as the almost mute in No Country For Old men.<br/><br/>In fact the whole film is back to front. Below is having seen the whole piece is my view on how the set pieces should have flowed: Spoiler Alert: Opening Bond barrel (its the 3rd film we are missing it at start still) M head towards MI6 headquarters, it blows up, news informing us of various agents being killed.<br/><br/>M flees to Skyfall. Bond comes out of the shadows as been in recluse since QOS. Skyfall battle happens with Ronson taking charge, Silva in the shadows kills M ""Bye Mommie"". M dies in Bond's arms Skyfall burns, Brick with skyfall name lands in lake turns into animation - opening titles start - titles show animation of Bond silhouette over M's tombstone. Titles end.<br/><br/>Opening scene at Turkey, whole sequence takes place, Tanner in make shift MI6 giving feedback to Bond and Eva. But its now Bond telling Eva to take the shot. She takes the shot.<br/><br/>Next shot Bond survives and put through his paces for recovery/training. Is he mentally still there? He has a meeting with Mallory and being told he lost the hard drive and the various agents are being killed. He is given all clear to pursue the mission.Meeting with Q (Q explains he managed to construct a small version of the hand scan gun from Licence to Kill and homing device from Goldfinger from left over's at blown MI6 branch.<br/><br/>Spends cat and mouse chasing Ronson and Silva across globe. Shanghai sequence with Severine happens. She leads him to Ronson. Sequence in Skyscraper happens with Ronson's death. Bond gets knocked out unconscious by same shadowy figure (Silva). We see Bond being tortured by Silva. Silva explains his pain and reasoning. We see Bond almost falling for it but escapes. Homing device activated - Silva is captured.<br/><br/>We have the MI6 sequence where Silva escapes, brings London to its knees. Flees to his island. Severine almost left for dead. Bond and her team up and head for his lair.<br/><br/>Big action sequence on island, Blows up.<br/><br/>Mallory and Moneypenny get introduced to Bond.<br/><br/>Bond beds Severine with a closing innuendo remark.<br/><br/>James Bond Will Return"

The film does go on to cover some standard James Bond ground for the first act: Bond still hobnobs around casinos, drinks a vodka martini, chases after some girls...but throughout the second half, all of the stakes were raised so substantially, it pushed the characters to their limits. With all the bold, thrilling plot twists and turns, Skyfall is to 007 what The Dark Knight was to Batman: in both cases, the heroes tread along a knife's edge and go through extreme measures to ensure victory.<br/><br/>Rest assured, the film still entertains every bit as much as the other films of the franchise. Despite a few slow parts, most of it (especially in the last half) remains consistently suspenseful, thrilling, exciting, and even humorous at times. There are even a huge number of references and nods to established elements of Bond lore, and by the film's end, it feels as though one age of Bond has passed and another has begun (which is funny, because I thought the transition was more or less complete after Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace; it goes to show that the filmmakers still have some aces up their sleeves).<br/><br/>The story for this film is quite sound, and amazingly thoughtful. From the start, it emphasizes James Bond's seniority, as he suffers in the line of duty, feels the burden of aging, and as politicians put his usefulness into question. The film goes on to talk about the old vs the new, or the past vs the present, and it does an effective job of mixing the old and the new in interesting ways. These key themes and conflicts keep the plot running, and ultimately spurs newfound life and depth in the characters, for both Bond and the villain he ultimately uncovers. Their interactions prove to be quite profound; many of Bond's most memorable villains have been foil characters, but in this case, I really got the feeling that this villain would have been Bond himself if things were different. Given the character motivations, the rising stakes, and the ultimate climax, the film showcases one of the most unusual and most hard-hitting Bond stories of the lot. Purists may find it totally uninteresting, but it'll strike a stronger chord with the modern generation, for the film proves that James Bond is still the man.<br/><br/>As expected, the film looks nice and slick. A bit drab in terms of tone and color design (for better or for worse), but the camera work is decent, and the editing is good (thankfully, not nearly as screwy as Quantum of Solace). Acting is great; Daniel Craig is still perfect as James Bond, while Judi Dench continues to play it tough as M, and Javier Bardem puts on a nuanced performance (despite playing a rather weird, child-like character). Ralph Fiennes and Naomie Harris are both a pleasure to watch as well. The writing is quite slick, full of wit and depth. This production does a fine job with the sets, props, and costumes. I've seen plenty of folks complaining about the special effects, but they never really bothered me that much. Same with the music; I love Thomas Newman's score, regardless of how different it is from the usual works of David Arnold or John Barry. And, I do love Adele's theme song.<br/><br/>I definitely enjoyed this film, and it would rank pretty high on my list of favorite 007 films. Whether you're a fan or not, the film is certainly worth checking out. <br/><br/>Recommended! <br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"
"squaare-pusher","5","5","8","19 November 2015"," Movie progressively declines
","The one saving grace to Skyfall is that it has a great intro sequence. Fast pace, action packed, and a bunch of explosions and cool stunts. Plus, Bond gets shot, which is insane. The movie continues with cool hacking sequences and interesting characters. I found it disappointing that was essentially the best sequence of the movie. <br/><br/>The plot feels very undeveloped. One character that comes to mind is Bond's love interest, they introduce her and provide a compelling story, but she dies essentially after she bangs Bond. The entire movie is riddled with half story lines and boring characters. <br/><br/>The main plot is essentially a revenge plan carried out by a former agent against M. I honestly found myself rooting for the villain as all the good guys were so unlikable. M is a bitch and has zero redeeming qualities and Bond is just a hired gun at this point. Bond is suppose to be a charismatic bad ass, however what this movie portrays is someone with essentially no personality other than being a vicious killer. It was so disappointing to see that the villain does not get to kill M, and in the end accomplishes absolutely nothing. Luckily M dies in the end, but in the most anti-climatic way. <br/><br/>The movie was also much longer than it needed to be. The entire cabin scene was also extremely slow and boring. <br/><br/>Overall its obviously the Bond formula is showing it's age. I hope the next movie try something different."
"SimonB27","1","5","8","16 February 2015"," Awful, misogynistic drivel
","Having just written a review of another film I hated (Imitation Game) I am now on something of a roll and thought I'd post a review of a film that is up there with Dark Knight Rises as a truly terrible film living off hype and bafflingly favourable reviews from critics.<br/><br/>This film is drivel from start to finish. Many other reviewers have catalogued the endless plot flaws and I won't repeat most of them here but it is unforgivable to construct an entire movie around set pieces that have no logic. Why would a hacker so expert (and apparently gifted with precognition) arrange to be arrested, taken to an emergency location that he could not possibly have known about in advance in order to escape again pausing briefly to trigger an elaborate and pointless train crash en route (again that he has set up beforehand?) with perfect timing. It's just nonsense.<br/><br/>Why does the film put in a ridiculous notion like a personalised gun that only Bond can fire for one tiny throw away piece where that fact saves his life.<br/><br/>Worse still is the Aston Martin, which just takes us from drivel into the realms of the offensive. There is no place for the 1960s tooled-up Aston in this reboot. If it's from the 60s then Bond would be an old man by now. If it's from Casino Royale then it's Bond's personal property and it wouldn't have all the toys. It's not witty, it's just insulting.<br/><br/>And possibly worst of all is the underlying misogyny throughout the film. Sam Mendes clearly hates women. Moneypenny does absolutely nothing wrong. She's pretty handy in the opening scenes and it's not her fault that she can't make an impossible shot. Why does she end up demoted to being a secretary (not even a desk job MI6 agent)? Bond's attitude to the other bond girl is deplorable (and unconvincing) and M ends up dead. It's bizarre.<br/><br/>This is a truly, truly terrible film and I cannot understand why critics are giving it glowing reviews. Does Sam Mendes have pictures of them all naked? I have recently read that they are giving Sam Mendeds the next one to direct. I for one shall not be wasting my £10 going to see it. I'm done with Bond."
"ianlouisiana","8","5","8","20 March 2013"," The medium is the message.Mr Mendes plays with 007...
","Mr Sam Mendes has had the nerve to take one of the cinema's biggest money - spinners and,well,spin it. In doing so he has made the first James Bond film that can stand on its merits and not merely drape itself round a carefully staged star performance. Certainly Mr D.Craig is more than adequate as OO7,albeit a slightly diminished 007,a bit worn round the edges,but he is not meant to dominate ""Skyfall"",neither does he.Instead Mr Mendes uses an ageing Bond as a discourse on acknowledging the past and accepting that actions have consequences. In addition to this new reading of a very familiar character he has brought joined - up film - making to the franchise,during the course of which there are many joyous references from ""The lady from Shanghai"" to Indiana Jones that had me laughing with delight;not a reaction one has come to expect a Bond film,however slick,to produce. Miss J.Dench - a bruised and vulnerable ""M""- gives her best film performance for some time. ""Skyfall"" gives force to the argument that film is a directors' medium."
"mdfaraone","3","16","35","12 November 2012"," WAAAY over-hyped and OVERRATED !
","Sorry folks, don't believe the hype, this is nowhere near ""best,Bond,ever"" nonsense reviews, actually both Casino Royale and the much maligned Quantum of Solace were better, The best scene in the movie is the opening scene before the credits and theme song, it's downhill from there, I thought Javier Bardem's performance was the best thing about the movie and found myself somewhat sympathetic to his character ,as he had clear and specific reasons for his actions, namely revenge for being betrayed by his country and specifically ""M"". Without giving away too much, you leave the movie realizing Bond was a complete failure at every assignment in the movie,and a Bond that fails is not a Bond I care to see, you also realize that if ""X"" had simply happened before ""Y"" , none of the other lives would have been lost. Another bone of contention is the dark filming and poorly choreographed fight scenes,almost two thirds of this movie is filmed in dark, drab,locations or in silhouette, not the bright exotic locales of a Bond film. I also have a disdain for the underlying theme of the film, which is the sacrifice of the self for the so-called ""greater good"", this has been the ""con"" of every communist, socialist, dictator, and religious extremist for hundreds of years now."

","The Mrs and I went off to this, and we couldn't wait for the film to be over. I did ask whether she wanted to leave early but she said ""no"". After Casino Royale, which I did enjoy, this was a huge disappointment, and am a little surprised that it received such high reviews.<br/><br/>The plot was pretty weak and the film dragged on and on and on, probably being 30 minutes too long. The filming is it's usual high quality, but still overall both my wife and I found this boring, something you can't usually level against a Bond film.<br/><br/>The one good part of the film's plot was at the end, where it attempts to tie in all the characters that are to be found in the ""later"" films (chronologically speaking). Having said that, while I knew Casino Royale was supposed to be early Bond, and Quantum of Solace seemed to be a continuation due primarily (to me) to Giancarlo Giannini's role, I was not aware that Skyfall was a continuation. Half way through the film it goes on about Bond being old and ready for retirement, thus one might be lead to think that he was at the end of his career, but the end rather contradicts this."
"zterrell","4","14","30","13 November 2012"," A failed mission!
","While it had the hype and numerous rave reviews, I must say my wife and I were very disappointed in this Bond effort. Having been a teen when Dr. No hit the movie screens, I became a Bond fan for life...well, for most of them. This show started off like the previous two -- wall to wall action in an extended fight/chase scene. From that point it became more like a 24 Hours TV series, except it lacked the pace or action. Overall, the villain was too perfect in his planning and Bond was helpless to stop him. With a purposed hit during a hearing with the PM and no one is ready for the bad guys??? The villain has people waiting for him or working for him at ever avenue ... for what? Money? Fear? Political means? No explanation as to why so many follow this insane villain blindly. But in the end, there's the very fact that Bond fails miserably in his mission. By then we were just hoping the overly drug out movie would end. I wonder what movie those giving 7-10 stars saw. This Bond rates as one of the poorest, longest and most unsatisfactory of this great series."
"gsceldridge","5","14","30","28 October 2012"," I was willing to overlook Quantum of Solace, but this has gone too far...
","This is a cracking action film. It is not, however, what I would consider to be a Bond film. If anyone has watched any of the older Bond films (ignoring the messes that were Pierce Brosnan's), then they can see easily what James Bond is about. James Bond is about a suave man's man who speaks in sexual innuendo, beds numerous women, kills frequently and efficiently and with the aid of super-cool gadgets and a top of the range Aston Martin. He is not an emotional man. He is the epitome of cool. <br/><br/>Skyfall is about none of the above. Skyfall is first and foremost about product placement. When one wades through all the product placement, one can view the plot, which goes something like this (please note that due to the overwhelming and unavoidable evidence to suggest that this is not a James Bond film, I will now be referring to the protagonist - formerly known as James Bond - as Daniel Craig) :<br/><br/>A very old-for-his-age Daniel Craig is fighting on the roof of a train and his colleague needs to take a shot at the man he is fighting with. He can HEAR this, we later find out. He can hear M saying ""take the shot"" despite Bond being in the way. At NO POINT does Bond try and get out of the way so she can make a shot. She shoots and Bond gets shot. The rest of the film is a mix between The Dark Knight Rises (an old, injured hero trying to make himself strong again), Law Abiding Citizen (a villain who WANTS to be caught for his ""master plan"") and Home Alone (the ""goodies"" boobytrap a house with objects they find lying around to defend against the ""baddies""). Most of the film focuses around Judi Dench, in some kind of bizarre tribute. Javier Bardem's character, whilst amazing, smacks somewhat of the Joker in the Dark Knight and his relationship with M was creepy to the point of distasteful.<br/><br/>Let's have a look at the Craig girls. Naomie Harris and her quite frankly appalling banter with Bond (another thing - Craig is supposed to be good at flirting) leaves her looking like a sarcastic t4 presenter. Berenice is electric for all of the 5 minutes she is in the film, before she is killed. <br/><br/>Other issues with the film: Daniel Craig is unshaven for a quarter of the film. No, just no. Daniel Craig CRIES. Way too much of the film was insulting Great Britain and MI6. Find out too much of Craig's family history.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - if you completely ignore that this is supposed to be a Bond film, it is a very enjoyable action film. Some of the sequences are breathtaking, the chases are brilliant and the plot is (albeit plagarised) jolly good fun. There is some decent humour in there too. I just can't help but feel that somewhere between the point where Sam Mendes was overseeing the script-writing, and the point where he had his head up Judi Dench's backside, SOMEONE, ANYONE might have said ""um...just a few things about this..."" or at the very least you'd think he might have watched a few Bond films himself and not have to be told. Because, from this utterly misguided attempt, I can see that he has never ever watched a Bond film that did not include craggy Craig."

","hi all, usually i don't prefer writing my perspective about anything but cant hold after watching this blunder. I followed the bond series but this, the worst. Action is limited to 1st 10 min of the movie and rest of the movie is just a sleeping time. There was no adventure, no action by 007 except he is passing a training (lol) and explosion by him with help of domestic gas cylinder (wat a thinking !). Including me everyone was yawning in theater. The car used by earlier bond's ""Austin Martin"" come into picture suddenly with no requirement in the frame. yeah, one thing i liked is ""the escape of dirty mind, Silva""( Javier Bardem), for this writer and director applied little brain. The hacking of computer reminds me Die hard 4. what 007 doing he might himself not aware. <br/><br/>guys please make it flop in bond series otherwise.. we might miss the further action.<br/><br/>PLEASE AVOID ...!!!! <br/><br/>thanks , mohit"

","Very poor film according to the previous James Bond I saw... ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace"" were very different and special, not the usual stereotypically style; so that ""Daniel Craig"" became my favorite James Bond artist. But Skyfall disappointed me. I thought that James Bond movie would have progressed and free itself from the typical style... But it was this time as usual: the action parts too long and boring. The part how James Bond rescued after falling deep into the water is missing. It could be important to give the audience a view to the feelings of James Bond. But:<br/><br/>the landscape scenes were beautiful and interesting... and I liked the song from Adele."

","Honestly, one of the worst Bond films I've seen, it was a generic slapdash action/spy movie with so many contradictions and errors.

""Skyfall"" is not a good James Bond movie. It is a good looking movie and the action is well staged but at the end of the day, who cares? The story is uninvolving. The villain is weak. Javier Bardem's obnoxious performance only makes matters worse. It seems to go on forever. Despite all of the action, watching a melancholy 007 for two and a half hours makes for a surprisingly dull evening. ""Skyfall"" is such a lost cause that even Albert Finney can't save it.

"jordan_heidendahl","4","12","25","9 December 2012"," It's a bad movie.
","I have loved Bond movies for a long time and was looking forward to this one, but was massively disappointed. They have pretty much turned Bond into a Batman/Bourne character. The modern action movie seems to feature a superhuman hero whose biggest fight was with his own past demons, in Batman it was completely pathetic, here a little less so, but it was still bad. The heroes in these movies are constantly whining about some past grievance, as are the villains. In this case man up guys, you're top secret agents with a license to kill, you don't think the job might have it's risks? Past Bonds seemed to naturally understand that, which is why Bond was such an exciting character. He knew could die at any moment but he maintained charm and cool at all times. This Bond was a robotic, and personality-less. He was like a Bourne programmed killer. Without personality in any of the characters, it's tough to care for them. The story was pretty standard comic book fare, maniacal bad guy with endless pool of resources whose only goal is to terrorize. The villain here was quite similar to the Bane/Joker style bad guy, only destruction is enough. That feels totally unrealistic, I can understand the making money, world domination aspiration, but revenge just feels a little bit pathetic. And that final showdown scene, wow you can totally tell they were gunning to get Sean Connery for that but he declined."

","This is the shortest 2 hour and 23 minute movie I have ever seen. From the opening scene through to the end, this movie just pulled me through.<br/><br/>It had real story lines threading through it, hence my rating this as a proper movie. It was not just action, or gizmos, although it has plenty of those, but for once these things just support rather than being the story.<br/><br/>Its worth pointing out, in contrast to all the nay-sayers slating this movie, that it is the only Bond movie to make it onto IMDb's top 250 list. Also it is the largest grossing movie in the top 10 in its third weekend making more than all the other nine movies after it combined. <br/><br/>I like a movie that works at many levels that has grown-up themes as well as action and drama. If you are expecting a thrill ride that does all the story-plot thinking for you, then it possibly is not the movie for you. However if you like something that leaves you turning the story over in your mind afterwards, then this is a treat. <br/><br/>The movie never stumbled of failed me once. Up there with Gladiator, Toy Story (falling with style) or Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>Enjoy."
"Old_Swampy","Null","12","25","16 November 2012"," What a letdown!
","After seeing the trailers for this movie, I was really excited. Sure, I said to myself, Quantum of Solace was nigh unwatchable but they seem to have made another great neo-Bond movie. It'll be like Casino Royale all over again!<br/><br/>This charade was kept up right until the scene where the guy gets eaten by the komodo dragons. Hmmm, I said, that seems like something that would happen in a later Pierce Brosnan Bond or an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The facade started to crack. The movie kept going fairly well. We meet the super villain: he has an awesome intro and great opening lines. Then, for no discernible reason, the movie plunges straight into the toilet.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, up until the conclusion of the island part I was really into this movie. I was more than willing to suspend my disbelief (it IS a Bond movie) and the plot seemed to be building to a cool story. There was a gorgeous woman who needed saving, an extremely crazy super villain that needed defeating, and a mystery about a missing list that needed solving. <br/><br/>But for some reason the writers chose to completely abandon these intriguing plot lines they spent the entire first part of the movie developing! I noticed in the credits that 3 people wrote this movie. Did the smartest one write the first part, the second smartest the second, and an escaped chimp the ending? It was going well!!! It had a great set up. Then they just chucked it all and started again on a much worse story. The bad guy kills the damsel in distress right away, so that angles done. The missing list is never found and not even attempted to be recovered after we meet the bad guy. The super villain turns out not to be a great foe for Bond to duel; instead, he wants to fight a decrepit old lady!<br/><br/>The writing is just so bad after we meet Javier Bardem. Some examples off the top of my head: <br/><br/>-Javier arranges an extremely elaborate plan to get to M just so he can look her in the eyes, involving changing the location of Mi6 headquarters, getting caught, tricking Mi6 into uploading a virus so he can escape, having disguises and getaway cars ready for him, and rerouting a subway train through the floor at the exact right moment, all so he can...shoot M with a handgun? WHY DID HE GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE JUST TO DO THAT? Every Bond villain ever had grander ambition than that. <br/><br/>-A major part of the plot until after the island part is how Bond is losing his skill. He can't run, shoot, and he may have a drinking problem. After the island this is never mentioned again<br/><br/>-The Scottish groundskeeper has no trace of a Scottish accent. He also steals Will Smith's line from Independence Day<br/><br/>-The movie turns into Home Alone at the end<br/><br/>-Javier Bardem can finally shoot M, then decides he can't, then tells her to shoot herself. She doesn't. <br/><br/>-There's no final showdown between Bond and Javier. Javier dies from a knife in the back and Bond is just standing there. <br/><br/>-After that anti-climactic death, M dies anyway. The whole stupid final part of the movie was a complete waste<br/><br/>This was one of the most perplexing, frustrating movies I've ever seen. It had a great beginning with cool action sequences and some interesting plot developments. Then it completely abandons them for government inquiries, bad guys fighting a house, long chase sequences where nothing interesting happens, and a plot to protect an elderly woman, which ultimately fails anyway. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long, long time. I give it a 3 only because the beginning had so much promise. Watch up until Javier finishes his opening talk with Bond. Then turn it off and make up your own ending. It will be much more satisfying."

","Not content with doing in beloved Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Ralph Fiennes decides that everyone's favorite ""M""--Dame Judi Dench--is an anachronism; since there's no one who can watch the watchers safely, the world would be safer without any watchers at all, he concludes. On the one hand, Fiennes' ""Mallory"" character is correct. On the other, he weasels his way into M's shoes. However, this James Bond outing literally returns to Agent 007's roots, reintroducing the ""Q"" role after a two-film absence, along with another ""Miss Moneypenny"" (who fires at Bond first, and flirts later). The ""Bond. James Bond."" line is revived, as well, and the Bond Martini is worked in more effectively than in QUANTUM OF SOLACE. For the first time, Daniel Craig is joking as James VI, with his ejection seat jibe at M particularly funny. SKYFALL spoofs London's version of the 9-11 attacks (when the ""Tube"" blew up in 3 1/2 spots (July 7, 2005), proving that the English are less thin-skinned than the Americans (even though Javier Bardem's ""Silva"" character shows they're still far behind in dentistry). They also employ less lethal suicide pills than those used by the Third Reich, resulting in about two dozen dead MI6 agents, along with countless random civilians. In SKYFALL, Bond cannot protect his lover (nothing new), but also loses his boss\foster mom, his ancestral home, his town house, and a classic car that Jay Leno would die for.

","I saw the movie last night. I thought it could not be worse than Quantum of Solace. At least they got Q back, right? I was so wrong. 2 hours and 37 minutes later after enduring numerous dark scenes, and forcefully pushing myself to like the sad sack sentimental and aging James (Lame) Bond I left the theater utterly disappointed with the after taste of ""What a waste of time!"". There was nothing, nothing and nothing in the movie. No balance of characters, couple of chuckles here and there on the lame humor and mostly dark sentimental scenes that were dragging f-o-r-e-v-e-r.<br/><br/>I was collecting Bond movies until Daniel Craig started playing in them. I do not have the last three movies. I felt I really do not need them. They are off beat. Daniel plays worse than George Lazenby, but back in that time if the movie sucked the bad actor got kicked out really quick. Now in the new age of political correctness it takes 3 failed movies to say to Daniel Craig ""Hey dude, you really suck like James Bond, make space for someone new that at least smiles occasionally"". <br/><br/>Here are the spoilers: <br/><br/><ul><li>Lots of violence, the villain leaves breadcrumbs of dead bodies for no particular reason. I guess Bond is out of shape not just physically, but also his IQ is lower than usual and can't find the villain otherwise. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>James is particularly bad making love to women giving the sense he does it against his will, and giving the audience the impression he leaves them unsatisfied. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Love scenes between Bond and girls are short, but the ""busting out of the closet"" gay scene with the villain is developed with great attention to the detail. It is obvious it did get James excited. Really! That is where we are going now? And this goes with PG-13 rating? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A beautiful classic car is destroyed just because </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In darkness the movie is somewhere between Lord of the Rings and the 7 Psychopaths.</li></ul><br/><br/>Potential: <br/><br/><ul><li>Young Q could be great in the next movie </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is tiny pleasant surprise at the end related to the other girl in the movie.

","Back from my local Cineworld and unfortunately Skyfall is wellIts disappointing.<br/><br/>It seems as if the ethos of Bond has gone, The cars, chases, gadgets and more so the story line are poor. Yes the DB5 is a stunning automotive piece of art but not for a 2012 film, the chases and gadgets seem none existent and the story line is simple and predictable. What amazes me more is the IMDb film budget of £ 200,000,000. Cant for the life of me think where it went apart from the ever expanding salaries. When this film gets edited for TV no doubt for a commercial channel, 33% of it will disappear to make way for adverts. And you know what You won't notice what they cut out.<br/><br/>I love the BOND franchise and each and every film they have done, but this is just too. Laboured."

Bad character development. Unbelievable Bond doesn't even flinch when woman that helped him gain access to bad guy dies. Could have saved girl by pulling escape moments earlier. Bad guy is ridiculous. Bond survives fiery explosion by hiding around corner (like fire can't go around a corner?). Dismisses Bond movie staples the whole movie (e.g. gadgets), but then at the end adds scene that praises and cashes in on the old style. Tried to cover up entire bad movie by circle jerking audience at end with this classic bond 'reboot' promise.

The plot is weak, the Skyfall theme song does not live up to what I would call a catchy tune that would have you running it over and over in your head and overall it was just a boring and overly long movie. <br/><br/>It lacked the Bond type gadgetry that we all have come to expect in a Bond movie.<br/><br/>Three of us watched this film and all of us came away with the same opinion, it doesn't live up to the James Bond standards."
"kallmekash","1","11","23","7 January 2013"," What a piece of garbage!!!
","James Bond 007 is a man of extraordinary abilities... He is a spy of its own kind... a man with style, present-mindedness and charisma who captures your attention with the very first glance... All the previous bond movies depicted these features of Bond in a more or less similar fashion except for this 23rd edition named Skyfall... I saw this movie without very high hopes but with an expectation that it would be better, or at least, at par with the last two of Daniel Craig's Bond ventures... Unfortunately, this do not even belong to a Bond franchise in any sense... I would like to list some very obvious observations neglecting the minor details:<br/><br/>1- I think the script-writers these days are suffering from serious creativity issues... unique plots are way out of stock or these guys in Hollywood have gone barren with new ideas and plots, which is pathetic... who gives a damn about Bond's childhood and issues related to his upbringing... while I was watching the scene where Bond escorts M into Skyfall Mansion... it felt like I was watching The Dark Knight where Bruce Wayne's childhood was being described... every this and that Hollywood director is obsessed with Christopher Nolan these days... Nolanomania is spreading like a jungle fire burning their creativity to the ground... Nolan has his own style and one must not try to imitate him... I am very disgusted to see the similar technique of Dark Knight constantly followed in Skyfall, yet ruining the style of Bond movies... A rogue MI6 agent coming to town to take revenge on M is simply tasteless for Bond movies... there are a several other movies on this subject much more artistically and cleverly put up than this piece of garbage... even the last 02 of the Daniel Craig's Bond movies were much more interesting and captivating than this...<br/><br/>2- The incompetent script-writer makes another big mistake by creating a paradox in the story-telling... This all starts from Casino Royale which is considered as a reboot to Bond series and was warmly welcomed... so as The Quantum of Solace, which keeps up with the predecessor... But Skyfall has a lot of plot holes such as Bond's being shown aging way over what Pierce Brosnan left off in Die Another Day... secondly, in Golden Eye, female M (Judy Dench) appeared for the first time and dies in Skyfall being replaced by male M (Ralph Fiennes)... But Ms. Moneypenny has always been there until Die Another Day... It makes no sense that you keep the female M character from the Pierce Brosnan's Bond franchise and, in spite of the reboot, this character remains in the three Daniel Craig's Bond movies but Moneypenny comes into picture in the third Daniel Craig movie... It seems like the script-writer did not see any of the previous Bond movies but got an idea from someone and prepared a rubbish script... <br/><br/>3- I do not understand what the script-writer thinks of the audience... Who in the world would fascinate seeing childish endeavours of story- telling wrapped up in a high-profile espionage drama... The idea of Bond taking M and vanishing into the highlands of Scotland to save her life trying to keep the villain from tracking them and yet getting attacked by a gunship helicopter is criminally outrageous.. Why in the world would Bond think like a 05 year old and try to leave the city, take M's life into his own hand and not take advantages of modern-day technology?... Wait a minute, no!!!... It's not Bond... It's the movie makers who should be hung upside down and whipped at least 80 lashes each for trying to fool the audience... <br/><br/>4- We have seen Bond in high-profile international espionages and much more interesting and intriguing plots... This is the 3rd or 4th movie where an MI6 agent goes rogue and tries to hurt back... Enough is enough... quit cheating the audience... and by the way, I must thank the movie-makers to turn an actor like Javier Bardem into a fagot... I've seen much more miserable characters but this one tops the chart... No scope of acting for him, still I think he made a good deal of money... good for him though...<br/><br/>5- To conclude this review I would like to bring the other viewers into recalling the time when Bond is sent to China where he meets Severine... I mean there should be some sense in that... Severine's character is strange beyond reasons... She risks her life for Bond willingly in taking him to Silva and gets shot in the end... is there any sense why she is willing to let herself die for one night spent with Bond? If this kind of effect Bond has on women, than he is a sorcerer, not a spy...<br/><br/>In the end I would like to give some advice to the team behind this deceit to movie lovers... Be creative, quit cheating others and come up with a sensible plot next time... We are not going to spend money on car chases and seeing the hero survive gun-shots and fall from a bridge altogether... this was done much more convincingly in Die Another Day, which, to me, by far, is the best Bond movie ever..."

","(Alert: this review contain a few spoilers)<br/><br/>First of all I want to clarify that I have 48 years and I am a fan of the Bond movies of all life. Just making a basic generalization could say seeing all the Bonds prior to Daniel Craig (whom I liked Casino Royale), I always leaves the theater thinking ... how I wish be Bond! But Quantum ... and now Skyfall ... Who the hell wants to be a Bond like this???! I'm sick of him looking at the horizon with abstracted gaze, pessimistic ... sick of the scenery dark frame absurd, pathetic villains (though here Barden gives the best you can).! Also there's nothing glamorous these films. Nobody ever has fun ... anywhere! Neither the Casino scene extras make a move to be entertained ... Most look like they are bound in a dungeon! In addition, this Bond has less power of seduction with womens than a rusty vibrator! Has not culture at all, lives drunk and dirty... and does not eat! At least nothing worth eating, especially if you're 007! I ask you this ... if you are the producer of Bond, you have the money and the machine to make films ... not would hire five, six ... Ten teams of writers to bring you a good script???! Unbelievable that anyone approve such a mess to film, especially considering that Michael Wilson is still in the game (or he is only a signature without power?). I leave the analysis of the plot (ridiculous and childish), the performances and direction for others with more patience. The last two Bond films have exhausted me. Greetings to all readers!"
"gabriele-5-90518","5","11","23","2 December 2012"," Weakest 007 ever
","I can't believe that so much money has been poured in a story so weak and so predictable.<br/><br/>I'm really disappointed, not a good movie beside the special effects. <br/><br/>The actors are good, is not about them, the story is just lame and with no substance.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is good like always, Javier Bardem always fantastic when he makes the part of the crazy psycho, perhaps its forte. I gave 5 to the movie just for these two actors that actually would deserve more.<br/><br/>The only good news is that Judi Dench is finally out of her part. What was she doing there? She was fundamentally surreal, put in there at the vertix of the politically correct era, it was obviously not her cup of tea, an old grandmother almost 80 years old with evidently no understanding of technology is running the most sophisticated secret service in the world? It's beyond incredible.<br/><br/>Will wait for the next James Bond movie, hopefully it will be better or the series will not survive its mid life crisis.<br/><br/>Being over 50 is hard for everybody, probably even for James Bond."

","Mendes so meticulously crafts scenes to explore story themes that he completely misses the spirit of Bond, kills the character, and delivers a soulless movie.<br/><br/>THIS WILL BE FULL OF SPOILERS If there's one scene that encapsulates this entire movie, it's the scene where M is reciting pretentious poetry interspersed with action scenes involving Bond. The inter-cut action scenes are boring but that doesn't matter. In Mendes hands, it's the pretensions that are important. The action scenes are only there to add symbolic weight to the words of the poem -- or to be strung together as pieces of ""art"" and paraded as a Bond movie. Ironically, there's no scene of classy performance art like we normally get in a Bond movie (we DO get it in the latest Mission Impossible movie). It's ""Skyfall"" itself that gets passed-off as ""classy"" performance art.<br/><br/>It's as though Mendes felt that, having delivered a good Bond mini-movie in the pre-credit sequence, he had fulfilled his obligation to Bond fans and was now free create a personal art project (merely checking some Bond boxes along the way) -- and an overly serious and boring art project at that.<br/><br/>As for the plot of ""Skyfall"", there's not a SINGLE scene in this entire movie that makes any sense what-so-ever from a plot perspective. John Logan, who wrote the brilliant Hugo, must have simply been brought-in to add wit and story themes to the existing script -- not concerning himself at all about the, apparently, necessary plot faults. Yes, I can only think the producers believe major plot faults to be NECESSARY to a Bond movie as they refuse to make the movies without these faults. With the near total lack of truly Bondian action set-pieces, all these major plot faults, simply and unfortunately, cannot be ignored.<br/><br/>For those that think I've overly harped on the plot faults, consider... This Bond movie had pretensions of being taken as a serious thriller. It has an academy award winning director at its helm and is filled with top-tier actors and actresses. It has a celebrated writing team. The producers have publicly bragged about this script and all the time (YEARS) that they had to perfect it. All this and they give us a story no more cohesive than that of ""Moonraker""(and, amazingly, even less original) -- but with none of that movie's stunts, gadgets, or special effects to hide the craters. It's enough to make one forget one's complaints about double-taking pigeons, gondola-car hybrids, and henchman who fall in love with teenage girls half their height.<br/><br/>THEN, there's the ""a storm is coming"" line. PLEASE. I can't begin to count the number of times I've heard that line used as metaphor in a movie but I think the first time was WAY back in the first Terminator movie. Logan, Mendes, and Craig should ALL be flogged for this. THIS is art?! This is our 50 year anniversary gift for all our support over the years -- and the new formula!? Old formula -- the plot and story must never make sense and we'll have great panache-laden action set-pieces to hide the fact. New formula -- the plot and story must never make sense and we'll have well-acted ""art"" scenes to hide the fact -- and the action set-pieces are to be thrown-out (the baby with the bath water).<br/><br/>I appreciate the great performances, theme explorations, artistic devices, drama and cinematography. I really do. These are needed additions to the Bond series. However, if ""Skyfall"" is supposed to be the new direction of Bond -- all the dumb story and plot faults we've come to expect of the franchise but none of the special effects, set-pieces, thrills, stunts, gadgets, panache and fun -- the series will never make it close to another 50 years.<br/><br/>Happy Birthday anyway Mr. Bond. You may have done nothing for us lately but we appreciate your cumulative service. Now, I'll stop ""expecting you"" as you've now become, yourself, an ""uninvited guest"". As I said, you've committed an unforgivable sin. You bored me.<br/><br/>James Bond is Dead (with a capital ""D""). Long Live Mission Impossible."

It would have been a good something-else secret agent movie, but not a James Bond movie. A big dude sitting next to me was with his girlfriend, (he was so excited before the movie started,) slept after about 30 minutes all the way through the end of this movie. People leaving this packed theater seemed depressed after the movie was over. Some understandably left the movie early. It would have been good if it named something else; otherwise, people are misled thinking and waiting for the charming, witty, smart, fast-pace, mysterious, sweet-talk British agent guy with unimaginably surprised gadget to show up."

At Skyfall, the conflict between the mother and sons is resolved. What? Why all the psychological stuff? Well, I didn't put it there, the people who made the movie put it there. Was this stuff put in to make it more interesting? To me, this is the first ""Weird"" Bond. I felt a lot of the stuff the movie was about had nothing to do with spying, secret agents, stuff like that.

The final output is big flop, another phantom of solace. I never expected such a pathetic movie when bond completed golden jubilee of 50 years, and I don't think they invested 200 million, for me they spent 20 million for the movie, and they going to get pocketed almost 1 billion dollars with big hype. Bond movie should be international, and not a domestic bond.

Here are a few points:<br/><br/>The scenery and cinematography, as always, are terrific. This was probably great on IMAX.<br/><br/>I find Daniel Craig to be way too serious and almost constantly pained in some way. Granted, in character and in real life, there were a number of physical setbacks. Past Bonds have always had some degree of humor and fun, but in this film, Craig delivers a few marginally funny lines, not convincingly. <br/><br/>So many eye-rolling absurdities exist, most notably the ""Silence of the Lambs"" -ish and the ""Batman Begins""-ish sequences. So many scenarios that are completely unbelievable, regardless of how hard you try to twist them into believability. <br/><br/>The justification for the villain's actions are a bit silly, if you ask me. The character doesn't show much range. <br/><br/>Overall, it's just not one of the best, not by a long shot."

Please don't try ever again to make James Bond "" more real, more human"". You cannot make him real, he is not supposed to be real!!!

","To be quite frank the only part of this film i liked was when bond was shot. Because (apparently) MGM has lost their mind. First of all, if they wanted a blond bond, Neil Patrick Harris would have been a much better choice. If a blond bond is acceptable, than Huston, we have aproblem! Craig resembles nothing but a common street bum. Hese got a bit too much attitude. The bond series was going fine until he took the job. (i myself prefer Rogor Moore) Daniel Craig is the most overrated actor in the history of the world. As for the film, we've got a black money penny, and a blond 007, oh yeah this is gonna be a great film!(if you haven't guessed by now that was sarcasm) I would have loved this film but there was one big flaw, bigger than the fact that we've got the most Unsexy bond in the history of films. It was the fact that there was no black whole thing where James bond came up to it and shot it. How anyone liked this film i will never know. 7 years ago when i watched casino royale i noticed all of this and everyone else there loved it. Well i stood up and said no! you cant do that, because James bond isn't a blond wimp! and that, is why Craig is the worst bond.

Basic plot of the movie isn't tough bond has show his loyalty towards his boss ""M"" as she gets into a trouble this time. The film isn't just about Bond it's about M and her journey over the years as the head. The movie emphasises on is M's relationship with bond. Coming to the casting Daniel has done a good performance but sometimes he is more like Bourne rather bond type. Judi as ""M"" has done a great job on her role as usual to say the she is the women lead with a meaty role. The bond girls didn't much screen space allocated. The villain this time Javier Bardem as a crazy, lunatic, venomous Silva has done a brilliant job. But his makeover was menacing with a blonde hair. We could say he was like The Dark knight heath ledger type of villain. ""Q"" by Ben whishaw (Perfume movie hero) looks apt in the role. The director Sam Mendes gives more importance to the script, dialogues where this movie being the most emotional Bond movie yet like bond revisiting his home and M's farewell. This movie has got standard ingredients like oriental music, very few gadgets, backless gowns, attracting villain girlfriend, tricky action sequences but as a limited version where story sentiments and dialogues takes over much. But comparing to the last flick Quantum of Solace this is definitely a better one. Verdict: Low on gadgets, high on drama and closer to some realistic stuff.

","""Old dog, new tricks"" says Eve played by Naomie Harris and the movie pretty much sticks to that. But after starting off on such a high note with the Casino Royale, does that ""old dog"" and his ""new tricks"" live up to the hype and expectations? ""SkyFall"" directed by Sam Mendes is something that i could sum-up as a ""wanna-be-Nolan-movie"". Don't get me wrong here. The plot here is indeed dark but it never gets darker than the screen. The sense of intrigue and tension is near-to-absent and the background score makes it worse by playing the traditional bond tune that we are so used to by now thereby making it look somewhat silly at times.<br/><br/>On the bright side, the action sequences are spectacularly choreographed especially the first 10 minutes has some of the best action sequences seen in any bond film and an action piece involving a comodo dragon was totally fun to watch.<br/><br/>But what bothered me were the bloody boring gaps. There are way too many dry spells in between and it all could have been excused if I cared about the characters. But the screenplay just doesn't do justice to the actors.<br/><br/>There is humor, some intentional, some unintentional and there are a few good one-liners thrown in. However, they are far and few in between and all that dialog would have made sense if there was some layer/depth to the characters or the story.<br/><br/>In the acting department everyone's done a fair job but it's ""Javier Bardem"" who stands out for making a lamely written clichéd negative character look marginally interesting.<br/><br/>Conclusion: For me ""Skyfall"" is an overrated film that comes dangerously close to being an average movie. It's an uneven piece of work that probably wouldn't disappoint if you keep your expectations as low as possible."
"DICK STEEL","10","21","51","26 October 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Skyfall
","It's the 50th anniversary of Ian Fleming's James Bond on the big screen, and the character is celebrating that milestone with his 23rd film outing in what would be the longest running film franchise that had seen the mantle being passed on from actor to actor, and helmed by various directors providing their vision of the debonair spy in Her Majesty's Secret Service. Skyfall continues the good work set out by Casino Royale, with director Sam Mendes achieving a remarkable balance between celebrating that milestone jubilee, while setting the stage for the future films with potential to be fulfilled.<br/><br/>Skyfall is an ominous sounding title, and the events here close a chapter, and reopens another, with two more Bond films in the works and may be shot back to back to compensate the rather long gap of four years between this one, and the rather lacklustre Quantum of Solace. We're still firmly into Bond's reboot of sorts with Martin Campbell taking over the reins with Casino Royale after having done so with GoldenEye, which charted Daniel Craig's induction as the new Bond, and two films on we have seen a more serious Bond at work, as compared to his predecessors. This film will change all that, through the subtleties in giving Bond that unmistakable sense of humour, and the introduction of a Q branch boasting a youthful looking Q in Ben Whishaw, which puts the character in very different light from versions of the past, and promising much more fanciful gadgets (or perhaps maybe not, given the rather old school-ness of this Q) in the coming installments.<br/><br/>And by the time the end credits roll, much of the Bond elements missing from the Craig versions so far, will have been introduced, which is a fitting way to celebrate one's 50th year, in a way going full circle. But that doesn't mean alienating the established fan base who grew from the era of Sean Connery's version, or any of the other earlier incarnations. The scribes in Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan managed to weave in a number of easter eggs from James Bond's film history into the movie, which is an extremely nice touch when they appear, to rapturous applause by audience members who instantly recognized those blast from the past nods.<br/><br/>But the story's not all nostalgia, as it deals with a more immediate, direct and personal threat this time round, as compared to the more bombastic, dastardly plans that classic Bond villains usually have. It deals with the challenges any security agency would face in today's environment where the enemy is seldom overtly known, but having gone underground, and is rather faceless, yet ready to strike at any time. Javier Bardem got invited by Daniel Craig to play the villainous Silva, a one time collaborator under M (Judi Dench), but now hell bent on seeking revenge against M for what he calls as sins of the past. Which Bond is now only too familiar with given the prologue's botched attempt at retrieving a sacred hard drive, and M's insistence on sticking to her guns and judgement call when instructing another fellow agent Eve (Naomie Harris) to take a shot that resulting in his temporal retirement from active service.<br/><br/>And it's rather interesting here to see a less than able Bond at work, as compared to the earlier versions where his feathers were rarely ruffled. Here, he huffs and puffs his way through, and in some ways, found himself in pretty unfamiliar territory despite London being called home. In most, if not all, of the films, he would be jet setting to exotic locations, and rarely had to operate at home, so having Bond back in London and fighting for what he believes in, is another cinematic milestone that took some 23 years to come to fruition. Daniel Craig's Bond has never been quite the polished, finished article, and this film continues in his development as the master spy, albeit one who is rather out of shape and out of touch for the most parts.<br/><br/>The villains here were a little less colourful than their counterparts in earlier films, and I suppose Bardem's Silva is likely to polarize audiences between thinking he's the epitome of evil, or a rather ineffective one that falls into the usual trappings. There's a distinct lack of a colourful henchman as well, although Patrice (Ola Rapace) did share a very elegantly shot fight sequence with Bond, completely in silhouette, in Shanghai. Sam Mendes puts the style back into the Bond franchise, allowing this installment to stand head and shoulders above other more contemporary spy films, that any Bond film would be proud of.<br/><br/>While other touches such as the introduction of Kincade (Albert Finney) for that connection and bit exploration into Bond's past, and Ralph Fiennes' Gareth Mallory to verbal spar with M, perhaps the Bond girls this time round lacked a little bit of presence. In fact I would like to suggest that THE Bond girl here is M herself, for having this story centered around her and the dedicated screen time she gets, as compared to the likes of Harris' Eve as a field operative with a nice final treatment, and Berenice Marlohe's Severine, which is that classical femme fatale that didn't have much to do, really.<br/><br/>Still, there's a lot more to love in this Bond film that would rank it as good as Craig's initial film, with a more intimate plot setting that strikes closer to the heart and souls of the principal characters involved, while keeping the doors very much wide open for more adventures given a new team set in place. Sam Mendes now has the origins assembled proper, which only promises of better things yet to come in the future. Happy 50th anniversary Mr Bond!"

(Don't worry, that is all I will say about the plot!) <br/><br/>The script is so well done, you truly do get the idea of impending doom and the only person who can save us all is 007 himself. Sure there are explosions, car chases, fights, etc but there are certainly less explosions and more of the traditional things in Bond movies.<br/><br/>Adele's ""Skyfall"" theme tune is so amazing, it gave me tingles down my spine as the sequence starts, and believe me it is at a truly epic part of the movie! <br/><br/>All the lead characters were played so well though I thought one of the bond girls (I won't name!) was on for too short a-time and it would have been nice to see more of her, calling her a Bond girl was slightly exaggerating as she is really just a plug in a small hole in the plot.<br/><br/>This movie truly is going back to the old style of Bond, you will find a lot more tongue-in-cheek humour, a few more of the old-Bond characters are back. However, rather than being sentimental about it, they've brought Bond into the 21st Century (after 12 years, its good of them to join us) If you are a Bond fan, this is the movie for you, its great, action packed and just fantastically British!<br/><br/>Bring on the next instalment!"
"richard-2227","1","13","29","17 November 2012"," Boring
","I don't usually write reviews. But how is it possible to make a BORING Bond film? The pacing was lethargic, the directing insipid. Sam Mendes isn't the right director for this genre and the chases and stunts we have ALL seen before. From the opening scene, we were just in rewind. Nothing new here.<br/><br/>There were glaring issues: the goal of recovering the hard drive faded as the movie went on. Bond's pistol with signature grip is treated as something new. There were continuity issues--Bond's old rifle at Skyfall suddenly becomes a shotgun. And an entire group of hit men walk past the old Aston with Bond lying down inside. <br/><br/>Where the HELL is Martin Campbell when you need him? And why isn't Daniel Craig smart enough to put a good team around him? Script, script, script. If the money they spent bribing the media about this film went into the production, then hey maybe they had half a chance. But the movie industry doesn't work like that.<br/><br/>There's NO WAY IMDb has an average for this movie of 8 out of 10. Did the producers simply pay off IMDb too? Casino Royale is the best Bond film in living memory. I just feel so sorry for Daniel Craig. A good actor who cares about his part. Surrounded by underachievers.<br/><br/>Kill off the franchise or treat it seriously. But don't do this!<br/><br/>Boring."
"grumpy-3","1","13","29","16 November 2012"," this is not bond this is boring
","They have finally killed off James Bond, Skyfall has to be the worst Bond ever. No script, no pace, no energy a lifeless plodding mess. This is a typical Same Mendes film, the guy has no idea. Daniel Craig is a good actor and from what I can see in interviews a decent bloke. But his Bond is wooden, without with or charm and certainly not suave. A stupid plot about a hard done by ex agent, who is going to bring MI6 down, with a list of all its agents, which half way through the film is completely forgotten about. All we have here is a below average, action thriller, where the thrills and action pieces are not exciting at all. The saddest thing is that because of the huge success of the film this is what we are going to get in the future. Bond was created as a mythical fantasy figure, who wisecracked was good at his job taking us places we would never get to. The girls, gadgets and guns, were what made the films stand out from any other action movie, now they are gone, to be replaced by so called reality, which by the way this film does not depict in any credible way, there just would not be a public parliamentary enquiry about the secret services. As for the sheep that are today's critics yet again they have not reviewed the film but the people who made it."
"ugly5","2","13","29","8 November 2012"," Bond without swagger
","How can you create a James Bond character almost completely devoid of swagger and bravado? James Bond should drip with both, but he does not in this movie. In fact, I have to agree with another review where Bond was characterized as a bystander in the movie, reacting rather than driving the action. This Bond is also stupid. ***Spoiler*** He's surprised to learn that his flat was sold after he was presumed dead. An international spy can't anticipate that fact. His stupidity manifests again when he leads Sylva into a ""trap"" at his boyhood home in Scotland. Where he failed to anticipate that the family gun collection would have been sold. Again, after he was presumed dead. AND he didn't bring any guns with him. This Bond reeks of incompetence.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also distracting...with the Bond theme heavily overused.<br/><br/>Cinematography, however, is spot on. The Movie is beautiful."

","FIRST, THE CONS<br/><br/>Sorry, feminists, but M has to be a man and not some granny.<br/><br/>Also, Bond works alone. He does not report to his grandmother on the radio, taking instructions about how to deal with a villain on top of a train. Bond is a rogue and he has contempt for his superiors. <br/><br/>Moneypenny has no chemistry with Bond and her character is otherwise poorly written.<br/><br/>The one-liners are not really funny.<br/><br/>The villain looks like something that escaped from a Batman movie. He is possibly the most ridiculous villain in the history of Bond movies. To make things worse the film explores loyalty, friendship, and identity issues, which clash with this joke of a villain.<br/><br/>'Q' is another joke that doesn't fit and has no chemistry with Bond. Also, they have abandoned the use of clever gadgets and instead shift the focus on Q and his fancy computers. <br/><br/>In general the film struggles trying to be a Bond film. It's insecure and comes across as a combination of elements form several other movies, like Jason Bourne and Batman. They never manage to find a distinct tone.<br/><br/>Bond's love interest is killed off before we even learn who she is. Also, we see more of Bond showing off his muscular body than we see pretty women. In a totally unnecessary scene we see him swimming in a pool and then just sitting there in his swimming trunks. Is this political correctness kicking in? Must we have female bosses and semi-naked men? Must Moneypenny be an action girl, as well as black? Must Q be a homosexual? <br/><br/>The film jumps over significant events for no apparent reason and totally forgets that exposition is necessary at times. <br/><br/>The third act is dull, illogical, and it all ends with a huge anti-climax.<br/><br/>NOW THE PROS<br/><br/>The opening credits is the only moment in the film that will actually give you the chills.<br/><br/>I am actually somewhat optimistic about the next film - provided they learn from their mistakes.<br/><br/>Craig is an excellent choice for Bond, but he needs a much better script."

"DubhDoo","9","13","29","29 October 2012"," Daniel Craig returns with a bang in the best Bond yet
","""You know the rules of the game, you've been playing it all these years"", says Judi Dench to Craig's James Bond in an early scene. This line mirrors the importance of this year in the 007 canon; it has been half a decade since Sean Connery first donned the tux in Dr. No and over that time we've come to know Mr. Bond and experience the good, the bad and the ugly. For Skyfall, this birthday had to be kept in mind, as following the disappointing mess-and-a-half that was Quantum of (any?) Solace, the film had to be good, first and foremost, but it also couldn't be your regular Bond adventure - something had to change. Fortunately, director Sam Mendes (who worked with Craig on Road to Perdition) has breathed new life into this long- running franchise, taking bold moves that pay-off brilliantly.<br/><br/>During an attempt to recover sensitive information from an enemy operative, Bond is mistakenly shot by a fellow agent (Naoime Harris). But when a cyber-terrorist (Javier Bardem) targets MI6, Bond returns, however he finds his loyalty to M tested as her past comes to haunt her.<br/><br/>""All the physical stuff, so dull"", remarks Bardem's Silva in his first encounter with Bond. However, the same cannot be said for the film's action sequences - they are magnificent and exhilarating. From the Istanbul-set pre-credits scene to a heart-pounding chase which occurs on the London Underground, Skyfall delivers some of the best action since Bane came to Gotham or Iko Uwais had a few floors to climb. All these sequences are aided not only by Sam Mendes, but also by Roger Deakins' extraordinary cinematography, bringing a majesty to these scenes to rival Wally Pfister's recent work with Christopher Nolan. Highlights include a scrap inside a Shanghai skyscraper lit entirely by neon advertising and the one shot/ single take introduction to the antagonist.<br/><br/>In Casino Royale, Daniel Craig took us all by storm, but with Quantum of (I don't see any) Solace, he experienced an unfortunate stumble; thankfully, within the opening seconds of Skyfall you can breathe a sigh of relief as Mr. Craig basically tells the audience that he's back and this time he means business. He has also never been better in the role, making it entirely his own and delivering sharp one-liners with dry and sardonic wit, whilst retaining nuance emotion and grit. Yet, this 23rd Eon outing belongs to Judi Dench just as much as it does to Craig; it has taken seven films, but M has finally been given the film she deserves, proving every bit as engaging ad 007 - she is the definitive Bond girl. Bardem is a wonderful standout in this impeccable cast; mildly camp, but properly menacing, he brings depth to the normally one-dimensional role of the 'Bond villain'.<br/><br/>Yet much of the film's greatness belongs to Sam Mendes, he takes many audacious risks that most directors would pass over in favour of Bond conventions, and while the film's first hour does feature many of them, its second half delves into Bond and M's pasts, before descending to a Straw Dogs (Peckinpah)-esque Scotland-set third act, which oddly works. He brings a sophistication to the series, allowing a reading of Tennyson to sit seamlessly alongside a cameo from a particular car. This isn't just a brilliant Bond film, this is a brilliant film fullstop. Undoubtedly one of the films of the year, it's exciting, funny, tense and emotional - the 50th anniversary has brought with it the best Bond yet. I absolutely loved it and can't wait to see it again."
"giuseppeabba001","9","13","29","26 October 2012"," Craig's best Bond!
","From seeing the first trailer, I was looking forward to this film and it did not disappoint.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig made a grand entrance as 007, as he has in the previous two films. The acting is great, along with some sparks of comedy which was nice to see. The fight scenes are intense and keep your heart going, the plot is clever and full of surprises while not going too over the top.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes has done a great job on Skyfall. The locations he's chosen are new and exotic (even the scenes based in London). The cinematography is crisp and clean, keeping the film looking as a Bond film should.<br/><br/>My only criticism is a CGI Komodo Dragon which appears briefly in one scene. It's clear the editors didn't spend much time on that, making the end result look a bit too fake. But don't let that bother you too much. Just sit back and enjoy a good 2 hours of Action, drama, and Javier Bardem's hair."
"jenssvendsen7219","2","18","43","5 November 2012"," Bond is NOT bisexual
","Skyfall is really an entertaining movie, and it clears out a lot of mistakes that have reduced Bond lately, paving the way for a renewed Bond.<br/><br/>It would in fact be a ten-star movie if it - sadly - wasn't for a couple of unforgivable flaws.<br/><br/>Two to be exact: 1) In a real Bond movie the logo appears just after the opening scene ends. Anything else is a stupid postmodern ""change-for-the-sake-of-change-ain't-we-smart"" thing, to which the answer is NO, and three stars off.<br/><br/>2) In ONE scene there is ONE sentence which suggests that Bond MIGHT be bisexual.<br/><br/>He.Is.NOT.<br/><br/>Let's put that in perspective, shall we? If anyone is bisexual it's his or her own business. I'm neither a puritan, religious, or against movie heroes that are not heterosexual. (I really like the cop in Boondock Saints, for example).<br/><br/>So the reason that this one sentence pisses offends me is simple: Craig may be as bisexual as he pleases. It was his idea (already suggested a couple of years ago) that Bond ""should be"" ""modernized"" by letting him show sexual interest in other men.<br/><br/>But bisexuality is not modern, in fact it's as old as mankind. So I don't mind if Craig is bisexual, that's his business. But: Bond.Is.Not.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig has tried to explain this nonsense away with further nonsense about the remark ""just being a part of the game between the two men in question"". But the scene cannot be mistaken, and the idea that ""Bond should be modernized by making him bisexual"" was suggested explicitly by Craig years ago - at the time when ""Quantum of Solace"" came out. His excuses now are lame, and he also adds bisexual anecdotes from his own life to rub it in that he really doesn't mean them.<br/><br/>Skyfall is excellent entertainment, but borrows heavily from other movies, especially in the ""Batman origin story"" it presents. My big problem with Skyfall is, that the main character is NOT a person named James Bond. It's a sexually confused man named Daniel Craig who apparently also has a personality disorder that makes him think he is a fictional character by the name of James Bond. The people who say that with this movie ""Bond is back"" are sadly mistaken. This is the only movie allegedly in the franchise where the real James Bond is not present at all.<br/><br/>Bond is a notorious womanizer. I don't praise that either, but that's a part of what defines Bond. Tampering with that - well, lets see where further modernizations might lead us ... (YIKES!).<br/><br/>If this ""modernization"" is ""acceptable"" to the wide public, then I suggest that Bond be further ""modernized"" by adding sexual interest in sheep and kindergarten kids in the course of the next two movies.<br/><br/>If not, then kick Craig and the producers etc. that allowed this breakdown of the established character, and let's get a lot of new movies with a REAL Bond again in the near future.<br/><br/>The bisexual disaster means ten stars off. We are now at minus three. Then add eight stars for having made a movie that CAN lead to REAL Bond again IF - and only IF - these errors (bisexuality, Craig, logo displacement) are permanently removed once and for all going from the next movie.<br/><br/>Then subtract three stars again thinking of the risk of actually seeing Bond in bed and kissing with another man next time.<br/><br/>And then you have two stars, where there could and should have been ten. A pair of scissors could have made the necessary changes (except removing Craig) in less than two minutes.<br/><br/>It's high time for a new Bond. It has been, ever since Craig made his stupid proposal around the time of ""Quantum of Solace"".<br/><br/>I posted this review before stressing why I think it is a good thing that some people will call this review unhelpful. I am refraining from doing so in this version of review, and I have actually stated clearly (as well as in the original) that peoples sexual inclination are their own business.<br/><br/>I just think Craig's personal idea that - quote - ""sexual divisions don't mean the world"" is his personal opinion. James Bond would strongly disagree. Anyone knowing Bond knows that.<br/><br/>Anyone accepting even the slightest hint of bisexuality in James Bond - or thus accepting Craig as ""Bond"" are completely unaware of what Bond has been about for fifty years, and they should just stay away from James Bond.<br/><br/>Bond is not bisexual, and people who mistake the main character in this movie for Bond are therefore rather confused themselves. At least in the Bond department.<br/><br/>This movie is just an action movie falsely posing as a Bond movie.<br/><br/>But ""Skyfall"" is NOT at Bond movie at all, and cannot truly count as such, at least until the bisexual remark is removed. Not just by private editing, but officially removed and withdrawn.<br/><br/>So go on and vote unhelpful. Really. It just serves as a counter for people who don't know what they are talking about."

The attempts at injecting humour generally fall flat and the villain is more of a puppet than The Hood from ""Thunderbirds"". Not very exotic locations, all seen at night anyway, Daniel Craig looks more like George Sewell from ""Special Branch"" than ever and since when have tube trains run on the District Line? (It's a sub surface line and uses normal height rolling stock). The Aston Martin DB5 makes a re-appearance but, as in the Brosnan years, still lacks the revolving number plate box on the front bumper (it has a normal plate screwed to the bumper instead). Oh well, back to the Blu-ray box set!"
"The_Other_Snowman","5","10","21","16 March 2016"," Two Hours of Outtakes
","You can plainly tell that Daniel Craig's heart was not in it. He mumbles his lines through a mouthful of marbles, as if he thought he had to save his real performance for the big night. The first result of that approach is the gaping vacuum where a strong protagonist should be: James Bond lacks even the barest intimation of charisma, for perhaps the first time. The second result is that, when the film was over, I had absolutely no idea what it was about.<br/><br/>I will admit I'm not really a fan of the series. The overlong action scenes and over-the-top stunts tend to bore me. ""Skyfall"" promised to be more down to earth, and for the most part lacks the franchise's trademark set-pieces. What action scenes there are, however, go on far too long: for example, Bond fighting a henchman atop a moving train until you've forgotten who's who and why they're brawling with each other, and stopped caring. And while it skips the gadgets and one-liners, it's still a hopelessly slick Hollywood product, staged and lit and digitally enhanced to within an inch of its life.<br/><br/>The plot -- from what I could tell -- seemed to be an extended excuse for the series' continued existence long after the end of the Cold War. Many of the secondary characters argue over the role of old-fashioned spies and intelligence agencies in an era of global terrorism and cyber-criminals, as if preemptively addressing criticism of escapist action films. The villain is a former MI6 agent with a needlessly elaborate plan to wreak vengeance on his former employer, Judi Dench. I think he wins in the end, though by that point in the film, over two hours since it all started, I wasn't paying very close attention."

","Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have seen most with the exception of a few Bond movies. I have to say I am more inclined to watch the newer movies due to the updated action sequences and the overall feel of the movies, however as much as I like Brosnan and Craig I have to say that the transition to Craig is starting to lose the original appeal of Bond. If you are looking for what the original Bond was please go back and watch movies like ""The man with the Golden Gun"" ""Live and Let die"". The Bond Character Was far smoother and the one liners to the villains and the women were witty and just smooth! Craig was getting there, I was not a huge fan of Casino Royal but I have come around as Q Of S brought out more of Craig and showed he could hold his own and was bring more of a story and his acting background to the role....He was more layered and a story was forming.<br/><br/>That being said Skyfall......this just destroyed CR and Q of S! I'm sorry I am a big Bond fan and the fact that the Marketing Campaign flagged this as the best Bond film ever.....what a joke. The first scene was great! It really set the movie up and then from there were so many holes. How did he survive the gun shot and drowning? Why did the therapist say skyfall, how would that word get integrated into a personality profile? Where did the villain come from? Just a quick visual synopsis of Silva would have done so much justice to the character. The bond girl, wow what character development there! She stared at Bond after he killed a spy, had a drink, Had a shower and got shot.....all the time with absolutely no expression on her face. She had the appeal of a Grapefruit. No offense to the actor but the character didn't have a chance.<br/><br/>Why did Bond shoot every other Bad guy and leave Silva alive. He had the shot and Silva just killed the girl. Every other movie that guy would have been in a box before he had a chance to speak. So lets say he left the villain alive for an elaborate escape later......So the villain knew he would be in a cell, Q would do something stupid and then it would start a series of events that lead to his escape.....and we don't get to see that either! I expected so much more from Silva, he really did nothing but take his teeth out and flirt with Bond.<br/><br/>The last half of the movie was uneventful and even the final action sequence left a lot to be desired. Since when does James Bond Walk up behind the Villain and stab him in the back????? Did Bond Fight the villain once? Bardem could have been one of the best Bond villains ever but fell way to short.<br/><br/>Other areas with no explanation were: <br/><br/>Silva's hacking ability was never explored it was just part of the story.<br/><br/>Why are the writers going back to the old story line of ""Is Bond still useful in this world?"" hence the court room scene where they are interrogating M.<br/><br/>So I guess all the other agents are dead.....what happened to the agent list they lost? Did M not say she was going to finish the Job? If this comes out in the next movie than I guess I can take that one back as it would be a good intro and tie in to this movie like CR to Q of S.<br/><br/>Some of the things I did like were brining back Q, Money Penny and the new M. I think the next Bond movie could be very good if done right. Bring back the Bond that has compassion for good, give a good actor like Craig better dialogue and for the respect of the franchise develop the storyline."

It seems to be that the film steals several ideas from other films but fails to deliver as a whole. The helicopter scene at end reminds me of Lethal Weapon 2- but its done better in that film. Why would a top agent drive to Scotland with no weapons or back up with head of MI6 ?<br/><br/>And the most ridiculous thing was the Bond girl. He knows she is a sex slave- wants to be freed from all this- so just appears naked in shower later on to take advantage of her vulnerability. Then she gets killed quickly.<br/><br/>Daft."
"AThames","7","6","11","24 July 2013"," Great action, great scenes, mediocre story and weak characters
","I can see this movie has received very mixed reviews. A lot of IMDb users hates it with a passion, a lot think that it's mediocre, and some loves it. All critics loves it. I was personally loving it during the beginning. The intro song was not the best ever, but it was okay. The intro scenes however were awesome. The action scenes in the beginning were awesome as well, especially the chase scene. The cinematography and soundtrack was great as well. Very beautiful shots of the cities(especially London, felt very ""londonish"") and landscape. Some of the still shots of Bond were a bit melodramatic but beautiful as well, also; clichées are allowed in a Bond movie (well done clichées that is). The villain was great as well (Javier Bardem is up there as one of the greatest villain actors ever). Overall, the acting was very good. <br/><br/>Now for the bad stuff. The story was a bit weak. I can accept that Bond is pushing the boundaries of realism, but why did he need to get shot, fall 100 feet, land on his back in the water, then get sucked in to a waterfall? It makes no sense. If he just got shot and passed out, and fell 10 feet or something like that, it had been much more acceptable. Not that it matters a lot, but it does bug me a little. I also know that hacking is the new magic in Hollywood, but it became a bit ridiculous in this movie. They should start to become a bit more aware of the fact that the audience is getting more knowledgeable about computers, programming etc. There is no need to present ""hacking"" as some kind of magic universe where everything is possible, like presenting the hackers monitor as some kind of visual labyrinth in which you need to maneuver through an orb of 1's and 0's, or the annoying ""the faster you type, the better you are hacking"" rule etc. Some of the characters were also a bit weak. The bond girl in particular, what was up with that?<br/><br/>All in all a good movie, but with some annoying little flaws."
"junknews","1","8","16","11 March 2015"," Worst Bond movie ever
","How this movie got a rating of 7.8 I don't know. Actually, it is part of an increasing trend I'm seeing on IMDb where rating scores seem to be manipulated. There are quite a few movies in the Top 250 of all time that very clearly should not be.<br/><br/>Best thing about Skyfall - the theme song. That's it.<br/><br/>Worst thing - the plot, or more precisely, the total lack of a plot. Let me be clear about this, there is no plot at all - not even an unrealistic plot, none whatsoever.<br/><br/>Instead of a plot, it has a series of half-baked, overused, puerile semi-excuses to glue together a few comic-book inspired ""action"" sequences. Those ""action"" sequences are about as realistic as pigs with wings.<br/><br/>This reduces Bond to ""Bond good guy. Fights bad guy."" A sad day for Fleming when a supposed Bond movie is even worse than one of the Fast & Furious movies I accidentally watched the other week. (No idea which one.) <br/><br/>I wish there was more to comment on, but ""Skyfall"" is to movies what a ""Scandinavian Blue"" is to parrots."
"BirdmanT7","Null","8","16","30 November 2014"," Soap opera Bond, entirely overrated.
","It's just ironic how this Bond film""Skyfall"" gets a 7.8 rating here on IMDb and yet almost 90% of people's reviews are all negative?. <br/><br/>I happen to like the first two Bond films with Craig as Bond. I never liked Brosnan at all, but Craig really created a more charismatic Bond almost as Connery did in the ""Doctor No"". I remember years back reading a article I read in the Calendar of the LA Times reading an article about Craig picked as the new James Bond and how the whole franchise will restart from the beginning with ""Casino Royal"" and it was a great concept and they really pulled it off with a director Martin Campell who kept the film interesting because it was focused on developing the character of Bond again rather than just action packed scenes.<br/><br/>""Quantum"" that was the sequel to Casino Royal that again set up another super power evil corp ""Quantum"" which as ""Doctor NO"" did with Spector. Bond films have always been about spying to discover these kind of people with power and criminal intent, I think Skyfall departed with that concept when they planted the seeds of ""Quantum"" in the first two films and and suddenly it became a soap opera about M in Skyfall with some deranged lunatic's taking revenge on M?. <br/><br/>Even the last film ""Quantum of Solace"", as much as it was scorned it was still far superior film compare to this turkey ""Skyfall"" which really is among the worst Bond film to date right next to the ""Timothy Dalton"" Bond series.<br/><br/>I happen to like Sam Mendez as a director for films like ""American Beauty"" but I think this Bond genre was way over his head. He was just all over the place; there was so many bad scenes that just hang on the screen, Bond was absent being Bond, the soap opera with M and her reciting poem in court was just awful. What are we watching here people?. I liked the idea of introducing the new ""Q"", but maybe someone older with a sense of humor, rather than the college nerdy look whose screen presence was just annoying to say the least. Even the casting of the new ""Moneypenny"" is just a miscast, again Naomie Harris is a great in other films I have seen her in but sorry not as Moneypenny?. <br/><br/>From the first action scene where Moneypenny shoots Bond by mistake but still has enough time to shoot the villain and she pauses; I had a feeling from that scene alone that this film is heading the wrong direction. Then there is the absence of Bond being dead and where we have no idea how he got rescued by whom?. There are scenes where he is dressed as a some limo driver in the airport and following a guy and it was just so lame, the time we spent watching him in his car and driving to the airport and waiting with sun glasses was a waste of screen time for a Bond film. Theree was another scene where Bond is captured with Silva's men, Silva has a gun in his hand, then there is a helicopter and Bond manages to disarm the Silvia's men but the next shot Silvia has no gun in his hand?...I mean how can a director like Mendez screw up a shot like that on a huge budget film like this?. Those fight scenes in the casino were just so lame and so poorly choreographed as if you are watching some B movie, it was just awful and boring to watch. There was just continuous tedious scenes when Bond is trying to hide M, by getting his old Austin Martin and that old house in the country, it just was a waste of screen time going no where. In the entire history of all the Bond films M's character was just a minor character that appeared in maybe 4 scenes in the entire movie,but ever since they cast Judie Dench as M, then M became a major character in the Bond series. <br/><br/>It's amazing this genre or franchise has lasted this over 50 years, when all the books Flemming wrote were made already. Craig was a miracle to restart the Bond franchise for a whole new generation but I guess today's audience is not concerned about story as the Connery generation was. They just want to see if Bond will save the world by killing the bad guys. ""Skyfall"" had potential for a great Bond film but it really was a disaster and yet it made so much money and had great critic reviews; which goes to show how much BS can studio shovel with the right marketing to this dummy down generation.<br/><br/>I just read Mendez is directing the next Bond film, I bet even he was surprised he was picked to come back. This time they are introducing the oldest Bond nemesis ""Ernst Stavro Blofeld""; I dread to think how Mendez will manage to screw that up too?. Ever since Brocolli's daughter took over managing the Bond Franchise she has made some really bad choices; she just does not get the Bond series like her father Cubby did.<br/><br/>The Bond films ended with Roger Moore, that was all the Bond books, what we have now is a mutated butchered studio version of what Flemming had written who would be rolling in his grave if he knew a two hour Bond film was spent on M."
"beingrohan-7","1","8","16","5 June 2014"," No logic, no comedy, no thrills, no fun: not a Bond movie
","I didn't enjoy the movie and found the plot lacking common sense in most places. I want to highlight the following points:<br/><br/>How the hell does bond not die after being hit by the bullet from Moneypenny and falling into a river? So many illogical scenes throughout. How the villain comes with so many people? This guy is an x agent and is obviously crazy. How did he form an army? Where did he get the money? How did he hack into the most secure computers when he had no technical knowledge? In the scene he blows the metro train into Bond, how come he had a bomb planted exactly there? Did he know Bond was going to accost him at exactly that point? How come Bond lets his girl die?<br/><br/>I mean, I don't want to be a stickler for logic but this one really lack s it. Also of course there are no thrills, comedy or entertainment! Unlike the previous Bond movies such as Casino Royale!"
"DKosty123","5","8","16","30 November 2012"," Revisits Old Territory
","If your a die hard Bond fan, you find what you like here. The theme song by Adele is pretty much like prior Bond themes. The opening credits are very much like older Bond films. The action is much like territory covered before. In fact, it is dangerously like ""Action for Older Persons"" as it is too much formula and flash, not enough script.<br/><br/>The plot seems to involve cyber terrorism and a former agent whose gone bad and is bent on killing M. They steal a sensitive worldwide list of agents, and then burn 5 of them on You Tube with a plot to keep doing 5 more every week. What is interesting is that there is no real black mail demand to stop this process. Then the movie forgets about this process, focus on the bad guy and his personal thing about M.<br/><br/>So it loses the save the world process here and never finds it again. Instead we get a get setting in Scotland to stage an action finale which makes very little sense. The bad guy loses focus on any real destroy the world goal and the film loses focus as well.<br/><br/>The most refreshing thing about this movie is Naomi Harris. She is the only new Bond woman of note and she looks sensational though the film only really gives you small hints of how good she looks. This is a Bond light film in there is less sex in this than previous films. Daniel Craig is back as Bond but he really does not get a lot of acting here. It is good to see him back on screen but think he had a better role in the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.<br/><br/>This movie celebrating 50 years of Bond has all the smoke and mirrors of a Bond film and if your into smoke and mirrors and stunts, it will make you happy. Even though it is easy to follow, there is very little to surprise you. It does set up new character actors to take over in repeating roles of Q and Money Penny for future films but it does not make up for the loss of opportunity the series had by missing 2007 as the obvious Century promotion.<br/><br/>This film will not kill the series. The trouble is a true Bond fan is in dire need of a great script to refresh the franchise. The question is will it happen next script as it sure does not happen here. This one takes advantage of the old frame work and adds to it. The thing is when a building is 50 years old, it is in major need of rehab. This film makes it look like that has not yet happened.<br/><br/>The net result is the same old furniture and rooms but the view to a kill is missing, lost in transition and translation someplace."
"Spats007","7","8","16","10 November 2012"," Shaken AND Stirred
","Skyfall is not a return to ""classic Bond""; it is rather a completely unique hybrid of elements from the earlier films and the darker tone and character of Fleming's later novels (which have been hinted at, but never fully explored before now). Thematically, the film is a Freudian examination of two orphaned sons and the cold, manipulative and abandoning surrogate mother they share. Bond's trademark self-confidence is shattered by a monumental betrayal by M., who seems to have lost her moral compass. And Bardem's Silva offers a manic and terrifying glimpse of what Bond may well become if he continues on his self-destructive path. <br/><br/>It is strange and disturbing to see Bond as anything less than the tuxedoed superhero that drew me to the cinema religiously every other year for decades. I don't consider Skyfall the best Bond film by any stretch (for me, that would be Goldfinger, followed by OHMSS and Casino Royale), but it is certainly the most disturbing and thought-provoking. I respect it for those reasons. I also pray the folks at Eon don't try it again for a very long time. There's a place yet in the world for the glorious popcorn days of exploding pens and space stations."

I was excited about Skyfall because it was getting such crazy press, reviews, and success.<br/><br/>On the surface, it was a very solid movie. However, the entertainment comes at the cost of huge plot holes and contrived ideas. MI6 are portrayed as complete idiots and buffoons, and the main villain is smarter than all of them put together and is nearly omnipotent. Similar to the Joker in The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>If you can get passed the fact that the scenario involving the main villain couldn't possibly have happened, then you'll enjoy the movie. Unfortunately, every step of the way, the story is propelled by more plot holes and nonsense."

"rvinodkrishnan","2","11","24","13 November 2012"," Licence to Kill......... the audience!!!!
","Skyfall did start on a promising note. Killing the Bond, the most brilliant spy ever created. The hook is strong. But then it doesn't justify for the rest of the movie. Mr Mendes just created the hook and forgot to weave a plot around it. One simply doesn't shoot a brilliant spy and forget to tell us the story!!! At one instance, the concept of a Ghost Spy ,proclaimed dead but still alive, was introduced. This was when Mallory asked ""If you're dead why don't you stay dead"". And then Mr Mendes thought otherwise. The movie makers seemed to have an ADHD problem. One hand they start with a great premise then lose the plot, again talk about Bond being a ghost spy and again lose the plot to dramatic vengeance-based epic saga almost 3 hours long. Audience could've have been provided with a fast-forward gadget straight to the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Gadgets are a necessity to tease the imagination of the viewer, to give the viewer an idea about the possibility of technology. This has been lost right from the start of Craig's Bond. Although, initially it looked refreshing, it was more like driving around in a Vintage Bentley in today's world of modern cars. It is unique and exotic. But then come-on, for how long can you enjoy the Bentley knowing the BMW Vision just released. In a way the Craig's bond was like that, he had amazing hand-to-hand fist combat techniques, no guns no gadgets, he even gets his balls smashed. However, you know he must use Gadgets they're the heart of any Bond movie. You sit in the theater expecting a magic to happen in Q's department, a far advanced magic than you see in Tony Stark's laboratory. If Q has this kind of a lab as shown in Skyfall then God help MI6, they deserve to be blown-out and bull-dozed.<br/><br/>Another most important element of Bond movies also got lost in this unforgivable mayhem. A Bond without Girls, ""Ok Mr Mendes, now you're pushing the limits"". A Bond girl is a significant entity in any Bond Movie, whether it is Ursula Andress or Eva Green, they have been so important to the Plot of the Movie that you just cannot think of a Bond in existence without the Girls. The girls give life to Bond, they take his life away, they make Bond who he is, his nature, his behavior, his thought-process everything gets manipulated by the Girls. It shows how vulnerable Bond is, at the same time how cunning and ruthless he is. All we get to see is a rescued Bond's post-coitus moments. And the fact he is helpless in saving the ""so-called"" Bond Girl in the movie, is purely tasteless!!! If anyone has to kill a Bond Girl it has to be Bond himself.....Craig was first stripped of Gadgets in Casino-Royale and now he is stripped of Girls...Why not then just for once, for real strip him of being the Bond itself!!!!! <br/><br/>M, the lovely Dame, the saving grace of what was a crucifying experience till now. Judi Dench, does what she does the best, at 77, one cannot think of anyone who can act the way she emoted the character of M, the No-Nonsense, ruthless, scheming, domineering boss. She proved that M means Business, M is head of MI6 for a reason. Her one scene where she says ""To hell with dignity. I'll leave when the job's done"" was the defining moment of the Character of M. Absolute ruthlessness and complete commitment to the work of saving the world. That reminds me, why didn't you see this in Bond? Well Mr Mendes has to answer that question.<br/><br/>Lastly, hey who is Bond?? Have you ever seen a Bond movie where he is not the main character? Welcome to Skyfall. I guess the director had a hilarious Irony in naming it Skyfall. It is indeed a Skyfall for Bond a fall from which he can never rise again. A fall which beats even Baumgartner's record. The movie has been about M, Moneypenny, new M, new Q and someone who has never been associated with Bond, Adele. You might be wondering why I didn't mention the ""Gay"" maniac. Well, he is the main reason why this movie fails miserably.<br/><br/>Personal vendetta to take-on M??? Oh for Crying out loud, Silva, you were an MI6 agent, someone who earns his living by betraying others you expect not to be terminated when you turn rogue??? Why take that frustration on M??? Maybe you didn't read the Job description before you applied for the position.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't work for the following major reasons:<br/><br/>1. Vengeance-based, dramatic potboiler when it is supposed to be a Spy thriller 2. No regular bond stuff like gadgets and girls 3. No focus on Bond at all. 4. Attempted accidental killing of the Bond not justified.... 5. Last but not the least, what happened to the hard disk???? Oh well it was lost for good like the rest of the plot....<br/><br/>It can be summarized that a Movie Franchise which had the elements of Politics, Espionage, Sex, Betrayal, Fast Chases, Breathtaking Action, Cutting Edge - Gadgets has been reduced to a Drama, Revenge, Bollywood-style potboiler."

","I made the mistake of believing some of the hype surrounding this film and I was seriously disappointed. I enjoyed QoS more and that wasn't great.<br/><br/>The basic story and the mission has been done many times before, Mission Impossible for example, and most of them do a better job. There are many flaws in the film of the sort that are usually overlooked if the film is any good. How they find the first bad guy for example. They improbably find his identity and then intelligence just happen to say he's going to be in X in a few days time. No explanation, just that intelligence says so.<br/><br/>Another issue is the hiding behind computer hackery to achieve certain things in the film. The new Q is a joke and if he is a fixture for the next films will spoil them too.<br/><br/>The villain is initially humorous but considering how feared he was made out to be it gets a bit silly. Others have compared him to the Joker from the Batman films and I can see the resemblance. His convoluted plot to try and achieve his end goal was pointless, with all the contacts and allies he clearly had he could have done it in a few about 2 scenes. Bond himself is contradictory at times. One minute appearing frail and vulnerable, then he's cold and ruthless and then caring. Having said all that the opening sequence is very good and is very Bond. In fact it is at the point of meeting the villain that the film takes a turn for the worse and never recovers.<br/><br/>It's all a little tiresome and the final action scene was poor and failed to make up for what went before. If you like your Bond, this is not really a Bond film. If you are not fussed for Bond then this is just a poor action/thriller film, stick with the likes of Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>One last point, I was staggered to read that the film cost £200M, there must have been some large salaries."

But I can't, the more I watched the more I found how terrible it is. The film is a very let-down production. After the first 15', it started to get boring and Craig's Bond turned out a drunk that cannot hit a decent shot to the target (even it didn't move at at). I will pray for Bond 24 if Craig goes on doing it. Gosh, he's loosing his physical strength and should be replaced. The plot is another Halloween nightmare. Dull and boring. I expected a miracle like Casino Royale, and instead, I got sth even worse than QoS. No great action sequence, no good sense of humor. Predictable villain tries to play cool. Silva is a mixture of Joker, Harvey Dent. Sam said he was inspired by Dark Knight. No, he just copied it literally. Don't mind about Bond girls because they don't exist. Don't expect a smart, charming girl like Vesper, don't expect a strong and independent woman like Camille. The worst thing is James Bond is no longer James Bond of the last 2 film. The Bond I loved in Casino Royale completely vanishes. He even did not not blink when his love mate had been shot in cold blood. He didn't give a damn that a man was going to be murdered.

"KirstenVerdel","9","12","27","28 October 2012"," The angel is in the details..
","This is the first time in years that I review a movie on IMDb. The only reason why is that in all the reviews I have seen no/little attention has been paid to the things I noticed in Skyfall apart from the spectacular action scenes etc. When I first saw Daniel Craig as Bond I wasn't sure whether I liked him or not. I now know that I believe he's the best Bond, after Sean Connery. I like this Bond so much because he's rough around the edges. He's 'more human, but never humane', as I read somewhere. <br/><br/>I loved Skyfall. I loved how this movie shows that MI6 is still relevant in the 21st Century. I loved how both Bond and M kept up appearances (being tough) until the very, very end, where finally both M and Bond broke just a little bit. I loved how the movie suggested that Ms. Moneypenny and Bond made love, but it was never shown! Same as in the old movies: always temptation, but never... I loved how the Bond girl got killed because Bond couldn't aim properly (at the same time I was flabbergasted by how he didn't seem to care at all. How the movie didn't seem to care that he hadn't been able to save her, even though he had basically promised to). I loved how 'the old ways' (the Aston Martin, the radio, the eject button) proved relevant in our high-tech era. I loved the comment Bond made after The Bad Guy came on to him. I loved Adele's song. I loved the lights, the feeling that the scene in Shanghai gave me during the fight with the sniper. I loved how subtle the Heineken commercial ended up being (did anyone notice the 843845 Vaio laptops in the movie, I wonder how much théy paid!) and I especially loved how they did put the Martini tradition in the movie after all (the girl in Macau who is shaking a drink for Bond... shaking, not stirring... without the words ever being mentioned). Like the title of my post: the angel, not the devil, is in the details of this movie. This movie was such an incredible gift. It was a true celebration of 50 years Bond, with elements from past, present and glimpses into the future. <br/><br/>Apart from that, the plot is great, the scenery breathtaking, the action scenes are as Bond as it gets, Judi Dench's performance is.. just Judi. I loved this movie so much more than I expected. 007 is so very much alive. To my own surprise, I just realized I want to watch it again. For someone like me, who watches 100-150 a year in cinema, that's rather rare. ;)"

","I'm really glad I got the chance to watch the movie for free at a pre- screening, otherwise I would have felt ripped off.<br/><br/>I've always liked the James Bond franchise, every film this far has been enjoyable to watch. The Skyfall story lacked two of James Bonds signature ingredients: An eccentric/mad arch nemesis and gadgets.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie felt like a TV-pilot to get to know the characters in preparations for the next episodes.<br/><br/>Skayfall came up short on the grandeur.<br/><br/>Both Bourne legacy and Taken 2 has been better on the screens this year even though they were more predictable than Skyfall."
"BA_Harrison","6","13","30","2 November 2012"," Double 0-verrated.
","After the disappointment that was Casino Royale, I decided to give Quantum of Solace a miss altogether on account of the very mixed reviews (to date, it is the only Bond film that I still haven't seen); Skyfall, on the other hand, had been getting such unanimous glowing praise that I simply had to check it out for myself, if only to confirm my suspicions that viewers had been letting their sense of relief that it didn't suck as much as the last two films to seriously affect their judgement.<br/><br/>Just as I imagined, those who have been claiming that this is the best Bond ever are only fooling themselves. The film begins in great style with an incredible chase scene, one that really gets the adrenaline pumping, but this promising starts only serves to highlight just how badly mishandled the rest of the film is. With far more conversation than chaos and a running time of well over two hours, Skyfall really drags in places.<br/><br/>The introduction of Javier Bardem's Silva, an intriguing mix of John Malkovich from In the Line of Fire and both Hannibal Lector and Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs, improves matters slightly, giving the plot some much needed focus, but the overall lack of action and adventure is still all too apparent (the only other memorable set-piece being a spectacular underground train crash/chase scene), as are the script's more convoluted elements and irritating plot holes.<br/><br/>The final act, which culminates in a showdown between Bond and the baddies at his family pile in the Scottish highlands, fails to save the day, being atypically Bond in almost every respect: the locale is dreary, the cinematography is dark, the weaponry outdated, and the overall tone way too sombre.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because Daniel Craig makes for a good 007—I just hope that they give him the Bond project that he deserves before he gets too old to play the part."

","Silly, Overblown, Dumb and Boring. That's how I would describe this movie in four words. I can't understand how this movie got such positive reviews. The direction was OK and some of the performances great (mostly Bardem's). However the backbone of a movie his it's screenplay and that's were the movie falls completely apart. The screenplay was a mess: the characters dialogues and banter were trite and clichéd, the plot was overblown and idiotic and the character's decisions and actions made little to no sense. The only positive points of the movie were Bardem and Fienes, who gave terrific performances (altough the latter didn't have much to do throughout the movie anyway) and most of all Roger Deakins, whose photography was gorgeous as always. Everything else in the movie was fair to mediocre. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: <br/><br/>Craig's Bond in this movie achieves a all new level of stupidity that kept me wondering on on earth this guy is still alive. Every decision he made was dumb beyond belief. Who would shoot against an airborne war helicopter with an automatic from a window of a old manor? Why didn't he shoot the villain when he was on his way to kill M and still allowed him to press the radio that caused a subway to be rammed against him? Those are just two of the many idiotic decisions that Bond made during the film, not to mention the biggest one of all: taking M to a secluded old manor without any manpower and virtually no weapons. That makes perfect sense! Also, in the end he fails his mission, breaching protocol while doing so and Mallory still reinstates him."

","------Spoilers-----Ahead----<br/><br/>After reading rave reviews, I really wanted to like this movie. However hard I tried I couldn't. This one is absolutely brilliant film. but it is hardly a James Bond film. This is more like the copy of Bourne films like they did before + DB5 and attempt at some humor. And they recreated the last scene from Bourne Identity as well. Brosnan era might be absurd with WW3 plans and invisible cars, but at least they had the essence of Bond.<br/><br/>It seems to me like the formula for last 3 bond films is to kill off the Bond girls and put some emotional stuff mix it, and serve. (did Bond cry at the end?)<br/><br/>I personally like to see the classic James Bond film formula, like pre credit story which usually do not relate to the main story, and for heavens sake give us the Gun barrel scene at the beginning, and some villain with elaborate plan with less serious tone.and where is the James bond theme? Where is that surf guitar riff.? <br/><br/>OK anyway this film.<br/><br/>I think the humor is out of place and it will not make you laugh the James Bond way. and the DB5 is just there to remind us this is a Bond movie in case we forget. Action is average at best. (no goosebump raising scene like Bond in a Tank) and as a whole it does not feel like a James Bond film.<br/><br/>I think villain is good but too serious, Craig is not bad but he cannot handle to humor bits very well. As a whole the movies has some nice scenes and done well.<br/><br/>conclusion.<br/><br/>I like to see Bond go on a spy mission, bed couple of girls, kill some bad guys, some gadgets from Q, and Villain with a plan to overtake to world. + an Aston Martin.<br/><br/>I feel all three Daniel Craig movies are like Bond, Jason Bond."

","This is supposed to be the 50th anniversary of the James Bond franchise, and what a waste of time it was. The story was dull and the villain average. The plot was a reasonable idea, but the execution was poor.<br/><br/>Traditionally, James Bond films have had fantastical plots: Moonraker had an evil genius stealing satellites (and a giant thug with gold teeth), Golden Eye had some kind of space laser (as I recall), Casino Royale pinned the fate of the free world on a poker game, Quantum of Solace had a slimy guy stealing water. Skyfall (whilst having a cool name which incidentally had functionally zero relevance to the story) by comparison had an unknown MI6 agent from the past bent on revenge against M.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS** Bardem's (apparently) gay lunacy was not compelling in the least.<br/><br/>Bond gets shot. You see that in the trailers. Then he comes back, all within the space of about 10 minutes. It was a worthless speedbump, since it added completely nothing to the story. Apparently he loses some of this skills, but again, that made ZERO difference to the film. What could have been a major plot point with interesting ramifications became a mere side incident. Talk about wasting time.<br/><br/>Maybe Judi Dench was bored with her role, so they wrote this film just to kill off her character. That's the only justification I can think of for such a lame film.<br/><br/>The direction was average. The acting was okay. Uninspired car chases, boring plot, some dull high-tech gadgetry, Adele's insipid theme song and that's 2.5 hours wasted. A truly dull script that turns into a truly dull film.<br/><br/>A noticeable low point in Danial Craig's up-til-now stellar showing as the latest James Bond."

","Skyfall is a great looking film. Daniel Craig delivers his best Bond performance yet.<br/><br/>Unfortunately they are the only good things that I can say about it.<br/><br/>Most of the acting was wooden, the dialogue forced, music unmemorable, action forgettable, the nods to previous films heavy handed and unnecessary. Worst of all the script is a half baked, contradictory, contrived and uninteresting mess.<br/><br/>The film lost me at the conclusion of the pre-title sequence. Here we have Bond, after taking two bullets to the torso, plunging over 300 feet from the top of the Varda Viaduct in Turkey, landing shoulder and neck first into water........and surviving! Since the impact of the fall in the first place would almost guarantee death and there could never be any satisfactory logical explanation as to why the natural laws of the universe are completely suspended in this instance, the scriptwriters decided that the best option was to completely ignore this event and simply have Bond walking around afterwards with no physical ill effects whatsoever.<br/><br/>Here's the problem as I see it.<br/><br/>The biggest factor in creating a quality film is the script.<br/><br/>Bond is not Superman, Thor or The Hulk. He is a human. Showing Bond suffering that amount of physical trauma and then have him walking around perfectly fine turned this film into the equivalent of a Wile E Coyote and Roadrunner cartoon and since it was the scriptwriter's obvious intention to show us a more human, realistic and serious side to Bond's character throughout this film they should have seen how ridiculous a contradiction they were creating.<br/><br/>The film doesn't get any better from then on either.<br/><br/>I would expect children to enjoy this type of hack writing, but an adult whose consciousness has been raised by life experience should be thinking more critically and demanding more.<br/><br/>Exotic locations, gadgets, humour, action etc. can still exist in a more logical film. The films don't have to be serious and absolutely realistic, just more plausible. Suspension of disbelief doesn't happen because one chooses it to happen. It is the responsibility of the film maker to create the conditions in which the viewers disbelief is suspended unconsciously. This film failed to entice me into that state of mind.<br/><br/>I wanted nothing more than to enjoy it, but I find it impossible to enjoy the work of scriptwriters who repeatedly treat me as if I'm stupid.<br/><br/>This is a film that attempts to tick all the boxes instead of choosing one stance and sticking with it and it is a poor film because of it."

It would be great feat if one saw this entire movie as I saw many Bond lovers and normal people leave this movie in the middle. I sat and saw till the end to get the complete picture which was way below my expectations. For this plot my expectation is simply making one understand the definition of 00 status. The level of risk involved in the operation of these agents and the tough choices that their superiors had to take to keep it under control. The concentration and effort should have been given on that. This movie portrays an aged MI6 agency,their pride, ridiculous emotional bonds, sloppy bond partners, no snappy gadgets. Even the usual dialogues of name introduction or the order of the vodka martini is poorly executed. so much for minute detail.

In the movie we get a few nods from classics such as Goldfinger which is seen in the film. (Will not say encase you haven't seen the film.

"MaximumMadness","10","10","22","13 November 2012"," Reconciling the edgy, gritty ""Casino Royale"" Bond with the classic suave Connery/Moore/Brosnan Bond, ""Skyfall"" is a great transition film and maybe Craig's best outing yet!
","The thing that really struck me about ""Skyfall"", Daniel Craig's third outing as the iconic character James Bond after the amazing ""Casino Royale"" and the very so-so follow-up ""Quantum of Solace"", was that this film is very much a transitional piece for the character. ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum"" are both very much products of their time, taking cues more from the Bourne films and other gritty reboots than the classic Bond movies from yester-year. This film begins to really transition and change that, reconciling Craig's previous dark, brooding take on the character with the classic, suave Bond we knew for decades before. And it works. It works darned well.<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan, ""Skyfall"" is the 23rd entry in the Bond film series, although it's technically the third entry in the Daniel Craig Reboot series. (As this film, along with ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum"", are essentially the start of a new continuity)<br/><br/>After a riveting, exciting opening chase sequence that puts the shaky-cam opening chase from ""Quantum"" to shame, Bond (Craig) is accidentally shot by fellow agent Eve (Naomie Harris), and presumed dead after his limp body tumbles into a river. Bond is of course alive, and using his presumed death to retire from MI6. However, after a terrorist bombing on MI6 and threats against the life of MI6 head M (Judi Dench), Bond is forced back into action. With the help of the new Q (Ben Whishaw), Bond tracks the villainous Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), attempting to stop his plot of vengeance against MI6.<br/><br/>The acting is essentially flawless all around. Craig seems more comfortable with Bond, still maintaining his dark edge, while adding a bit of the classic suave and complexity to the character. Dench is a joy, as always, as M. Naomie Harris is a lot of fun as Eve, Bond's fellow agent. Ben Whishaw is fantastic as the new Q. And Javier Bardem is both tragic and terrifying as Silva, the lead villain. Other characters played by the likes of Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney are also fantastic.<br/><br/>The production is also top-notch. Mendes' direction is some of the best in the series. Thankfully, he eschewed the shaky-cam work that Marc Forster introduced in the prior film, and presents us with some first-class action, without relying too much on CGI. The script is tight, concise, and simpler than previous films, giving us a more elegant, easy-to-follow-yet-still-deep-and-complex storyline, which was nice as a few prior films got too convoluted. Costume and production design are absolutely gorgeous. There is almost nothing to complain about with the production.<br/><br/>I usually try to think of a few things to complain about, but here, it's near impossible. This is a flawless Bond film and a flawless picture in general.<br/><br/>I loved ""Skyfall."" It's possibly Craig's best outing yet, and re-invigorates the franchise yet again. A perfect 10 out of 10."
"scrapmetal7","4","10","22","11 November 2012"," Many, many missteps.
","This review really does have spoilers, just to let you know.<br/><br/>SKYFALL has amazing action! One of the strengths of the Daniel Craig Bond films has been unbelievably intense, nerve shredding action sequences, and Skyfall's have lived up to the standard and then some. Except for an unfortunate final act.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig's performance as Bond is superb for the third time in a row. He made the role his own from his first Bond film. His presence is riveting in all of his scenes.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is a fun villain, as we'd expect. I pretty much rooted for him the whole movie. His odd bleach job is a little annoying, especially when he's trying to run around in the subways in a policeman's uniform.<br/><br/>OK, now that that's over, Let's get into this movie's problems.<br/><br/>#1. More length than story. Like X2, Superman Returns,and Moonrise Kingdom, this movie reaches a point where it should be over, but then drags on for another half hour.<br/><br/>#2. This movie is not really a James Bond film. It is a Judi Dench ""M"". film with James Bond cameos. Apparently, this being her last, the creators felt they had to center it around her, and give her a massive send off. A Viking funeral, of sorts. It is a sentimental character piece that pays loving tribute to a background character as if she were the heart of the whole franchise. This really wears out its welcome very quickly.<br/><br/>A strength of both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace was that their villains' plans were global and so complex they really couldn't be explained within the context of the films. We, as the audience, were along for the fast paced ride, and just had to snatch the details we were given out of the air as we raced by. It wasn't important to understand every facet of the enemy, and that was for the better.<br/><br/>So, to bring this back to the point, Raoul Silva's plans, at first intriguing and exciting, suddenly become simply about his obsession with M. In fact, getting back at her and trying to win her love seem to be his only motivations. It's really kind of a letdown.<br/><br/>#3. Another strength of the Bond films was that moving or emotional content wasn't up front, but rather shone unexpectedly through the cracks, and was all the more moving and gave the films substance through their subtlety.<br/><br/>In SKYFALL, that subtlety is replaced with heavy-handed, unwelcome sentimentality. All the fawning over Dench is bad enough, culminating in a ridiculous parliamentary inquiry where she pontificates, but even that is really just a prelude to the film's worst aspect, the final act, where Bond takes her to his parents' stately abandoned Scottish manor to await a siege.<br/><br/>It's a mistake to start shining a light into Bond's past if all they're going to reveal comes out of Harlequin romances. The dashing fellow from the Scottish highlands who takes the lady to his stately manor to save her life... really? THIS lady? But it's not just romance novels that this film evokes. It also evokes comic books. Now Bond is a tormented orphan (like Batman!) with a faithful manservant (Like Batman!) who has a mansion full of secret passages (like Batman!)... It's been noted that Mendes says he was inspired by Nolan's Batman films. Well, it really shows.<br/><br/>Another dubious thing about this reveal is that it is ALSO revealed that ""James Bond"" is in fact his actual name. I liked it better when it seemed to have been a cover name. But that's just me. <br/><br/>We go through an awful lot of drawn out siege-style action at the end of this movie that somehow reminded me of both Straw Dogs AND the end of Pineapple Express except that it's just not all that interesting, because it's only about protecting Judi Dench, who had apparently some years prior deliberately blown Silva's cover and let the Chinese have him (???) for reasons she gives that seem pretty weak... She's not all that likable and I wasn't that invested in wanting her to survive. Which means I wasn't that invested in the actual plot of this M. movie."
"nillobit","5","10","22","11 November 2012"," Generic Action Guy
","James Bond's thinly veiled cover had been either that of an aristocratic playboy or business man. Using this cover he was able to interact with wealthy jet-setters as one of their own. Woman and Men alike are attracted to his charm, wit and boundless knowledge of fine living. In retrospect, many of the early films seemed more like travelogues for tourist and less like action films. This pretense accomplished a couple of objectives; it allowed blue collar types like me to see behind the veil of wealth power and privilege. And moreover, OUR AGENT, James Bond will ultimately show these aristocrats up, giving them their well-deserved comeuppance. <br/><br/>The world has change and become more corporatized and generic. However, human nature being what it is, we know there are still restaurants, casinos and other venues where most of us would be spotted as interlopers and summarily ejected. We still need James Bond. I think Daniel Craig capable of pulling off that sort of nuanced performance. He just hasn't been provided that sort of script. What did they get right: Daniel can wear a tailored suit well. And, Javier Bardem's mad man was appropriately distant and sinister.<br/><br/>This film is a disservice to Ian Fleming, who's stories expanded on F. Scott Fitzgerald's words: ""Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves. Even when they enter deep into our world or sink below us, they still think that they are better than we are. They are different.""<br/><br/>007 is a blue collar wolf disquised as a blue blood, not a Scottish prince."
"nyshrink","5","10","22","9 November 2012"," Preposterous and Weird
","James Bond movies have never been ""realistic,"" but in this installment Bond is invulnerable like a cartoon character. He's Wile E. Coyote; a one-ton weight could drop on him and he would just crawl out from under it. It's preposterous. There are a number of other ridiculosities that sadly are becoming standard for action movies, such as the outrunning of explosions, people shooting up cars yet somehow the driver is unhurt and the gas tank doesn't explode, etc. Suspension of disbelief is ruined within the first 10 minutes.<br/><br/>In addition, there is a creepy plot line about a renegade agent who has a ""Psycho"" type mother issue relating to ""M."" I have never seen anything like this in a Bond film and it is just weird. There's some awful dialogue, like they were writing the script as they were filming it. Naomie Harris, the interesting actress from ""28 Days Later"" is wasted. The movie is saved from being garbage by the enormous amount of money spent on action sequences in exotic locales, and fine acting by Javier Bardem, Judi Dench, Naomie Harris and Ralph Fiennes. I would add Daniel Craig but in this film he does little more than kill people. There are no romance scenes as in ""Casino Royale."" Bond comes across as cold and unappealing, not sexy and complicated as in the previous two films with Craig. The more I think about this film the less I like it."
"sabrish-007","6","10","22","8 November 2012"," Horribly Disappointed. Skyfall???? I call it Skyfail.
","Lets start from the beginning. Pre credits scene is shot in turkey. Bond is chasing a guy who has stolen a drive containing information about undercover agents.OK, not bad. Yes, its full of action but end result, bond gets shot and falls into some river. Credits time, adele's song.... Not sexy, but fits the movie perfectly. The animation is Bad. Next, bond is alive....How? The movie doesn't say how!!! Oh god, kill me!! Bond enjoys death, meanwhile MI6 is under attack, cyber terrorists, we are led believe, caused the attack. This, is when it starts to become very boring. Cyber terrorism? Very common if you ask me, this is nothing special or extra ordinary. You've seen it before.. Die hard 4.0 for example. I suggest you watch that if you ask me to choose between skyfall and die hard 4. OK fine, cyber terrorism accepted, At least show us how destructive it can be how its going to be a big threat . But no, nothing of that sort is shown. Next, there is absolutely no motive for the villain. He harvests computers in his hideout, for what? Just so that he can keep a track on MI6. Yes, its a horrible plot. The first time i said 'Woah!' in the movie was during the house siege. That was really cool no doubt. It was impressive. The climax wasn't that bad as well. Performances- Craig was good. Judi Dench and Barden did justice too. Bottom line is that a weak plot and MORE IMPORTANTLY, very few action sequences spoil Skyfall or is it Skfail?!"
"maria-fry1","5","10","22","2 November 2012"," Disappointing
","*****CONTAINS SPOILERS***** <br/><br/>I was really disappointed with this film - I had heard so many good things from friends who had been to see it, so I was expecting a lot more. I found the plot to be really thin and dull. It didn't feel much like a bond movie to me.I also thought it was really predictable (saw the 'getting caught on purpose' thing coming, and was waiting for M to die through the entire film.<br/><br/>Bad Points * What was the point in Shanghai? Other than to enter a room in a skyscraper that seemed to be full of glass doors and nothing else.<br/><br/>* It was awfully convenient for the casino chip to be in the assassins gun case. Because that's where you usually store a casino chip.<br/><br/>* I thought it a bit presumptuous of Bond to waltz straight into the shower of the casino woman, particularly after the discussion of how scared she was of Silva and how she had been sex trafficked.<br/><br/>* It was a little bit convenient that this amazing hacker guy didn't know MI6 were on their way.<br/><br/>* Did no one else know he was captured on purpose? Saw that one coming.<br/><br/>* Also saw the 'lets break into his laptop' plan going wrong. The minute they started decrypting I was waiting for someone to say, 'stop, this is a trick!' * Considering how Silva had ranted about how much he hated M, it took a long time to find the answer to the question 'Where is he going'.<br/><br/>*What was the point of Silva getting caught. Yes, he wanted to see M again, but if he was really the '007 before 007', surely he could have managed to track her down (given his hacking ability) and get rid of her? * It's not very realistic that Bond, M and some old guy would have taken out about 25 of Silva's men.<br/><br/>* If you are running away from death in the cover of night, would you really use a torch? * The woman playing Moneypenny was really irritating.<br/><br/>All in all, the beginning sequence was amazing and the end sequence (apart from the gripes above) was also pretty good. The middle was where the movie fell down."
"karagoraymond","3","7","14","18 March 2015"," The best Bond film ever, really ?
","Skyfall, the highest grossing James Bond filmand also one of the most overrated films of all time. I have never really been a huge James Bond fan, but I saw the trailers and I went into the cinema feeling very excited, and, sadly, left the cinema half a sleep. God was this film boring! Despite all the money and Oscar-nominations, I genuinely struggle to find anything of credit in the film. I am not a fan of Daniel Craig either, but even by his standards, he was very dull in this film. His Bond was not engaging in the slightest, we learn nothing of his past and if he was a supporting character, I would have been rooting for him to die. Judi Dench was not much better, with the ever present scowl during the film, it was almost as if she was channeling my feelings when I was in the cinema.<br/><br/>The Bond girls were also played up greatly, but to no avail. One dies after barley 20 minutes of screen time and the other (Harris' character) apart from having a few sexually tense scenes with Bond, was as dull as a rock.<br/><br/>One of the few aspects of the film that I enjoyed was Bardem as the villain. His accent along with his over-the-top nature, made his scenes enjoyable and to be fair I did enjoy his backstory. Also, the actions scenes where also pretty damn cool.<br/><br/>Overall, I have sat through this film twice and I can say I didn't like it. It was boring, the characters where predictable and I didn't even like the song (Yeah I said it). I know the film is considered a ""hit"" but one of the beauties of our world is the difference in opinion"
"cherold","5","7","14","2 March 2014"," disappointing and ridiculously plotted
","I really enjoyed the Bond reboot Casino Royale, and while it was less appreciated, my vague recollection is that I generally liked the follow up, but I was hugely disappointed with this film.<br/><br/>There are a few good things. Javier Bardem does a great job as an unstable bad guy. Bond's flirtation with a fellow agent is kind of cute. The action scenes are pretty good; not mind blowing, but generally entertaining.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I was constantly frustrated by the plot, in which neither Bond nor anyone else (except the bad guy) ever does anything that makes the slightest bit of sense. The movie is just stupid, and the good in it never balanced the idiocy. I am actually amazed that a movie with such a terrible, terrible structure has gotten such rave reviews. For just some of the problems with the plot, read on:<br/><br/>************** SPOILERS BELOW *****************<br/><br/>First off, Bond twice waits until someone has died before fighting, even though in both cases his subsequent actions indicate he could have prevented the death. First, he calmly watches an assassination before attacking and killing the assassin. Even worse, he lets a woman he promised to help die (I knew she would from the moment he offered her help - I've seen Bond films before) and then takes out a bunch of bad guys even though nothing changes that makes it easier to take them out than when she was still alive.<br/><br/>Then there's the moment when a supposed computer genius good guy (Q) hacks into the computer of the computer genius bad guy and takes zero precautions. He simply hooks the computer directly into the MI6 system. Who would do that who wasn't an idiot? The whole reason there are sandbox applications for running suspect software is because anyone who knows anything about computers knows you have to protect your system from threats.<br/><br/>And when the bad guy escapes from a complex bristling with agents, how many people chase after him? One. Just Bond, by himself. No one tries to cover other exits, or chase at him from different directions. He really wouldn't have been that difficult to catch for any organization working together.<br/><br/>The go-it-alone motif comes back at the end, where Bond lures the villain and his army to a remote location to take them out single- handedly. Why? Why not lure them into a trap made up of trained snipers. They're surrounded by flat land, it would actually be a pretty easy area to defend. <br/><br/>I get angry all over again just writing all this down. There is no excuse for this much stupidity in one movie."
"bamitchell2","5","7","14","22 February 2013"," Winfall for Skyfall Promoters - Making a 3 into a 5
","After all the hype about Skyfall I was disappointed in the movie. It is an average James Bond movie, with all the constituent pieces, chase scene(s), women, at least one archaic gadget (in Skyfall's case), and of course a super villain. But Skyfall was sorely lacking - I have seen better everything, over the years from this franchise, starting with my visit to the local movie theater in 1965, at the ripe age of 15 to watch Goldfinger. I have long been a fan of the series and have no serious argument with the Bonds' chosen over the years. Some, I thought more suitable than others, but all around, they all worked just fine.<br/><br/>The problem with Skyfall is that the promotion of the movie worked out better than the movie itself, including dollars moving from my coffers to theirs. The promoters (critical and actual) get a 5 and the movie gets a 3. The downside is that many critics, who are supposed to be fair (as they are not the real promoters) stated in various tongue, that this is ""the"" must see James Bond. These nere-do-watch critics have forever lost credibility in my eyes.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert who I generally include among the several movie critics I read before making an investment, probably because he's been around as long as I have, and, has been correct more than once, until now, gave SkyFall a 4 out of 4 - on a 2.5, absolute tops, movie! Possibly the medication.<br/><br/>As always, caveat emptor, rent before you buy (or better, borrow a duped friend's:) and beware of movie critics bearing gifts."
"zachymcsmacky","9","7","14","28 December 2012"," Best Daniel Craig Bond Movie- He has finally gained my respect for his portrayal of Bond
","OK, I going to start off by saying... WHAT THE HECK? All I can see here is a multitude of bad reviews, for a really respectable and pretty damn cool movie. Yeah, I'll admit there are a few (by that I mean more than a few) plot holes and pointless things happening, as have been pointed out by many silly nit picky critics on these pages- but don't let spoil the film for you! Instead of seeing a plot hole and analysing the film for two-and-a-half hours, just sit back, watch it, AND ENJOY IT. I have to admit, I too am usually a film-analyser too, but in my opinion, the greatness of the film clearly outweighs the slight plot inaccuracies- just ignore them! Now secondly, compare it to Daniel Craig's other ""Bond"" movies. Casino Royale- I'll admit, there is a fair amount of action, the story was all right, however half the movie was taken up by the lengthy, ""action-packed"" poker playing sequence, and Daniel Craig being whipped in the balls. That was the only Bond film I ever fell asleep in. And that is not a lie. Then Quantum of Solace- it's just crazy... There's a load of random fights, then a crazy guy who is trying to steal water then gets chopped in the foot with a fire axe... Somehow, I preferred it to Casino Royale, but yeah, still not great. But now, Skyfall is now going back to proper Bond- it balances the right amount of full-throttle action, with seriousness and humorous cheesiness. And also, Bond actually says more than five lines in this film... In conclusion, it's got non-stop action, giant lizards, Chinese mobsters, gadgets (I admit not the best ones, but that's more than we can say for the last two films), bimbos randomly being shot, false teeth, meltey faces, impossible stunts, badass old men with sawn-off shot guns, traps AND the Aston Martin DB5..! WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT? I will say this one isn't my all time favourite Bond, but I have to admit, it has to be one of the greats!"
"sofieree","7","7","14","18 November 2012"," Excellent, with one notable flaw
","*Spoiler Alert*<br/><br/>As most people, I'm a huge fan of the James Bond character. My favourite actor to portray the coolest agent in the world has always been Connery, but I must say, I'm really warming to Craig. Despite missing some of his original characteristics, I think that the character is still fascinating, perhaps especially because of its development in a new and quite interesting direction; coolness, charm, elegance and, let's face it, a lack of any real depth has been replaced with an icy, stubborn, dependent and 'rebel'-like surface to cover up for the tragically lonely and distrusting core, that has come to be Bond, since Craig's debut in Casino Royale. This movie gives further insight to the Bond of the 21. century; and even when it gets maybe a little too sentimental (like the battle in his childhood home, before it is blown up), I think it works mainly because Craig is not the sentimental type; he is a dislikable version of a cross between John McClane and Jason Bourne on the outside, and only on the inside a kind of 'tortured soul'. So definitely, Daniel Craig's character and performance is a big part of this movie's excellence. Another big part is Javier Bardem's portrayal of the betrayed MI6 agent. If it is not actually the reason, why this movie is so totally worth seeing. This is indeed af type of villain not seen before in the 'James Bond Genre'; sure we saw Sean Bean as Alec, the former agent who went 'bad' in GoldenEye, but as Bond evolves with Craig, so does the concept of the Evil he fights. Silva (Bardem) is actually in many ways a typical villain of our time; of course he does his evil deeds with the help of computers, and homosexuality is now rightly accepted even in the Bond-universe. But the new aspect of the villain is Silva's humanity: He might be in some ways typically mentally unstable, but he is also just angry - and perhaps rightfully it seems. He is lonely, sexual, passionate. And actually also loving it seems, in his last scene, where he seems to truly be concerned with M's ('mom's) condition. The only thing actually wrong with him seems to be his overpowering feeling of being betrayed - which has then led him to become what we would call a 'psycho'. Alas, the defining character must be intelligence, which is indeed characteristic for the last ten to fifteen years' movies' portrayal of evil people. Along with Kevin Spacey as John Doe in 7 and of course Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight, Bardem just went right to the top of my 'Coolest Bad Guys of All Time' list. Bardem is as always convincing, and really nails the psychopathic but at the same time sad avenger. The whole theme of 'M's past' is interesting. For the first time, it's not decided for us, that she is good; even she has a past - she has sins, even if her deeds were for the sake of her career and her country. The direct M-Villain relationship is definitely an exciting initiative. Of course a number of flaws can be found in any movie, but the only one really worth mentioning here is the character of 'the New Q'. I actually get the notion that since Bond is middle-aged, it would create humorous tensions if 'a guy who still has spots' gets to boss him around. And strictly talking appearance, Ben Whishaw is an excellent choice; skinny, pale, 'nerdy' - but in that kinda-cute-and-kinda-fashionable way that has been so popular lately in the portrayal of 'The Nerd' (think Seth Cohen i Orange County). The major problem is that he is not efficient. Bond cracks the code - he doesn't, his computersystem - the supposedly best protected security system in the UK is hacked by one IMPRISONED man, and - he seems more confused, than intelligent. What's with the subway scene - 'I see you Bond' - okay, but are you actually contributing with anything? The old Q (before John Cleese) was dominant, authoritative, self-assured, and a genius (which gave him the right to the first three characteristics) - Ben Whishaw's performance unfortunately doesn't let us believe that the new Q has the potential to become any of these things. One last minor detail: Very nice touch, that Naomi Harris turned out to be Moneypenny - she has actually always been one of my favourite characters, and one that I've kind of missed in the last couple of films. <br/><br/>All in all: Beautifully filmed, stunning action movie - and a James Bond movie with more layers than usually. 7/10"

","Skyfall was not a typical James Bond with cool gadgets and cars , high octane action scenes. It is purely story-oriented which would be little bit disappointing for James Bond fans.<br/><br/>M's past comes back to haunt her and is threatening to kill her. 007 must track down the killer at any cost before he comes forward to hunt down M<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Mendes ( American Beauty) , Skyfall starts off very well with well choreographed beginning scene(usually the charm of a James Bond film) but loses the steam somewhere down the line and it will make you wonder if you are watching a bond film or just some other action drama. The problem with Skyfall is the must-see trailer which will build the excitement but will be sagged down by weak screenplay. Before watching Skyfall , I heard a lot about the mindblowing reviews but was surprise to see whether if the movie was even close to those glowing reviews. Even Sam Mendes direction is not in form. James Bond film is more of punching dialogues , high octane action stunts( like Casino Royale) and cool gadgets which is clearly missing here. Story is catchy. Screenplay could have been more crispy  action scenes are just about fine. Dialogues are less impacting. Cinematography is nice- watch for the beautiful camera work done while filming action scene in the skyscraper of Shanghai city. Performance by Daniel Craig , Judi Dench and Xavier Bardem is what drives the movie. Each of them played their character with convinced attitude. <br/><br/>Skyfall could have been made much better considering it to be directed by Sam Mendes but I felt less satisfied with movie on the overall basis. If you going to watch as a Bond film you will be disappointed .. or watch it otherwise Average 2.5 /5"

","There wasn't any interesting action. Fighting on top of a train? That hasn't been done. OK the backhoe bit was good, and I get that it must be hard to come up with new ideas, but train-wrassling was as good as it got in this Bond installment. Q was bland and there were no new cool gadgets. They even lampshaded the lack, but it didn't really make up for it. While the villain was well-played and sympathetic, the stakes weren't very high. Bond's 'death' was kind of squandered. We aren't left to wonder if or how he survived, or even shown how. He just pops up again looking quite hale and with an interesting scar. They didn't create any sort of peril which his resurrection can uniquely deal with. I just found it very unsatisfying and about 40 minutes too long."
"DunkelheitVZ","5","11","25","5 November 2012"," feels very artificial and constructed
","Finally I have seen the movie to see what the fuzz is all about. But this Bond adventure left me disappointed, here are the reasons: 1. The ""super hacker and PC geek"" is really getting annoying and is slowly taking first place as a lazy story vehicle from ""the prophecy told us so"". Explode something with hacking a computer? yeah, sure... I am not sure that my mom would buy this and she has problems watching a DVD.<br/><br/>2. Nearly everything in this movie feels like the director or writer wants it to go there and does not feel organic or in a natural flow. For example, why should Bond use a house in a very open area for a fight when he is outnumbered? Just because he was born there? There was no advantage for him picking that building, with the exception of the ""secret passage"".<br/><br/>3. There is no real Bond - girl in this movie. Every woman in this feels really tagged on. There is no real chemistry between Bond and his sexual partners in this movie.<br/><br/>4. I could not follow the decisions of the characters. ""Take the shot"" - scene for example: Chances for Bond to retrieve the hard drive was quite high, especially considering Bonds reputation. Shooting a moving/fighting target on a moving train from that far away really only makes your chance bigger if you really make sure that you kill the target and that would mean that she must kill Bond, too. So why did M order the shot and why did the girl not shoot multiple times so that she can make sure to retrieve the hard drive? <br/><br/>5. Unbelievable developments, like, did anyone really understand why Bond cannot hit anything in the mid of the movie, but near the end he takes masterful shots with an old rifle? I don't want to go too much into detail and nitpick everything. I believe that this movie might be quite cool for some people. But for me, a natural flow, believable characters and decisions are what makes a good movie. ""Skyfall"" was an entertaining movie, but not a great one."

","I've just finished a marathon of Bond films over the last 2 weeks in preparation for Bond 23.<br/><br/>I've just watched all of Connery's Bond, all of Moore's Bond, I skipped Dalton's Bond, the Australian Bond and watched bits of Bronson's Bond. So I was now ready for the new bond... nearly ready. I watched the great Casino Royale and fell asleep watching Quantum.<br/><br/>Now I was Ready!! And wow...what a strange film this is...<br/><br/>Obviously I wasn't expecting the campness of the early films but I was expecting a Bond Thrill Ride. So I waited and watched, and waited some more...<br/><br/>Great opening, some intrigue, a nice bond girl....I looked at my watch, thinking something massive is building...it surely must be...wow, I didn't realise the joker was in this??? What!!!! And this is were the film started to disappoint. I disliked the villain in this film, an odd camp bisexual misfit with a lob sided face when he removes his fake teeth. He also comes with a blonde wig to rival Elton John, tech wizardry and enough foresight to rival Uri Geller (Google him). The plot seemed to fall to bits upon his entry into the movie, i.e the hard drive, where did it go? who has it? Surely getting this back was more important? I enjoyed the likes of Goldfinger, Blofeld, I even enjoyed the voodoo priest in Live and let die, and Christopher Lees Scaramanga. They were products of their time and fun. This guy grated me, he didn't seem to fit into the modern take on Bond. Anyway enough of him.<br/><br/>This film has some nice cinematography and locations, but most of the film is a drama and lacked the degree of tension to carry the quiet parts. Because the villain takes over the 2nd half of the film, it all became a bit silly. The whole protecting M by hiding her in the Scottish Highlands, without support, suspend your belief at this point. She was after all the leader of MI 6 and someone of high importance. Bond fails to protect her, so the whole Skyfall estate was a complete waste of time. Not sure what Bond was thinking taking her there, and at the same time leaving a trail of breadcrumbs. This was before seeing what assets he had available prior to the baddie and his goons arriving. Which apparently turns out to be a severally aged Albert Finney, who seemed to struggle with his lines.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very good, even the dark scenes, and the use of light and lighting was excellent. Using flames to light scenes during the final confrontation was a nice touch. The underwater fight scene was nicely lit.<br/><br/>So on to the actors... Daniel Craig was fine, but Bond was worn out and tired, he seemed to lack conviction. A complete contrast to other Bond films. Judy Dench, fine actress, cant complain. Javier Bardem, too weird, not in a good way. Even Christopher Walken was a better villain. Naomie Harris, not good, seemed miscast, which is worrying since it appears she'll be appearing in future films. Bond girl Bérénice Marlohe didn't last more than 10 minutes, which was a mistake, since she was quite interesting. A poor choice to kill her off quick. Q was in it too, but not really fleshed out.<br/><br/>Mendes has taken the Casino Royale and stripped Bond of his urgency. He has reduced Bond to a drama, and taken lots of the fun and energy out. He's tried to pay homage to the old Bonds by introducing a new male M, Q, and Moneypenny, and reintroducing the Aston Martin db5 complete with guns (I did have a sly smile on my face at this scene). The direction of the film is fine, but the story was lacklustre, and had too much drama. Not a terrible film by any means but several pieces essential to Bond seemed to be missing.<br/><br/>At this point it seems Casino Royale is Daniel Craigs Goldfinger. Will it ever be topped? Maybe not."

","I confess that I am not a Bond fanatic, but in recent decades I saw them on TV and the life of a secret agent remains interesting phenomenon. That is why I was surprised at how much I look forward to the Skyfall; brilliant actors, a brilliant director, a a decent screenwriter. It's always Big Bang-type start, because they wanted to raise up the blood pressure of viewers and they use it thousands of scenarios. James Bond - survived the unimaginable. Never mind, I thought, it starts up and begins the film. Well, it would not start. We see the new center, a description of the mission, he came to the mission, but throughout I thought something was wrong. The film is slow, the scenes are long and one-sided. Here, let me tell you: I did not like the story, I did not like the way the film is sometimes slowed down. All together I did not like it."
"sircameraobscura","7","5","9","27 November 2012"," I expected something else...
","Let me start of by saying I am a pretty big James Bond fan, I've seen all of them and own the Ultimate Collector's set. Like most people, I was blown away by Casino Royale. It simply had all the elements a James Bond movie should have, and Daniel Craig certainly gave the character his own interpretation. Following this, I would agree with most reviews that QOS was a letdown. There are many reasons for this, however ultimately it failed. Something was missing. <br/><br/>Now back to Skyfall. Surrounding the release of the newest Bond, the Sony marketing department once again kicked into high gear, launching a global campaign that was truly impressive by any standards. And it worked. Adele's epic ""Skyfall"" theme song went viral weeks before the release, the marketing buzz was perfect. Soon enough, everyone was talking about ""the best James Bond ever"". <br/><br/>Naturally, this got me very excited. And all the right elements were in place. The great ""Skyfall"" theme song, a very talented and experienced director with Sam Mendes, and of course a cast that promised nothing but supreme performances. <br/><br/>So after weeks of hearing this was the best Bond ever, I came out of the 5pm Odeon screening and stepped out onto Leicester Square -- My first though: ""That was supposed to be the best Bond ever??!!"".<br/><br/>I simply cannot understand all of the 10/10 reviews. How is that possible? Was this the first Bond film most people have ever seen? What happened! <br/><br/>Skyfall started of strong, with a good first Act. New characters were introduced in an interesting manner and the pace kept me involved. Certain scenes such as the assassination in the Shanghai Skyscraper and its ""hall of mirrors"" were most memorable. Praise goes to the consistently exquisite cinematography by Roger Deakins. His eye for camera angles and lighting carry the film when the script shows it's weakness. <br/><br/>I though the film began to decline with the death of Severine. She was barely introduced to us when she was eliminated again by Silva. He just needed a target and why not use the Bond girl after she just had a screen time of under 10 minutes, right? The classic Bond girl was completely absent in Skyfall because of this. Severine's only role in this Bond was to lead 007 to Silva. That's it. What a shame to waste such talent...<br/><br/>It almost seemed like Skyfall was trying not to be a Bond film. Instead of using the impressive Floating Dragon Casino set to create a scene filled with the classic 007 gambling moments of style and intensity, the only thing that really happens is Bond meets Severine (for the 10 minutes she's alive) and he has a short brawl with 2 bodyguards. Oh and some weird lizard is involved too. Another wasted opportunity in Skyfall was the new Q. The classic young nerdy sidekick, seen over and over again in other films. Why not try and create a more interesting and deep character? And when the rookie Q tells Bond he doesn't need any gadgets anymore it really baffled me. I mean, the 007 gadgets have been part of the Bond franchise for 50 years, why now take them away? It almost seemed like lazy screen writing...<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong. The acting is certainly great throughout the film, Bardem is up there with the best Bond antagonists. Like I is said, cinematography, VFX, stunt coordination, and the score are all great. But after sitting through 143 minutes of Skyfall I couldn't help but feel disappointment. Maybe my expectations were just too high. Its a good film, but I would certainly not rate Skyfall in the top 3 Bond's ever made.<br/><br/>Casino Royale absolutely blew me away. Since seeing it in the cinema, I have watched it countless number of times and it's still that good. It perfectly combines the Bond style viewers have loved for 50 years with the modern capabilities of movie making. In my humble opinion, this fails in the newest Bond. Skyfall is an entertaining action film, but not an amazing Bond. 7/10.<br/><br/>After the initial hype will fade, it will be interesting to see how Skyfall will hold up with time. I am happy that James Bond Skyfall has been so successful, hopefully this will guarantee many more great 007 films in the future. I can't wait to see Daniel Craig return to the big screen. I really think he brought a lot of unique traits to the character. I guess I just hope they incorporate a little more of the ""classic"" 007 style into Bond 24. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading."

","For the love of bond, don't go see this movie. The only way we can try to save bond is to ensure this bond flops, but I fear the marketing machine may have already won that battle. I was already expecting some great things after reading the numerous ""best bond ever"" reviews here, but it now seems more likely these are fake reviews. As for the 8.4 score, I wouldn't be surprised to see that plummet shortly. <br/><br/>You may ask ""why should I avoid bond to save him?"" I'll tell you why, because the sponsorship, product placement and general commercialisation of the bond franchise is what's killing bond. It's as if it's driving the story - Enter Bond....Bond looks at omega watch, Bond plays with vaio laptop, Bond plays with Sony phone. <br/><br/>The story was so poor this film would not have made cinema release if it wasn't bond. <br/><br/>Lastly, I've heard people say this is bond ""back"" implying this bond is somehow closer to the original Connery and Moore movies - that is soo far from the truth - I don't want to give anything away but if I said name 3 things that exemplify bond you would struggle to find more than 3 minutes of them in this film. I can't stress how bad this movie is. Peace"

","So hands up who honestly thought 'Skyfall' would be the must see blockbuster of 2012, No? Well it seems certain to be not only the highlight of this year at the multiplex but also Movie enthusiasts favourite ever Bond, However bond devotees may not be convinced. As 002 Roger Moore once said ""It's sort of like a bedtime story: As long as you don't go too far away from the original, the child is happy,"" So Sam Mendes and the crews balancing act has to be commended, moving away from the traditional bond formula whilst also staying in range of the double O radar is a tricky business. The epic intro full of action that's more like the end of a film, the irrelevant MacGuffin (No Nuclear Armageddon this time its Hacking and Hard-drives - hmmm very modern) the one-liners and the Aston Martin are all here, however the glamorous exotic locations are swapped for London. A nice touch in this Olympic year.<br/><br/>Indeed at times it feels similar to the opening ceremony's celebration of British culture not only in heavyweight acting talent (Fiennes is fantastic with limited screen time he manages to change are view of him with every new appearance) but there are also nods to the poetry of Tennyson and the art of JWM Turner not to mention Adele's more traditional theme song. Thankfully this spirit doesn't extend to giving John Cleese another bash at Q instead the subtler more pivotal role is given to Pingu from 'Nathan Barley' (Ben Whishaw). Who along with at least 3 others give fine performances and should be expecting a return for Bond 24.<br/><br/>The person we should most of all be hoping gets on board for the next mission is Cinematographer Roger Deakins. Whose involvement makes this the most beautifully shot Bond by some distance. The first act as expected is full of intrigue and a bit of a slow burner (It is over an hour in before main baddie Bardem's first appearance) but the stunning visuals ensure you won't want to take your eyes off the screen for a second. If he and Mendes were to stay we could be in for the kind of sustained reboot we were promised at the beginning of the Craig era.<br/><br/>Without giving to much of the plot away expanding the role of M is something precisely none of us were asking for but it is however a master-stoke. Having are hero's damsel in distress being a vulnerable 70 odd-year-old rather than the usual bikini clad babe adds a lot more freshness than it has any right to. It is this sort of minor tweaking that 'Skyfall' does so well. If I had to find a criticism I must admit after 'No Country for Old Men' I was expecting something very special from Javier Bardem (Don't get me wrong he is the best nemesis in a long long time). I think had Bardem been given just as big a part but as a second in command henchman/enforced type we could have had a character as iconic to the franchise as perhaps Oddjob or Jaws. That aside we are left with a Bond film to be enthusiastically enjoyed an absolute must see."
"Spoffdarko","5","13","31","5 November 2012"," Disappointing and too much product placement
","Disappointing is the only word I can use for Skyfall, poor cliché-ridden script, too many blatant nods to previous Bonds, some really stupid ideas and scenes (Komodo dragons anyone?). I was very excited to see it and left the cinema disappointed and a bit angry at being cheated out of £8.00<br/><br/>THIS...is NOT Bond...Casino Royale IS Bond. And am I the only one who felt that this was a mini-reboot of the reboot?<br/><br/>Shame really when the best thing about the latest Bond film is the appearance of the DB5.<br/><br/>I don't know if it is just me, but Skyfall also seemed like a huge product placement exercise, if you weren't looking at Omega watches, it was Heineken beer, or SonyVaio laptops, or Sony mobile phones, or Jaguar cars, or Macallan Whisky.<br/><br/>And they were just the ones I did see, there must have been others.<br/><br/>Also with 30 minutes worth of adverts for Omega, Sony, Heineken, James Bond video games etc. before the actual film started, I was just marketed-out by the end of it.<br/><br/>Very disappointing in the fact that they now use the most enduring franchise in film history to flog you as much stuff as they can."

Gone are the witty one liners, gone are the toys that made us go wow. I know they've written the plot around current technology but it just made MI6 look idiots.<br/><br/>However as a film it was entertaining but not a bond."
"dan-421-105621","3","8","17","2 March 2013"," Franchise in a hype tornado
","Although it's been well reviewed, I thought I would add my weight to the argument. To give this some context, I watched it on DVD when I was ready to watch anything and it only needed to be passably entertaining to keep me happy.<br/><br/>The longer the movie went on, the harder it was to stay immersed. There were simply so many clunky issues with this movie that by the time we arrived at 'Skyfall', I'd all but dropped out.<br/><br/>A number of things really surprised me here & I'm going to bullet list them out of sheer laziness: <br/><br/>* The dialogue was really strained in several scenes. For a top budget movie I was left surprisingly uncomfortable at the exchanges between M & 007.<br/><br/>* I fail to understand how anyone who's taken a bullet to the chest can duke it out with an assassin on top of a train.<br/><br/>* Just where did Moneypenny hit 007 with that shot? How did he fall 200ft in to raging torrents of swirling water, slide down a huge waterfall & still survive. The incident was superfluous as far as the writers were concerned. He simply survives because he's 007 and we don't need to know the reasons.<br/><br/>* When 007 meets the antagonist's girlfriend at the Casino - did I miss some sexual tension? To my mind, she (and I never did pick up her name, which is a sign of a red shirt if ever I've seen it) was exuding fear and looking for help under duress. Yet up pops Bond on her yacht and slips in to her shower for a shag. This seemed demeaning to me and a poorly realised echo of yesterdays Bond. Sheer tokenism.<br/><br/>* You're working for the top government military intelligence establishment in the UK, yet you're stupid enough to join the super villain's laptop to the corporate network (which happens to be a flat structure with no boundaries). You're Co-co the Clown? No! Your designated title is Q and you're a prick. Surely after such a massive error of judgement, causing tens of deaths, we're not going to have to see his face in the follow up? <br/><br/>* Just why did Silva derail that tube train? Perhaps I missed something here but it seemed pointless. Worse still, the effects were dire and smacked of a Hornby closeup in a studio.<br/><br/>* I'm presuming that as Bond decided to whisk M up off in to the highlands rather than follow set protocols - combined with the fact that she died, means that he'll be relegated to desk jockey along with Moneypenny.<br/><br/>The only thing this movie does better than oozing stupidity is telegraphing the obvious.<br/><br/>We could never see <br/><br/><ul><li>The fact that an enemy would try and kill Bond with the gun that was locked to Bond's palm print.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>That Silva actually wanted to get inside the new MI6 HQ.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>That the laptop was primed to free him.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The fact that M was going to be replaced - and hence, likely to die to add gravity to the story.</li></ul><br/><br/>As I stood there, chained to the rock of movie injustice, eagle pecking at my liver, I thought things could get no worse. Then we get the 'My name's Eve Moneypenny' scene. Honestly - was this script sponsored by Edam or something? Above all, the movie appears to have nothing more at the heart of it than a simple 'over-cooked' revenge story that's hard to believe. Javier Bardem had real potential to be an outstanding super villain, demonstrating some real awkward tension when we first meet him. Yet, the abysmal realisation of Silva in the script gives him no room to redeem the movie.<br/><br/>3/10 - and two of those stars were for the fantastic title sequence."
"nolandalla","3","8","17","26 December 2012"," Make Barbara Broccoli the Next Villain
","James Bond endears as the universal superhero. Everyone loves 007. Young and old, male and female, black and white, rich and poor -- everyone wants James Bond to kick the bad guy's behind, and do it with style.<br/><br/>And so, a stellar cast and an Oscar-winning director were tapped for what should have been a slam-dunk monster hit.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Skyfall is a major disappointment. And given what film makers had to work with in terms of budget and talent, that's unforgivable. No doubt, all the pieces were set for what should have been a masterpiece -- ""the best Bond film ever,"" as we were promised. But ultimately, this film is ruined by its star's lack of charisma, and arguably one of the least-interesting scripts of any in the lengthy James Bond franchise.<br/><br/>Of course, Skyfall will earn a profit, which is all that seems to matter to Barbara Broccoli, who inherited the James Bond empire from her late father, Albert Broccoli. Sure, making a profit is essential. But clever marketing and riding the coattails of international brand loyalty doesn't make for a good film.<br/><br/>Skyfall lacks the wit that made most of the great James Bond films of the 1960's and early 1970's instant classics. The problem starts with hopelessly miscast Daniel Craig, now into his third reincarnation as the spook superhero. To be fair, every actor who tries to fill cinema's most challenging shoes inevitably gets compared to the original gold standard, personified in Sean Connery. Aided by some excellent scripts (Live and Let Die, Moonraker) follow-up Roger Moore made a nice ""honorable mention"" in the coveted role. But no one will ever match Connery's natural charisma and charm as the only true 007.<br/><br/>While it's unfair to compare a living film legend like Connery to Daniel Craig, the bottom line is -- the modern-day reincarnation lacks cinematic appeal. On screen, he comes across terribly insensitive. Remaining stone-faced pretty much the entire doesn't allow audiences to make any emotional connection to the man we're supposed to be rooting for. Whether he's gunning down the bad guys, exchanging dialog with the villain, gambling in a casino, or pursuing his latest sexual tryst, Craig's expression always seems the same.<br/><br/>Part of Craig's problem in this role rests in the lame writing and one-dimensional dialog, which should have been easy fodder for memorable movie quotes. Recall that in earlier Connery and Moore films, the superhero always had something witty to say when things looked the bleakest. The punch line was usually delivered after overcoming impossible odds. There's none of that in this film. While the Bond story succeeded because it provided just the right mix of suspense, humor, and charm -- swooning movie audiences for nearly five decades -- the traditional recipe is now in ashes.<br/><br/>If there's any reason to see Skyfall, it's for an excellent performance by Javier Bardem. The Spaniard has made quite a career playing fascinating villains, and this character -- a former MI6 agent gone bad -- is no different. Bardem gnaws on every line like a tiger, playing a whacked-out malcontent with but two ambitions in life -- to ruin the United Kingdom and to extract revenge on ""M"" (Dench). To the film's credit, Bardem is a nice addition to a long litany of mesmerizing bad guys with funny personality quirks. Too bad they didn't just shoot a movie with Bardem as the star. It would have been much more interesting. As it turns out, we're supposed to cheer for the superhero with the personality of an insurance salesman over a far more charismatic villain.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT Finally, there is one scene in Skyfall that is positively grotesque. How the scene made it through the dailies and past the editing room is baffling. There's a minor spoiler here, so be advised. One of the so-called Bond girls is Asian. We meet her in a Macau casino. Bond interrogates her in a bar scene, during which time we learn she was once sold off in the notorious sex trade. Moments later, the Asian woman is shown in the nude, taking a shower. Utterly dismissive of the troubling conversation that took place about the woman being forced into prostitution, James Bond suddenly appears nude in the shower and the two happy lovebirds engage in the predictable. This scene wasn't just uncomfortable. It was slimy. Even if one accepts the premise that Bond is irresistible to women, there's still an underlying suspicion that this Asian woman sleeps with Bond because she's desperate for help. The final indignity of the relationship is shown when the Asian woman meets her fate, and Bond doesn't even wince. I suppose it would have been asking too much to see Daniel Craig show any emotional reaction after seeing the woman he just bedded getting blown away in front of his eyes.<br/><br/>So, who ultimately bears the responsibility for tarnishing Bond's legacy with yet another instantly forgettable film? There's plenty of blame to go around -- from director Sam Mendes to Daniel Craig to the screenwriters. But the real booby prize goes to Barbara Broccoli, who has yet to make a good film over the past twenty years, despite her access to the unlimited resources and best talent in the movie industry.<br/><br/>Poor Albert Broccoli. I feel sorry for him. How disappointed he would likely be to see what's become of the Bond empire. After making so many wonderful films like Thunderball, Diamonds are Forever, and You Only Live Twice -- one of the world's most recognizable characters in fiction has been reduced to appearing in television commercials to pimp beer. Daughter Broccoli doesn't seem to care about art, creativity, or a once-proud legacy established by her father. She's smiling all the way to the bank.<br/><br/>Here's an interesting idea -- let's make Barbara Broccoli the next Bond villain. She's far more dangerous to MI6 and 007 than Javier Bardem."

","I went to the cinema because of the good critics but I was really disappointed. I expected much more. (Don't keep reading, as there are spoilers).<br/><br/>In every Bond movie there's someone really evil who wants to conquer or scare the world. In this one, it's just one ex agent wanting revenge. He wants to kill M. No plot there. No cool gadgets or cars from the Q department. No hot girl in a bikini or underwear.<br/><br/>About the plot, they could have done so much more. The basis was there but the development is just not quite right. There is the intrigue of not knowing who they are fighting against. Then they think it could be someone from within the MI5. The follow up of that is good, very good actually. Bond follows a Hint that takes him to Shanghai and there is a wonderful scene in a casino, where he finds the villain's girl. The whole casino scene is good. But then they find out about the bad guy. He is just resented. Only wants to kill M. No plans of world domination whatsoever. Not good.<br/><br/>And finally, the end of the movie is just ridiculous. Bond kills the guy but fails to save M. Unexpected, yes. Good end, no.<br/><br/>Another detail I didn't like: Moneypenny is a black girl with field experience... what's that? Moneypenny has always been some old lady deeply in love with Bond.<br/><br/>3 out of 10."

","OK, I know I should never say never, but that's how I feel about it right now. SO disappointing! Casino Royale (2006) was inspired greatness! Unfortunately, the sequels have been either confusing and pretentious, or just plain boring dreck. I have no objection to the descendants of Albert Broccoli milking the franchise for all it's worth, but for heaven's sake give us something worth watching!<br/><br/>What's missing from this movie, or what's wrong with it? Oh, let me count the ways. Here's my 4-paragraph rant about this colossal waste of time:<br/><br/>1) Plot-line: MIA. Simply put, there is only one story in this nearly 2 and a half hour movie: get rid of Dench and replace her with Fiennes (with a minor plot-line of creating Ms. Moneypenny). They could have done this in the first 20 minutes of the film and had plenty of time left for a rollicking good Bond story! But instead, we are ""treated"" to a dull, pandering film that is an attempt to reboot the reboot with Sam Mendes' sensibilities. Why not move on and really develop the story and the characters? Instead, we get a 10 minute story crammed into a 2+ hour movie. <br/><br/>2) Character development: Schizophrenic at best. Although expertly acted by Javier Bardem, the villain is just a rehash of the Joker from Batman, with slightly more homoerotic overtones. Nothing inspired here except Bardem's acting, which is amazing. But what's worse is the ambiguity and confusion of the main characters like Bond and M. Many of their actions are completely out of character or contradictory. Examples: M telling Bond to murder Patrice to avenge Ronson's death. Since when did MI6 become the Untouchables? They don't operate on an emotional level, they're supposed to be a logical, complex organization working for the greater good (at least for England). As was mentioned in other reviews, Bond shows truly sex-offender sensibilities in this film, bedding and forgetting a woman whom he has already identified as having been an abused sex-slave since she was 12 or 13. Bond's a womanizer, but he's also a gentleman. This film doesn't seem to be able to recognize or reconcile those ideas. <br/><br/>3) Plot holes: Too numerous to count! I'm not saying that Bond movies should be completely logical, but they should hang together reasonably well. This one is just a crazy-quilt patchwork of action scenes glued together with ""computer magic"" while pandering to the audience by throwing in references to REAL Bond films now an then. By ""computer magic"" I don't mean the CGI effects (which are great), but instead the insistence on using computers and computer programs to explain everything that happens, as if it were magic. It's so ridiculous. They might as well have been casting spells instead of using computer programs. The only difference between this film and Harry Potter is that Voldemort isn't present... oh, wait, he actually is...<br/><br/>4) The final insult: Death by Elocution. The worst part about this film is the subplot of the government inquiry into MI6, which is supposed to convince us that Bond is still necessary in the 21st century. Judi Dench gives an uninspired and creaky speech about how we're no longer fighting nations and how our enemies are loners and small groups whose actions we can't accurately track or predict. This whole subplot is not only dull and unconvincing, it's completely unnecessary and it completely ignores the entire Bond canon! While Bond's enemies in the past may have sometimes been nominally associated with foreign governments, they have ALWAYS been unpredictable psychos! This has always been the whole point to having someone like Bond available to use against them! <br/><br/>In summary, don't waste your time with this terrible movie. Just keep re-watching Casino Royale and dreaming of what might have been. Perhaps Broccoli Corp will get the message and score a hit next time, but I'm not holding my breath."

"hemchander11-521-569898","2","10","23","6 November 2012"," Disappointing - Avoidable movie
","*Contains Spoilers*<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that this was the second Bond movie I have seen from start to finish (others in bits and pieces, but aware of the entire story). The first being ""The World is Not Enough"". With the hype around this movie, I went to the theaters hoping to kindle my love for Bond franchise.<br/><br/>But this movie didn't quite do that. The main plot is extremely weak. The villain, Silva, wants to kill M who once was his mentor but wronged him. This plot has been regurgitated so many times, that it is getting really annoying. There are some parts about a list of undercover agents being stolen but that is forgotten about mid way into the movie. The dialogues are extremely clichéd and offer no great surprises. The action sequences are very average, considering that it is a Bond movie.<br/><br/>There were two disappointments that stood out for me in this movie.<br/><br/>a) Portrayal of Silva - Javier Bardem does a great job at portraying Silva. But the character itself was extremely disappointing. Nolan came along with a new breed of psychotic and sadistic villains (Scarecrow, Joker, Bane) who revolutionized how we see villains. With this Bond movie, it is very apparent that film makers are blatantly copying this formula. Silva is portrayed to be someone blinded with rage and wants to get M at any cost. But the mean streak doesn't really come out and without a proper story, his role is wasted. Oh BTW, he is killed when Bond throws a knife from behind into his spine. Silva and Bond never fight one on one in this movie. Disappointing.<br/><br/>b) Bond girls - Bond girls are someone who are extremely beautiful and have been very integral to the plot of the movie. There were two in this movie as always. And they were neither beautiful nor integral to the plot. Their ""blink and you miss"" appearance was very annoying. Naomi shoots Bond and then retires from active duty and the other girl whose name I didn't bother remembering was boring. Trying too hard to be seductive. Was very glad when Silva shot her and ended her role.They were again betrayed by poor character sketches and shoddy storyline.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes and the script writers did a very shoddy job at directing and scripting respectively and there are many open questions. How is Bond miraculously saved after being shot and falling 50 feet into water? What happened to the list? Why was Silva, an ""international terrorist"", not given a proper portrayal? How can you made a movie with such clichéd dialogues and shoddy action sequences?<br/><br/>The two good things about this movie are - The stunning opening credits section with Adele's song and Daniel Craig. <br/><br/>I sincerely hope that the next movie is a better one."

I was a little disappointed when I found out Adele was doing the theme song even though I like Adele I just don't see her as a bond singer but actually thought the theme song was OK. I didn't like the opening credits, I thought that they were a bit all over the place. The acting in the film was superb, I really like Craig and thought he was particularly good in this film. But it all went downhill when I saw the ""escape"" twist coming. I thought well that was predictable. That's the thing about bond, it's not your average American action film, its meant to be confusing with decent plot twists all made realistic by the suave that Bond has. But I was accepting it all under the idea that it would all have a complicated ending but no, lets send in a load of goons to kill bond and get me M. I wanted Silva to come alone and battle bond seeing as he is meant to be this amazing agent, but all he does is chuck grenades into the house. I wanted him to be smarter and have some twist to make James decide to let M die to get Silva. O well, maybe I just had very high expectations."

The plot I thought was a bit hmmm and the pacing I thought was very slow in the middle section, I kept wishing they would ramp up the action rather than all the farting around! <br/><br/>Should Bond be a broody almost art film experience with lots of pondering introspection/emotion, or a no brainer series of action scenes interlinked by a dodgy story involving a megalomaniac trying to take over or destroy the world, interspersed with lots of cool gadgets and good looking girls eagerly jumping into bed with our hero quicker than it takes him to drink his shaken not stirred Martini.<br/><br/>I really need to see it again (tomorrow) to finally decide if it's a work of genius or an over-hyped attempt in making a Bond for the 21st century that is so far removed from the previous films that they have destroyed it. The acting, photography is excellent though, but I didn't like the Thomas Newman score. Newman's scores all remind me of his American Beauty work using lots of pseudo ethnic percussion that I feel is not at all right in a Bond film. <br/><br/>I think the next one will be more of your classic James Bond fare which is better I think than continuing on in this style........I think?<br/><br/>One thing I am sure about is that it's nowhere as good as the greatest most gritty Bond film of all time............. Casino Royale. Where Bond kicks the **** out of everyone and doesn't stand around pondering his childhood."

","*Contains major spoilers*<br/><br/>I think Craig is a good actor, but I'm still struggling with him being James Bond. That said, I went into Skyfall with an open mind and left with very mixed feelings.<br/><br/>The plot was unoriginal; a list of agents and their alias' is stolen and a man responsible is threatening to leak the names to the world. Sure it's been done before, and however over the top and unrealistic the techno-hacking elements are, it doesn't matter. It does the job for an action spy film and that's what is important.<br/><br/>Skyfall's main problem is that it forgets about it's own plot half way through. After the Enquiry I'm not sure if the list is ever mentioned again.<br/><br/>What we are left with is the most elaborate and unbelievable 'revenge plot' that somehow manages to last around two hours. The film started out on the front foot, but for long periods of time not much really happened.<br/><br/>However my biggest gripe with Skyfall is the same as with QoS. Bond not longer cares about collateral damage. The Bolivian Policemen in QoS, and in Skyfall Bond happily lets Silva snipe the guy in Shanghai among others. Perhaps more criminally, Bond doesn't make any effort to save Sévérine, a woman who he hours before promised he would free from the sex slave trade. This is not the James Bond we have come to love over the years.<br/><br/>This leads me onto the next point. There is no Bond girl, unless you count either Sévérine, who played a minimal part, or Eve, who had very little screen time outside the first 15 minutes. I think it would be very generous to consider either a proper Bond girl.<br/><br/>The action is there, but what is love about James Bond is completely absent. I'm not sure if anybody else is getting a little bored of motorbike chases going up and down steps in Istanbul or like cities?<br/><br/>As with QoS, it's not Craig's fault, he can only work with the script he is given, but he really isn't James Bond.<br/><br/>For a film that I have so many negative things to say about, I shouldn't have enjoyed watching it, but I did, it was okay. If Skyfall was a standalone film I would have definitely reacted differently. Perhaps I set my expectations too high, or maybe the James Bond universe covered up what is otherwise a poor film. I will never know.<br/><br/>I imagine Craig will be back for a forth outing, so lets hope he is given something he can really work with next time. I'm finding it very hard to give a rating to. I'm going to stick with a 5 for it's few saving graces; it was entertaining in parts and has a couple of good action scenes, namely at the beginning and end."

","Let me describe this film in one word...Boaring, I have given this film so many chances but every time I watch this film I just end up falling a sleep, this is by far one of the dullest films I have ever sat through.<br/><br/>First of all, I am not a Daniel Craig fan. I'm sure he's a nice man and I think its wonderful how much he does for charity, but as an actor, he dosen't do a thing for me at all, he's a modern day Chuck Norris. And here he is no different, when I think of James Bond, I think of James Bond I think of a smart, charismatic and witty. Craig just stands there and says vague stuff.<br/><br/>The film is also way too long, but I guess we live in a world where directors feel like they have to make action films 3 hours long. None of the characters were interesting, in fact, I barley remember what their names or objectives were.<br/><br/>The only remotely interesting thing I remember was Javier Bardem as the villain. He was just a typical over the top bad guy, and he was just fun to watch. He was cool but he could'nt save the film, and his plot was really forgettable.<br/><br/>Some fight scenes were cool, but I will be honest, not only is this film overrated, it's pretty bad."

","How is this film so successful? Is Bond a magic word that means you can film an ants nest for two hours, call it Bond, and presto, people will rate it high? Skyfall has absolutely nothing going for it, yet it has made millions. Maybe the sequel should have an android as the star (it would show a lot more emotion than the current Bond)? Before Daniel Craig tried to become Bond, I loved Bond movies. I loved the mix of amazing stunts, the wry humour, the cinematography and even the acting. Having John Cleese turn up as Q was a touch of brilliance. The last fifteen minutes of the last non-Craig as Bond movie contains more action and excitement than is in the entire Skyfall movie. Skyfall has earned the studio awards and lots of money, so unfortunately it can only mean that Daniel Craig will almost certainly be back as Bond. I tried to watch his first Bond attempt, but fell asleep after the first ten minutes. I tried to watch it again, but it just isn't Bond. I avoided his second attempt, but going by what the critics were saying, I watched ""Skyfall"", only watching it to the end because my daughter wanted too. This plodding, badly written, under budget tripe isn't even a shadow of a Bond film."
"Spondonman","7","6","12","19 November 2012"," Adequately entertaining
","I wanted to see this as it's been trailed by the UK media and critics as the best Bond film ever. Well, to my mind an impossible job as Sean Connery hung up his toupee decades back – but I thought it could be a good action film for all that. I found it rather entertaining hokum and a passable time-passer, then I saw some of the savage IMDb comments and wondered what I'd missed.<br/><br/>The first 12 minutes are cops chasing robbers chasing cops, but the film quickly resolves itself into  nothing but that. The baddies have stolen a list of names the other baddies wanted to keep secret, 'tis Bond's mission to find out how/why/who/where and instigate liquidation proceedings. The film is a shallow linear and hackneyed adventure thriller yarn told straight – nothing wrong with all of that, but compare it with the contemporary Dark Knight Rises for something equally as nonsensical but with marvellously inventive use of cameras, sets and cgi cartoonery. Favourite bits: the crackers chase opening; the mesmerising scenes in the psychedelic Shanghai skyscraper with Bond calmly letting a stranger get murdered; when trying to get to Mum in central London marvelling at top mad baddie Silva's precision prescience which rivalled that of Paul Muad'Dib in Dune Messiah; the scenes at Skyfall itself, bringing a lot of old fashioned wood into the picture to give it a rosier glow. Craig & Dench in particular out of the muttering cast did a good job with their guttural whisperings. The biggest letdown was the cold blooded and pointless execution of Bond's female consummation of the night before – why do film makers insist on some such gratuitous atrocity, is it only in the hope we'll remember their films fondly?<br/><br/>Overall, it's nothing fantastic but enjoyable and entertaining – and probably the best Bond film since Connery."
"tye1138","7","6","12","9 November 2012"," This is why revenge films don't work.
","Making a James Bond film is a challenge and being part of the club is something unique in of itself. It seems to me the more recent James Bond films are made by directors who really want to do something different, but the classic formula is still lingering in the wings. The directors are trying to buck the trend in any way they can, but the net result is still a Bond film... just without the charm and whit of the classics. <br/><br/>Skyfall falls into the same trap as the last few films, it tries so desperately to buck the trend with more realism, phenomenal cinematography, simple stunts which aren't too over the top and a fantastic cast that not only works, but is well directed. With these elements, you'd expect this film to be a winner, but unfortunately this time around, it isn't a Bond film anymore. What most filmmakers don't understand about James Bond films is quite simple; the cheesiness is what makes them great. The charm and whit of the classics, the bad guys who want to rule the world, the imprisonment of Bond with a countdown clock before some laser cuts him in half. These elements are what is lacking in the last three films. Daniel Craig's presentation of Bond is more modern and the filmmakers feel they need to ""update"" Bond, where the truth of the matter is, we go to Bond films to see the cheesiness, to see the gadgets, the one-liners, etc. <br/><br/>This new Bond film falls into the same trap as the last few have, its just another action film with characters from the Bond franchise, NOT a James Bond movie. There is nothing wrong with that, its still an entertaining and well made movie, but its lacking the soul which makes REAL Bond films. Skyfall has one other small issue, which is the simple fact its a revenge film with almost no character development. So the audience is left scratching their head, wanting more, but not understanding WHY they want more. Its quite the conundrum and I'm anxious to see the deleted scenes on video. <br/><br/>In summary, its a very entertaining action film. The production value is through the roof, the acting is top notch, the directing is good, but it just isn't quite a Bond film. The identity doesn't exist and unless the next film is super cheesy and over the top, I'm afraid the Bond franchise has lost its charm.<br/><br/>One side-note, I love Thomas Newman, but he is the wrong guy to score a Bond film. It was the most distracting and non-Bond score I've ever heard. It feels like the entire post production was rushed and detracts from the over-all ""bondness"" of the film."

","It's one of the worst Bond movies because the filmmakers of this series all too frequently have operated under the delusion that stringing a few decent action sequences together can somehow make a Bond movie into a compelling spy movie. There is no more-direct evidence of that idiotic thesis than this movie. The script is awful - it is the very definition of an inherently flawed story determining characters' actions, rather than the other way around. The acting had kernels of greatness, which could have blossomed had the script not been awful.<br/><br/>As far as combining espionage and action in effective stories that actually demand audience attention, the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series has already beaten the Bond series to the punch."

","There are three items which make Skyfall worth some credit. First there is the title song. Regardless of whether the lyrics make sense (like all the other bond songs) 'Skyfall' is destined to be a soul classic someday. Second there is Javier Bardem's performance. His bond villain is as deliciously whimsical as he is sinister. Third there is Roger Deakin's cinematography, which compliments all the set pieces with extraordinary light and colour, and subsequent texture.<br/><br/>Aside from this, Skyfall is dismissible. The biggest problem is Daniel Craig who plays James Bond with no love. He seems to interpret 007 as a creation of the cold and seclusive espionage world of John le Carré. That wouldn't explain however the way he just shoots back a shot of thousand dollar scotch as if it were a tequila and lime. What happened to your class Mr. Bond?<br/><br/>Between the action set pieces, Skyfall is rather ponderous and void of wit or charm. The movie brings in a 'would be' bond girl (with the whole package; lips, legs) only to bump her off a couple scenes later in a way it feels like an attack on the bond girl tradition itself.<br/><br/>Skyfall succeeds in dodging most of the gimmicks but fails to capture the highlights of the 007 legacy."

","Skyfall celebrates a long running franchise that spans 50 years and staples itself as one of the best so far. After the misfire that was Quantum of Solace, Bond is back in a form we haven't quite seen before. <br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes anchors a brilliant script and adds meaning to what was previously a character without much layers. Mendes doesn't shy away from giving us a splendid variation of visual flairs, making this Bond the most aesthetic yet. <br/><br/>This time around we see 007 face his own vulnerabilities after having been accidentally shot down by his own team. Bond retires the life of espionage, inducing himself in alcohol, with no purpose, only to be brought back by a mysterious hacker who has targeted MI6, more precisely, M herself. After a rigorous regime to get James back in shape, the agent is back as he tracks down this new threat. Enter the villain. With a superb one shot introduction, we meet Javier Bardem's Silva, a blond haired, weirdly camp and psychotic-in-a-fun way villain that delivers right from the start with a monologue that couldn't be better written for him to chew off. Him and Bond bounce back and forth like a pro tennis match, each trying to gage the other, Silva sometimes sexually. This is where protagonist meets antagonist in a perfect symbiosis. <br/><br/>The action remains thrilling, relying in more realistic sequences rather than bombastic set pieces often seen in the Pierce Brosnan era. One sequence especially serves as Bond's best hand to hand combat. <br/><br/>The Bond girl here is Judi Dench, as she owns the role one last time. She is as much a Bond girl as he is M's guy. The relationship between Bond and M almost mirrors one of a lost son and a mother without one. <br/><br/>All in all, Skyfall delivers in almost all fronts. Sam Mendes has crafted a beautiful, intelligent and relevant film that brings James Bond back as one of the most iconic spies of all time."

","OK, the story is no more or less plausible than previous episodes in the series. Perhaps it has a harder edge, with a line of coffins draped in Union Jacks and faux news coverage of summary executions filmed on hand-held cameras mimicking all too familiar real life events. What is unfortunate is that the legacy of this series, injects softness where there should be none and implausibility where mere spectacle is no longer enough. The legacy demands that Bond is portrayed as a heroic figure, but coldly, there is little in this tale that is heroic. The dichotomy for the writers is delivering a convincing narrative about this secret agent, when little that drove the invention of the character and his ""glamour"" has any meaningful relevance to the job such an agent would need to do in today's world. We've know this for years of course, and the problem is perhaps the biggest challenge to face anyone who wants to continue the succession. There are few films in cinema history that are nicer to look at than this one, but if you want to get the most out of the film, don't bother trying to connect too many of the dots in the story. It's not Shawshank, The Godfather or Lawrence of Arabia, but it is a GOOD James Bond film!"

"zkonedog","3","4","7","8 March 2017"," Time To Go Back To ""Formula"" (Ironically Enough)
","There is no denying that ""Casino Royale"" and, albeit to a lesser extent, ""Quantum of Solace"", did a remarkable job of breathing new life into a Bond franchise that had become too over-the-top at the tail end of the Brosnan years. Yet, in the case of ""Skyfall"", the franchise actually goes too far in the OTHER direction (e.g. too gritty, too ""real"", if you will). This is what prevents the movie from being a true Bond Classic (or really even close).<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Skyfall"" sees an aging Bond (Daniel Craig) once again taking orders from M (Judi Dench), this time trying to bring down cyber-terrorist Silva (Javier Bardem) before he can completely cripple MI6.<br/><br/>There are two glaring problems that haunt this film (one ""macro"", one ""micro""):<br/><br/>1. The ""big picture"" problem is that director Sam Mendes doesn't seem to have a clue how to place ""Skyfall"" in the Bond canon. SPOILERS AHEAD: At first, viewers will think that this is the latest Bond film after Die Another Day, as the main theme of the movie deals with Bond getting older. Yet, as the movie goes along, one begins to doubt (what with a young ""Q"" and an MI6 setup remarkably like the Connery years) if this isn't still treading prequel territory. I think this is suppose to be more of a ""reboot"", of sorts, but it just doesn't make a whole ton of sense. You either need to have continuity in a film series, or you need to reboot it completely...there can't be a large amount of overlap.<br/><br/>2. The ""little stuff"" trouble, then, is that the ""Does the world need James Bond anymore?"" storyline is a complete flop (and that is what is supposed to be the main emotional backbone of the movie). Again, director Mendes tries to take the franchise too far into ""Dark Knight"" territory here, when in fact that Bond character is not meant to be done in such a fashion. It worked once in ""Casino Royale"", but this is not a place (e.g. dark themes) in which this franchise can consistently succeed.<br/><br/>Overall, then, I was severely disappointed by ""Skyfall"". I hope that the next two Craig Bond efforts go back to the more traditional Bond formula (gadgets, girls, & fun) without falling into the ""over-the-top"" trap that ultimately slayed the Bond runs of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. Bond is all about balance, and the scales need to be tipped a little bit away from the ""dark side"" once again."
"EnglishWuTangDisciple","8","4","7","7 October 2015"," New Age Bond
","Four years on from the disappointing Quantum of Solace, legendary screen hero James Bond (Daniel Craig) makes a triumphant return to the big screen. Director Sam Mendes deserves the lion's share of the credit for this triumph, for his inspiring boldness and deftness in simultaneously paying homage to the classic Bond adventures of the past whilst defying the conventions that have previously made Bond films stale and restricted. Quite frankly, a Bond film that re- establishes several series staples, explores Bond's roots, positions M (Judi Dench) in the main Bond girl role and which features a villain in Silva (Javier Bardem) whose plans are more grounded than simply world domination, deserves huge praise.<br/><br/>The film kicks off when a figure from M's past returns to plague her and MI6 comes under attack, a washed up and down on his luck James Bond must return to track down and eliminate the threat at all costs. These events thrust Bond into what can only be described as one of his most thrilling adventures to date, taking the now fifty year old series, in a bold new direction.<br/><br/>Perhaps not so coincidentally referring to the 50th anniversary of James Bond and the fact that four years have elapsed since the last Bond film (six since Daniel Craig's debut), the film's central theme revolves around the dichotomy of old and new. Over the course of the film many references are made to this dichotomy jokingly or otherwise. The film examines whether Bond is too old or still has the stuff, whether MI6 and espionage still have a place in the post- Cold War world, how rogue actors present a different threat than traditional nation states and if cyber warfare presents a greater threat than typical military actions in the field among other things. This central dichotomy of old and new is also represented through the characters played by Bond newcomers Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw.<br/><br/>The performances from the film's star studded cast are predominantly solid. On his third outing in the main role, Craig finally seems to have grown into Bond's skin and taken full ownership of the character. Judi Dench as always injects M with her trademark cold professionalism while Ralph Fiennes deftly manages to make the audience constantly doubt his character's intentions. However, it is Javier Bardem who is the real star of the film, stealing pretty much every scene he is in. Bardem's villain Silva is the perfect juxtaposition between camp and playful and intimidating and frightening. A particularly memorable scene where he awkwardly caresses an imprisoned Bond more than cements his place in the lore of iconic James Bond villains.<br/><br/>However, not all of the performances are on such a high level which tarnishes the film ever so slightly. The two performances in question are those of Berenice Marlohe and Naomie Harris who play the traditional young and beautiful Bond girls of the piece. Now it could be argued that the characters were written poorly or were simply marginalised in favour of making M the main female presence of the film. However, it's hard to ignore the fact that the relatively inexperienced Marlohe switches from seductive and intriguing to unnatural and awkward from scene to scene and that talented actor Harris provides the film's cringe-worthy moments when flirting with Bond. Furthermore, while the film should be praised for its originality in breaking typical Bond tropes and conventions, its central plot is ultimately based on revenge, which is highly unoriginal and overdone at this moment in time.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Skyfall is a blockbuster with brains and is a fine example of how a good James Bond film can compete with the absolute heavyweights of the action genre. Right from Adele's iconic opening theme to the closing credits of the film, the audience are taken on a captivating thrill ride. Sam Mendes and the cast deserve massive credit for skilfully crafting one of the very best James Bond films of the series' 50 year run and quite possibly the film of the year."
"drmnc1","7","4","7","6 February 2014"," An enjoyable film but not a James Bond film.
","Don't get me wrong, I liked this film. In fact I enjoyed watching the film. But somehow it didn't feel right. Even the mediocrities of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace gave off similar vibes to all the other James Bond films we know: the charm, elegance and fun that is the taste of a James Bond movie. However, this film did not feel like this. It did not feel like a James Bond movie. So here we go with a straightforward plot about ex- agent Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) back with a grudge against M (Judi Dench) who cut him loose when he was going about some unauthorised hacking and was captured by the Chinese.<br/><br/>There has been a recent trend in big film series that the sequels continue to get darker and darker, as can be found in the likes of Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and the Dark Knight trilogy. This happens also in Skyfall, and although making such films darker can often make films more successful, this simply does not work with James Bond. The uncharismatic role Daniel Craig plays as James Bond does not help with this. In the films (and the novels), James Bond has always been full of charisma, charming and full of witty remarks. Although many of the films have incorporated real-life situations in their plots (such as the Cold War), there have been few that have been too serious (The Spy Who Loved Me, Diamonds are Forever, Live and Let Die). To his credit, he manages to pull a couple off here, but they are very few and far between. Although it was entertaining, it did not seem reminiscent of the others.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, although the plot was quite different to what we've experienced in the past, the film itself was quite one-dimensional – the only major plot line was Silva's vendetta against M. That's it. One plot. Few (in fact, one) subplots. <br/><br/>It starts off well. Silva is threatening to release all the names of operatives implanted in terrorist organisations of the world. That sounded really interesting. However, everybody forgot that it existed as they dropped it halfway through the film so Silva could pursue M. This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. If you are going to create a plot device, it should be followed through, not binned and hope that nobody realises. So they had to fill in the rest of the film with tons of action sequences (everybody enjoys a bit of mindless action, but that was too much) and by bringing Bond's family into the story was little more than plot-filler, for what could have been a very short film. This subplot (the only subplot actually) could have easily been placed in any other Bond film as it serves no function to the overall plot whatsoever.<br/><br/>Most notably, Skyfall has the biggest anti-climax I have seen for a long, long time. All 3 of Daniel Craig's Bond films have ended in a huge anti-climax which has always made the film a huge letdown. There are no henchmen, or ""second-in-commands"" to speak of in these recent films, and every major villain has posed little match for Bond. The past 3 films, one was shot unceremoniously by another terrorist, another flailed around with an axe for 15 seconds before being easily disarmed, and now, the villain, Raoul Silva, who was one of the best Bond villains we have seen in a long time – gets a knife in the back. He did not deserve to die in such an abrupt manner, like any one of the grunts James Bond ploughs through each film. It's insulting. <br/><br/>Although elements from previous films such as Q, the Aston Martin and Moneypenny were welcome in Skyfall, often they served little function in the film whatsoever but to amass nostalgic favour from long-time James Bond fans. I really think the change to Britain as the backdrop for most of the scenes in the film was very refreshing and enjoyable – the exotic landscapes of far abroad places are not missed in this film. The UK has plenty of natural beauty to showcase itself, and it was nice to see some of that. New additions to the cast like Mallory and Moneypenny I am sure will keep the series afresh for many films to come and made noticeable impacts in Skyfall.<br/><br/>As the 23rd film of a series, this film could not relate in any way whatsoever to the previous films. Its plot is one-dimensional and makes little sense in many parts. However, if you were to consider this film individually from the rest of the series, and could ignore the awful ending, it was a decent film."

He enjoys death and decides to retire for good when the troubles back home convince him that he is needed once more. An old, unfit and alcohol addicted James Bond returns to duty with a huge question mark slapped on his head on whether he can continue the job or not. The movie is very different from the usual Bond movies where we are accustomed to seeing Bond romance several beauties, have a gadget loaded car and have blistering action sequences. There was no 'Bond girl' in this movie, there were hardly any awesome gadgets that 007 used and save for the first 20 minutes there was absolutely no other captivating action sequence the movie could bring up. Javier Bardem was a saving grace to some extent but somehow he too does not feel like the right villain that Bond would usually fight. The movie was disappointing and although I haven't seen each and every Bond movie, I will go as far as claiming this to be one of the worst I have come across."

","Skyfall directed by Sam Mendes is an awesome action movie! The movie,said to be the 23rd installment of the James Bond series is an entertaining movie!

As MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.<br/><br/>The movie has some excellent performances,power-packed action sequences,awesome dialogs,breathtaking cinematography and water-tight screenplay.<br/><br/>The movie also has a shortcoming,that is its duration.The movie has several unwanted scenes,which add up to the length of the movie and makes it tiresome.<br/><br/>The direction is excellent.<br/><br/>The screenplay is excellent,although it does go erratic at times,but still manages to captivate you.<br/><br/>The dialogs are good,specially the ones delivered by Daniel Craig.<br/><br/>The action sequences are fantastic.<br/><br/>The cinematography is awesome.The locales of Istanbul,Shanghai,London and Macau are a treat to the eye.<br/><br/>Performances: Daniel Craig as Bond is super-awesome.Cant the forgot the way the people went berserk at his entry! Javier Bardem as Silva is outstanding.Judi Dench as M is efficient.Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory is nice.Naomie Harris as Eve is average.Ben Whishaw has very little to do.Rory Kinnear is fine.<br/><br/>All in all,Skyfall is an excellent entertainer and an amazing installment to the James Bond series!I am giving it a nine on ten.Strongly Recommended!"

","was disappointed with Skyfall﻿. It was OK, but it was a generic action movie, and to put it into the James Bond genre just felt awkward, there were too many cheap and nasty tricks to try to make it fit with everything that went before.<br/><br/>specifically, what on earth was going on with Moneypenny. she's supposed to be an AO or EO or HEO civil servant with Developed Vetting Clearance not some failed field agent (who'd I would expect to make a shockingly bad secretary). she's not supposed to sleep with bond, just flirt, the knickers are supposed to remain firmly on because she's smart enough to know she's not that sort of girl.<br/><br/>Richard McCarthy﻿ was correct, Judy Dench is a joke as m. which is soul destroying to admit as Judy is a national treasure. but her performance in this was comically poor.<br/><br/>too be honest if I were Sean Connory and had watched this I'd have been super irritated at how they just trampled over all of his legacy.<br/><br/>I think, too be fair, if anything in the film industry needs to be rebooted it needs to be the bond franchise, which has become too generic and has frankly lost its way.<br/><br/>restart it from the beginning, set it in the era that it was written, between 1953 and 1966. have bond be as biased, bigoted and misogynistic as he is in the books so that he becomes and anti-hero (the wrong man doing the right thing).<br/><br/>I think if this was achieved we'd have a daring, gritty and dramatic bond, rather than some generic, cookie-cutter, johnny-come-lately, action hero."
"cloudsponge","3","7","15","30 January 2013"," Puerile Pabulum
","Not having the mentality of a 12 year old I wasn't of the demographic the filmmakers were aiming for.<br/><br/>Another formulaic Hollywood travesty of senseless violence. <br/><br/>Summed up briefly this movie is just like all the other James Bond movies. An eccentric evil genius gets Bond under his power at his secret lair and instead of killing Bond instantly he decides to have a casual chat with him long enough for Bond to wreak havoc. Seen that, and been there too many times. It is old, stale, and as ridiculous as ever. In spite of all the flames, explosions, gunfire and killing, it is boring.<br/><br/>Apart from the music and production values Skyfall was constantly eye-rolling stupid. With Daniel Craig's one-dimensional, Gloomy-Gus characterization the only women that could possibly ever be attracted to him would be obsessive necrophiliacs. The one tinge of sex happened when he snuck up on a woman and as much as raped her in the shower. How did he get there anyway? So many elements of this movie had the quality of deus ex machina. Things happen not because they could or were remotely possible but simply because it suited the idiot filmmakers. No one falls from such a height as Bond did into water and survives. Hitting water from that height is like hitting concrete. That combined with being shot with a high-powered rifle makes his survival questionable. Wasn't she aiming to take a head shot? The question of how on Earth he could have survived wasn't touched on in the slightest. Why? Because the idiot filmmakers couldn't offer a solution. No. Just have him appear suddenly later. Same as his being in M's apartment. But of course, considering her position there would be no security so it would be easy for him to break and enter. Ha! Even if they were lovers (ha!) and she gave him a key to her place it would not be a simple matter for him to surprise M. The truly simple things in this movie are the simple minds of the filmmakers.<br/><br/>The Komodo Dragons were obviously computer added. As believable as 50-year-old blue screen. Step on a Komodo Dragon's back and it will wheel about, leap, and seize in its poisonous jaws the fool trying that. Oh, but of course, the Komodo Dragons were on the same drugs as the idiot filmmakers. Oblivious to all and everything, and so it just ignored Bond's assault upon it and kept walking as if in a daze. Just like the makers of this film. <br/><br/>The puerile fist-and-grappling fight scenes make these top agents look like the only martial arts training and experience they had were gotten on the school yards of high schools (secondary schools).<br/><br/>How could the antagonists be so certain Gloomy Gus was at Skyfall? He was off the grid, whereabouts unknown even to Q. Q was not tracking him he was trying to set up a false trail. If 007 and M really wanted Silver to follow them why did they have to change cars to eliminate the possibility of being tracked?<br/><br/>Why would a woman, as in Singapore, betray her dangerous boss for the sake of some harsh Gloomy Gus because he grabbed her wrist forcefully and pointed out the possible provenance of her tattoo? Why wasn't she being listened to by Silver's people as Bond and Moneypenny were listening to each other? Haven't the filmmakers done they're homework? Traditionally in fantasy movie situations like this it is after she makes love to or at least falls in love with the protagonist that such a woman betrays the antagonist. Oh, but Bond snarlingly grabbed her wrist. That certainly would make any woman fall head-over-heals in love, or seek to use him instantly, and in public, to betray, in his own den of henchmen, a killer . A killer who held the power of life and death over her. And what was the problem with her bringing him to the island? Bond wasn't supposed to be with her? So where was she thinking she was going on a boat controlled by Silver's men?<br/><br/>The movie was misogynist. Moneypenny was shown to be dangerously incompetent. The other two strong female leads were killed. What was Bond's reaction to the vicious cold-blooded murder of Silver's female compatriot? ""What a waste of good whiskey."" M at the end gets replaced by a man. What do the filmmakers have against women?<br/><br/>I could have done without the ""Home-Alone""-shenanigans, with gunpowder, at Skyfall.<br/><br/>Not only was the escape tunnel useless in that it exited into an open field visible from miles around, but the escapees needed a flashlight to see where they were going in spite of the intense firelight illuminating all from the burning mansion. They would need a flashlight for only one reason. To give the idiot filmmakers a way for Silver to spot them. Just continual eye-rolling stupidity.<br/><br/>I like Adele's song. But having to listen to it as part of this trash ruins it. It is much better listened to on its own.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie was seeing the Aston Martin DB5. I laughed when Bond flipped the cap up to the red eject button. And, yeah, I was in high school when I first saw the DB5. I'm not now."
"michaellaing71","8","12","30","26 October 2012"," Skyfall, Easily on the best Bond films
","Casino Royale was one of the best Bond film, whilst Quantum of Solace was frustratingly flawed. Now we have have Skyfall, the third outing of Daniel Craig as Bond, with Sam Mendes stepping into the directors chair.<br/><br/>After the horrible opening to Quantum of Solice (a lesson in bad editing). Skyfall opens with an extremely strong action packed opening sequence, which introduces a new major character and also is the basis for the main plot of the film. The following title sequence, is exceptionally well done and whilst I am not a big fan of Adele's Skyfall opening theme, it does work well with the titles.<br/><br/>I won't go into any further detail on the story but it is handled well through out. Certain comparisons have been made with Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' and I can definitely see resemblances, though I think the dynamic between the characters in Skyfall is stronger and more interesting.<br/><br/>Whilst the story for the film is quite basic, it is written extremely well for the most part. The dialogue is probably at a higher level than I have heard in a Bond film for many years and maybe ever. Sam Mendes is generally accepted as being a actors director and he shows his skill here, bringing out some great performances.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig has made the role of Bond his own and for me is probably the best Bond. In this film we see a much changed, more grown up Bond, who is much more world weary than previous Bonds and who is shown to have various problems. Judy Dench as we expect is impressive as 'M' and with the story of the film, revolving firmly around her character, she is given much more to do than any previous Bond film. <br/><br/>As for incoming Characters. Javier Bardem is a strong Bond villain, who come across as extremely creepy at times and camp at others. Naomie Harris works well as the field agent 'Eve' and her character and Bond work well off each other. Bérénice Marlohe does a good job in her role but isn't given a huge amount to do, Ben Whishaw plays a modern version of 'Q', he is given quite a bit to work with and again his interaction with Bond helps the film. Ralph Fiennes comes in to the film with a very murky character, who is fleshed out through out the film. It does become quite obvious where his character is heading, though those of us with a suspicion double cross nature might come to an in obvious but incorrect assumption.<br/><br/>Mise-en-scène in a Bond films are exceptionally good generally but with Skyfall the notch is moved up another level. The settings for the film look extraordinary adding a huge amount of character to the film. Special mention has to be given to Roger Deakins, who does an amazing job of the cinematography and if this is not up for an Academy Award for the amazing job he has done on the film, it would be a travesty.<br/><br/>Another area where Skyfall has stepped up its game is the score, which I found both comforting and interesting. Thomas Newman has taken over from David Arnold and has done a great job. As I said at the top, I am not a big fan of Adele's Bond theme but it does make much more sense after seeing the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I can't say the film is perfect. There are a couple of moments, which for me don't work as well as they should. The initial interaction between Bond and Bardem's Raoul Silva, at a certain point becomes uncomfortable, in not a great way. Fortunately that moment psses soon enough but it will raise eyebrows.<br/><br/>My second gripe is the ending.I found it to be much weaker than I had hoped for. It isn't terrible but is very sudden and feels out of step compared to the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Apart from the two small problems though I feel that Skyfall, in Bonds 50th year is a triumph. I would say that this Bond film probably isn't for kids as it has some strong moments, though none stronger than the Chair scene in Casino Royale. Well worth going to see."

","Saw it last night and by this morning had pretty much forgotten all about it. Says it all really. Wanton destruction of the DB5 most ""un""cool. Had the feeling I had sat through 3 distinct films before the last 30 minutes which had some redeeming qualities. Daniel Craig looks too old and worn out - I felt knackered just watching him. Actually, he made Judi Dench look positively youthful. I keep on saying never say never again and not see the next movie but I have low will-power. I think this one may have finally pushed me over the edge. Part of the problem may be that Sam Mendez tried to make a 'real' James Bond 'drama' but because it straddled the need to titillate though gratuitous sex and violence and at the same time stimulate intellectually it was neither one nor the other. I wouldn't necessarily avoid but if you don't bother watching this until you can see it for free on TV you will not have wasted your time waiting."

Well, let's melt this sentence on our tongues. It meant, shoot the bad guy even if you hit the good one too. And we don't talk about some collateral damage here, we talk about our hero. This is the opening of an awful construction without any sense, humor or inner logic. Plot as plot can: Apparently somebody knows all the codes and secrets of MI6 and is able to hit them badly, yep, just blast the headquarter. Nobody can do anything against it. Even not the politicians in the Westminster Palace can be saved from this man - deep frustrated, apparently homosexual ex-MI6 sociopath-agent Javier Badem - who storms in with a bare pistol in his hand. Yes, they're truly lost down there in London. So tremendous lost, that the story finally leads to the childhood house of James Bond in the Scottish wilderness. This is the last resort where him an M seems to be save. Sure, it's just a bait, and sure, the old housekeeper is still there. Now: Three against the evil. We just miss Pater Brown up there in the highlands and the steamy moor. Beside this facts of raging stupidness it dismantles Bonds background secrets as an agent and as well as his character.

","Strip James Bond down to the basics, a man and his mind, and this is what you get. This is raw Bond, down in the dirt, with almost no devices (tiny radio-ish thingy), yet he is still expected to save the British Empire, which, of course, he does. Study the plot and you can see how it all leads to only one conclusion; the Bond that we have all learned to love over the last 50 years had to start somewhere, and this is where he starts. <br/><br/>I won't go over any of the plot points (some are weak, most are not), or the character development (which is not in the least bit weak, except for the villain) but I will say that this is the most satisfying Bond I've seen since Sean Connery in ""From Russia With Love"", where Bond simply had himself (and a crappy briefcase) with which to defeat a very determined enemy. It is almost the same thing here. What you get is ""Bond"", period. <br/><br/>There are those who do not like the new Bond, but after the previous five, I'd put Daniel Craig's Bond up against any of them, and I'm sure he would give them all (Even St. Sean, whom deserves all praise) a run for their money. The producers have very wisely rebooted the franchise and stripped it down to the bone, and if they keep this up, we will see a new, relevant Bond, for many more years to come."

Silva (Javier Bardem), once a trusted agent, feels betrayed by M and vows to kill her. M knows the only man she can trust is Bond, James Bond (Daniel Craig) to make things right. Let the games begin. <br/><br/>Most of the action in here occurs in the first 20-minutes. And, this action is incredible. I had to duck numerous times. There is more very good action later on but nothing like the first 20-minutes. How they did all that is a mystery. Wow !<br/><br/>I want to say this was the best Bond, James Bond ever, but I cannot. Bond, James Bond is being rebooted. Bond, James Bond wears a beard for too long a time. Not good. Looks too old with it and is hardly recognizable. Q (Ben Whishaw) is now a very young person who Bond, James Bond doesn't quite trust at first. Q only gives Bond, James Bond 2-toys to help him get out of jams. Only 2-toys? Oh, the horror! There is no baccarat or even poker although Bond, James Bond goes to a casino in China. Bond, James Bond gets his vodka martini, but the words ""shaken not stirred"" are never heard. There is no quirky one-liner Bond, James Bond is noted for after a tussle with a bad guy. The twinkle in the eye is never there. It was always there with the other guys, especially with Sean Connery. Bummer. <br/><br/>Yes, changes are afoot for Bond, James Bond. You will be surprised to see who the new Moneypenny will be; but will Bond, James Bond toss his hat on the rack as he encounters Moneypenny before he sees M for his next assignment? These things are not important in the grand scheme of things, but they are things that endeared us to Bond, James Bond. And, we miss them. Bring them back. <br/><br/>There are some other changes afoot but to reveal them would give too much away. However, the biggest thing in here is the villain, Silva. In past Bond, James Bond escapades there was never anything personal with the bad guys. This time it is very personal as you will see. And, yes, Javier Bardem as Silva is very scary. <br/><br/>I feel the producers of the Bond, James Bond movies are making a mistake in aging everyone including Bond, James Bond. We do not want that. Like a favorite cartoon where the characters never age is the way Bond, James Bond should be portrayed. If they keep on the way they are going we will need a new Bond, James Bond soon. Hey, Daniel Craig is no spring chicken, you know. <br/><br/>All my misgivings aside, this was still a very good Bond, James Bond movie. But, keep the white whiskers out of all this . Keep Bond, James Bond forever young and bring back those subtleties that keep us saying ""Bond, James Bond is our guy forever"" If you bring back the quips and the twinkle in the eye we will forgive everything else.

","Spoilers have tried to be avoided but sometimes you just cannot. I also have only wrote this review to balance the critics' rave unwarranted reviews.<br/><br/>First off I can't pour scorn on Mendes, to be fair the cinematography and direction are not at fault. But I cannot see how the same person who wrote Casino Royale's script was involved in Skyfall's script. But can see the same nonsense from Die Another Day. Mr Purvis hang your head in shame. <br/><br/>Secondly, plot holes can be forgiven when they are few and far between, but this film is riddled with them like a fallen gang member from south central LA. <br/><br/>Thirdly, Skyfall's title sounded good, but it turns out to be the name of Bond's ancestral home, hold on he is an orphan, but an orphan with a stately home with lands to match and a grounds-keeper too, Richie Rich anyone.<br/><br/>And in closing a movie that built up for a while ended too quickly with a whimper, and every ""shock"" was obvious from a mile away. Mallory, Moneypenny, Silva's escape etc.<br/><br/>The only reason this film is not a 1* in my opinion is because Craig and Bardem actually acted quite brilliantly, with a very poor plot, generic dialogue and poor supporting cast (except for the perennial giant that is Ralph Fiennes).<br/><br/>Goldfinger and Casino Royale tie for 1st place for me in terms of Bond movies, this does not even register a blip on the radar, highly overrated tosh!"

Normally the girls would leave a lasting impression - either good or bad. Not the case this time. Their screen presence was barely noticeable. I thought the franchise had hit rock bottom with Halle Berry in that regard.

Things briefly recovered with Casino Royale, then the descent resumed with Quantum of Solace, and now Skyfall. In my opinion, they have made a mess with their reboot attempts. They seem to be trying too hard while making strange decisions in the process.<br/><br/>The movies are also coming across as exceedingly dark and Bond has very little charm these days. Having read most of the books, I think Timothy Dalton came closest to Ian Fleming's vision of James Bond.<br/><br/>If they are so determined to wipe the slate clean and start things from the beginning, then we need a younger Bond. They are replacing everyone else with younger actors, so pretty soon Bond will be the oldest member of MI6, and that is bound to be a bit awkward.<br/><br/>I won't hold my breath for the next installment. I may have to wait for the reboot of the franchise reboot, if that eventually happens. In the meantime, I'll pop in a DVD and enjoy one of my favorites, including For Your Eyes Only, The Living Daylights, Dr No, etc."

","I was disappointed with Skyfall due to the plot and overall inconsistency of the movie. There are so many factors that make me feel this way. Here are a few without giving too much away.<br/><br/>1) Bond can't move out of the way when he knows an order has been given to shoot 2) Surviving a fall like that and then vanishing off the face of the earth, why?? are we watching a Bourne movie or have we lost creativity here? 3) Q is just terrible. The actor should stick to playing roles like in Cloud Atlas 4) No gadgets at all? 5) Super duper ex agent with amazing computer skills hacks into Mi6 systems because of a moronic act from the so called super intelligent Q.. OK whatever.. those who see the film will know what i mean.<br/><br/>I am amazed that this got such a high rating like 8. Clearly IMDb is rigged and its not the first time i have seen errors with movie ratings on this site. <br/><br/>Besides bashing the film i can say it was mildly entertaining to watch but definitely not the 8 as it has been given. i give it a 5/10."

"empbb","3","8","18","25 December 2012"," A bad remake of earlier Bond movies that fails miserably
","This move features a flash back to the past. In fact most of the movie is a flashback. The first quarter of the movie reminded me a lot of Tomorrow Never Dies. Just swap a mad news mogul with a mad computer genius. Terror! Terror! Terror! After that the move travels farther back into the earlier Bond movies, where Bond fought against an unknown enemy - SPECTRE. Lots of disposable henchmen and cheesy lines. The villain is some sort of a resurrection of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (SPECTRE #1). I am just surprised the new villain didn't own a cat. This super villain is supposed to be super scary, more scary than anyone else in the world! Except this is according to the bond girl who's been terrorized by him since she was 12. As it turns during the movie, he really fails to live up to that standard. In fact, compared to the other Bond villains, he is bellow average. The scariest thing he does is smile in a creepy way, not very scary if you ask me. And speaking of the Bond girl. We see her for a few minutes here, a few minutes there and then she is gone out of the picture. I have trouble even calling her a Bond girl. Really, this is the first Bond movie with no Bond girl. Way to go and experiment! There are about 10000 polls on the internet that try to ascertain who the sexiest Bond girl is. Meanwhile, the movie producers and writers decided to create a Bond movie without a Bond girl.<br/><br/>Oh well. I guess it could have been worse, I didn't actually get up and leave the theater, so that's a little something."

Skyfall opens up with a bang and closes with a bang. The first scene with the chase though a European country,witch ends with a 'ow no she didn't'.Craig brings back the best bond to date with being funny at times and angry at times buts its the little things Craig does that bring class to bond, like sort-en out his cuff-lings after jumping from the crane,though the roof to the train was just class and funny. the bad guy Javier Bardem as Silva, let me tell you he is mean. The new Q played by Ben Whishaw is great, Bond dose take the micky out of him for being young mind, the effects in the film are great, one off the effects was the underground crash was holy cow... lets just say its better than the one in coronation street.There is a sad part where M sadly dies :'( all in all Skyfall get a EXCELLENT 10/10 See this film."

","This film just adds a touch of class to the bond series. Craig is on great form here as Bond, struggling to get back his edge as the super spy. But this movie is owned by Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. The Villain here is similar to Villains of old such as Gold finger and Blofeld. He is truly menacing and he has some killer sarcasm at key moments in the movie. Overall this is a 10/10 for a Bond movie, it has everything you need. It adds a new Q played by Ben Wishaw famous for the the new TV show The Hour and you are introduced to a new character close to M played by Ralph Fiennes. Lets hope that Sam Mendes does one more Bond."
"owen-chin89","4","8","18","30 November 2012"," The franchise has regressed.
","I much preferred the direction the franchise was heading with Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale. They were saying times have changed and so they did away with all the fancy gadgetry and made it more of an action based film wrapped around a character (Bond) that seemed to be more human-like; a character that people can actually see exist in real life. I felt those two movies were magnificently done because they were able to keep Bond's ""suave characteristics"" while still being able to do away with the cheesiness of previous Bond movies. <br/><br/>The franchise was heading in the perfect direction; then came Skyfall......Now if they reverted back to the old style after introducing a new actor to play Bond then I'd be more accepting of it because it'd be more of a ""revamp"" of the character and the setting and time in which he exist. An example of this would be the transition between having Pierce Brosnan play Bond and having Daniel Craig play bond; the setting and overall feel was different. However, since this movie is still played by Daniel Craig, it's hard to grasp the concept of how different the first two movies are from this one. <br/><br/>In the movie, they kept on repeating on many occasions that times have changed and new tech has surfaced while Bond was presumed dead. However, I feel that this ""new technology"" is rather fake and doesn't give the sense of ""a new day and age"" at all. Moreover, the way in which they had Daniel Craig portray Bond in this movie is a complete let down. They initially chose Craig because of his athletic build and ability to portray Bond as a ""blunt killing instrument"" as said by Dench in Casino Royale; Craig was exactly this in the first two movies. In Skyfall however, they made him into a prancing ballerina similar to how Pierce Brosnan portrayed Bond. I think that the overall feel of the movie has regressed rather than progressed. <br/><br/>To further solidify the fact that it has regressed, look at the gender of the character that they chose to replace M. When they first chose Judy Dench to play the role, it marked a significant point in history because the franchise was portraying how a character such as Bond who frequently cycles through women as if to have no respect for them could somehow find himself so respectful and tamed by a women (Judy Dench). They say that they're heading in a new direction in which the ""Bond Girls"" are not seen as his equals. When they said this of Quantum of Solace, I believed it. However, in Skyfall, not only did they replace Judy Dench with a new head of MI6 that is male, they also did not introduce a bond girl that is even remotely close to the independent and strong character played by Olga Kurylenko in Quantum of Solace(Camille)."
"Thorsten-Krings","5","8","18","29 November 2012"," Bond goes Bourne
","After a very weak last Bond film (Quantum of Solace) Skyfall makes an attempt at trying to come back as a plot and character driven film rather than as an action driven one. There is no doubt that Skyfall is indeed better than the last film but it is mediocre as an action film and disappointing as a Bond film. Strangely enough, it has always been said that Craig is supposed to be the best actor ever in the Bond role. If he is a good actor he does not show it in this film. Every gesture and every posture gives the impression of being studied. Hardly ever does he appear as being authentic. He always gives the impression of someone pretending to be a tough guy. This is most obvious in the final scene where he stands on a roof like a cowboy whose horse has been stolen but who hasn't noticed it yet. Oveerall, the film has a whiff of ""Ersatz"" about it which starts with the theme tune in which Adele renders an unimaginative copy of a Shirley Bassey performance. Throughout the film we keep finding hints and allusions to past Bond films and one cannot help but wondering what the message is: they don't make films like that anymore? That also results in some glitches in the logic. Casino Royale was basically a re-imagining of a young Bond who wins his Aston Martin in a poker game yet here he is back with the Goldfinger DB 5. I found Bardem equally offensive as an actor since he simply copies his role from ""No country for old men"". The action sequences work fine and are much better woven together than in A Quantum of Solace. However, what little story there is is either between implausible and absurd (Okay, this is a Bond film but within that framework a story should at least be logical) and the main theme of revenge is something that anyone who knows the espionage genre has seen a dozen times before at least and usually better executed- most notable in Spooks. So all in all, Bond has left Bond territory and essentially we are in Bourne terrain now. If you like it, you will see an okay action film. If you are a Bond film you will be disappointed."

","The chase on the rooftops in Istambul was first seen in 'The International' (granted, here they are not on motorbikes, but it's hardly original). The chase scenes inside the bazaar are cheaply made (i.e it is obvious they are 'green screen-ing' it). The whole thing would have been better if he was saving Severine instead of 'M' but that's another story. Casino Royale, and Quantum of Solace were markedly better IMHO. The villain is OK (although he was much more convincing in No Country for Old Men, as the script was far more superior). London/Scotland are very dry, uninteresting places for a final face off."

","While the movie had some good aspects the last 1/3 of the movie was not very well done. The introduction of a possible homosexual theme for James Bond was horrible. I've noticed some movies lately trying to incorporate a strong acceptance of homosexual themes.<br/><br/>I'm sure many view this as a good thing to accept different views but I see it as an agenda being pushed that will effectively show young people growing up that homosexuality is a good option to consider - creating or adding to their confusion over sexuality.<br/><br/>This is not the direction we should be pursuing. We view it as freedom but it is actually enslavement."
"thesar-2","5","8","18","10 November 2012"," Fallen, Indeed
","And the Bond reboot trilogy comes to a close. Although, I believe they might have left it open to another sequel<br/><br/>I really don't know what to think, immediately, at any rate, of Bond's latest, Skyfall. Well, of course, I'm happy to see him (and Daniel Craig, my favorite Bond) back on the big screen – IMAX, no less – after such a long and unnecessary absence.<br/><br/>The reason for my hesitation was because I was disappointed in the poor script, plot holes, and terrible villain – although I should be proud of what I think they were portraying him to be. In addition, there were so many references to the older Bond flicks that I just re-watched or watched for the very first time recently that I just didn't care about. Injunction with the seven or eight attempts at homage, all they talked about was the same boring cliché Lethal Weapon kept reminding us of: ""We're getting too old for this sh|t.""<br/><br/>Enough! I am a James Bond fan, for the most part, and I put him in the same category as a super-hero. I don't want to see him fall from the sky, get shot, complain about cramps, want to move into a retirement home or act human. Sure, it makes it more realistic, but Jason Bourne was pretty banged up for most of his trilogy and he didn't make us listen to all his wines or grunts. Ironically, Judi Dench's M was tough as ever and she's twice Bond's age.<br/><br/>Regardless, take out the meager writing – including the most obvious twists, the crying and one-too-many homage's – even the so-so title song was one, it was a very decent action film that started off with a fantastic chase scene, had a great silhouette shot and included one of the best cinematographers in the series. I also enjoyed the Bond Girls, albeit they were fairly absence throughout. The lesser of the two girls in relation to screen time, Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) has to be one of the best looking Bond Girls of all time.<br/><br/>Bond's chasing a man with a drive, hard drive, that is, containing the secret identities to all MI6's agents and inadvertently gets ""dead"" for several months. When the sh|t hits the fan, Bond pulls himself out of semi-dead mode to aid M find the computer hacker while she's dealing with, ah-hem, politics to continue funding the spy organization.<br/><br/>Things get personal and hit home for our heroes and once again, our Bond villains always stop short of either killing Bond or escaping and giving Bond more than adequate time to basically reload or recover.<br/><br/>That last part is a Bond film signature, and as much as they tried to make this the most realistic, I found myself pointing to the screen to the most obvious exits or actions the villains should be doing while waiting for Bond to catch up. They might as well be tripping over some bushes at Camp Crystal Lake while Jason Voorhees slowly walks to them.<br/><br/>I'm really not trying to dog the film that much, and it was a slight improvement over Quantum of Solace, but it was a letdown from what I expected. I still love Craig (and his Dumbo ears) as Bond, and Judi Dench as M, and I will be excited for the next chapter, but I hope they get away from all those Bond references and just start making individual Bond movies again.<br/><br/>Forthis movie truly made the exceedingly superior Casino Royale look like just the first part of a reboot trilogy. With all that came to pass, all the way to the finale of Skyfall, it finally looks like the series came in full circle. So much so, that the movie basically felt like it immediately preceded Dr. No.<br/><br/>In regards to that, I praise them and I yearn for an energized and original Bond to come next.<br/><br/>Side Note: The movie touched on one topic close to my heart and opened the door wide for people like me. I'm being very general here, because I don't want to spoil anythingbut, I was shocked and pleased with Bond's reaction and statement while tied to a chair and being interrogated, sort of, by the villain. Way to go. I'm glad this Bond film has an open mind. I just don't want to hear the backlash from the general public."

","I won't say I loved this film, but I definitely liked it. As usual Daniel Craig's Bond is spot on. He makes Bond somehow more real than previous actors.<br/><br/>Skyfall has a purpose, and that purpose is to bring back the classic Bond. You are finally introduced to the new ""Q"" and ""Moneypenny"". Bond exclusively uses a Walther PPK as his weapon. He drives the old Aston Martin he won in Casino Royal, only now it has machine-guns behind the headlights.(sound familiar?) This is definitely homage to all the other films, and is perfect for the 50th anniversary. Skyfall is filled with innuendo and references to the Connery days which adds a certain whimsy to the movie. It has action, humor, drama, and charm galore. A perfect 007 movie. If you are a Bond fan, this movie is a must see. If you are not a fan you might want to wait till it hits DVD."

","This is not a 'Bond' movie. When I watch this movie in theater I greatly disappointed that not to fulfill my expectations as imagination by me. After first action reels the moves goes very slow. The bond girl does not do any action not daring act like previous ones. There are very rare chances to see comic touch of Bond. Also bond looks in non shaved face along with seen taking pills. He has no dynamic car nor fantastic gadgets. How he plan to take M at a non secured place where anyone can attack simply. This is not matched with the plan by Bond, the super spy. Disappointment goes at high when M died. Why can not Mr. bond survive her? I never expect from such super hero. Basically, this bond is very different from old like Roger Moore, Sean Connery etc. The both were original bond and their movies were full of thrilling excitements, comic lines, lucrative bond girls and extra villain character like hat man ( Harold Sakata in Goldfinger) or Jaws in Moonraker/Spy who loved me. Skyfall showing that bond is growing old and a slighter dull like Batman in Dark Knight Rises. As me all of our superheroes never grow old. They must young and active like past because they have ever responsibility of saving earth or world or all human being. Overall Skyfall is a boring movie and never to be compared with previous bond series. It is very alike from them. One who expect bond's famous capabilities or stunning action scenes with cars, gadgets and sexy bond girls definitely will disappoint."
"Falconer1","1","9","21","31 December 2012"," Bond has become a sad and boring second rate action ""hero""
","Bond is ""dead"" as far as I am concerned (or at least temporarily put on ice) because Daniel Craig is, in my opinion, an absolute trainwreck as Bond, a sad second-rate main-stream action hero. The ""feel"" of a James Bond is of a smooth, suave, confident, well-groomed and in control man and saving the world is somehow ""effortless"". Daniel Craig is not only unbelievably unattractive (looks like an accountant on a bender) but he acts like an insecure teenager with a ""oh yeah"" - chip on his shoulder - attitude. Only...he's an adult. I would seriously NOT feel confident if my life were in his hands. A Bond is somehow...other worldly - he cruises effortlessly through his ordeals and there's a lightness and playfulness coupled with a devilish charm in his moves. Like any super hero Bond embodies all the super human characteristics that make men envy him and over which women drool. Well I'm certainly not drooling and if I saw a guy with this attitude at the local bar I would not spare him so much as a glance!"
"asha-albert","10","9","21","16 November 2012"," Not a typical Bond movie...but a great movie nonetheless!
","I went for the movie with some very high expectations - engendered partly by the fact that Quantum of Solace had left me miserable - and am happy to report that Skyfall more than fulfilled my expectations.<br/><br/>Die-hard James Bond fans might be disappointed, since this movie represents a drastic departure from the genre - Bond here is more sensitive, more given to self-deprecating humor, less prone to emphasizing his manliness, and most importantly, has a past. A past that he shares with M, and that catches up with both of them.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a spectacularly magnificent action sequence across the rooftops of a Turkish bazaar (India's loss, Turkey's gain), and culminates in Bond seemingly being shot and plummeting to his death. Of course, since he is Bond, he is not dead, and returns when the ghost of an ex-agent comes back to haunt MI6 and M.<br/><br/>The ex-agent Silva is played to great effect by Javier Bardem, uglified,for lack of a better word, with bleach-blond hair. Silva has a few bones to pick with M who he believes has betrayed him, and he has a diabolical plan to bring her and MI6 down.<br/><br/>While the movie differs from its predecessors also in not being an all-out action flick, mention must be made of the inventive fight sequence in a Shanghai high-rise - shot in darkness, lit by flashes of garish neon - the fight is seen mostly in silhouette, and is very realistically choreographed.<br/><br/>Both Bond and Silva get our sympathy - the first by his portrayal of an aging man, haunted by his past, desperately trying to prove himself in a young man's world, and the second by the trauma he has undergone for the sake of a cause he wrongly believed in. M played by Judi Dench, is the true Bond girl, forget all those bimbos you have seen over the years. She is funny, she is feisty, she is manipulative, and she will do anything to gain her own ends. Her defence at the enquiry is a masterclass in acting.<br/><br/>The movie ultimately belongs, as it should, to Daniel Craig, probably the finest actor to ever play Bond. He truly embodies everything that James Bond should be - a man in every sense of the word. Perhaps nothing embodies the evolution of Bond as well as Craig does - he has moved from a wise-cracking lothario to a man who is keenly aware of his failings, physical as well as psychological, and triumphs in spite of them."

The story delves deeper into the characters of its principles than any other film in the series. It feels like a story that Fleming himself could have written. The pacing is steady. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is breathtaking, along with the razor sharp editing by Stuart Baird. Craig claims the mantle of Bond for himself. Javier Bardem is the creepiest Bond villain of all time. He equals, if not surpasses, his Oscar winning performance in ""No Country For Old Men."" And even in a series where you sometimes you feel like you've seen it all, this movie offers up an array of surprises that run the gamut from funny to heartbreaking.

","Perhaps the most somber moment of Skyfall is when the credits begin rolling and you realize that the film has presented a potentially unstoppable, untouchable, superior story to the modern Bond franchise.

Mendes' cinematography coincide with the best Bond character performances in series' history. Amid Daniel Craig's most convincing Bond performance yet and Bardem's chilling villain play, Dench, Fiennes and others give an fantastic emotional flair rarely seen in past action epics. In the end, Skyfall merges old bond with new bond in such unbelievable fashion, that Skyfall has made itself a mandatory keystone in the famous British series. An absolute must see."

After an exciting opening sequence, the movie sagged badly, with little action either, until the half way mark when the baddie Javier Bardem appeared. He was great, in fact the only great thing about the film. The film may have been well made, and well shot, but I found it bleak and tiresome, and worst of all just not very exciting or suspenseful. I am bored with seeing it raining in London, this is a tired cliché, London is not such a rainy city ! The Shanghai scenes were boring and unimaginative, I only saw the film 2 hours ago and I am struggling to remember what happened there ! The casino fight was quite pathetic and absurdly resolved. The mystery island segment showed imagination and was better. <br/><br/>The film was full of decent half-laughs and sniggers, but no real killer lines. I am not at all a fan of mindless bombastic action films, but honestly I would be happier to have even John Woo or Michael Bay direct the next Bond movie than see more of this ! Give me flash cars, massive action stunts etc. The romantic scenes with the bond girls were also far too understated to the point of being inane, cutting away before there was barely a kiss. This must rank as the un-sexiest bond movie ever ! <br/><br/>There was not enough action in this film, and I can't believe it cost $ 200 million, where did it all go ? Although the critics reviews are all very positive at the moment, I am sure that when the hype dies down this movie will have no higher a rating than Quantum of Solace in the long run.

The whole story of disappointment with M was childish. M wasn't being a nice mommy. Where is the professionalism of a double-o agent? SPOILERS ahead. I had three scenes that were a major problem to me. First when Eve was told to ""take the shot"" why didn't she fire again? If the hard drive was the most important item then the thing to do would be to shoot Bond and once he was out of the way to shoot Patrice and knock him off the train. Instead the scene was wrapped in this sentimental emotionalism. ""Oh no I shot James Bond!"" Weak. The second was the escape of Silva from the glass cage. Okay I can accept some deus ex machina reason for his slipping away, just to keep the story going, but why weren't the underground passages and tube guarded or secured. This facility was supposed to be highly guarded and top secret and all Bond had to do was to lift a grate and voilà a ladder leading to the tube. They had to know the ladder and tunnel were there when they built the place or did the entire British secret service not think about looking under the grates. It was a HUGE security hole. Did they rent the place at the last minute from an ad in the newspaper? It is a wonder some wino living in the subway didn't wander up the ladder and fall asleep in the glass cage. Come on. Why not have Patrice blow a hole in a wall that led to the tube? The third problem was the ending. If Bond knew that people were coming to kill he and M then why not get some help. I assume Britain has an army, or Special Forces, or a police department that could have been utilized. If they were out of communication then how did Patrice find them? Couldn't that dork Q do something to help? Was this action over a weekend and no one was available? How could Silva commander a helicopter and troop of men and the British secret service had nothing. The whole scheme was so amateurish. Silva should have won since he seemed more capable than the whole British government. The whole end fight sequence seemed from a different movie that would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. Disappointing. Lots of action and big bangs but a weak script. I thought Javier Bardem was good as the bad guy, given the weak script. Naomie Harris is likable but the love interest part was not believable. Bérénice Marlohe was sufficiently babeish. Ralph Fiennes seems to be a good replacement for Judi Dench and the whole ending in M's office was fun."
"marsh876","1","5","10","16 February 2015"," Skyfall Sucked
","I wish there was a 0 rating. Confusing, meaningless plot. Are all Brits terse and sarcastic all the time? Judy Dench is always good, but she can't save this shipwreck. Good thing I saw it on Amazon Prime. I'd have walked out of the theater after paying $10. The coloring is inconsistent, making it irritating. There is no wit and charm. Just drivel dialogue until the next shoot out. Save your viewing time and watch an old Lassie. You'll get something out of that, at least. I did like the use of the old Astin Martin. And they played some of the old Bond music themes. Be thankful for small mercies! Too many scenes where there is no movement on the screen and silence."
"classicalsteve","8","5","10","6 January 2015"," Maybe the Best 007 Film Since ""From Russia with Love""
","Seven actors have portrayed James Bond, Agent 007 of MI-6, the ultra- secret bureau branch of British Intelligent. None, in my humble opinion, will ever outdo Sean Connery as the cool and calculating international spy who sports automatic hand-guns and beautiful mistresses. However, I believe a close second may be the latest installments featuring Daniel Craig. While the forgettable mid-Bond films, starring Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan, who seemed like he was just replaying Remington-Steele with higher budgets, more often than not were more like Bond-by-the-numbers intent on making money from the name, the women, and the gadgets, Daniel Craig has stood out. Craig may well be the best successor to Connery in the role.<br/><br/>The other Bond installments with the above-list of mediocre actors in cookie-cutter installments, featuring the obligatory femme-fatale, a casino scene, and a chase through the Alps, pale in comparison to the latest Bond installments with Craig. Maybe why I like the Craig versions as some of the best since Connery has to do with making Bond more vulnerable. In many of the Moore and Brosnan installments, I certainly knew Bond would break free from his plot-driven shackles but the way the character was played, I thought the character himself knew he would win in the end, and so I was never rooting for him. He was always so cool that I knew he knew he would prevail. Not with Craig. Craig's take on Bond is more subtle with sudden unexpected emotions, as if his character doesn't know whether it will turn out in his favor, which is as it should be. Craig sweats, grunts, even sheds tears. I never saw Moore grunt hardly at all. (I liked ""Jaws"" from ""Moonraker"" much more than Moore.)<br/><br/>In ""Skyfall"", Bond and MI-6 are dealing with a foe who has infiltrated the computer systems of British Intelligence. Part of this foe's breach includes the revealing the aliases of under-cover British agents all over the world. Bond and MI-6 must stop this baddie before he or she compromises more field agents which may lead to their deaths. Is this is an old foe, like Specter, a new foe, or someone else? Maybe someone who knows the intricacies of British Intelligence? A wonderful film from start to finish with a good combination of humour, action and even emotion. And there's even a throw-back to elements of the old Bond films of the 1960's."
"OllieSuave-007","6","5","10","18 February 2014"," Sky-fall from grace.
","This 007 movie has a little more action than Quantum of Solace, where James Bond (Daniel Craig) inadvertently exposes secret agents from around the world after a botched mission, causing M (Judi Dench) to relocate MI6. With the agency compromised, M can only rely on Bond to crack the case and follow the trail of perpetrator Silva (Javier Bardem), who has a personal and lethal mission of his own.<br/><br/>The opening sequence was well done, with the very nice ""Skyfall"" song sung by Adele capturing the majesty, charm and mystery of all the intro songs from previous 007 movies, with the exception of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace; this is a great throwback to Bond's heyday. My favorite part is when Bond and M hop into his Ashton Martin and speeds off, where the classic Bond theme plays in the background. It was also nice to see the introduction of Q (Ben Whishaw), but I wish he would have resembled the classic Q more rather than a computer nerd who looks like he was fresh out of college. And, Javier Bardem makes a love-to-root-against villain, sending Bond on a wild and thrilling chase around the country. <br/><br/>Like the previous two Bond films starring Craig, this movie lacks the charm, suaveness, substance and humor you've come to recognize and love from the earlier 007 movies. This film's atmosphere and storyline were dark, which deviates to the more light-hearted Bond movies of the 70s and 80s. In addition, the time-line for this and the previous two films are supposed to be set before the events of the pre-Craig movies; however, this was not explained very well (i.e., as good of an actress Judi Dench is, they should have had a different actor/actress portray M since she was also in the Pierce Brosnon movies, which are set after the events of Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall). The story itself wasn't too appealing.<br/><br/>Overall, not one of the better Bond films. It's just another action flick with some neat special effects, but minus the 007 flavor.<br/><br/>Grade C"
"Gambitt","5","5","10","9 July 2013"," Fun Action Movie Dulled by Plot line Absurdities
","There's a lot to like about Skyfall: the entertaining and fairly creative action sequences and the beautifully shot videography. I particularly enjoyed the first third of the movie, which indeed had the look and feel of a traditional Bond film-- a high-speed, globe-trotting, action-packed adventure. I generally have no problem with Daniel Craig's tougher, beefier Bond.<br/><br/>However, once we meet the villain, Silva (Javier Bardem), the film is forced to flesh out its plot and things deteriorate quickly. There are numerous plot holes and contrivances in Skyfall, but I'm willing to overlook most of them except the two glaring ones that are central to the movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, the movie has an Aha-He(Silva)-planned-it-ALL moment a bit over halfway through the movie. A movie can do this, so long as the plot leading up to this fits. But considering that Skyfall up to that point was a sequence of seemingly arbitrary, fortuitous events, this strains credibility and indicates sloppy, contrived writing.<br/><br/>Secondly, Bond hatches a devious, cunning plan to counter Silva in the final Act of the movie. Except it's not devious. It's a horrible, illogical, arbitrary plan, put in place only because the writers wanted to shift the movie's setting. Lazy writing like this only serves to undermine the characters.<br/><br/>Skyfall is not a bad movie, but the plot problems make it feel like a ""stupid"" movie-- one that was a written for an unthinking audience. I don't require that movies be impeccably realistic, but I do hope that writers take the time to address the most logical and obvious questions that are likely to pop into the viewers head.<br/><br/>On a side note, the movie actually seems more chauvinistic than its predecessors. All the female characters are portrayed as unreliable and error-prone, as dependent on male counterparts, or ultimately as mere sex tools. Perhaps this is what the critics were talking about when they raved about Bond getting back to its roots?"
"AbbyColclough","9","11","28","26 October 2012"," Brilliant Bond
","Well I saw Skyfall today. I was a fan of Casino Royale but I thought Quantum of Solace was not as good and was lacking that element of bond. Well Skyfall grabbed that bond back with both hands. As well as a brilliant soundtrack from Adele and co, the movie was packed with pure bond action. The cars, the guns, the fights, the chases. It was a thrill ride for the ages. The actors performed so well and the characters were very well written indeed. Bond is explored much more than in the past movies, M was pulled to the for front of the film, the villain is a true bond villain and the cute and quirky Q won me over in seconds. I highly recommend this movie."
"terryperring104","10","9","22","12 November 2012"," No Dr Evil here, a villain with a reason...
","This, for my money is the best Bond movie. It has all that should be in a Bond film, beautiful women, great stunts and exotic locations... But it has a great, linear, easy to understand plot. Not only that, the gags are some of the best, everyone laughed heartily in this cinema.<br/><br/>Another plus was the villain, Silva. He has a reason to hate M, and his camp, twisted view of the world, brilliantly played by Javier Bardem, is special and better than any other villain in the series. I wont be surprised if there are some Oscar nominations for this film:- Actor - Craig, Supporting actor- Dench, film -Mendes, Director, Mendes, and also the cinematography and soundtrack/theme/music. A nice birthday present to itself."
"keekosdoctor","7","9","22","11 November 2012"," One of the greats! A must see for Bond fans and new viewers alike.
","I meant that for me by the way. This was my first experience with seeing a Bond movie in theaters,and dude, it was totally awesome! After therather strange and cluttered bit of...stuff, that was Quantam of Solace, Skyfall feels very much like the continuation of Casino Royale. <br/><br/>For those not in the know, Skyfall represents the 50th anniversary of 007 as a film franchise, and boy does it do a better job of celebrating the films of old than the OTHER ""celebratory"" film Die Another Day (made for the 40th anniversary).<br/><br/>Too start with, Daniel Craig cements himself (for me anyway) as the definitive James Bond with this performance. Craig's Bond has just the right mix of humor, suave, and brutality, making endearing but by no means the prototypical ""good guy"". Craig could have easily carried the whole film on his own, but he also has a fleshed out and intriguing supporting cast. Judi Dench returns as M, who's much more of a key player this time around, being the target of the villainous Silva (played by Javier Bardem). <br/><br/>Several other supporting characters get to play key roles throughout the film, but Skyfall's story is a deeply personal one for the three main characters, something that, along with the several little references (and re-establishing) of Bond film staples, makes Skfall a great jumping on point for new fans. <br/><br/>The plot is well constructed, and what few little niggles the story has do nothing to detract from how great it was put together. Action setpieces aren't over used and over saturated like they were in Quantam of Solace or Die Another Day, and not one scene in the movie feels unnecessary.<br/><br/>To talk too much about the film would spoil a lot of surprises, but safe to say it easily ranks among the best of the Bond films, and climbs to my personal #1 spot. It's obvious Skyfall was made by people with nothing but love for 007, and the film serves as a nice merger of all of the previous eras of Bond with the more gritty and modern Bond. <br/><br/>In short it's a good movie. Go watch it. Now. Do it."
"aharmas","10","9","22","11 November 2012"," A Human and Tormented Hero
","There is always guaranteed fun watching a Bond movie, and it's unbelievable that the arguably best Bond film ever shows up during the franchise's 50th anniversary. Daniel Craig makes a superb return to form in ""Skyfall"", a film that gives us a deeper understanding of the relationships between ""M"" and Bond, and his ties to his past. This makes the film richer and more interesting than it being just a senseless display of special effects and thin scripts. ""Skyfall"" certainly is very good movie.<br/><br/>In addition to the usual intrigue and spy fare typical of Bond's films, Bond is now confronted with psychological pressure and scars. We see a man traumatized by a close encounter with death, who is testing the loyalties and support of his superior, and is now facing a worthy villain, someone who might understand him much more than he knows.<br/><br/>Javier Bardam plays Silva, Bond's nemesis, and he is a pleasure to watch, as he keeps on outmaneuvering the good guys. He understand the machinery, and he is out for blood, compulsive and driven, and this only guarantees that the final third of the film will be deeply satisfying. Be prepared to see how the ghosts of Bond's past mingle with the demons in his present, and the surprising twist at the end.<br/><br/>Skyfall soars."

"jayraskin","1","6","13","23 December 2013"," Good Movie to End the Series On
","The Bond movie series started off quite original. It was really a combination of Hitchcock's ""North by NorthWest,"" the T.V. series, ""Danger Man"" and numerous Mike Hammer type detective movies. However, Ursula Andress in a bikini, Sean Connery in a tuxedo, and some great sets by production designer Ken Adams gave it a sheen that no other film had before it. Every spy film in the 1960's tried to copy it and failed. This was a mixed brew that nobody had ever tasted before.<br/><br/>How sad to see the series now shamelessly copying other movies. The lost list of all our agents which triggers the plot comes from ""Mission Impossible,"" The Exotic locations, including China are also from that movie series. The smiling, invincible psychotic killer villain is the ""Joker"" from ""Batman""/""Dark Knight"" Stealing again from the same source, the capture and imprisonment of the villain in the middle of film turns out to be a planned maneuver by the villain. The second major plot of betrayed agent going after his organization is from the Bourne (Robert Ludlum) movies. It is clear that the spy series that everybody else ripped off has run out of fresh ideas and is now shamelessly ripping off from other successful big budget movies.<br/><br/>One can imagine an honest trailer for this movie: ""See the latest James Bond adventure. This is James Bond, older, uglier, stupider, and more vicious then you have ever seen him before. This film explores the one relationship you've always wanted to know about - the love/hate relationship between James Bond and ""M."" Does he love her? Is she a mother to him? Does she hate him? Is he like a wayward son to her? What is the truth about their relationship? See ""Skyfall"" and find out.<br/><br/>Anyways, this is as good a place as any to stop the series.

The set-ups are so implausible and the payoffs so predictable. Bad guy getting caught and then escaping so easily? The tube train explosion? And Skyfall is the name of Bond's Scottish home?

","After all the brouhaha and critical raves for ""Skyfall,"" I finally got around to seeing it. Now I'd really like to know what the critics were smoking. I actually fell asleep in the middle of this loooooong, boring epic, that has practically nothing to do with any previous Bond film, except for an action-packed pre-credits sequence (action-packed, but ridiculous, as Bond is shown to be as indestructible as Superman). Here's the plot: somebody connected with MI6 has stolen a list of agent identities and starts outing them, causing not only their deaths, but great embarrassment to M (Judi Dench), so she reactivates a somewhat dissipated, believed dead, James Bond goes to find the guilty party. A cat and mouse game ensues until he's found. That's it. For two-and-a-half hours. It seems like six. Judi Dench as M acts like someone doing a Judi Dench impression, while Daniel Craig is starting to resemble a ""Spitting Image"" caricature of himself. The tough-as-nails approach to Bond is great, but only if it's not retrofitted into a super-hero storyline more reminiscent of the Roger Moore era. Javier Bardem plays, well, he plays The Joker, really, but that's not his character name. I was ready to write this off as the worst Bond movie ever until an Aston Martin DB5 shows up, making the most welcome cameo in recent film history. (Other cameos are not as good, including a completely unrecognizable Albert Finney as an old, old family retainer). So because of the Aston Martin, ""Skyfall"" moves up the list, but it's still in the bottom three of worst Bond films."

Unfortunately I went in at the point where its theatrical run was coming to a close and all that could be found were the fattest dregs of its fan base; the kind of people who seem to have shotgun blasts of ""backne"". There were some hot girls there too, but they had their parents with them.. or their parents had mace... I can't remember... all I know is that I ended up beating off and crying in isolation to one of the worst movies I'd ever beaten off during (next to Skyfall later that night). I mean, I hadn't seen any of the other Twilight films, but I knew going into it that it was going to be terrible, but instead it was just horrendous. Watching Trash Humpers again for the eighth time would have seemed relaxing and pleasant compared to this arrant display of mental retardation splashed across the screen like a vomiting dog. Though there was one good part in ""Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2."" While fumbling for the zipper on my pants I found a pack of matches in my pocket that had some broad with boobs on it. Totally awesome. The movie ended so I decided to sneak into Skyfall and try to pick up some old ladies, hopefully widows. The night ended again with disappointment. You'd think that they'd make a good movie what with it being the 23rd in a franchise, or at least do something different... But no, it was just like the rest. Bond wins and undergoes no changes whatsoever as a character. The same old spunk tortured out of Fleming's dead dick, tarnishing the legacy with repeated mediocrity...

"Turfseer","4","8","19","17 November 2012"," Skyfall fails to pass the three 'G' test (Girls, Gadgets and a Goldfinger)
","This is Daniel Craig's third performance as James Bond--why can't it be his last? Craig is a decent actor who should never have been cast as James Bond in the first place. He's certainly excellent when it comes to the physical requirements of the job as it appears he doesn't shy away from giving it his all in the action scenes. But he exudes little wit which is a key important component of this iconic role. This is borne out by Craig's reported professed desire to have his contract bought out since he's been quoted as saying that he finds acting as James Bond to be ""boring.""<br/><br/>For a James Bond film to be successful, it needs the three g's (Good girls, gadgets and a Goldfinger). Skyfall pretty much fails in all three departments. Take the 'girls' for instance. Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny is quite pleasant to look at but is given little to do here as agent in the field turned secretary. Initially, we're led to believe that she'll be an integral part of the plot, Bond's 'point man' in the exciting chase scene where he battles mercenary/assassin Patrice on top of a speeding train. After botching the shot that takes out Bond instead of Patrice (how Bond survives the shot and subsequent fall off a bridge is never really explained), Eve is relegated to office work and has little more direct interaction with Bond for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Then there's Bérénice Lim Marlohe as Sévérine, a concubine of sorts of the Skyfall villain, Raoul Silva. Unfortunately Marlohe does not get the opportunity to show her stuff as an independent 'Bond woman' as she is petrified of Silva and hints that she will soon meet her own demise. There is a perfunctory shower scene with Bond on her yacht which is mercifully short. The end comes rather quickly when Silva dispatches Sévérine on the island with a bullet to the head. It would have been much more tasteful if Director Sam Mendes had chosen to depict the killing off screen but when has Sam Mendes ever been known for being tasteful? <br/><br/>As far as gadgets, 'Skyfall' is even more disappointing in that department. The young and geeky Ben Wishaw, has now taken up the mantle of a modern day 'Q', the quartermaster of the MI6 spy service. He even spells it out quite succinctly when he tells Bond there are no fancy gadgets this time around. Instead, we're left with a miniature radio tracking device and a gun that will not fire unless it recognizes Bond's palm print. Q of course is a computer expert and he stands around trying to hack into bad guy's computer or prevent being hacked himself. The yawn factor is in full force as we've been privy to all this computer mumbo-jumbo, oh so many times before! <br/><br/>Finally there's a 'Goldfinger': If the Bond antagonist is not larger than life, with the much needed ubiquitous charm, it's hardly likely that a Bond film can be truly successful. Unfortunately, Javier Bardem as the aforementioned Silva, hardly inspires confidence as a truly endearing Bond villain. Silva is merely a former MI6 agent who improbably was given up by M (Judi Dench) to the Chinese in exchange for a coterie of MI6 double agents. His goal is to take revenge on M as he blames her for his subsequent imprisonment and torture at the hands of MI6 opponents.<br/><br/>For some reason, Silva acquires super powers of sorts after being released by the Chinese and now has the ability to hack into any computer, resulting first in the ridiculous theft of a list of all undercover NATO agents in terrorist organizations and subsequent bombing of MI6 headquarters itself. If that isn't absurd enough, computer genius Silva escapes from MI6 custody and then attacks politicians where M is giving testimony at a public inquiry.<br/><br/>'Skyfall' of course does not refer to jumping out of a plane but rather, Bond's family estate where he grew up as a child. After Silva's failed try at assassinating M at the public inquiry, she decides the only way to capture the former agent is leave an electronic trail (facilitated by Q) where Silva can find her. Holed up at Skyfall is Bond, M and Kincade, the gamekeeper at the estate. Silva attacks in two waves: the first is a group of his henchmen, all wiped out by Bond and company, utilizing primitive weapons found inside the Bond mansion (how crazy Silva manages to get all his confederates to follow him, is a mystery to me). Silva then makes his grand appearance via a helicopter, which of course is shot down after Bond detonates a couple of gas canisters. Later, Bond falls through the ice and engages in a death struggle with Silva's last henchman. Like the earlier scene where he survives Eve's errant shot, it's unclear how Bond manages to extricate himself from the icy pond, after being submerged in icy water for so long.<br/><br/>I suppose it is appropriate that Silva should meet his end not as a result of a technological advantage but simply due to the flick of an old-fashioned knife into the back. There are other satisfying moments in 'Skyfall' including some dazzling opening credits, a sultry opening number sung by Adele, the aforementioned Bond/Patrice fight on top of the speeding train, lovely panoramas shot in Istanbul and Shanghai, another unlikely but exciting train crash in the London Underground and the big fight to the death action scenes on the Skyfall estate.<br/><br/>I have no idea whether Judi Dench also wanted out of her contract and it was her suggestion to finish off 'M' with her playing the role. Let's hope that Mr. Craig follows suit and the producers then conscript new writers and a director. With a new team, the next 'Bond' can be much better than this current hokey effort."

Right from the start you are sucked in by that fantastic retro intro. Perfect song, classic graphics style - I had goose bumps.<br/><br/>Get outta town with your poking holes in the plot.

No one asks how Quarrel was able to cut 3 bamboo reeds THAT quickly in Dr. No, or how Dr. No looks right at James while he's wearing that radioactive gear and somehow doesn't notice he's not a Chinese-worker - they just remember that James defeats the baddie with far-flung fabulous dramatics every. single. time! The same applies to Skyfall. The point is not to wonder how James survives after falling into a ginormous waterfall (post gunshot) or why the importance of the chip with Agent names falls a bit by the wayside. The point is: James Bond is THE most bad ass mofo that ever there was and in Skyfall, we see him as the epitome of what Bond should be.<br/><br/>Cinematically, this film had my heart aching - in a very good way. The scene on top of the building in Beijing was jaw-droppingly retro and so so well done. All of the scenes were classic Bond style - The Komodo dragons?! The train fight?! The Boat in Macau?! Bond's childhood home?! MONEYPENNY!! THE ASTON MARTIN (the whole audience audibly sighed when he opened that door). On and on - every single minute had me riveted and I knew the moment it was over that it is my favorite Bond to date. I can't wait to see it again!"

","I watched it yesterday and I gave it a B minus, for a 50 year anniversary film it should have done better. OK, the movie started in Turkey, the roof top scene has been in recent movies at least 2 or 3 times, not sure why they picked that place? Bond has been abandoned again by the stupid old witch and declared dead, why he chose to go back to report for duty? The story isn't convincing enough. And the villain Silva played by Javier Bardem, Mr. Bardem tried very hard, but he still doesn't sound like an Englishman to me, how did he end up to be a British agent? another setback! And the final battle took place in Bond's childhood mansion? WTF! The film company should shoot the screen play writer first. Oh, I forgot to mention, this movie has the worst Bond girls ever!<br/><br/>The director of this movie is not a bad director, but through his career he hasn't done any good action movies as yet, so again bad choice for the movie company.<br/><br/>Bond's gadgets are limited to a handgun, a radio and the old DB-5 driven in Goldfinger, my God the new Q looked so stupid!<br/><br/>In most Bond movies there're always and Master evil mind behind every evil, this movie is like the evil stops right here, why?<br/><br/>Anyway, I think this is a stupid movie, rent a DVD and save your money!"

It wasn't great, it lacked glamour, particularly with regard to locations - Britain in winter is ... well, grey and leafless. After Casino Royale - The Bahamas, Montenegro and Venice - Britain just didn't swing it. I couldn't help noticing Daniel Craig looked a bit old this time around, yet I understand he's signed up for another two Bond films. Ralph Fiennes'character lacked character despite him being a very able actor. Javier Bardem was superb, as always. Q's youth made Bond seem even older but other than his youth he was unremarkable, as was the film."

"TdSmth5","5","7","16","24 February 2013"," Bond in times of recession- no fun.
","In the intro scene we see Bond following some guy. He's got some girl sidekick helping him. Both have comms to MI6 and M keeps telling them to get the guy or else they lose the list. That leads to some ludicrous motorcycle chase scene on Turkish rooftops followed by a chase and fight to top of a moving train. The girl positions herself to shoot the bad guy but Bond keeps getting himself in the crosshairs too. M orders the shot, Bond is hit and falls a couple hundred yards down a cliff and into the water.<br/><br/>In Act II, M attends a very public funeral for the fallen secret agent 007, when MI6 HQ blows up. Retired/vacationing Bond hears the news and returns to England to offer his services. He's in bad shape and doesn't pass the requirement tests to go back to work. Nevertheless, M who's about to forcefully retire assigns him to investigate and get back the list of all NATO secret agents embedded with terrorists.<br/><br/>Act III takes us to China where Bond follows the bad guy from the intro who from one highrise shoots someone in another highrise. In the fight with Bond he ends up falling down the building and Bond finds a casino chip that leads him to Macau where he cashes it in for a lot of money. There he meets a gorgeous girl (Marlohe) enslaved by the big bad guy, Silva. She offers to take him to meet Silva, but first Bond has to survive some thugs. Bond ends up meeting Silva on some deserted Chinese island. He's a former 00 agent played wickedly by Bardem, who as a sign of our times also fondles Bond who takes it with a smile. Choppers arrive and take both back to London.<br/><br/>There he's jailed in some glass cage. A new Q studies Silva's computer only to have his entire system infected and hijacked. Silva escapes and goes after M but his mission to kill her fails. Bond and M set a trap for him offering M as bait.<br/><br/>That takes us to the final act in the Bond family ranch in Scotland and a somewhat unexpected ending.<br/><br/>Bond movies always have been a good mirror of the times. But it's not easy figuring out what this one, and Quantum of Solace say about our times. Both movies present us a Bond in times of recession and cost-cutting. Politicians during hearings to punish M question the whole purpose of MI6 and secret agents. There are no gadgets at all in this movie. There is no glamor. While we do get one casino scene, there's no gambling involved, just fighting as the Bond movies continue their descent into Bourne territory, except that Bourne movies excel at what they are. The locations are rather unspectacular. We have seen Turkish rooftops a few times too many recently and fighting on top of moving trains, well, that's been going in since westerns. The intro scene looks like something out of some silly Michael Bay movie with cars flying around. And I don't mean that as a compliment. The intro credits are lame. They manage to show just 1 or 2 girls. In general, the girls in the this movie aren't really Bond girls the way we know them. Poor Marlohe gets a a very thankless role. And they did something with her teeth to ruin her otherwise stunning smile, the lousy make up doesn't help either.<br/><br/>For some reason this movie is more about M than anything else. Frankly though, who cares about her? It's also more introspective and subjective. It's less about the mission than about the audience learning about Bond's past and Bond learning about himself, or some such thing. It just isn't handled well in this movie. The revelations about M's ruthlessness should have been handled as such, as surprises. Perhaps then we could care more. Personally I'm not all that interested in Bond's background. Again, if it were handled better in a more cursory way it would be more meaningful instead of tying to make it of supreme importance when there is really not a whole to it.<br/><br/>The significance of the title says it all. One hears ""Skyfall"" and thinks of some sophisticated villain trying to take down planets. Instead it's the name of the Bond family ranch... That's more or less how this entire movie works- very underwhelming. It's a back to basics movie, very limited in scope and ambition with a flawed direction and lots of plot holes. It's a Bond for a new generation, a generation that has never seen the greatness of previous Bond movies. In the past, Bond movies were in a league of their own. This new Bond sets standards fairly low and now has to compete with Bourne and that kind of movies. And now it even has to compete with excellent TV series like Strike Back that have more of a Bond spirit than Skyfall. Skyfall is stunningly unspectacular and not a whole lot of fun."

","As I was watching...first scene.......an hour into the movie...another hour into the movie....then finally as I'm sitting here thinking this review up, I mean to be complacent, nice with this film and the people who liked it. Personally, I was bored to death with this thing; but like I said, I'll cut it some slack a bit, because maybe I'm just not a Bond guy. My direct criticism is this: first scene is some of the same. Action, action, action. Then, every once in a while, the clever little quips, the pretty girls and the tension-building scenes including them, casino-like places, chic futuristic aesthetics, a cold Bond (cold as ever), and even the inclusion this time (which I won't comment) of a hint at Bond's sexual curiosity (as in having had gay sex before, to be perfectly clear).<br/><br/>In the complacent side of my mind, there's this: it's Bond, what do you expect ?! It's supposed to have all this ! It's supposed to be smart-ass-ish, full of action, artsy, fashionable, superficial yet classy, pretty girls etc...<br/><br/>In the no BS part of my brain though, this: action, fine, but renewed, not the SAME OLD car chases and fights on trains. Girls and casinos and the one-liners and company? Who can possibly be a fan, a genuine justified fan of such redundancy when this is the EXACT SAME FORMULA for, what, 25 James Bonds now ?<br/><br/>Too long, plot all over the place, NOTHING new (except Bond is bi...), heavy-handed ending, typical villain, the girls sucked (nothing like the usual impressive entrances and all...) Theme was nice, and even though I hate Adele's voice the composition itself is well written...<br/><br/>This thing *could* be criticized for longer, but there's no point. Overall, that's all that needs to be said. Flat and repetititititititititititititititit...........(sorry, got stuck here)...titititive."

","A deus ex machina (Latin: ""god from the machine"") is a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly solved with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object. Depending on usage, it can be used to move the story forward when the writer has ""painted themselves into a corner"" and sees no other way out, to surprise the audience, or to bring a happy ending into the tale.<br/><br/>In Skyfall's case it is also about the only plot device used. The team of nitwits that wrote this script should never be allowed near a computer again ever.<br/><br/>If the really stupid super-criminal had kidnapped and tortured M like he was tortured because of M, with JB on a revenge mission, the story might have worked.

The bad guy was great and they killed him off. Totally incompetent writing imo. The only reason the movie gets a 4 is the bad guy and that ""M"" is finally dead. Ugh! Terribly written script. I mean the guy can hack mi6 repeatedly, breach parliament and synchronize a train falling into a hole based on his explosive, to thwart his enemy, but gets whacked by a thrown knife (no, not in some plot twist)?? Not to mention about 50 of his ""minions"" got whacked by a guy that could barely hit a target. Bond ""hooks up"" with a girl that was human trafficked into sex work at 12. I'm sure she would be so into having sex with him after knowing him 5 minutes. I get it, it's pretend, but this was beyond cheesy. Also, note that ""M"" can kill easily with some gunpowder and a sack of nails but ""real"" grenades explode like large firecrackers when thrown by the baddies.

That heightened the grade a bit.<br/><br/>Now to the bad part. What I didn't like in this one is the storytelling. There are too many plot holes and unexplained circumstances. I would define the 'Silva' storyline dreadful character development, because I didn't understand his motivation. He could've just killed M and get it over with. But NO he came up with a lifelong plan to destroy her and in the end just proved her right with all her paranoia about how terrorists are hiding in the shadows. <br/><br/>I wouldn't go into details about all the plot holes because there are many. Like the one 'I wanted to get caught and I bombed the MI6 headquarters specifically to get locked up in the tunnels underneath the subway' trick.

","There is no denying Skyfall tries really hard to take Bond back to its roots. The problem is it lacks the talent that made the Bonds of old possible. The problems start with the title song which sounds like a mash up of previous forgettable Bond songs, with Adele singing at times embarrassingly off-key. Daniel Craig looks like he is really really tired of the character. It doesn't look just like Bond being tired of being Bond, it actually looks like Daniel Craig is tired of being Bond. He is simply going through the motions. He is not alone, by the way. Judy Dench looks like she can't wait to get it over with. I appreciate she is having difficulty acting with failing eyesight (there is a very nice pun about it in the movie), but it's still no excuse. Naomi Harris is just terrible and is simply miscast. I don't understand all the fuss about Javier Bardem's performance either. His first meeting with Bond is poorly scripted and fails to deliver to the potential it holds. From that point on it just gets worse. Lastly, why turn Bond into Batman? Family castle, a butler (kind of), the car (a nice blast from the past but also a Batman touch) and so on, and of course - the scene which was part of the trailer, with Bond looking over London from a rooftop. Bottom line - it was kind of fun, but doesn't live up to the hype. 6/10"

","I have to say I went in with very high hopes but came out utterly disappointed. <br/><br/>When I hear James Bond, I think of action, fancy gadgets, exotic locations, hot ladies and some serious bad ass villain. This movie had nothing. Action? First 3 minutes or so. Fancy gadgets? A radio. A frigging radio! Hot ladies? I guess the black girl was cute but in the wrong role! Bad ass villain? Not impressed at all, give me Jaws or, gold fingers bodyguard anytime.<br/><br/>Granted the musical score at the beginning was nice, as well as the unveiling of the car used in gold finger but the rest was quite boring.

Hell he could have been Ghanaian for all I care ( I am Ghanaian btw).<br/><br/>This is a huge letdown I actually had to keep myself from falling asleep, twice. Despite all its flaws I gave it a 6.

"YaumingYMC","3","7","16","11 December 2012"," Stupid plot so big a train could drive through it.
","The thing that gets me about this film is that it is laughingly ludicrous.<br/><br/>Most of the plot is utterly implausible - the main characters do absolute stupid things - esp. in the climatic fight scene.<br/><br/>The villain has a bomb device which he detonates precisely at the moment when he is climbing up a ladder and Bond is directly beneath the train.<br/><br/>Bond places the head of the British Spy Intelligence in the middle of the Moor in his old home. There is no cover. And there is no way of the rest of M15 et al to come and help them if they are in trouble. He has no way how many mercenaries the villain will bring along. He doesn't even know whether the guy will bring along an attack helicopter or heavy weapons. He's just going to stay out there in the middle of nowhere armed with his dad's shotty, an old game keeper and his useless boss. Wow brilliant strategy there.<br/><br/>Its not as if they didn't have a choice. He specifically took the scenic route to get to where he is and even laid a bread trail for the bad dude to follow - the same bad dude that has been waiting 20 years and amassed a sizable fortune to get what he wants. He could have showed up with a freaking huge army - staked it out with snipers - killed 007 and just walked into to do a Ramsay Bolton Snow on M, not before pumping her for any intel on the UK spy network.<br/><br/>This is probably in keeping with the Bond franchise from the Roger Moore/Remington Steele days - but I thought that we had entered into a new era with an emphasis on realism?<br/><br/>I found the whole show laughable. Best watched after getting drunk.<br/><br/>I had to watch Tinker Tailor Spy 10 times to purge the memory of this shocking film out of my mind."
"cunningmunki","6","7","16","19 November 2012"," Skyfail
","I'm still baffled how the director of American Beauty, Road to Perdition and Jarhead, and the writers of Casio Royale (and most other recent Bond films) could have come up with something so clunky and as full of holes as a Looney Tunes portion of Swiss cheese.<br/><br/>The pre-titles sequence contained the first danger signs of wonky dialogue (and some poor CG), but I could forgive it because, well, you know, this is Bond, and the franchise had been in danger of taking itself a little too seriously. Then my patience was stretched to its limit by absolutely NOTHING happening for the next hour. Seriously, until Javier Bardem shows up, the story just flies itself off to Shanghai FOR NO APPARENT REASON just for the sake of going to another country. Would it really have been so bad for most of the film to have taken place in Britain for a change? At least it would have been original. Anyway, never mind Bond's apparently miraculous survival of the pre-title sequence, we are then expected to swallow the far less believable notion that the reason he doesn't immediately call in after said miraculous recovery is because he's being... petulant. That's it. That's his motivation for playing dead. He's SULKING. Give me strength. Ethan Hunt wouldn't have done that. He would have called-in the second he could draw breath.<br/><br/>So yes, thankfully things improve immensely when Bardem arrives and gives some weight to the paper-thin plot. It's a pure revenge story, but that's OK. Too many action films have been disappearing up their own arses recently, so it's nice to have a straightforward plot for a change (even one that took an unnecessary diversion to another country purely for a sake of a single fight scene and an obligatory shag in the shower). Things get more interesting when Bardem starts to cause chaos and chomps on the scenery, but then the whole new-technology-versus-old- school-spying sub-plot rears it's head again and attempts to force itself down your throat at every conceivable opportunity. It's as if Casino Royale and Quantum of Silliness never happened. And then we're supposed to be shocked when Ralph Fiennes suddenly turns out not to be the arsehole everyone else thinks he his despite showing very little of his alleged arse-holiness on screen (and instead, making you wonder, why wasn't he ever Bond?).<br/><br/>The rest of the story then plays out as a by-the-numbers Bond film, with every twist and turn visible a mile off. They are still enjoyable twist and turns, but the fact that the film thinks it's surprising you and being clever is just insulting. I liked the reveal of the old car along with it's old-school gadgetry intact, but during the trip to Scotland I started to ponder how it was possible that a 40-something agent in 2012 could have been the owner of a car in the 1960's, when we've already witnessed his genesis as a secret agent two films prior, and all sense of reason and believability packs it's bags and jumps off the nearest train. You suspend your disbelief, but I'll keep a shred of mine, thank you very much.<br/><br/>Then the film turns into Home Alone.<br/><br/>Then, Judi Dense decides that, despite there being a demonstrably intelligent evil mastermind on her tail, escaping across open countryside in the dead of night, with a very bright torch, is the best way to avoid death. And then she 'hides' in a chapel. WITH THE LIGHTS ON.<br/><br/>And then finally, if we haven't had enough old-fashioned values shoved down our throats, the promising young female agent decides to take to heart Bond's discouraging remarks about her ability as an agent, with his 'there-there-dear' remarks, and becomes the new boss-man's secretary. And so we end where Bond began, in a poorly-written, two- dimensional world where women are either sex-objects or secretaries who go slack in the pants at the mere sight of a man in a Tuxedo ordering a weak cocktail.<br/><br/>It might sound like I hated the film, but I actually enjoyed most of it, at the time. However, the more I think about it, the more I hate it. I'm astounded that chief among the criticism aimed at Prometheus was its lacklustre dialogue and obvious plot-holes, and yet Skyfall manages to avoid the same denigration from its far too generous critics."

I think they overspent so much on the opening sequence, that the producers told them to ""pull in the sails"" for the rest (over 2 hours) of the shoot. Daniel Craig sure knows how to pose (and run) because that's about all he does, and speak in a practically inaudible mumble for most of the movie. Bardem knows how to ham it up. The gratuitous scenes and references to past Bond movies was so juvenile and obvious, well you can see I was disappointed and depressed by this claptrap. Judy Dench was totally wasted.

","Look I totally get the idea of bringing Bond into the 21st Century,making him more pensive, thoughtful & sensitive. But surely that doesn't mean you have to forget about a plot,plausibility & originality. Some have labelled this as the Best Bond movie ever. What were they watching. The movie opened with a fast paced chase scene which although pacey & frenetic to watch had nothing original about it. 2 men fighting on top of a Train, avoiding tunnels & grappling like lovers designed to keep each other on the train when surely the best thing to do is throw em off it. Its old pap & then add in some stupid plausibility about having a fully operational jcb with keys in the ignition to be used to rip a carriage off. Then when the movie decides to give you the plot going forward about some list of agents the baddies have. Soon as that plot is introduced it is then forgotten midway & turns into a story about revenge. Then through out the movie there are some shots of Bond & even the Bond girl stood with legs wide open so obviously shot to make them look cool, because nobody stands like that unless there posing for a camera shot, so obvious it made me laugh. By the way the Bond girl might has well have not existed, it was bizarre how Bond manages to bed her after one meeting in bar. Older Bond movies although painted Bond as a womaniser at least built some plot in that appeared believable for Bond to bed his girl. Seriously this Bond girl may well have not been in this movie thats how insignificant she is. Then the rest of the film is littered with so much plot holes & gaffs they are too many to go through. When the film looked interesting for a bit midway, it suddenly dawned on me why, it was blatantly copying a plot from The Dark Knight. Then the climax & this should say it all. An old codger, M & Bond carry out a Home Alone trap in a cottage in Scotland to lure the baddies. Epic or what??? Seriously devoid of originality, plot, action & laughable plot leaps it beggars belief. Avoid at all costs, I wish I had."

","Skyfall.<br/><br/>Or should that be Scuffle? From the frenetic opening sequence I thought to myself, oh no, not again, not quantum of solace all over Admittedly, it wasn't quite as terrible as QOS - there was a fine title sequence and something of a storyline here, but the fast, 5 frames a second, explosion-filled, 'most-is-more' juvenility was still ever-present, a philosophy that is symptomatic of today's economic and metaphysical decline. Furthermore, Daniel Craig, bless him, is completely devoid of any quality whatsoever to the point that where towards the end standing at the head of the pass of Glencoe in a typically misty morning, he utters dispiritedly, plagiarising both Terminator and The Dark Knight Rises (both of whom had some feeling in it), 'There's a storm coming..'. As blank as a blank cheque.<br/><br/>No, Daniel, there is no storm coming. What is coming is the usual third act of explosions and gunfire and dead bodies and hesitations and more gunfire, and a helicopter and more hesitations and of course the cliché just-in-time-finishing-off-the-baddie. What is wrong with these baddies? Have they not seen any action films before? Have they lived a life completely devoid of cinema and DVDs? Do they not realise that he who hesitates is doomed, and that he who hesitates not once but three times is even more doomed? But no, obviously not. It's just an insult, plain and simple, and completely negates any intelligence that you had hitherto invested in the typically dastardly Bond baddie. It's pathetic. It might be entertaining for a 12 year old and then it dawns on me, most grown ups who are lauding this are 12 year olds.<br/><br/>For someone who has been showered with accolades in the past several weeks for being the 'best Bond' in the 'best Bond film ever', Craig is not even man enough to say, 'C'mon, c'mon, surely not.' He just sits there, all dolled up like he just fell out of an action man box and smiles. He is terrible as Bond and the fact that many critics laud him as the best is indicative of their invertebrate status as human beings and the confined boxes they operate within (their fear of standing up and kicking against the pricks). OK, so Casino Royale and Craig's entrance to the Bond franchise was a fine piece of work (thanks for the most part to the gentle pacing, the bubbling menace from Mads Mikkelson's 'Le Chiffre' character, and some outstanding set-pieces). There was also, like in so many cases of artistic endeavor, a fair bit of beginner's luck involved on the part of Craig in his alternative view of the chauvinistic spy.<br/><br/>No such luck in Skyfall. It is simply cliché after cliché in a monumental two and a half hour grand cliché, eventually ending up with Albert Finney (who looks as if he's just been dug out from Rannoch Moor itself) telling the baddies before blowing them away with his sawn-off shotgun, 'Welcome to Scotland'. OK, I smiled, maybe even chuckled, but only because of the berserker spirit we Scots have in the depths of our hearts. Our backbone (once upon a time) stood upright. Where is the backbone of these film critics who ordinarily despair at such cliché-ridden acts of violence and such facile 'most-is-more' enactings? Suddenly, when watching Skyfall, they become blind and deaf, clutching onto their careers for dear life lest they lose their jobs, their livelihood, for daring to question the work of such monumental status-men. To be sure, Scuffle is not without its moments - I can think of two - but in a film that is almost three hours long, surely this is not good enough.<br/><br/>In the orient, though perhaps not in Shanghai's obnoxious cityscape, they have a saying that in order to reach enlightenment, first you must kill the Buddha. Well, I say, enough already with Bond. It's all getting rather tired and weak. Kill him already. Kill the Bond."
"gd432","6","7","16","15 November 2012"," Two and a half hour wasted
","The movie was lacking whatever a movie has to have. The plot was a total cliché and easily predictable. To me, the 'bad' guy and his attitude was a poor counterfeiter of Joker (in Dark Night). I could not stop myself thinking about the budget allocation, where did all the money go? Probably spent on tuxedos and suits otherwise there was no breathtaking costly scene or something. The voice quality was horrible, I had to stick out my ears because not everyone is spoon eared like James Bond.<br/><br/>All in all, it was not entertaining, nor a thriller, rather I felt it was a set-up to kill my hours and take my money."
"colmagn","1","7","16","10 November 2012"," Not the Bond movie you were led to believe by the critics
","Mad spoilers ahead. If you don't want to know the story line, don't read on..<br/><br/>Only went to see this movie in the theatre because of the reviews. Here's what I though the plot was going to be based on the trailer:<br/><br/>Bond dies due to M's error except he isn't dead, just self-retired living on an island banging a local hottie.<br/><br/>Back in England, M gets in trouble for the cock-up and is fired. However she gets wind of a plot that MI6 has been infiltrated by a badman. Nobody believes her, so she turns up on Bond's door step one morning saying she knew he wasn't really dead because 'you're so cool and all' and they have a funny scene together and then get to business chasing down the badman, discovering what his grand scheme is and all the while being targeted by MI6 who think she and Bond have gone rogue. The badman is ultimately killed and M redeems herself in the process. Bond gets laid. The end.<br/><br/>That's what I was looking forward to.<br/><br/>That's not the film you get. You all see the trailer — people think Bond is dead, except he is not. But is it integral to the story? Nope. He just comes home in the next scene when he sees an explosion on news at MI6 headquarters and everything is back to normal again except he can't shoot straight.<br/><br/>So then it's off to china to find the badman behind the attack. This should be good right? NOPE. The badman turns out to be a flamboyant clichéd gayman in a bad wig who used to work for MI6 and wants to kill M because she got him arrested and tortured by the Chinese. Why is he Spanish? Because Mendes wanted Bardem for the role because he reckoned the badman in this plot was going to be iconic and wanted a top actor. He was wrong. Bardem is a pretty good actor but this badman is extremely unoriginal. One reviewer already mentioned the similarity between him and the joker and I think that's where they were influenced a little. Why is he gay? I guess the writers though that would give him depth.<br/><br/>Someone on team bond seems to have watched the second batman reboots and just decided to copy the themes. As next-up...the badman is caught....except (drum roll PLOT TWIST!!!!) he really wanted to be discovered and caught by Bond so he would be brought to England and then escape using his leet haxor skills and kill M.<br/><br/>Here's an idea...if he wanted to kill M so badly, then get on a plane to England, enter M's house and when she comes home, kill her. It's pretty easy to break into her house. Bond did it. You're supposed to be his equal right? You don't need to make it so convoluted.<br/><br/>So anyway, he escapes, goes after M and Bond then takes her to his old Wayne mansion, cough I mean Skyfall, which is being looked after by Alfred, cough..I mean kincade. Along the way, they attempt to give Bond some depth to his character by mentioning something about the death of his parents - the waynes...cough I mean the Bonds. But this fails because Bond just tells M to shut up about it so we don't hear what happened.<br/><br/>Anyway, they Mcguiver up some weapons and booby traps and wait for the badman to arrive who somehow now has henchmen and helicopters in Britain to help him. M does not call for backup because that would be too obvious. They just have a big old A-Team shoot out, wayne manor burns down and it's all pointless because she dies anyway because she was grazed at some point in the battle. The end.<br/><br/>What a waste of time. Next time you want a plot team Bond, call me.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a one just to cancel out some of top scores. In reality it deserves about 2 for sets, camera work, special effects etc. <br/><br/>If the film doesn't have a good storyline, it's all pointless though."

","The reviews flowed in. Best reviewed Bond movie ever. Biggest overseas opening ever for a Bond movie. That just proves a good point: consensus doesn't prove anything. <br/><br/>I was the kid who stayed glued to the TV on all the old TBS Bond movie marathons during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I've read a good deal of the source material books from Ian Flemming. But I have no fanatical attachment to either. On the contrary, I just happen to enjoy the simple escapist window Bond opens to an audience for a few hours. Yep, I even liked Moonraker. I always preferred George Lazenby's ""strait Bond"" over all the other guys. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is by far my favorite movie of the series. ""You Only Live Twice"" would be a distant second place. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig isn't a bad Bond at all and he's definitely a product of the ""Jason Bourne"" generation of action movies of stoic heroes where the Brosnan productions often veered into the Roger Moore fantasy camp - which I actually didn't mind. So the cold and stale touch of Skyfall actually compliments his character, but it can't save the movie from the doldrums it ""falls"" into from time to time. Javier Bardem was good, but I think Moriarity in BBCs Sherlock was more of a threat to London than this guy.<br/><br/>Plain and simple, Skyfall was pretty dry and the narrative was a jumbled mess of pacing. There were undoubtedly great ideas, but none of them were well capitalized on. The pieces never really fit together. It's as if the three writers agreed the movie would star Daniel Craig, then went their separate ways and wrote three different movies then tied them together with string before filming. Even Hollywood fix master editor Stuart Baird didn't tighten this one up very well. There was a lot of shifting in seats and not a laugh to be heard in the theater I sat in.<br/><br/>Money Penny, M, Q and the Aston are here to signify that Jason Bourne is finally dead and Bond we all remember has returned. Maybe, but this coming from a book worm with a long attention span: this Bond was boring."
"ssvikas","5","7","16","5 November 2012"," Scores for stunts & acting, fails with its plot
","Bond is Back!! Or that's what we have been made to believe. 'Skyfall' or Bond 23 is being touted as the best James Bond movie ever. But to the purists among Bond fans, this would come across as a dull, conversational flick with occasional bursts of action sequences and the humming of the classic James Bond tune.<br/><br/>The pre-title sequence starts with the trail of a stolen hard drive in a Turkish town, that culminates in a first-fight atop a train, as seen in the trailers. Oh yes, this was supposed to be filmed in India, but didn't happen because the requisite permissions weren't given! At the end of the sequence, Bond is shot and an obituary is written.<br/><br/>Although the start seemed promising, the film goes downhill after wards. It turns up that the hard disk has the names of secret agents operating in the middle east; remember 'Mission Impossible' anyone? After hearing news of an attack on MI6 headquarters, Bond returns from playing dead to find the bad guy and recover the list.<br/><br/>The bad guy, as it turns out is a hacker; Oh, when James Bond had to come out of the cold war era and appear modern, are computers and hacking the only convenient way to show modernity? What happened to the built up in the previous two Craig movies that dealt with serious themes like terror funding and natural resource monopoly.<br/><br/>While it is tempting to write more about the plot holes, I'm holding short only because those of you who are still keen to see the movie don't get to know how it's going to end. But, all that can be said of 'Skyfall' is that it is hardly a James Bond movie.<br/><br/>Anyone who is familiar with the 20-odd moves made in the Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan era would agree that Daniel Craig's avatar as Bond is different from the rest. Craig seems more like a street thug in a tuxedo and lacks style and humor. Whatever happened to all those famous one- liners that bond is known for?<br/><br/>Another quintessential missing element is gadgetry from the Q- department. This time, all that he gets is a gun that responds only to his palm-prints and a radio transmitter. The phone that Bond uses looks lousy too. But yeah, it was interesting to see the return of the famous Aston Martin DB5 that first appeared in Goldfinger.<br/><br/>Skyfall has very little role for its lead ladies, Naomie Harris who is shown in the trailers to be taking a shot at 007, plays a fellow agent and Bérénice Marlohe is a woman who gets him to the villain looks exotic but hardly has a few minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>There is nothing exciting on locations either. A major portion of the film is shot indoors and underground including caves, tunnels, or old houses. However, two shots stand out. One, Shanghai skyline at night and two, the deserted island lair of the villain, which is actually an abandoned coal mining colony off the coast of Nagasaki.<br/><br/>The film scores for some extraordinary stunts. The bike chase on the rooftops of the grand bazaar in Istanbul, the train-top sequence and the one involving the London Tube. Bond films are usually good with their camera-work and Skyfall is no less. The overhead shots of Scotland stand out. But there isn't enough for action junkies either.<br/><br/>The other plus is some good acting. Daniel Craig lacks the looks and isn't a suave Bond, but is a good actor. Judy Dench and Ralph Fiennes deliver some good performances. The Academy Award winner Javier Bardem plays a good villain. And this time, James Blond, err Bond and his enemy are both Blonds.<br/><br/>The film's release marks 50 years from the date of the first Bond film, 'Dr No' that starred the legendary Sean Connery. This will be the last film where Judi Dench plays 'M'. If this was a farewell movie for her as it seemed from its plot, then it's an apparently a bad and boring idea. Hope they turn up with a better movie next time!"
"mrdsaravanan","6","7","16","4 November 2012"," Finale of the Beginning of THE BOND
","Bond is back. The First Stunt Sequence is Outstanding comparing to the final ""SKYFALL"" sequences. STORY: Nothing. At last after so much technical build up, they ended it like a normal revenge movie. In this edition, Daniel Craig is much adapted to the Bond Character & style than the other two movies. Good looking Bond girls; Gorgeous Locations; Classic Cars; Stunning Stunts; Witty One Liners - Everything were there which we usually expect from Bond Movies (which we miss from other two movies). I think the Director had the confusion where to use the Bond Theme and as usual he wasted it by misplacing. Negatives: The movie is slow paced and the overall movie is lengthy. (More than 2 Hours)"
"rtwmbn-512-331329","Null","7","16","26 October 2012"," Bond is back!
","I don't even know where to begin this... There isn't a single Bond-movie that has left me so excited or awestruck whilst watching it in the cinema. Perhaps it is not THE best 007, but it certainly is at the top. Especially after the utter rubbish that was Quantum of Solace this was by comparison sheer awesomeness.<br/><br/>I will try to be as vague as possible so I won't spoil it for anybody:<br/><br/>My main criteria of objection was the recycled themes from previous Bond-movies; the unwilling mistress of the villain (The Man With The Golden Gun) M's personal sub-plot in relation to the villain (The World Is Not Enough) an ex-00 seeking revenge on MI6 (Goldeneye) Bond's dedication to his friends/boss and avenging them (License To Kill) the tragic loss of a close one (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) and a certain item from Goldfinger which will make any true Bond-fan cream his or hers' pants in sheer excitement ;)<br/><br/>As said; the ending left me simply speechless. I was at the point of tears and I have never felt such sympathy for bond since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Screw Eva Green in Casino Royale, this ending is such more tragic I could not find the words.<br/><br/>The lyrics of Adele's *Skyfall* actually make sense now.<br/><br/>For the first time ever do we explore a bit of James Bond's past, namely that of his parents (we learn their names, where JB grew up as a child, etc.) We also find out M's real name.<br/><br/>The Bond-girls were OK, but nothing spectacular. The new Q is cute but will have to live up to his epic predecessor Desmond Llewelyn. M is by all accounts spectacular in this movie. The villain, 'Tiago Rodriguez', also brings a new element in a JB- villain not seen before since Blofeld's henchmen in Diamonds Are Forever That being said I think they tried to make the villain too funny and can't take it that serious.<br/><br/>Scores: Music: 7/10 (Adele's lyrics finally make sense and the Bond-music in the movie takes you back to the original series) Acting: 9/10 (the only one who's acting was not believable was that of the villain which was a bit tóó much...) Plot: 6/10 (too many recycled themes) Humour: 7/10 (some excellent one-liners) Gadgets: 3/10 (pretty much non-existent since the re-start<br/><br/>Conclusion: the end of Skyfall brings Bond back to the style of the original Bond-movies. Skyfall is definitely worth watching and by far the best since Goldeneye. Go see Skyfall!"
"0w0","4","3","5","14 May 2020"," Plot-hole central... 2 gigantic plot-holes
","The first Bond movie in history, where Bond actually gets shot.<br/><br/>Anyways, there's lots of plot holes in the movie: In the one scene, Bond's partner shoots him accidentally, while Bond is in a fish-fight with a bad-guy, yet his partner doesn't then shoot the bad-guy after that... she literally just lets the bad-guy get away, whilst still having a clear shot of the bad-guy for 5seconds after that.. This is a huge plot-hole, as the bad-guy escaped for literally no reason. The ENTIRE movie is based off of this plot-hole, which is pretty sloppy writing. Predicating an entire movie off a single plot-hole makes for a pretty horrible story and spoils the entire experience for the viewer since due to that plot-hole, the entire story has now diverged from reality.<br/><br/>Another plot-hole is when Bond literally stands idly by while a bad-guy assassinates someone... There's no way that Bond would allow somebody to die like that... I mean, just look back at the previous films: There's been Bond films where the entire plot predicates on rescuing a single woman or man... And now, Bond just stands by allowing a man to be killed? It goes against the entire creed of the Bond name, and creates a plot-hole.<br/><br/>Another plot-hole is the fact that any security agency worth their salt would NEVER plug a foreign device into their own security database... That's the equivalent of you picking up a flashdrive in a Walmart parking lot and plugging it into your work computer... Only colossal idiots would do that, and it's exactly what they did in the movie... It would never happen in real life, and it creates another plot-hole.<br/><br/>Overall it's a flawed story, with bad writing. The plot-holes spoil the entire movie, since the entire movie is based on plot-holes. Javier Bardem makes a great bad-guy, eventhough like I said, he wouldn't even be in the movie, if it weren't for the plot-holes and bad writing. The movie is utterly spoiled, and it's too bad since it could have been a good movie."

","I decided to rent this one out at a later time back in 2012 instead of going to the cinema. The previous two films in the series with Daniel Craig had made me reluctant, since they were depicting the character of James Bond pretty different from what I know & love based on older 007 films. Unfortunately, I found this one bad and even worse that the last two. I couldn't even finish watching it. There were too many over-simplifications, so that the story can move forward, the pacing was too slow, and the film wasn't entertaining. Surprisingly, boring is not at all what I'd expected, having watched the trailer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, you realize what's coming up just from the opening sequence... ****SMALL SPOILER****James Bond leaves a compromised safehouse at a random time and the intruder happens to be 30m in front of him. Then a could-be-good motorbike chase scene ensues and the CGI on every Daniel Craig's close-up is bad. Then on the train the intruder chills in place, while Bond is attacking him with an excavator (transported by the train), as if he couldn't move and shoot at Bond from any other position. The passengers are chilling on their sits too, although Bond just cut off the back of their wagon with the excavator. And lastly, Moneypenny takes a pretty irrational shot - did Bond actually look in desperate need of help? Do we doubt his combat skills? Oh man, I could go on and on, but I'll only ask you this... did you catch the Home Alone: 007 edition at the end?!<br/><br/>P.S. Spectre (2015) was mediocre, but at least waaaay better than this one!"

I wonder if the by- election caused by Gareth's resignation from Parliament was won by the Opposition or a third party? Political intrigue at its finest.

No room for that sort of patriotism in this film. Possibly it was made with the US audience in mind - or maybe just anyone who feels better about themselves by seeing the British portrayed in this way. The film starts well - the music is great - but it goes quickly down hill. The whole storyline lacks the usual positive optimism we associate with James Bond. It's all so depressing. There are some funny lines, but even they sound a bit forced. I can't say more without risking a spoiler, so let me just end by saying that seeing this film spoiled James Bond for me."

"ScarletSpider87","5","8","20","10 November 2012"," A great film, but not Bond
","Skyfall was disappointing. My overall impression? It was a great and enjoyable film if it were an ordinary action film, but it was NOT a Bond film.<br/><br/>Skyfall lacked everything that differentiates Bond from every other action hero.<br/><br/>1. The film did not open with the gun barrel sequence. It was pointlessly tacked on at the end. That is so stupid. If you are going to include the sequence at all, why put it at the end? Just to be different? The gun barrel sequence is important at the beginning because it sets the tone. It revs the audience up and gets you in the Bond mood. Some traditions shouldn't be messed with.<br/><br/>2. There were no visible naked women in the opening sequence. We want dancing naked women! There, I said it. Yes, there were two naked women that it showed from the shoulders up, but that doesn't count. Everything else was CGI, and with way too much focus on Daniel Craig himself.<br/><br/>At this point I must add that I loved Adele's theme song, until a FREAKING CHURCH CHOIR started singing behind her! That ruined the whole song. It was completely inappropriate to the tone of the film. When she sang by herself, that was awesome. Why did she ruin it like that?<br/><br/>3. The Q sequence was extremely lame. Q gave Bond a gun and a radio transmitter. Q is supposed to give Bond cool gadgets. A gun is not a gadget. Q said, ""Did you want an exploding pen?"" Yes, Q, I freaking did.<br/><br/>4. No actual female nudity was shown, but we sure got to see Daniel Craig with his shirt off all the freaking time.<br/><br/>5. James Bond didn't say anything funny in this film. Sure the writers attempted to give him jokes, but THEY WEREN'T FUNNY. I didn't hear a single laugh in the theater.<br/><br/>Even when Bond could have said something funny, he didn't. Like when he stabbed Silva in the back at the end, and he starts slouching toward him, the old Bond would have made a quip about his death. What Bond should have said is something like ""I can see your back is killing you."" That would have been brilliant.<br/><br/>6. James Bond did use his Walther PPK, but he didn't treat it with any respect. He got frustrated and threw it down at the beginning. Then when he got a new one, he simply left it in the pit at the Asian place. In fact, I am amazed at how often Bond thought it would be a great idea for him to go around with no gun whatsoever.<br/><br/>Like at the end, when he is chasing Silva to the old church, he knocks out a bad guy with a machine gun. But does Bond grab the gun like any sensible person would do? No, he continues chasing Silva weaponless, and is immediately confronted by Silva who has a gun and stops him helpless on the ice. SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE MACHINE GUN, IDIOT.<br/><br/>7. Bond failed to rescue the girl (who happens to be M) in the final sequence. Which is OK, because I hated Judi Dench anyway.<br/><br/>8. The film lacked the typical ending with Bond about to ravish some hottie.<br/><br/>9. The end credits did say ""James Bond will return,"" but failed to name the next film. What, are they too lazy to think of a title? Here's a bright idea- make another of Ian Fleming's actual books.<br/><br/>10. The number one rule of James Bond is that he must never, ever, ever, be Daniel Craig. But to my dismay, James Bond was again Daniel Craig. And he looked worse than ever. How could someone so ugly be James Bond? Seriously. And before you ladies go on about how hot his body is- have you ever paid attention to his chest hair? The man has no chest hair except for two little patches that grow in rings around his nipples, and this hair is long my friend, like six inches long! It hangs down like a woman's hair from his nipple. What a freak.<br/><br/>By the way, why were they talking about Bond being old in this movie? This is only the third film of the reboot, and he isn't supposed to be old yet, knuckleheads. This is James Bond at the beginning of his career. How can he be old already?<br/><br/>All in all, the filmmakers went with the same dry, Bourne-like stuff that they did in the last two films. Bond is not supposed to be realistic like that. He is supposed to be over the top. Is it realistic that the guy turns on every woman he meets? Bond was never realistic, just like Batman (you hear that Christopher Nolan?).<br/><br/>The best sequence was when Craig pulled out the old Aston Martin and the classic Bond music played, and everybody in the theater went wild. That was the most excited anybody got during the whole film. Do you know why? People like the old Bond and they want the old Bond. The formulas are what made Bond successful to begin with.<br/><br/>One final thought. When ""Bond"" word associates ""murder"" with ""employment,"" that makes absolutely no sense. The classic Bond was not a murderer; he was not an anti-hero like Bourne. In one of the classic Bond films (I can't remember which) he even actually says that he doesn't kill innocent people. The old Bond actually recoiled at the thought of being labeled a murderer. Bond is a killer, not a murderer. My Bond only kills murderers and those he has to kill in self-defense.<br/><br/>Skyfall is Bond without all the fun and sex. So go see it if that's what you're into."

","This is a first impression review from a lifelong Bond fan just back from an early morning screening in London.<br/><br/>""Skyfall"" is the Bond that nearly didn't happen, so that it's here at all makes it welcome. It's quite long, but it never drags or bores in the way that perhaps ""Casino Royale"" did. Like ""Quantum of Solace"" it actually feels like a Bondfilm despite its many flaws, and invites multiple viewings. <br/><br/>It's much publicised budget limitations show, with most of the film shot in the centre of London (fun for Londoners like me who see many familiar spots become Bond backdrops) including 007s first foray into our famous ""Tube"" train network, and a finale in Scotland. Turkey(popular location for modest actioners – see ""Taken 2"") and Singapore/Macau make fleeting appearances, though it's hard to say if Craig actually ever went there, since it's just postcard vistas followed by obvious studio sets. <br/><br/>The film promised to strip Bond to the emotional core, something that has been boasted since ""Casino Royale"", but frankly we learn as much here about Bond's tragic childhood as we did about Peter Parker in this summer's ""Amazing Spiderman"" (ie almost nothing) He is supposed to see ""M"" as a surrogate mother, but it's something that must be read since it's never actually implied in any way. Romance and the ""Bond girls"" get relegated to a level that makes ""Quantum"" look like ""Twilight"", and will worry those who see Eros getting squeezed out of the Bond world altogether! In the case of Naomie Harris, this lack of sex makes sense with the final reveal, but a romantic interlude is briefly shared with Severine, though Berenice Marlohe looks and acts very much like Talisa Soto's Lupe in ""Licence to Kill"", a character whose arc she shares and who may be one of the many nods to Bond's legacy scattered throughout. <br/><br/>Unlike recent Bond outings, who have featured less than memorable adversaries, this one baited us with a strong villain in the shape of the legendary Javier Bardem, who cleverly subverts his Latino hunk image playing a flouncy camp gay baddie. Unfortunately his character is never developed, and has actually very little screen time, which disappoints. He spars verbally with Bond, but despite being of similar age and physique, there is no hand to hand combat between the two. He doesn't really care about 007 anyway, it's ""M"" he's after. That is his only motivation (he is a cyber-terrorist, but he makes out it's just a hobby and nothing special) and all for a hazy, poorly explained back story during the 1997 Hong Kong handover. In fact he seems to be an amalgam of the villains in the 2 McG ""Charlie's Angels"" films, a cyber whizz kid who engineers an incredibly complex web of events just to get at an intelligence boss who once betrayed him in morally dubious circumstances and a former top operative who went rogue after capture and torture soured their souls. Whether this is accidental or deliberate only the screenwriters can know? He also has hideous scarring which a prosthetic hides, easily removable for a ""look what you did to me!"" moment, then forgotten about. <br/><br/>The action is fun, but oddly unoriginal. Again the ""car chase"" occurs in the pre-credits sequence, then we get a dirt-bike chase through a crowded 3rd world marketplace and a fight atop a moving train, two things we've seen many times before. We also have a brief fight that's filmed in silhouette, which looks sillier than it sounds. There's a foot-chase-manhunt on the underground, again something that's been in dozens of films (interrupted by a train falling through the roof, something that looks cool in the trailer but means nothing in the film) and a final battle in Bond's ancestral Scottish home which is clearly inspired by the final cottage fight of ""Straw Dogs"" (except that was more violent and exciting!) It's all watchable, but oddly familiar and unoriginal, something 007 action should never be! <br/><br/>The score by Mendes regular Thomas Newman is OK, but sounds like a bad impersonation of regular David Arnold, and is not up to the usual 007 music standard. The title sequence accompanying Adele's deliberately Bassey-esque song is lovely, teasing us with images, locales and elements of the film we are about to watch. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is also very good, and makes a modest film look glamorous and lush.<br/><br/>Elements from previous Bonds are scattered throughout in a way similar to 40th anniversary ""Die Another Day"", including the classic Aston Martin from ""Goldfinger"". It also has the least ambitious Villain ever, least exotic locales, least sex, and furthermore the script tries to hide the fact that under the accolades and backslapping, 007 actually achieves precisely nothing in this story!<br/><br/>The overall theme seems to be ""Bond is still as relevant today as he was 50 years ago"", and it is constantly hammered home with little subtlety throughout, with an ""analogue Vs. digital"" set up similar to this summer's ""Battleship"". The film ends with the traditional 007 set up restored, albeit with some changes. There's a condescending ""Q"", a flirty Miss Moneypenny at her desk (guess who she was during the rest of the movie?) and a Bernard Lee style ""M"" in a drawing room office handing Bond secret mission files. In other words, we've reconstructed Bond, now we're going back to the beginning again because tradition is what it's all about! Quite how much of this will make into the next Bond when there ISN'T a 50th anniversary to celebrate remains to be seen?<br/><br/>But it's a Bond, and it's here, and its good and fun, so let's celebrate that at least!"
"GLanoue","10","7","17","15 February 2013"," Psychological terror matches the terrifying action
","I was almost dreading this latest instalment in what must be the world's longest running franchise, thinking the writers couldn't possible sustain yet another Bond episode. Happily, I was wrong. This proves once again that once you get past the legacy of the special effects of the 1990s and the comic book villains of the earlier Bonds, scripting and casting are at the heart of any movie enterprise. Daniel Craig proves once again that the producers were absolutely right to cast him as a youngish (at first) Bond-type (we are never sure if this is a retro-ed Bond a la the recent Star Trek) who by now is accidentally wounded by his own partner and psychically wounded by all the killing and uncertain moral standards of the contemporary world. This, BTW, is explored very well in a subplot involving M (Judi Dench, in another incredible and understated performance) facing a parliamentary hearing into the screw up that led to Bond getting shot as he's trying to recover a hard disk with the names of Western agents infiltrated in terrorist groups. Obviously, Bond survives and goes underground, licking his wounds and wondering if it's all worth it. Apparently it is, when it turns out that this is part of a larger plot to discredit and eventually kill M, by a rogue agent that she allegedly abandoned in the field to be captured and tortured. He too survived, but with a different and very malignant mindset than Bond's, whose personal loyalty to M, though tested by his knowledge that she ordered the agent to take a difficult shot that missed the bad guy and hit him, overcomes his moral disgust with the institution. Dench, Craig and newcomer to the franchise Naomie Harris who plays the field agent with a shaky aim who later decides to ride a desk under the name of Eve Moneypenny (signs of the retro-ed story, as we are clearly in the contemporary world, with modern technology and modern bad guys even though we are viewing a prequel birth of the Bond world). And speaking of technology and bad guys, the movie gains quite a bit by having a new Q, a confused young genius not at all certain about his technology (twice, M and he set off a cyber attack by trying to backtrace a cyber attack, a feint that was designed to provoke the cyber response and open the door to real attack). It also has a scaled back the technology: a gun and a radio (albeit a gun with a grip keyed to Bond's palm print). It makes the menace and especially the confusing reactions to it all the more human and believable, since the threat is not really a superweapon from space or the ocean depths, but an evil person wreaking havoc by exploiting human weaknesses amplified by current technology. And what a menace it turns out to be – Javier Bardem is the best Bond villain in decades. He combines sadism, sadness, crazy-obsessive paranoia, complete indifference to others, yet with a modern vocabulary of caring and insight. It's like talking to your shrink, except he's packing a Glock with which he'll blow your kneecaps off once your 50 minutes are up, or maybe before if you don't have enough insight. Bardem is spooky and unnerving, since he's not really undone, unlike other Bond villains, by his own ego masquerading as crazy genius, and Bond/Craig is far from an invincible superhero as he faces off against an evildoer whose talking isn't merely an excuse to show off how clever he is (how many times have we wondered why No, Dax, Goldfinger, Blofeld and the rest didn't just shut up and simply shoot Bond?). Bardem and Craig really sell the idea that it is not at all foreordained that Bond will win the climactic battle. In brief, a wonderful addition to the franchise, showing that good writing (action and characterisation) is the key to a good movie"
"justin-537-710518","3","7","17","24 November 2012"," In this film James Bond dies—in more way than one.
","Films in the bond series to date have typically been hit-or-miss. This new take by Sam Mendes is a miss.<br/><br/>News of Sam Mendes taking the helm of director for the new bond film was something to get excited about. Finally—a talented director to recover the bond franchise from the disappointment that was Quantum of Solace! And Daniel Craig clearly has the potential to be the best James Bond of them all, especially after his groundbreaking performance in Casino Royale.<br/><br/>So why is Skyfall such a disappointment? After all, the trailers made it look so cool!<br/><br/>This film has gone to great efforts to break the traditions of the franchise and turn the character into a new and more modern Bond. Unfortunately, in an attempt at refreshing this iconic character, the screenwriters, producers and directors have completely lost sight of what it is that makes James Bond and why fans keep on returning to the franchise.<br/><br/>Why are the storytellers so preoccupied with systematically destroying the very things that make James Bond... James Bond?<br/><br/>1. Where's the cool cars? 2. Where's the gadgets? 3. Why are the action scenes so flat and unengaging? 4. Where's the breathtaking stunts? 5. Where's the humor? 6. Where's the adventure and excitement? 7. Where's Bond's typical resourcefulness? 8. Where's the great set pieces? 9. Where's the glamour? 10. Where's the cool factor?<br/><br/>Admittedly the film is photographed beautifully—this is largely due to the work of Mendes' Director of Photography. But you can see Sam Mendes has little experience in directing action scenes. He clearly doesn't understand how to honor the traditions of a film franchise, and it is obvious the producers caved in to this director's meddling during story development. Bring Martin Campbell back. He simply makes great Bond films."

","I was one of those who liked Daniel Craig as James Bond, more precisely I liked Casino Royale the most of all Bond films, being the only one with some semblance of plausibility in real world, without over the top villains and hair brained schemes to rule the world. So I've started having high hopes for Bond. Alas it didn't last for long. With the ""Skyfall"" were are back at it again, minus one redeeming quality that we had in previous Bonds, the aloofness of Bond character is gone, Craig's Bond is more emotional than ever.<br/><br/>We have Bond opposing Silva (Bardem), former M's pet agent, in his wish to punish ""mommy"" (M) for betrayal, stealing agent list (through the means of computer hacking), bombing MI6 headquarters (through the means of computer hacking), getting himself caught and escaping (through the means of computer hacking - again), so that he could just see his former employer in the face (and M being cold hearted bitch, viewer sympathizes with Silva). When all that is needed to get rid of M is a quality sniper. Oh yes, the agent list is completely unmentioned in the latter half of the film.<br/><br/>You know that Bond film is a flop when woman who has the most screen time is a gray headed granny. Making her literally the oldest Bond girl on the screen ever.<br/><br/>Since it had nice opening chase scene I give it three stars."
"treach33","Null","7","17","14 November 2012"," Not a Bond film, please re-title this as something else
","I must admit that as far back as when Daniel Craig was announced as the new Bond I really had low hopes and expectations for the continuation of this franchise. I became a fan of the Bourne series instead with Matt Damon and that filled the void for me quite well. I never thought Craig would be a good Bond, he just didn't fit the part. He looked like one of the Bond villains instead of Bond himself. Definitely not what Ian Fleming might have envisioned. <br/><br/>Regardless, I continued to watch and give the series a chance because I have always been a big fan of the franchise. Although they decided to completely change Bond and everything that made it a 'Bond film', Casino Royale was surprisingly not that bad. I realized that this was going to be a different universe of Bond and took it for what it was. <br/><br/>All that aside, this last installment of the series was a big disappointment especially after the lackluster and equally disappointing Quantum of Solace. <br/><br/>Craig was as wooden and non brilliant as ever. Dench played her usual predictable curmudgeon self. And with the exception of these two, no other characters were properly fleshed out. Even the main villain played by one of today's most promising thespians in Javier Bardem. No real back story or development to his character other than a brief verbal story. Not to mention we only see him for maybe 30 minutes of a more than 2 hour movie. And when he is on film, he has to work with mostly very campy and predictable one liners. What a waste of a great talent! He did command attention with his presence alone and he definitely stoled the show when he was on screen therefore making him and his character probably the only promising thing about this movie. <br/><br/>The story was trite and predictable. Lots of plot holes and implausible action sequences. I thought they were suppose to make Bond more realistic? Plot lines are dropped and never picked back up on a whim. No consistency whatsoever throughout. You never really seem to care or form any real connection with any of the characters and some seem to be forced in just for no other purpose than to move the story along.<br/><br/>A very poor effort indeed, especially considering that this marked the 50th anniversary of the franchise."

","Am not in the majority but ...<br/><br/>Reasons I hated Skyfall:-<br/><br/>Bardem is a laughable and contrived Bond villain.<br/><br/>Sexism back, M's role as mother figure to the central protagonists was overplayed. The prostitute who was the main sex interest was disposed of via a brutal murder as easily as Bond obtained sexual access to her.<br/><br/>M is head of MI5 but uses a torch in the dark making her getaway – This is a ludicrously lazy plot device.<br/><br/>Craig looking pretty haggard and very miserable throughout. He seems to hate being Bond.<br/><br/>The scene where villains that arrived in Scotland looked like footage from Assains Creed.<br/><br/>The franchise seems to have lost it's nerve –this film was neither old school enough or brave enough to progress Bond as a more layered character, something Craig had done brilliantly in his previous two outings."
"yuta_rule","6","7","17","10 November 2012"," Was it wrong to be expecting too much?
","With all the stellar reviews and cast, it's really hard to NOT be looking forward to this one. I don't wanna fault the critics, so I have only myself to blame for reading too many reviews. But it is puzzling...what is up the the tremendously wonderful reviews? Was OoS SO bad that it made Skyfall look spectacular? I really don't get it. What's with the box office in UK? Are the box office figures more representative of how people like the movie or is it really just a matter of more people flocking to the cinemas to catch Craig for a first time having heard so much about the first two? <br/><br/>Like someone mentioned, the plot is weak. The list, yeah, whatever happened to it? And I honestly don't quite get what Craig said in interviews about how this is Bond being able to have more fun. I don't see the fun really being explored in his character. In fact, I think there was so much more edgy fun in Casino Royale (which remains to date my favorite Bond movie). The lines which were suppose to be suave or witty weren't all that great and there were just too many moments where you were forced to suspend your belief a little and just deal with what's unfolding on the screen. <br/><br/>Instead of trying to create substance, I think they undermined the whole concept of Bond by trying to go back to the ""old-fashioned"" way. I like how that's their intention, but it just doesn't get translated nicely onto the screen. Whereas you see in Casino Royale, the mix of new and old is so fluid and beautifully done there aren't jarring moments when you go ""huhhhh...."". I felt like I was watching Craig in Defiance towards the end of the movie. Fire, grenade, traps...secret tunnel....I don't know. And having the last moment with M in the Chapel....that's just a little too clichéd for me. Now I'm a little worried about the next two Bonds honestly, now that John Logan will be penning them alone. If what I saw for Skyfall was a result of a script largely written by him, can't be sure what to expect for the next two.<br/><br/>Bottom line - don't go in with too high an expectation, and you'll enjoy it enough. Just be prepared to maybe step out after the movie and realize you can't really pinpoint a defining moment in the movie that worked for you."
"rajnishduara","3","7","17","7 November 2012"," Skyfall: Through My Eyes Only
","If you would like Butter Chicken Gravy in Chinese Hunan Sauce, go for it! But I believe. If you were the classical Bond connoisseur you would be disappointed. Only the beginning had some promise. And when the much hyped Adele sings, I feel Golden Eye is still lethal, still the best, but that's a personal choice. But it's a story of yore, when it all started. The Qs and the Ms. It starts off promisingly in Istanbul amidst the din and the fading blue of the famous mosque, which incidentally is captured well before for the song ""Mayya Mayya"" in the Bollywood film 'Guru'. There are more shades of Bollywood too. Especially the chase with flying fruit carts and running within the Bazaar! The classic cult from Mumbai, Sholay theme comes back too, in between, with the Anglicized concept of Hema Malini tied to pillars for that famous song under the sun and gun! Off course you have to be British to place an apple alternative in the head for the Robin Hood type bow and arrow shoot. Bruce Lee inspires Sam Mendes for the mirror house shoot as in Enter the Dragon!<br/><br/>I, for one like to see Bond films for 3 Gs (pun not intended). Gals, Goons and Gadgets. You will get only one, the Goon. The Gals and the Gadgets will be missing. Eve (Naomi Harris) is excellent, something of a statement for the modern world, her colour, her poise and her statements. We have lots of surprises too. The other woman, Severine (Berenice Marlohe), is a sinister self-destructive femme fatale whose lips are as black as her heart and she has played her role fair enough to make a mark. The goon played by Spaniard, Javier Bardem, which got international acclaim for his role in Woody Allen's Vicky, Christiana, Barcelona is the best act in the film. Javier is Penelope Cruz's husband and he makes his personal life secret as he had his character for this film. But Bond will have only one gadget to boast, the age old Walther PPK with slight modification. But I loved the car on which India's Ambassador was designed.<br/><br/>There are moments of some brilliance though. Like, the meeting of the Quatermaster with Bond at the National Gallery at London. Yes, that is what Q stands for. In front of JMW Turner's 1839 painting, ""The Fighting Temeraire"" so apt for the time and phase of Bond's career. The Temeraire sold for scrap after the battle of Taraflgar is a simile for the crisis within Bond, MI6 and M! The style statements were there, but Reid and Taylor will not go for any advertisements soon. Just one arrangement of the cuff link within the tube, that's it. As for the one-liners I liked only one when Bond was jumping from one carriage to another. The classic style and sleekness of a Bond movie is missing, the flair is not there. The last sequence is more Harry Potterish, the colours dark, the mood severe, the angst very much there. It is interesting to note the signing off of Judi Dench, which probably won't be seen in future Bond movies as we already have another M by the time the movie ends! Yes, there was another one liner which remains etched in the memory for a long time. 'Welcome to Scotland' and that was Albert Finney's classic and reserved till the end. Finally, for Bond fans you still have to visit the theatre once. And that is what 'loyalty' is all about."

","It's not as bad as QoS, which I thought was inept and dull. It's nowhere near as good as Casino Royale.<br/><br/>I find it odd that many reviewers, with usually high standards, have apparently become blind to some quite obvious clangers in this film.<br/><br/>The stereotype would be that a Bond film doesn't need to be smart, it can be cheesy. I'd disagree, the best Bond films - Goldfinger, Live and Let Die, Casino Royale, OHMSS - yes, they do have all the usual staple Bond scenes (Casino, Q gadgets, car chase, bond girl) - but they can still put it into a package which is not cheesy.<br/><br/>Some bits which jumped out:<br/><br/><ul><li>Bond goes to the casino and is told he won't leave alive. He beats the stuffing out of the 3 baddies and Moneypenny hands him the suitcase of money ... and then just casually strolls out. This is a casino on an Island. There's no other security at the casino to bother him? He just has to dispatch 3 people and then that's it?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It's revealed to us that Ralph Fiennes' stuffy office-bound M used to server in Ireland up against the IRA. Cue groans when he duly grabs a pistol and starts kicking butt when the MP's committee is assaulted. This reminded me a bit of the Independence Day Vietnam-Vet-President stepping into a fighter plane</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Disk of agents that is being leaked ... What happened to that?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Major clunky dialog exposition. Q: I'm not ready to do .. M: ""Well seeing as you've just overseen a failure whereby our agents details have been leaked and lots of Nato people are now at risk (insert plot exposition here)... ""</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bond goes back to the estate .. and his old mentor turns up to offer wise words and home-truths, like some kind of Karate Kid mentor. Groan ...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Did Q really have to point out explicitly that Bond failed the tests. Surely we'd figured that out already? It's another example of clunky exposition that cheapened the experience</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bond going to Scotland in the old Aston Martin. Huh? He is allowed to keep his old gadgets or something? That's ridiculous. So then this was just crow-barred in as a reference to the old Bonds regardless that it makes no sense in the universe of the film... I know that this is not reality but you need to have some sense of consistency otherwise it's just a theme-park film</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Mentor person could pretty much have been written out of the movie and it'd have made no difference</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Fore-mentioned mentor happily wandering into the brush - forgetting to switch his light off and thereby alerting the baddies of his presence. Come on ...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole Rocky type teaching Bond to shoot again stuff. Groan</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The irrational Villain behavior.

The benchmark (for me anyway) is Casino Royale and frankly i'd rather watch Quantum of Solace than Skyall (yes i know QoS was a bit under par).<br/><br/>No gadgets, OK i'm fine with that as i like the more realistic bond, but then...why the hell is there suddenly a Q character back again ? Q was flimsy, looked like a teenager and detracted from the class and sophistication of the Bond franchise - no offence to the actor but he has been woefully miscast. Then we have TERRIBLE continuity editing (or lack of i should say) - check out how many times Bond's bullet wound scar changes from right chest to left chest and back again (both in opening credits and also throughout the film - 10 times maybe ?!! lol, very very poor).<br/><br/>Then the opening action set piece - its OK, nothing special, motorcross bikes on rooftops was cool but after that a routine fight on top of a train - sorry Casino Royale has that beaten all ways up. Then after Bond is shot he is next shown lying in a bed sipping a beer - nothing is explained as to where he is, who rescued him and patched him up, who the girl is lying in his bed next to him, very loose plot strand.<br/><br/>The bond girl Severine is good but gets about 8-10 minutes screen time before getting killed off - what the ?! The other girl (an MI6) operative is hardly pretty, and in terms of being a strong actress sorry she's just not memorable and neither is her script (not her fault admittedly).<br/><br/>Fight scenes are minimal - a short fight against bad guy ""Patrice"" in a skyscraper but all in dark shadows - good for stuntmen looking to 'sell' a fight, but really dissatisfying for the audience, and another short 'by the numbers' fight scene against 3 Chinese goons in a casino, and thats about your lot fight wise - we've waited 4 years for this film and that's the best you can do ?! And the bad guy's death at the end is extremely basic and not dramatic at all, very poor.<br/><br/>On the plus side : Dame Judy has more screen time and she is a classy operator with some sharp lines. Ralph Fiennes has a good cameo appearance that promises to be a bigger character in the next film. Bardem's first few big scenes are good but after that just standard bad guy fare. Daniel Craig looks good and tries to show a vulnerability to his character but there isn't too much he can do with this poor script.<br/><br/>Frankly the pre-film trailers for The Hobbit and Life of Pi were more enjoyable than this film. I really would like to see the same scripter and director who did Casino Royale to come back to the franchise because it badly needs them."

","This review may contain some spoilers, not that I think they can be any disturbing.<br/><br/>The movie was not that bad. The performance of Javier Bardem was one more time impressive, as you can't tell the similarities between this and his other characters. Bond wasn't in his perfect shape, which demonstrate some loyalty to the old Bond of the books (a person who smokes 60 cigarettes per day can't be in shape, right?), specially after the first scenes emphasizing his alcohol addiction. The plot was good, not astonishing, but OK, whereas three really important things missed in my point of view. 1) there wasn't much attention given to exotic places. Turkey was shown in its worst scenario ever and there were nothing at all like in the old Bond movies; 2) there wasn't almost any involvement with the actresses, too quick, no story...; 3) there was no games! Bond arrived at the casino and just took the suitcase full of money. One can say that some of the most exciting parts of previous films were behind the games of Poker, Baccarat, and so on... To sum up, this was a not-so-bad Bond movie, although I might state that this was the worst Bond movie of all time. There was a good amount of action and some characters were brought back to the scenes, like the old Aston Martin DB5 and Miss MoneyPenny. For those who only watched the two last Bond movies, it might seem to be OK... Unfortunately, it seems the director forgot some essential elements for the old fans, but, of course, in my point of view..."

And yet she (Teresa, I believe) died in Bond's arms the way George Lazenby's Bond (and less then stellar acting in OHMSS) bride died (Diana Riggs, in this case whom would have been wonderful had it been Sean Connery in the flick.)<br/><br/>No more spoilers...<br/><br/>The theme was singable and memorable as well, and I'm glad it won an Oscar which Goldfinger should have gotten)<br/><br/>You know, I really wasn't fond of Craig in the beginning, but I changed my mind after the second time I watched his first film Casino Royale. Now, I'm a die-hard fan forever! Especially after I found out that Mr. Craig did most of his own stunts!<br/><br/>Spoilers...<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor as the new M was perfectly cast, but I am still sad at the loss of Madame Judi Dench though I know she had lost most of her sight and has gotten quite old.<br/><br/>No more spoilers...<br/><br/>After I saw some reviewers ""hating"" this motion Picture, I wondered who asked them? Stupid people, if you ask me.<br/><br/>I mean, what is here to hate about this amazing Motion Picture? The answer?... nothing! ...and you can take that to the bank once you look at how much cash it raised,<br/><br/>I'm glad to hear that Daniel Craig will do two more at least, but I'm hoping he will do another 3 before he leaves.<br/><br/>I have watched all of the Bond films, and many, multiple times, but I have also watched a few comedy versions that had their good points. Like ""OK Connery"" or ""Operation Kid Brother"" with Sean's younger brother, Neil Connery with a beard and an American dubbed voice - plus many of the actors from the Bond series of the time from Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell, plus a few villains in the series in those days. It came out about the same time as Sean was doing one of the two films (You Only Live Twice with a in which he was going to leave, but didn't. <br/><br/>It even had Ennio Morricone doing the score with a fun, silly song called O.K. Connery (which makes me have to sing it every time I say ""Ok.""<br/><br/>I even saw the 67 parody which was really bad, even with Orson Welles and David Niven as Sir James Bond (proving Ian Fleming wrong and so wanting to cast him in the part he was so wrong for the role. Fortunately Peter Sellers was lots of fun as well as Burt Bacharach's music theme which is best without lyrics. Even a strange cameo by George Raft flipping a coin in old 30's gangster attire.<br/><br/>In The 1957 CBS-TV Climax version with Barry Nelson as ""Jimmy Bond"" as a boring American spy working with British spy ""Clarence"" Leiter even more dull. <br/><br/>It is only Peter Lorre as Le Chifre who makes the black and white show interesting in an Ian Fleming sadistic torturer scene at the end, making the idea of Lorre in one Sean Connery film perhaps as the Emilio Largo in that film. <br/><br/>A shame that didn't happen.<br/><br/>This film could have bee a great ending to a fantastic series, but James Bond ""will return"" again, people!"
"Rawal_Afzal","5","4","8","10 November 2015"," The film makes no sense to me!
","So let me get this straight, this film is about Bond's brilliance, right? How come that he makes such a foolish plan which ultimately results in the death of the very person he was supposed to protect? He come that, let alone actually deserving a slap for such a failing plan, he is not even asked by anyone from the authorities above him?!<br/><br/>Let me explain myself, the villain, the bad guy, wants to kill ""M"", he however hasn't been successful in doing so after attacking her at a meeting, where Bond arrives at the last minute to rescue her, kudos to him. But then, instead of letting that woman rest peacefully at home (or somewhere) where she can have her security, Bonds thinks of a plan on how to catch Silva: to be on the move all alone with M, to use her as a prey to invite Silva. Silva arrives, injures M to the extent that she dies of her wound (the mission hence fails), Bond himself kills Silva. How utterly daft is that?!<br/><br/>Apart from that, the film was slow in pace and got boring at times, but some good action and thrilling moments makes me still give it five stars. How generous of me!"

","I really don't understand the overwhelming list of bad reviews that Skyfall has been given. Perhaps the basis of this hate lies within the minds of old school bond lovers who are enclosed in the pious belief that if its not Connery its not bond. Skyfall more than holds its own, I myself will more than admit that perhaps Casio royal and Quantum of Solace are poor in every sense of the word. <br/><br/>However Skyfall has cinematography that is truly beautiful and that really can't be argued with. For those critics who argue that there are multiple plot holes, its's James bond, the last time I remembered invisible cars exist. oh wait yeah its a fiction film, I'm sure people like you would question how James bond has looked so different over the years, again he is played by different actors. <br/><br/>Have a go at the critics all you want, the public doesn't lie and this is one of the most popular bond films of all time. Adele's opening is excellent, I doubt it would have won an academy award had it not been. Daniel Craig is very much Ian Fleming's bond and he pulls off the role with brilliant conviction and principle.<br/><br/>So many reviews take apart the unbelievably of this film, however they also bring up the issue of the lack of gadgets, make up your mind please. For anybody who hasn't seen this film it really is an excellent watch, however I wouldn't recommend it if your only interesting in picking out plot floors, at the end of the day its a fiction film and if you want to make a true to life film go ahead. I look forward to seeing bureaucracy the new bond movie where it takes him 6 health and safety forms in order to begin a chase and then 2 hours of filing out liability forms after he bumps a car."
"Mr-Dimes","8","4","8","23 October 2013"," The Daniel Craig movie we've been waiting for!
","Having been a bond fan for many years I found myself feeling extremely disappointed after watching Daniel Craig's previous bond film (Quantum of Solace) which I felt lacked an engaging plot and interesting characters. So naturally I was sceptical about this picture. However, within the first 10/20 minutes the film asserted itself as being far more grown up, intriguing and polished than the previous film. It feels as though the franchise has stepped into new territory with new characters.<br/><br/>Positive points; - Feels modern and polished. - Interesting narrative. - New characters feel fresh. - Intriguing villain performed faultlessly by Javier Bardem. - The Daniel Craig Bong we've all been waiting for.<br/><br/>Negative points; - Javier Bardem's character first appears half way through the film, because of his immense performance I would have liked to see more of him. - Bond decrypting the secret code from Silva's laptop was unbelievable.<br/><br/>I think we were all questioning Daniel Craig after the slow (yet still interesting) Casino Royale and the mess that was Quantum of Solace. But now we can rest easy after finally seeing Mr Craig filling his potential. All in all, this is possibly one of my favourite bond films. 9/10"

","I was dubious about this film. I enjoy the James Bond books immensely, and loved Casino Royal (film), feeling that it remained fairly true to the storyline and dark feel of the book. After Quantum of Solace, which was a disappointment in my opinion, I was worried that this would go down the same road, especially as it was not originally a book. I was very pleasantly surprised. Daniel Craig is fantastic in his role, he is pretty much the way that I imagine Bond to be. The film has just the right amount of over the top action scenes, without going too far like some films previously have. The storyline was excellent, tackling Bond's demons well, with both an ensnaring and entertaining story throughout. Overall a very good addition to the James Bond franchise."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","4","8","28 January 2013"," Empowered by an Excellent Foil, Daniel Craig Finally Strikes a Chord
","A solid return to form for the Bond franchise after a bit of instability in Quantum of Solace. Daniel Craig is still growing into the leading role, but he's begun to mix in little quirks and kinks to his performance that, taken together, make a big difference. The action sets, also, seem to be past their growing pains and strike a nice balance between the stark, modern realism of the two preceding pictures and the characteristic over-the-top absurdity of past chapters. Like its predecessors Skyfall struggles with pacing issues, dilly-dallying for most of the first act, but once Javier Bardem finally surfaces around the sixty-minute mark it gets to the point and presses pedal to metal the rest of the way. It's interesting that, while in previous films the villains have been momentary flashes of color meant to shine a brighter light on the hero, Bardem's role in Skyfall often actually eclipses that of Bond himself. He's a brilliant, charismatic, damaged bit of anarchy that's reminiscent of, if not quite as eccentric as, Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker, and Bardem is magnificently unnerving in the role. With the spirited new foil, the return of a few familiar monikers to the series and a dramatic, meaningful finale that's sure to reverberate through subsequent installments, I think it's safe to say James Bond is finally, firmly back in the saddle."
"mfsdc","7","4","8","6 January 2013"," Back in action again, with some pleasure
","After 50 years since the first, Dr. No, everyone knew that Skyfall, wisely picked this time to be released not 2 years but 4 since the last one, was going to be an event, and by all accounts, it was. Anticipated by one of the best themes in all 007 movies, apparently made in 10 min by Adele, which seems a bit odd. But once the most famous character in cinema wore off, did the odd-job still have anything to add to the franchising? The answer is yes, Dr. Yes, with pleasure. One of the things about 007 Daniel Craig era is that the hero is no longer a superhero and the superhuman spy is after all very human. Sam Mendes, a gifted director, explored that nicely. With the addiction of 3 great actors: Ben Whishaw, Ralph Fiennes and, of course, Javier Bardem that again and again delivers the goods. Sam and his writers saw what any fan of the secret agent feels: the decay of Bond girls (anyone can recall the last greatest bond girl?) For years and years fans wanted the films to be more explicit. Make no mistake this isn't classic vintage 007 style club. That said, while this is still a 007 film, much of the credit goes for the clever way the writers tried to cover that fact, creating a virtual 007 with epic tones, an agent caught between the old-fashioned ways and the modern ones, being this interaction hugely a high point. In fact, Sam Mendes adds some splendid cinematographic details all over the place, you can tell this is a guy who spent much time, apart from his career, digging into movies. Unfortunently, the story isn't that amazing, still original in 007 catalog yet not so strong compared to the previous 2, nevertheless despite the excellent directing and solid performances, the script goes plain and simple in one way only. After 2h of quickly delivered scenes there's only one place left: Skyfall. The expanded Skyfall treatment sees some powerful imagery that will appeal too all kinds of audience. Largely held by Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig and nobody does it better. The image quality, as expected, is excellent, allowing the viewer to experience every detail of a Bond mixed into the past and the present. The dislocated island and the final set should impress those unfamiliar with 007 and surely thrill longtime fans. The famous Bond's shots are still here. The script didn't allowed more humor, that surely be welcome, but this is a very small quibble about the secret agent in our century. It's a fine testament to a timeless 007 that doesn't sound dated, on the contrary this the best era singe Roger Moore and finally back in action again, in the right place this time. This film plays great whether you're a fan of James Bond, the actors, or not. (On a minor but no less important note, John Barry should be included in the movie opening, not to mention in the ending credits. After all Thomas Newman did use Barry's music.)"

","I felt like Homer Simpson during this movie, I thought I was so close to making it across the gorge (on my metaphorical skateboard) but now after having my second thought I find myself suddenly plunging once again to the depths of cinematic failure and disappointment; Doh! I mean when did both Bond and his villains suddenly become such apron clutching delinquents who start bed wetting the moment they find out Santa isn't real? <br/><br/>My real problem with the movie was predictability. Right from the outset the story had holes wider than the pretty boy inmate we all love and like my friend with OCD you knew what would happened next. The story goes from capturing a hard drive to Bond on vacation to a terrorist plot to protecting M – all plot lines which were tossed aside like last night's left overs! Peppered with poor attempts at being techy (sorry Sheldon, Raj, Howard and Lenard), gloomy shots of a London summer and some old Scottish fart living in the shadows I was pretty bored for much of it. And we all knew he didn't pass the tests! Off course the baddie escapes his Hannibal lecter prison cage! Obviously ""years of planning"" is never enough (the bad guy still gets it wrong)! 'Woman in shower' always equals 'Bond infiltrating unthreateningly from behind' (I always get a squeal and a slap when I try), I mean bond is like a fungal nail infection – it never really dies, so stop trying to convince us he has! <br/><br/>Everyone who watches bond watches it for 3 reasons: 1) the bond girl 2) the larger than life eccentric villain and 3) gadgets. This movie really had none of these! It's sad that they actually make a point of being gadget-less! What happen to the good ol' days when Bond always ended in bed with the girl? Where are the villains who want to take over the world, start WW3, have a satellite sun ray gun thingy, metal teeth, killer hats and a fluffy pussy (cat)? Instead we have to put up with a whiny, homo-erotic, Boris Johnson lookalike who has a fetish for computers (is that supposed be Mendes' attempt at bringing Bond into the 21st century?) and likens himself to a rat – and boy does he have mummy issues...<br/><br/>I guess if you look at this film as a memento to the 50 years of Bond it actually does okay. The old school Bond cheese always makes me smile, the endless references to the old movies, the half-baked desperately intertwined story lines (from old Bonds) and the return of a certain iconic gadget we all loved and wanted to one day own (once we'd grown up and had enough money) do give it a nostalgic feel and made me want to go home and start an old school Bond marathon.<br/><br/>All in all I think this movie had the ingredients for being something special, instead it's special like how you tell the dumb kid in class that he's ""special"". The nostalgia was great but the plot holes and 'M for mother' feel in the movie left me bewildered like the armless man with a spare watch <br/><br/>By the way, where did that hard drive go?"

"hj0544","8","6","14","27 October 2013"," The best Bond movie ever...
","Ian Fleming's James Bond (007) has been enthralling people around the globe for a long period of time. He holds us with extreme action, humor, style; super-fast cars and technology hyped electronic gazettes. Skyfall yet last released movie of James Bond and is very different from all other movies of the series.<br/><br/>Skyfall portrays a Bond never seen before. Though his physical strengths are depressed his character is actually outstandingly strong. Moreover the terrorism shown in movie is a true reflection of present situation. Our enemies are no longer known to us, there is no specific battlefield. They don't have certain identity. As it is said in movie, 'They are not nations, no uniform they have'. Some other day we may find them at the next door. The world is truly in shadows.<br/><br/>James has grown older now. He is not strong as we saw him previously. Physical and psychological tests highly reject him for field duty. MI6 is broken down. There best security systems are hacked. Government now doubts their efficiency. M herself is targeted by enemy.<br/><br/>We observe resurrection of James Bond in this worst situation. Hero is not the one who comes from distant planet or star, he is not mutant neither he has superpowers. He is one of us. He has limitations and above all he is mortal. Bond shows intention and great determination is enough to be a hero. Movie itself has commented some lines on this fact, 'We are not as strong as we were in the past. We might have moved earth back then in time but it has changed now. We have become weak. Now muscles would not work but motivation can. And this is how some men with strong will fighting hard to save the world.'<br/><br/>Concept and presentation is just outstanding. It is not just a Bond movie; it is an inspiration to rise again from failure. A great Philosophy narrated in James Bond style is so effective. A must watch movie."
"n-mo","3","6","14","25 June 2013"," If this is modernity, count me out.
","Part of the appeal of the original James Bond, as conceived by Ian Fleming and as depicted in all 007 films up to ""Licence to Kill,"" is the way in which it plays to a sort of quirky imperial British nationalistic chauvinism in its twilight but kept alive and polite by the fact that the successor Great Power was a descendant of England (the United States - more on this later) embroiled in a nasty griplock with one of the most horrific superpowers ever seen (Ronald Reagan may have been a cretin, but unless you're a member of the French Communist Party, which famously reacted to news of the Gulag Archipelago by ignoring it and precipitating its own decline, you must admit his speechwriters certainly got the ""evil empire"" bit right on the money) - and to a sort of male chauvinism very peculiar to Britain. N.B.: Indiana Jones played on post-war American optimism and nationalist chauvinism in much the same way.<br/><br/>However, owing to cultural changes, ""Skyfall"" could never have lived up to the best ambiance of the 007 franchise, and the filmmakers' attempts to juice it up with modern meaning only serve to hasten the day of reckoning.<br/><br/>As the 1990s unrolled, overt sophisticated jingoism became increasingly less acceptable in the eyes of polite educated company, and the memory of the Hays Code was distant enough that directors need not fear slipping subversive undertones into their films, provided they steered clear of anything that would too overtly offend most of the inattentive box office-goers whose pockets they yearned to empty. Hence ""Goldeneye"" could only make it to the box office if it were to be touted the ""modernization"" of the James Bond movies (replete with hammer-and-sickle symbolism neatly planted into the opening credits of a film in which the protagonist is supposedly anti-communist and a feminist dressing-down of said protagonist), and the newest Indiana Jones movie couldn't depict an anti-communist protagonist without showing that a capitalist was just as bad.<br/><br/>And since ""Goldeneye,"" the 007-series has been well unrecognizable. For if the quirky British and male-chauvinist bent of the old Bond films has a kind of quaint charm as an historical relic that excuses ""sophisticated"" folk for taking guilty pleasure in them, even a rabid reactionary, if honest, would concede that a similar ambiance could not today be captured on film, at least not in any contemporary setting. It's not just that it would be offensive (and to the professional victim class, it would be), or that it wouldn't be plausible (Bond stories have never had a problem dispensing with the limits of plausibility): it would be completely out of order and cheesily laughable.<br/><br/>Arguably, the wise thing to do would have been to throw in the towel and stop creating new installments for a fictional universe which can no longer proceed from the order of things in Britain or the world. But the 007 franchise was too hot to give its last gasp without cashing in, and so the producers castrated it. All of the quirky charm of Old Britain, with all of its flaws and all of its dignity, is gone. What's left is bloodshed and high-paced action. The problem is that bloodshed and high-paced action are each a dime a dozen in cinema. Accordingly, all Bond films since and including ""Goldeneye"" were predictably bland and boring.<br/><br/>The producers of ""Skyfall"" surely understood this, for they decided to turn the formula around and ""deconstruct"" the classic Bond: giving him emotion, injecting anguish over the deaths of his parents, turning the ""Bond Girl"" fixation into a weird and stupid and possibly depian mommy-attachment, even hinting at homo-eroticism beneath that aggressive womanizing. Some have praised this turn of events for the literary and cinematic richness it breaths to the film and, by extension, to the script.<br/><br/>Please allow me to respectfully dissent, on the following grounds:<br/><br/>""Deconstructionists"" are notorious for taking superficial things and turning them into objects of contemplation. In France there is a well-known psychiatrist who wrote a psychoanalysis of the child's love for a McDonald's hamburger as surrogate breast-food. The bottom line is that James Bond is silly and superficial and just a quirky, personal-fantastic guilty pleasure: while the better-crafted of the novels and classic films certainly showcase a few fun-to-contemplate aspects of culture and the world, they are pure entertainment and have absolutely no didactic value, not even incidentally, not even as libertine works. There is absolutely no fun in seeing them deconstructed, and if one is cone-headed enough to take the the deconstruction seriously, one risks having all the previous films retroactively ruined as well.<br/><br/>In the end, the Bond universe is such that anything that aspires to be anything other than simply entertaining is doomed to abject failure. These ridiculous subtexts are so obviously retrofitted onto the character and setting that one is tempted to see this film as a parody of deconstructionism.<br/><br/>But it gets worse. Because the film is so fixated on its the uninteresting and unamusing themes, it fails to advance a sympathetic or conceivable plot. Nothing makes sense; nothing is put together; no progression can be seen - and so throughout the action scenes that so ungracefully intersperse the postmodern drawl, one cannot feel that sort of breathless tension. One is simply not able to make oneself care.<br/><br/>See ""The Hangover part 3"" for another example of a recent movie that cut the guts out of a purely entertaining universe to try and tried to inject conscious meaning. This has not been a good season for big-name film franchises. Indeed, one might suspect that even the name ""deconstruction"" is, minus the ""-con-,"" a harbinger for the future of a civilization which insists upon tearing all its own treasures, even the silly trinkets such as James Bond or The Hangover, to bits. Be old-fashioned. Save your money and rent the old flicks."

","Bond is back and he's bigger, better and bolder than ever in Skyfall. Skyfall is the 23rd installment of the movie franchise that revolves around the exploits of British Secret Service agent James Bond. Daniel Craig delivers his best performance yet as agent 007 in this international action packed thriller. <br/><br/>Craig, whose previous outings as James Bond were Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, steps up the level of intensity for the character based on the Ian Fleming series of spy novels. Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) plays the villain Raoul Silva, and is especially chilling as the psychotic former MI6 British agent turned cyber-terrorist, now out for murderous revenge against ""M"", the head of MI6. Screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan deliver a script that is arguably the best the 007 franchise has seen in years. They've turned the James Bond character into one that is a more credible and less tongue-in-cheek. They have also given Skyfall a plot that is exciting yet believable, void of too many gadgets and quick one-liners. While all of the gadgetry and comedy are not totally gone, they are well placed and an appropriate break from the level of seriousness that this movie maintains.<br/><br/>British singer Adele sings the title track for Skyfall during the mesmerizing opening credits that have delighted James Bond fans for years. Well choreographed action sequences and unique filming locations provide the film with stunning cinematography that is pleasing to the eyes.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a James Bond fan to enjoy Skyfall, action fans of all ages will be pleased with this movie and will leave the theater anxiously waiting for James Bond #24."

","First of all, I want to start off by saying that I'm not a Bond fan- I've only seen the first one (Dr No) which I didn't enjoy. In that case, this review will not be fan based and in no way a biased review.<br/><br/>'Skyfall' is whatthe 23rd movie in the Bond franchise!?! Its focus is mainly around James Bond who is enlisted by M to track down and kill a mysterious man by the name of Silva who has stolen codes and secrets vital to MI6.<br/><br/>There is yet again, so much stuff that I find entertaining about this movie. The Old Bond movies I'm guessing didn't get carried away with action due to effects having to be practical. In this film, the director carefully gives just the right amount of action to make us enjoy the action and care for what's going on. Unlike Looper, where the end felt unsatisfying with little action, Skyfall gives a lot of action but also focuses nicely around the emotion of our characters. Having not been a fan of Dr No, I cared for 007 in this movie, I cared for M and enjoyed the villain that was Silva and even liked Ralph Fiennes' character.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is certainly a great aspect. There is no weak spot. Everyone fulfils the director's wishes. The cinematography and shots during the movie are gorgeous, especially the shot at the end of the movie where Bond is outside in broad daylight. The shot during when Silva attacked Skyfall and there was fire all around Bond, that shot looked brilliant. The direction in the movie is taken well, with the director knowing what too much and too little action is clearly. The dialogue is very well done and overall, the film really succeeds and entertains for a full 2 ½ hours.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if anyone has yet to see Skyfall, please do so as I'm sure most will love the movie. It is a 2 ½ ride of fun, adventure and action done to the top standards."

Craig follows directions well, but in doing so he looks like someone trying to remember to separate the whites from the colors.<br/><br/>But even Craig is capable enough to handle decent material, which, unfortunately, is a very short supply in this movie. For instance, the climatic battle scene takes place in castle in Scotland, takes at least 20 minutes of screen time, involves weapons of all kinds, dynamite, various lesser explosions, and booby traps, and in the end, only one person has been killed. And he was stabbed.<br/><br/>Scenes change for no reason whatsoever, except to introduce someone Bond has to defeat, which he usually does handily even though the odds are sometimes 35 to 1.<br/><br/>I could go on, but to summarize, this is the worst Bond I've ever seen; worse, even that the one which used the invisible car.<br/><br/>Filmmakers need to remember that no matter how good the stars pecs are, there still needs to be a story wrapped around them. And I would suggest if you're going to make a movie, stop taking advantage of Daniel Craig's rapidly-aging pecs, and pay the writer to come up with a believable story.<br/><br/>This wasn't it. 2/10"
"andyetris","3","6","14","9 February 2013"," As M Goes Bye
",">> > SPOILER ALERT < << <br/><br/>It seems pointless to have a spoiler alert in a Bond film; the tropes are too well-established, although Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson HAVE spent the last couple of films trying to get outside the box. They really succeeded with CASINO ROYALE and in a way did with QUANTUM OF SOLACE, though chiefly by ripping off Clive Cussler. This paint-by-numbers effort by Sam Mendes, however, isn't so much an attempt to get outside the box as a kind of disinterested shrug AT the box - and its contents - and despite a few moments of impressive cinematography falls directly into my category of ""I've no interest in seeing THAT movie again,"" which is unusual for a Bond film (a tribute to the amazing abilities of Cubby Broccoli et al.) However although Javier Bardem isn't given much to work with here, there is real audience identification with his character as he tries to achieve what so many Bond fans have wanted to see for so long - the elimination of Judi Dench.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong - Dame Judy is an OK actress, and is pretty much OK in many films, like MRS HENDERSON PRESENTS or BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL. It's just that like John Cleese as Quartermaster... Well, it was a fun twist to throw the actor in for a laugh (or whatever Mrs Dench is supposed to evoke) during the Pierce Brosnan era, but for where the franchise needed to go with Daniel Craig - not the right character for aspirations to seriousness.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much all there is to this film - the poignancy of the great Spanish actor as he begs M to join him in a murder-suicide, instead of the lame-ass knife-in-the-back finale that seems WAY too symbolic of the scripting of his part. If only, as Bond weeps after M breathes her last, Bardem could have suddenly shrieked ""Pass the onions, Danny-boy!"" as he twisted back up for the final jolt, giving Moneypenny an opportunity to yell ""DUCK, Jimmy!"" and redeem herself for what really wasn't ENTIRELY her fault in the Orient Express scene (couldn't Bond hear M yelling ""Take the shot! TAKE THE SHOT""? Is he supposed to be growing deaf with age?? How is that the TOKEN's fault?!?) <br/><br/>It's too depressing to contemplate the film much further. The initial motorcycle chase across Istanbul's rooftops is energetic though little more than an homage to the far superior Saigon-scooter chase from TOMORROW NEVER DIES, and once we're ducking tunnels while wrestling atop the roof of a speeding train, we know we're in trouble. A thin plot has sometimes been saved by some magnificent scenery-chewing, but the half-assed assassination scene is a mess and the extended destruction of the Bond manor just feels tired. We sighed with Bardem as he shrugs at the spectacle of Bond giving the sub-boss treatment to a henchman, and seriously - the grounds-keeper needs a flashlight to find the kirk? During a sassenach attack?!? To be honest, I kind of expected this kind of thing from director Mendes, famed, if that's the right word, for the unfortunate contemporary-Hollywood's-prejudices-about-middle-America vehicle, American BEAUTY.<br/><br/>Sigh. So... Ralph Fiennes as M, huh? Is the restrained character's demonstrated willingness to stand up for subordinates and get it on with a gun in pinch some kind of signal for something new when James Bond Will Return? I hope so, Barb and Mike, 'cause as far as I'm concerned this is two duds in a row.<br/><br/>>> > SPOILER ALERT < <<"

","With the exception of the opening sequence I felt let down by this film. It was not the best Bond film ever by a long way, taking Daniel Craig out of the question - as he is faultless - Sam Mendes took lazy decisions that are very surprising and disappointing. I thought it was fairly lame and dialogue heavy, at the expense of action. <br/><br/>With Bond we live the film through his eyes, we have to see how he escapes from impossible situations - but Sam Mendes just left him in situations and then cut to him walking into the next scene with no explanation! lazy film making and I expect more from Bond. We need to be with him every time he escapes and be amazed at his inginuity, but we didn't get that. He was left at the bottom of the Loch, he fired a flare towards the ice (winter in Scotland, yet light in London at 6pm? hello?)....then cut to him walking into the church. How did he get out? Also lots of story lines that don't make sense, like the tube train / the HEAD of MI5 making her escape ...at a snails pace...across a field...WITH A TORCH!!?? them making their way secretly to Scotland...but laying a false trail supposedly by their satnav, but following the same route they made anyway...yet no-one at MI5/6 followed them? a succession of contrived nonsense. Daniel Craig 10/10 but the film as a whole didn't live up to the hype for me."

","Those expecting the James Bond they have enjoyed in the past may be disappointed. Bond, played by Daniel Craig in his third time in the role, lacks the confidence, the swagger, skills, and tactics of the character's previous incarnations.<br/><br/>After an ineffectual struggle with Patrice, a hit-man, Patrice, Bond is mistakenly shot by Even, another MI6 operative. Rather than undergo a thorough government sponsored therapy, he just drops out of sight. Once he returns to MI6, he must undergo tests to determine his fitness. He flunks the physical, but is reinstated to duty by M (Judi Dench).<br/><br/>Bond's original mission was to retrieve a hard drive containing the names of every NATO agent currently operating undercover. Though this Bond is a protagonist, rather than a hero, the story has a real villain, Silva (Javier Bardem), who has the stolen hard drive. Silva appears to have almost unlimited resources and skills; his planning is so precise as to bring a subway car crashing into a tunnel where he is pursued by Bond.<br/><br/>Silva is eventually killed by Bond and the hard drive recovered. But Bond's secondary mission -- to protect M while using her as bait to lure Silva out of hiding -- is a dismal failure. Bond takes her to his family home (Skyfall) only to see M killed and his home demolished because he greatly underestimated Silva.<br/><br/>More human? Perhaps, but not the man I came to admire."

A mindless plot, uninspired fight scenes, Judy Dench with lines that I'm sure she tried to forget. No tension, predictable twists, senseless violence and boring chase scenes that go on and on and on and on. The villain was a gay ponce who was about as menacing as Mr. Magoo, he did however tell an interesting rat story. Back in the old days you could go see a Bond movie at a drive in theatre. In-between necking bouts with your girlfriend you could keep up with the standard simple plot of Mad scientist tries to destroy or take over world.

","I am very much a Bond Movie fan and have always enjoyed the excitement, imagination and innovation that typically goes hand in hand with all the Bond movies.<br/><br/>I entered the movie theatre full of positive expectation that Skyfall would be another James Bond classic. Sadly what I saw was nothing of the sort.<br/><br/>The movie lacked a credible storyline, in fact the storyline was so weak and fundamentally flawed that it became annoying. The usual James Bond techno-innovation, which has always been the hallmark of the 007 brand, was completely absent. In fact the absence of anything even resembling some 21 century innovation, gave a clear impression that this was a 'low-budget' movie. <br/><br/>Then there were the characters. James Bond, or should I say Daniel Craig looked terrible. For much of the movie he looked tired and haggard. Not a look that is synonymous with 007. Judy Dench likewise looked her age and came across as frail and weak and certainly didn't present the image you would associate with the head of MI6.<br/><br/>Historically I have watched James Bond movies many times over. Sadly this one I will NEVER watch again.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this was very very disappointing."

"Chase_Witherspoon","3","6","14","2 January 2013"," Skyfall in a tailspin
","A prime example of where hype outweighs substance, ""Skyfall"" is the epitome of the studio pay dirt, exploiting the brand for the sake of some funny money, sans the desire to actually conceive, construct and execute a strong, cohesive narrative.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is starting to relax, and that's a good thing insofar as Bond is concerned; not that I don't appreciate the contrast in his Bond incarnation, just that his chiselled features (physical and emotional) rarely enable much character to emerge. Javier Bardem - a stereotype if there ever was, not the worst Bond villain ever conceived, but I struggled to take him seriously (he seems to be cornering the market on villains with really bad hair-do's).<br/><br/>Adele's theme song while now ubiquitous on the radio, is but a pale imitation of the great themes developed for the Bond franchise since its inception. And finally, when you inflate an expectation to the degree to which ""Skyfall"" was relentlessly plugged pre-release, you've got to deliver. Aside from the production values, I'm not seeing where the money was spent on developing the narrative or plot (without the need for contrivances), so ""Skyfall"", for me, was a disappointment only amplified by its great expectation."

"cx2hmsvx0twdmx5","4","6","14","30 December 2012"," Way too straightforward
","One of the weakest of the series. It was like watching someone playing one of those games where everything is being hinted at you right before it happens. It has no surprises at all as all the so-called twists are so predictable and seen in countless movies before. To sum it up : the only ""James Bondesque"" elements in that movie was the names and the music. Everything else was dull.<br/><br/>The intro sequence is easily forgettable. And come on, it's the 21th century. We had enough of the bad guy who can't shoot straight at his target when he's just in front of him. Finally, Eve missing his target, well sorry there would have been better ways to introduce a failure.<br/><br/>The main part is filled with empty sequences where nothing really happens except here and there. So there's not much to say. It's just boring.<br/><br/>The villain has less to none charisma. Biggest fail was jailing him with a big weapon (the movie has 3 writers and yet they let this happens).<br/><br/>The ""James Bond"" girls... Where are they ?<br/><br/>The plot. Well, I don't understand why they were 3 writers. I could have written the story myself for a much cheaper price probably.<br/><br/>I was happy before seeing because I knew there would be some sequences in Asia. Yeah. Asia. Stock shoots probably and studios indoor sequences are my best best. Awful.<br/><br/>As for the finale. Flawed. So much.<br/><br/>It was painful seeing James Bond failing so many times.

"Lawlass","10","6","14","16 December 2012"," Oscar should prefer Daniel Craig as Bond as opposed to Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln
","Though I have enjoyed adventure/mystery flicks over the years, I have never previously seen an entire James Bond movie. As a child, I would catch glimpses of old Bond movies on television, and I always found the dialogue to be trite and boring, prompting me to change the channel. But now comes 2012 and the draw of the chiseled, serious-minded, Daniel Craig, drew me to finally watch a Bond movie. I took my 70 year old father, who enjoyed the movie, but afterward quipped that ""Sean Connery was a better looking James Bond."" I have not watched Connery as Bond, but Daniel Craig sizzles with sexiness as this dark blonde, brooding, dangerous, unsmiling, elegant agent. Setting aside the sultry energy that this actor emits on screen (something that I do not believe any modern day actor equals; Craig's smouldering affect is akin to Cary Grant in North by Northwest or Brando in On the Waterfront), the plot of this movie is fast-paced, energetic, and overall entertaining. Craig's moving performance is corroborated by the assistance of being surrounded by great actors, such as Dench and Bardiem. And, of course, Bardeim's villain matches his equally demonically dark presence of his character in No Country for Old Men. The Skyfall script is tight, unpredictable, and the cinematography is nothing less than stunning (and no, I am not talking about the scenes of a shirtless Bond - though Craig is as visually beautiful as the Scottish landscape).<br/><br/>I have not been so entertained by a movie in many years. I am actually going to see this one again next weekend and, while I made repeat trips to the theater to see Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark as a child, I have not made a repeat visit to a movie theater in adulthood.<br/><br/>In closing, Daniel Craig should get an Oscar nod for this movie. I am tired of hearing about the ""brilliant"" acting of Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln and the ""brilliance"" of Spielberg. Lincoln was a mediocre movie at best, and this is coming from a person who resides in the Land of Lincoln and who is a Civil War buff (Ridley Scott's Gettysburg is one of my favorite movies). Spielberg has not made a great movie since Schindler's List and, while DDL was indeed ""brilliant"" in My Left Foot and There Will Be Blood, his performance in Lincoln is hampered by a silly, exaggerated, sophomoric, Joey-the-horse type, of script."

Think - back story of the agents, how they're brought in and treated. Skyfall even has Albert Finney from Born as well, go figure.<br/><br/>How dark has Bond fallen (no pun)? He accesses the bad guys lady - a girl he says (to her face) is a sex slave. She doesn't deny it. He says he can help her. A few scenes later he's having sex with her - so how did he really help her?

I like the transition to the new M and the introduction of the new characters well known to Bond fans like me. I think Sam Mendes did some of his bet work making this transition as Bond had not been reporting to M as we have been accustomed to since Die Another Day. It is understandable since Mr. Craig took the role that he would have to ease in to it so at the end we are please to see him make the final transition. The train chase is a nail biter as is the chase after Silva escapes. These sequences make the movie memorable and Mr. Craig's acting is very good for such a one dimensional character. I will miss Judi Dench but she made her mark and with it did what she knew she must eventually do. I like Ralph Fiennes as the new M and believe he will hold up well.

"brad_oulette","1","6","14","18 November 2012"," Bring Back Bond
","Where to start... I'm glad I went on cheap Tuesday. Skyfall opens without the gun barrel as we all heard. Instead we get a shot of the weathered Daniel Craig. At the start of this movie Craig is supposed to be a healthy Bond but he looks like he crawled out of the grave. Just look at his face while he's on the bike and in the track hoe. Then comes the fight on top of the train. I found the fight decent but the choreography on Craig's previous 2 was better. Once Bond is shot and falls into the river the title sequence begins. I thought overall it was on of the better title sequences in a long time. The only thing that would have made it better would have been if Craig's face was not in it as he looks awful. I liked the fact that there was an ample amount of females in the title sequence, Casino Royale did not have one woman in its title sequence. After the title sequence we get to see an even worse looking Craig drowning his sorrows with hienekin. Craig watches the TV and sees mi6 has blown up so for whatever reason decides to check in with M. M tells a 80 year old Craig that he can return to duty if he passes all the tests, why she says this is beyond me because she clears him when he fails anyway. Craig digs out shrapnel from his gunshot wound from the start of the movie and has it analyzed. It comes back that only 3 men use that type of munition (lol). Craig then finds the man in shanghai. I found I really liked the look of the film while in shanghai. It was cool modern and unique. Craig fights the man after he lets him assassinate some guy. Craig than takes a money chip he finds to a casino and meets the beautiful Bérénice Marlohe who is wearing to much black make up in the casino scene. Then Bond takes on three men and some Komodo dragons. The Komodo dragons look terrible when cgi is used. Then finally bond gets the girl and Bérénice Marlohe looks wonderful. Then Craig meet silva and we have the famous ackword homoerotic gay scene (if you want to call it that). Bond captures silva and they take him to the new underground mi6. I found Bardem to be trying to hard to act like some deranged killer maniac. Q hacks into Silvia's computer only to discover that silva planned the capture and hack resulting in silva actually hacking mi6. Silva escapes bond fallows silva tries to get M Craig gets her first and takes her to Scotland where we are given a brief forced scene on Craig's family and childhood. This scene wanted desperately to be award material but fails big time. Craig takes M to his former home Skyfall and we meet the groundskeeper who informs Craig there are no guns left at the house except his father old double shot. I did not like the groundskeeper played by Albert Finney for 2 reasons. 1 it made me think of Jason Bourne and will you comitt to this program and 2 I was confused by his and Craig's relationship and how close they are. I don't know. M drops an f bomb. So with no weapons except some shotgun shells and dynamite they decide to home alone it up. Then silva arrives and acts crazy throwing bombs. Then Craig blows up Skyfall and runs away. Then Craig falls threw the ice on the lake and has a fight underwater where, get this... He chokes a man to death underwater. Why strangle someone underwater??? They already can't breathe!!! Me and my wife couldn't help but laugh at that! Academy Award my @$$. Then Craig kills silva in a very unrewarding manner. M dies Bond cries. It's revealed that eve is Moneypenny and mulroy is now m. The we get the gun barrel. The in big letters James Bond Will Return! Ya right I believed that the previous two times.<br/><br/>What worked in my opinion: Title sequence and song 007 theme music is finally back Bérénice Marlohe is hot as heck they injected the movie with humour that actually works shanghai Craig has no problems finding the stationary<br/><br/>What did Not work in my opinion: the rest of the movie plot is not very good Moneypenny Javier Bardem Dench's f bomb and the use of other cuss words hienekin sexual tension between Craig and Bardem. cgi Craig in a tuxedo Home Alone angle but my biggest complaint is Craig"

","In light of the Cold War the James Bond movies used to be a means to tell people: ""Don't take war too seriously!"" It was a way to convert the threat , presented by the Soviet Union, into amusement. The stylistic devices, to achieve that, have been a certain amount of British humor, Bond girls and exciting gadgets. Do not expect too much of either in Skyfall!<br/><br/>In fact, it appears as though the makers desperately tried to diminish anything that used to stand for James Bond, and in turn, tried to increase anything that has to do with the contemporary Batman trilogy. Although performed fairly well, Silva (played by Javier Bardem) reminded me of a poor version of Joker in the Dark Knight. Moreover, the mood, conveyed in the movie is strikingly similar to the one in the Batman trilogy. Even the plot shows similarities; which, I will not reveal, of course. Last but not least it is worth to mention that the action is mediocre compared to movies like the Bourne trilogy, for instance.<br/><br/>Nevertheless; although I did not leave the movies with an uplifted feeling, it is still a pretty watchable movie. Just not what I expected and therefore a 7."
"omilders","6","6","14","31 October 2012"," Skyfall – Not even close
","Sometimes you watch a movie and read the reviews where you wonder: did we watch the same movie? This is one of those cases. Of course it's interesting that this is Bond nr. 23 and the 50th anniversary but let's review the movie itself, not it's history or the emotional load carried by the actor playing James Bond.<br/><br/>The story line is exceptionally weak in my perception. The opening scene is full of action, as one might expect, but full of strange actions. Of course the scenes on the rooftops of Istanbul are sensational, but realistic? I think not. Than there is the point where James has to jump on a train from a bridge. He does that by crashing into a railing in a way that would injure anyone profoundly. His co-star Eve, played by Naomie Harris manages to take her car from the bridge through traffic, and within seconds next to the train. Even more bizarre, in minutes they are high in the mountains. Not a very well written script.<br/><br/>The traveling around the world to Shanghai was necessary for Bond to put him in different locations, but the high-rise assassination was weird first of all because of the assassination it self, where everyone in the other building knows of the assassination, but than why do it so difficult. There are millions of ways to kill someone that are easier and more logical. The glass panels in the tower, with the commercial signs flashing in the background where a bit weirdly shot.<br/><br/>The subway explosion and subsequent tumbling down of a complete subway train was shot in an clumsy and stupid way. The whole train remained full of light during the tumbling down, it went through 8 columns which didn't show when it finally came to a stop. It didn't crash but sort of kept on driving over rails and after 8 support columns are smashed, you expect the building above also to crash down or so. And how does the new Q track people in tunnels?<br/><br/>The scenes in Scotland were of course well done. Although the light of a big fire carries apparently for miles when they arrive in the little church, a bit unbelievable. But about those scenes many questions arise. Why was M injured, and how do you die so quickly after walking for 2 miles? And than the scene in the house where it felt like watching an episode of McGiver or the A-Team. Very poorly scripted and not realistic for James Bond himself.<br/><br/>The weirdest thing of all is the plot of the storyline itself. The question being asked in the movie, for instance by the minister of internal affairs is, is there relevance for the existence of MI6. The answer in the movie: No there is not, because all of the worlds problems have disappeared. And the only things that remain are personal vendettas within the rankings of MI6, or old agents that have personal problems. Reason for abolishing the whole of MI6 and it's ancient agents. Apart from the fact that three villains attack the room of where M is interrogated by the minister and nobody of the MI6 agents or police officers know how to shoot and kill a bad guy.<br/><br/>There are many different ways to make James Bond more 2012, this was definitely not the way to do it. Basically it's the end of Bond, unless in the next 007 they know how to give world problems a better view by a more realistic storyline. Of course the movie was shot with nice cameras, nice lighting, one might expect that. But for me this James Bond is not in the Top 10 of best movies from the agent that we all know so well."
"joebondo","1","5","11","28 May 2016"," The Bond film that made me leave the franchise
","I've been watching the James Bond franchise my entire life. Always anxiously awaiting the next Bond film about every couple years or so. I began to lose some interest beginning with the 3rd Pierce Brosnan film, ""The world is not enough"". I didn't even finish watching that Bond film because I was so bored and because of that, for the first time ever I didn't even see a Bond film, Brosnan's last, ""Die another day"". <br/><br/>Daniel Craig got hired and I was more than willing to come back to the franchise. Boy oh boy was I glad I did as ""Casino Royale"" is one of my favorite Bond films of all time. Contemporary Bond? Yes. But they blended in everything about today's world perfectly, especially the fact that Texas Holdem was probably at its height in popularity at that time. Craig's 2nd film, ""Quantum of Solace"" can be described as nothing short of a yawner. <br/><br/>Now comes the 3rd Craig film, ""Skyfall"". About a month or two before it's release, all I kept hearing was this great hype, ""this is going to be the best Bond film of all time""! <br/><br/>Well not only could this statement be further from the truth, it is the polar opposite as I am of the opinion this is the worst Bond film of all time! My main issue with this film (aside from the weak plot) is the word credibility. I know whenever we sit down to watch any film but especially a Bond film, you have to have an open mind and let yourself be entertained. Bond films are going to have crazy stunts, gadgets, getaways, etc. throughout the film, but there is always a redeeming quality of credibility, to a certain degree anyway. What Sam Mendes did as the director of ""Skyfall"" completely insulted my intelligence as a moviegoer and as a human being! The average Bond film will have a handful of scenes that are not credible. In ""Skyfall"", EVERY scene is not credible! I guess Sam Mendes said to himself, 'it doesn't matter how incredulous any scene I include in the movie is, people will watch it, they'll buy it, because it's James Bond'. This movie is a complete and utter embarrassment to the franchise. I won't get into all the details of the movie but the 3 that 'stick in my crawl' I'll share. <br/><br/>1. Bond should have been dead after the opening scene so the film should have been about 5 minutes long. 2. The way they have Silva escape MI6 HQ is a complete and utter farce as he just literally walks out unscathed amongst 100's of agents as well as the most sophisticated security on the planet. 3. The ending is an utter joke, Bond, M and an old man gamekeeper decide to holdup in a broken down shack of an estate as sitting targets, barely armed, with no backup close by! Please!<br/><br/>Thank you Sam Mendes for doing 3 things: 1. Making me leave the Bond franchise for good, 2. Making the worst Bond film in the franchise, 3. Aside from being a James Bond film, you also made one of the worst films of all time, period!"

","I heard many reviews before seeing this film and they were somewhat varied though none were bad. The two main things i heard were either 'The classic Bond is back' or 'It was better than Quantum of Solace but not as good as Casino Royale'. I however thought it was worse than both and that the classic bond was not back. Craig gives an incredibly uninspired performance. The ending is reminiscent of Home Alone. The plot is poor and the villain seemed to replay Live Free Or Die-hard. The film had Craig try his hand at a one-liner or two to no avail. All this said the film did have some visual competence but, back to the negativity, was shot unwell. I just don't understand what the hype is around Skyfall, I very much enjoyed Casino Royale and thought that Quantum of Solace was alright as a part two and was visually stunning at all times (Granted they didn't feel like original Bond films). But Skyfall was, in my opinion, quite terrible throughout. The plot was rather pathetic and i felt like i had seen it before in multiple films. To sum this review up, i hated it."
"shaososa","4","5","11","26 July 2013"," Double 0 Boring
","The 007 franchise has a recipe that is pretty simple in ingredients but has still been able to keep audiences buying tickets for over 50 years. You have a super villain, a girl (sometimes two), some gadgetry paired up with a beautiful automobile, and top tier chase and fight scenes that are the best in the business. Aside from minor variations on this formula, it is one that has not changed in half a century. <br/><br/>For the most part, this has not been a bad thing. The James Bond series has spawned one of the best action films ever in Casino Royale and even the mediocre ones are enjoyable to watch. Most critics and fans alike will say that the Daniel Craig led phase of the Bond series is 1-2 with a grand slam in Casino Royale and a strike out with bases loaded in The Quantum of Solace (although I feel that is a little unfair on the latter). So now we have Skyfall at the plate and with Sam Mendes at the helm and Javier Bardem checking in as the bad guy, anticipation for a big score could be no higher.<br/><br/>MI6 is in chaos. After Bond is accidentally shot by his colleague during a fight with a hit-man, he is presumed dead when his body is not located. His boss, M (Judi Dench), is facing heavy scrutiny and being pressured to retire by British Intelligence Chairman Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). Shortly after an inquest into Bond's demise, M receives a taunting email from an unknown sender and then the offices of MI6 explode, killing many workers. Bond, who is actually hiding out and gathering his wits, learns of the attack and returns to London. Since he has already been declared deceased, he must pass some psychological and physical tests, all of which he fails. Nevertheless, M inserts him back in the field to search after her tormentor. The usual Bond type globetrotting detective work ensues which leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former MI6 operative turned freelance cyber terrorist. Silva has a very large bone to pick with M, and through that MI6 as a whole.<br/><br/>Besides Craig, who could prove to supplant Sean Connery as the best Bond ever, Bardem is one the few good things Skyfall has going for it. This is no mere copy of Anton Chigurh, the hit-man from No Country For Old Men for whose role earned Bardem an Oscar. Silva is one of the most layered Bond villains in decades and the story of him going bad fits well within the 007 universe. But there is some ridiculousness in his skill as a hacker, and it is one of the many problems with Skyfall's plot.<br/><br/>The ongoing worry with Bond movies is directors must know when something is too over the top when crafting the action that is the backbone of the franchise. Do too much and risk jumping the shark. Do too little and audiences are underwhelmed. Mendes somehow manages both in the same film. Silva's character's issue is that he is too much of a genius, too clever for the sake of the story. We are expected to believe that he has no problem hacking into M's personal email and computer with ease and later into MI6's entire system. He masterminds an escape from custody that is so reliant on perfect timing that it is too much too swallow, even for a Bond movie. The essence of a great villain is that he is able to overcome adversity by outthinking the good guys. But here, the good guys are so inept that Silva's feats neither impress nor seem possible.<br/><br/>The other big problem with Skyfall is the mediocrity of the chase and fight scenes. Mendes shoots a beautiful film, no doubt, and there is a fight between Bond and a baddie on top of a Shanghai skyscraper that is nothing short of gorgeous. But the rest of the action has an uninspired feel to it. There are no wow moments and one can't help but feel like you have seen these shootouts many times before.<br/><br/>The relationship between M and Bond is given more story here than in any movie of the series that I can remember. I understand the reasoning but it is all done with such a heavy hand that it comes off as melodramatic. And that's really the whole gist of what is wrong here. Mendes has attempted to make Skyfall the most character driven Bond movie ever but in the end I didn't want to ride to where these characters were being driven to."

","1 star - why 1 star? because of unusual current rating on IMDb. So to balance it off I've to give a 1 star. The original movie rating reflecting on IMDb should not be more than 5 stars.<br/><br/>I happen to watch this movie pretty late, there was a time when I used to watch every bond movie only in theaters, but not since Daniel Craig. I watched this on a DVD and wasted my 2 and half hours.<br/><br/>The movie hardly offers anything worth watching, neither the story, nor direction has anything to offer. It could have been just another spy movie that would have gone unnoticed unless you call it a bond movie. Too much attention to M, and bond couldn't even save her at the end. Villain's reason for revenge is just unconvincing, there is no suspense besides M's life in the climax. Too less characters and there is no threat to the world either. The story just sucks!<br/><br/>It ain't a bond movie. As said by many others the steady characters like Q and money-penny are not convincing. Q is a proper misfit for the role. There are no gadgets to talk of, just a gun and radio transmitter and a dialog like ""were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't do that anymore."". There is no style to bond, he is not a charming playboy anymore, he couldn't even save his love-interest.<br/><br/>Long story short: They tried hard to keep the bond alive, but they didn't knew he is already dead."

The charm of the Bond films has always been the tongue in cheek nature of them. Along with the innately debonair persona of Bond himself. Daniel Craig is a good actor, but lacks the charisma to pull of the role of JB and is getting worse with each installment. This type of inane smashem up - crashem up flick is everywhere. Javier Bardem makes a brilliant villain (see 'No Country for Old men') but his talent while up to par, is totally wasted here.

","I feel this film is massively overrated. The overly long gun fights couldn't distract me from the shallow revenge plot. We find out very early on that the agent's list(already used in Mission Impossible) was just a distraction to the main plan which is to take revenge on M. This tiny little story is wrapped up in a sushi of gun fights, chase scenes, explosions, trains, helicopters, etc. And that's the ENTIRE film.<br/><br/>A few specific qualms: 1. Completely incompetent bad guy. This film will dazzle us with all his cyber terrorism skills and techy stuff but it all comes down to the fact that he had THREE chances to kill either M or James Bond and he failed due to the old ""take your time before killing someone"".<br/><br/>2. Bond arranges a face to face meeting with the bad guy. That's your plan Mr. Bond? A man of your experience and you go with let's get handcuffed and bring a tracking device? Which by the way none of the goons checked his pockets?<br/><br/>3. Villain's elaborate but pointless plan. So you get captured intentionally to hack MI6, what exactly did that do for you?

The action and stunts scenes were fast and neat. Should definitely appreciate the costume designer for the perfect fit suits designed for stunts.<br/><br/>Unlike other Bond movies, there is a lack of pace in the script as most of the story revolves only in London & Scotland with less importance in scenes pertaining to Shanghai, Macau & Istanbul.

","The problem with Bond films is the insistence on the same or similar formula. This tends to rule out or at least inhibit the development of a good storyline. Having read all Ian Flemings books, I wish just one would start in his apartment, early morning, does his press ups, prepares his scrambled eggs etc, instead of always a precipitous action start. Having said that Skyfall must be one of the best beginnings to any Bond film. The first twenty minutes was spectacular and beautifully filmed. When the adverts came on I just said, ""follow that"". This is where it fell down ,it couldn't. The story reverted to the usual formulaic pattern, and the script was frankly sub standard. I know the one liners are usually quite corny, but at least they are funny, though nearly absent in this film. After all this criticism I must add the acting was excellent,and the song and singing from Adele brilliant.

","I am confused how to form an opinion on Skyfall. In short, I saw a good movie, but I am unsure if I saw a James Bond movie.<br/><br/>Let's start with what was good: - a more careful direction compared to the shaking cameras of Quantum of Solace - the cinematography: the Shangai skyscraper with reflecting doors scene, the wonderful Macau set, the beautiful Scottish landscape scenes which were perfectly tinted, the fire - not only the inclusion of the Aston Martin, but especially the way it was filmed, as well as the shot of it in the Scottish mist were wonderful nods to Goldfinger - Adele's title track: finally again a song where they got the Bond feel right (it's been since Goldeneye) - at points a convincing plot - it is clear Sam Mendes is an experienced director: most things here feel solid - a solid cast: Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes really add to the thing<br/><br/>And best of all two things: - Javier Bardem: who is far and away the best actor in this movie. We have to go back to A View to a Kill (Christopher Walken) and perhaps Goldeneye (Sean Bean and Famke Janssen) to find the last inclusions of truly great and memorable Bond villains. Bardem reigns in the scenes he is in, through face, look, feel and intonation. - again, the villain, but approaching from a different point of view now: what I'm getting at is how the story actually includes a villain. One of the great joys of watching old Bond movies was watching a charismatic villain instead of the villains' schemes (did the schemes matter really? Most often not). Many of the recent Bond movies invested more in the scheme than the villain itself. While the villain's scheme here is sufficiently written, this is all about the villain again: a larger-than-life (while avoiding the 80's cheesiness) villain who commands the screen. Bardem's performance is crucial to this, but it also has to do with how this villain was actually written and developed instead of being tacked on almost as an afterthought.<br/><br/>So, many good things to admire and in shades more Bond-like than in ages. Still, for some reason, it does not feel right. I am not completely sure yet why this is, but these reasons are part of an explanation:<br/><br/><ul><li>What struck me most is how Bond himself is almost absent. Daniel Craig's performance was more than OK and he has sufficient screen time, but thinking about the movie produces images of many things in my head (Bardem, Dench, landscapes, Aston Martin, Macau), but no Bond. Bond did not feel like a central part of this movie. Sure, there were certain other focuses in this movie, making it partly intentional, but it felt like Bond was wandering around in a story that was not about him. - Bond girls: there are two Bond girls here, but where are they? They are truly tacked on. - Thomas Newman: Newman is a giant in soundtrack world and his soundtrack in itself was not bad, but I am not sure if it was a fitting match.</li></ul><br/><br/>I am trying very hard to include one single conclusion in this review, but I am unable, I cannot make my mind up what this movie is (yet). I did enjoy it thoroughly. And I want to unapologizingly like it for its many good things, but part of it does not sit right and I can't quite put my finger on what that is.<br/><br/>Oh, and put that gun barrel scene back at the front finally next time!"

","Nothing original. Not written by Ian Fleming. The persona of Mr. Daniel Craig does not fit into the character created originally by Ian Fleming. The story revolved around an insider job, executed by an ex-M16 agent. Own M16 British secret agent revolting against his department Head. Too much action, too much flaws like M (MoneyPenny) ordering to fire, even when the girl on the trigger apprehends James Bond may be hit, who was engaged in a hand to hand scuffle with the bad guy. Strange orders of M, executed ruthlessly that result in shooting their own secret agent. Afterwards, lame excuses put by M (Judi). Too weak a story. I logically suppose such decrepit orders of an incompetent M, should be enough to perturb James Bond to join hands with Silvo. <br/><br/>Too much crazy action, too weak script, unimpressive Bond girls and a young feeble and immature Q. His persona was quite much a mockery of the character Q, that was originally defined by Ian Fleming. Finally, Daniel Craig has a cold, insipid and stolid visage.

","The James Bond franchise has had some ups and downs but somehow has stayed going strong over the years. When Daniel Craig took over the role of Bond it sent a shockwave through the fans heart as he delivered a harder edged Bond than ever seen before. Casino Royale knocked it out of the park, but while Quantum of Solace was OK it just didn't live up to the quality of Casino Royale. After much struggle to get the latest Craig Bond film Skyfall made it's finally here, but will it return to what made Royale so good or will it be another sequel like Solace?<br/><br/>Skyfall follows Bond as his loyalty to M is tested when her past comes back to haunt her. With an attack on MI6 and a threat that is becoming more personal, 007 must come back from the dead to save her and MI6 before all is lost, no matter how personal it gets. This is easily the best Craig Bond film to date and could rank as one of the best of the 007 overall. Here we get a more emotional Bond times, but not in the realm of whiny or preachy like a lot of stories like this go. While there are some major action sequences, they are noticeably toned down for this latest edition to the popular franchise in favor of taking a more personal approach for both Bong and M, who is given a lot more to do here. Craig steps back into the shows of the titular spy better than ever continuing to breathe new life into this old school spy hero. Dame Judi Dench steps up her game even more to take the M character in a whole new direction giving her a chance to showcase even more of her acting brilliance. Of all the great performances none rival that of Javier Bardem who is the perfect villain. He is a bit over the top strange at times which gives him the feel of the classic villains in the earlier Bond films. Do not be surprised if he ends up with another Oscar nod for this character. The action that is in this film delivers on every level really keeping you the edge of your seat and racking up the body count.<br/><br/>Skyfall more than makes up for the issues with Quantum of Solace and even improves on what made Casino Royale so great. In addition to the expected current look and feel of the series, this time around they have added some classic elements that will make any hardcore Bond fan smile taking this film into a whole new level. If there were any doubts about his staying power it will easily be dispelled with Skyfall as Daniel Craig is James Bond and cannot wait to see what they have in store next."
"rgkarim","8","7","18","9 November 2012"," For Me Much Better than Quantum
","This weekend the latest Bond film released and from the reports seems to already making nice money. For this reviewer though, my excitement was relatively low after watching Quatum of Solace so many years ago. Still a couple of friends and I caught the afternoon showing with the hopes that the franchise would make up for their previous work. I'm happy to say that our hopes were not dashed as Skyfall impressed us and renewed our faith in the series. If you're up for hearing my highlights read on as we dive into Daniel Craig's latest film. <br/><br/>For those who have been in the dark, Skyfall starts with Bond (Craig) on another adrenaline fueled mission to recover a hard drive containing all the agents' identity. As seen in the trailer, a fellow agent named Eve (Naomie Harris) follows orders and supposedly send James down the river. However, like an ignorant stain that Bond returns once more after a threat to M (Judi Dench) 's life. The culprit of this crime is a rogue agent by the name of Silva (Javier Bardem)who has a personal vendetta to take out the head of MI6, in hopes of achieving his insane goals. <br/><br/>The summary of the trailer is pretty much the story of this film, so don't expect too many twists and turns to come up in this film. It's simply a plot for revenge for previous acts, that while fun and quick really lacks any Bond Finesse. Those seeking the classic spy mystery and information gathering may be disappointed, as this Bond continues to move towards the action franchise. However, there is a bit of backstory to help keep things interesting, as we uncover more of James' past, and learn a little more about the dark side of M, at least pertaining to Silva. A few other events unfold in the movie, but most of them I saw coming from the earlier events in the movie. Perhaps the only thing you might be wondering in this movie is the tie in to the title, as every bond movie has some connection to it. <br/><br/>Don't really care about the complexity of the story? Well then do you care about action, because this movie has got it going on. Bond's move have gotten more bad@$$ as he ages, trading in the typical one shot running kills, for a little more martial arts and more intense shootouts. Want proof? Okay, the first ten minutes of the movie is an intense chase, mixed with a touch of shooting, a little ingenuity, and a pinch of a fist fight all brilliantly captured to keep you in the loop. I was on the edge of my seat with excitement as I watched everything unfold, appreciating the fast pace to start the film off with a bang. The only downfall was that after such a pumping start, you feel the crash afterward, but not for too long as the action continued to occur throughout the movie. While all of them have impressive moves, these scenes are only a fraction of the time. For me these were small doses that led up to the grand finale at the end, that were just enough to break away from the dry conversation, but not overdone to have you rolling your eyes. Patience pays off though, as the final scene is filled with enough ingenuity, stunts, and suspense to reward the audience. <br/><br/>Putting the action aside, Skyfall takes a few nostalgic turns back in time that fans will appreciate. The dialog itself contained a few classic lines that will make you chuckle, or at least make you respect the movie even more. Putting the bond references to the side, Skyfall's dialog is just funny itself, as the rivalry between the characters provides openings for insults, sarcasm, and other quips to keep one entertained. However, the biggest Bond nostalgia comes in the gadgets, but I'm not really going to say much as I'll ruin it. Regardless, keep your eyes open as I'm sure there are plenty of things I missed that others will pick up. <br/><br/>As for the acting, well it's pretty much the same as the previous installments, good. Although not as suave or elegant as some of his predecessors, Craig has the killer edge to make him a good agent. I was impressed not only with his moves, but also his ability to deliver his quips with just enough emphasis to make his intentions known. Dench as well stays strong to the role, using her British background to keep the pride of the old program head alive. Like Craig, she too has just the right emotion in her words to make it feel real, and not an overacted dribble, though fans might not expect to see her fight, which was a surprise to me. Continuing on Bardem did a good job playing an emotionally disturbed, though creepy bad guy. His voice in particular had the calm collected edge to give you the creeps without going into a screaming rant, or some other stereotypical villain. Unfortunately, the directors made his calling card a little too plain for my tastes, which took the edge off of this villain for me. Well that and the fact he didn't do much other than send in thugs, and do computer hacking, which although smart was a little less flashy from the other villains. <br/><br/>Skyfall is perhaps the first bond movie in a long time I would go see again. With a fast paced story, lots of action, and countless classic references this movie is a nice balance and a good step up. My only hope is with all the changes this one makes, there will be new challenges they will have to face. There is still plenty of things to say, but I'm reaching my limit so to wrap it up: it's worth seeing in theaters. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Crime: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0"

"twentystcenturychristian","6","7","18","31 October 2012"," Skyflop?
","Plot? What plot? I've seen bigger plots in our local allotments, and they probably cost more than the budget for Skyfall's script. I just don't get where all the rave reviews are coming from. Skyfall is what I would call a washing-line film - lots of big impressive scenes hung together on a very thin story. It is rather sad that James Bond has succumbed to Hollywood's current formula for creating a 'block-buster' by stitching together evermore jaw-dropping set pieces in the hope of convincing you that you've seen a 'great film.' However, the lack of compelling story not-withstanding, Skyfall is still a good entertaining watch simply because of the excellent direction by Sam Mendes, the superb photography and spectacular special effects. One fight scene in particular was utterly mesmerising. I'm not giving anything away if I say that the two undoubted stars of the film are a wonderfully evil villain and a car – between them they just about manage to raise Skyfall to rank just above your average shoot-'em-up/blow-'em-up FX thriller. UPDATE: Just watched the Blu-ray again. I thought I'd give it another chance in case I'd missed something... my opinion about the film stands. It's no Diamonds Are Forever."
"moviexclusive","10","9","25","28 October 2012"," A perfectly timed high watermark for the series, 'Skyfall' ups the action, drama, and stakes for Bond to deliver its best entry yet
","Fifty years after Bond's first screen outing, 'Skyfall' represents a remarkable high watermark for the series, a truly stunning masterpiece that counts as one of the best, if not the best, Bond films we've seen. It is also so because it is quite unlike any of the Bond films thus far, delving into his origins as well as his relationship with Moneypenny for its most character-driven addition yet. The showy action and authentically British wit are as sharp as ever, but what makes 'Skyfall' stand out is how surprisingly riveting the drama is.<br/><br/>Kudos to returning writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, together with Oscar-winning scribe John Logan, who have expertly tapped into today's real-world fears for a tense and thrilling story that spans three continents. Beginning in Istanbul, we are dropped into an operation that's already unfolding – the recovery of a pilfered hard disk drive that contains the names of every single NATO-allied spy embedded in terrorist organisations around the world. Bond is on the chase, paired with fellow agent Eve (Naomie Harris), but predictably it goes south, leaving the disk in the wrong hands and Bond presumed dead by MI6.<br/><br/>Then without allowing you to catch your breath following that firecracker of an opening, the MI6 headquarters is rocked by an explosion, and M's computer is hacked into with an ominous message 'think on your sins'. Of course, 'Skyfall' isn't the first to envision a scenario where our once hallowed security institutions are compromised from within, but that nightmarish 'what-if' is depicted so realistically here you can't quite help but feel unnerved.<br/><br/>His country and company under attack, Bond returns from seclusion to hunt down the perpetrator, a chase which leads him to Shanghai, then Macau, then a desolate island and finally back to London. Halfway between that globe-trotting manhunt, Bond is finally acquainted with his nemesis, Silva (Javier Bardem). Right from his superb one-take opening where he saunters up to Bond with an extended speech about cannibalistic rats and the inversion of the natural order, Silva proves to be smart, menacing and eerily unpredictable.<br/><br/>Unlike the caricatured Bond villains, Silva isn't filled with delusions of grandeur to destroy the world – his purpose is as personal as it gets, involving a bit of nasty history with M, and not unlike that which Bond has to confront himself. 'Skyfall' is the first to allow Judi Dench to flex her acting chops - and the thespian seizes the opportunity to deliver a first-rate performance with dignity and poignancy.<br/><br/>It's not just M who needs to confront her demons; for the first time in the franchise's history, its suave and confident character is made to confront his as well. Continuing with his grittier transformation that began with Martin Campbell's notable 'Casino Royale' and subsequently Marc Forster's underwhelming followup 'Quantum of Solace', Bond is here even more human than he has ever been. <br/><br/>And yet it is precisely this change that is likely to make Bond an even more convincing hero than he ever was to today's audiences – as Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' saga has shown, it's not nearly enough that our big-screen heroes save the day, we need to know that they can bleed and hurt on the outside as much as inside. Bond's struggle to find conviction, purpose and meaning allows his audience to develop a deep emotional investment with the character.<br/><br/>Certainly, this is a film with big ambitions – it wants not only to pay tribute to the Bond films of the past, but also to rejuvenate the franchise for another jubilee. Thankfully, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes manages to preserve the Bond iconography and redefine the franchise's traits. After sitting out the last two movies, Q (or Quartermaster) is back, but in the form of a younger geek played by Ben Whishaw. Mendes also introduces what is likely to be a new recurring character in Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), a bureaucrat brought in to make M accountable for MI6's mistakes who later becomes a surprising ally. <br/><br/>Mendes too has made this an actor's film, and nowhere in the history of the franchise will you find a better performed film. Every actor is perfectly cast, but two are especially worthy of singular mention. First is Javier Bardem, who injects pizazz and menace into his villainous role that is showy without being cartoony and edgy without being over-the-top. And then of course there is Daniel Craig, who in his third outing, truly makes the character his very own. More assured than he has ever been, Craig brings class, style, grit, temperance, determination and courage to make his Bond the most complex and captivating one we've seen yet.<br/><br/>Even with the dramatic additions, Mendes knows the Bond fans need cool action – and just from the heart-stopping opening sequence in Istanbul, he lets you know that he is committed to the task. While its globe- trotting nature might invite similarities to 'Bourne', Mendes applies a much more expansive scope to the action without any of that shaky camera-work, so trust us when we say that the sequences here are simply exhilarating. In fact, the movie pulses with its own energy and momentum from start to finish, and despite running at more than two hours, you'd wish it could go on for longer.<br/><br/>That sentiment is also how you know that producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have succeeded in transiting James Bond from an old- school action hero to a contemporary one. Not only does it mark a turning point for the character, it also is for the franchise as a whole – and 'Skyfall' couldn't have arrived at a better time to breathe new life into 007. The wit, the action, the style are all as intact as ever after 50 years, but the drama is new, fresh and spellbinding - even if this Bond is older, he is also wiser and better than ever before."
"Aniviel2","9","10","29","27 October 2012"," I was afraid...
","...very afraid that all the hype would be just that. From the opening scene in Turkey, to the wonderful theme song, sung and written by Adele, to the vulnerability of both Bond and M, (and the incredible acting by Daniel Craig and Judi Dench), to the many nods and references to past Bonds (which had me laughing aloud, or squealing like a giddy schoolgirl), to the deliciously creepy and insane villain played brilliantly by Xavier Bardem, this is probably going to end up being my favourite Bond film of all, and I have seen every one of them at least once.<br/><br/>If you want OTT gadgets, exotic locations, and a parody of a 007, then go stick on a DVD of Moore or Brosnan and leave the good stuff to us who love the gritty realism.<br/><br/>Oh, and I can't have been the only person of an age with Bond who was thinking exactly the same thing when he met Q - lol!"
"rebecca-ry","9","10","29","27 October 2012"," Best action, best villain, best film
","'Skyfall' is the third Bond film starring Daniel Craig – it also marks the 50th anniversary of James Bond in cinema. There are lots of delightful little old references to classic Bond films with lots of old gadgets, gags, cars and theme song. <br/><br/>The script is well-written; it's an interesting story focusing more on M than Bond. It can be a bit confusing because it's moving at such as fast pace but it does all make sense and you don't struggle to keep up with it. Like 'Casino Royale', it began with a great action sequence and an even greater title sequence. The middle of the film is interesting and there is a decent amount of gripping classic Bond scenes but at some points it can lose momentum and lag a bit. However, the ending is brilliant with a fantastic finishing action sequence and a great last scene to make us all look forward to Bond 24.<br/><br/>The acting is very good; Daniel Craig returns as Bond and provides the same quality of performance as he brought in the past two films. Judi Dench features a lot more in this film and gives a great performance. Bond girls Naomi Harris and Berenice Marlohe are great and are probably the best of the Craig series so far. However, Bond villain Javier Bardem definitely stole the show; he gave a fantastic performance and was genuinely creepy. He may be type-cast after fantastic performances in this and in 'No Country for Old Men' but he fully deserves to be up there with the best Bond villains. The only problem was that he simply wasn't in it enough! <br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic film and has already been called one of the best Bond films ever. It's the first recent Bond film that hasn't tried to be like a Bourne film so hopefully the three planned future Bond films will take heed of this. A truly excellent film that everyone should see, a great piece of cinema that could even get awards attention due to both the performances and the script."

","(this is spoiler-free as I realise most people won't have seen this yet.)<br/><br/>Oh. my. word.<br/><br/>Skyfall is amazing.<br/><br/>It is Bond. It is Bond with heart, with character. Bond with armour and without. It is a throwback to the classic Bond, a standing ovation to the earliest Bonds - and yet modern, fresh, gritty, brutal. You *feel* things in Skyfall. Bond feels things, like in CR - but unlike CR which was Bond becoming Bond, here we have Bond as Bond - witty, debonair,charming, dangerous, a man who lives in the shadows and occasionally puts on a front of lightness. <br/><br/>It is a more personal, character-driven film - but with superb action and AMAZING cinematography (seriously - some of the images in this film put Nolan's films in the shade!). The pre-credit sequence (yes, it's back) is worth the price of admission alone. <br/><br/>In one way CR was like a break from the old Bonds. It was a fresh start and the stench of Ye Old Bonde had to be washed off. But now in Skyfall it's all grown up, and so can appreciate it's roots - like a teenager realising their parents aren't always wrong.<br/><br/>It is brilliant. Go and see it. It's fantastic. (And if it wasn't Bond, it would win an Oscar or three. As it is, it may just yet - it's that good)<br/><br/>Welcome back Mr. Bond."
"Munster1979","3","6","15","5 March 2013"," The worst Bond ever!
","""Skyfall"" is properly the worst bond-movie I've seen and I think I've seen them all! You can separate the movie into two halves: the first half spreads a bit of the good old Bond-flair but still is pretty boring; the second half gets really bad! It seems like they already had an end to the story but noticed that the whole movie is to short and added a second half from a different script. While watching the second half I felt like I was watching an average action-flick, something like ""Die Hard 4 1/2"", but not an Bond-movie anymore. And please: no more hacker guys who're able to open every door around them by hitting some keys on their computer keyboard! That's such a bulls***!"

","I don't know why many people hates so much Skyfall i found this movie perfect except from action, yeah it has barely 20% action as we comparing to Casino Royale. You will enjoy first scene from the movie like any others.<br/><br/>It's a different kind of James bond movie, all others 22 movies is one side and this one is other one side and this movie describes the Bond's past as well.<br/><br/>In the first scene Bond has been shot by eve so, the whole MI6 thinks that the Bond has been dead but actually he isn't he came back after few days but not actually that fit (maybe this is reason of less action).The movie plot is good, role of villain played by Javier Bardem (Silva) who is the former agent of MI6 and he wants revenge from M. So, the movie is about that the Silva wants to kill M whereas Bond's loyalty comes to save M from Silva.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is quiet boring but you will definitely enjoy the second half. This flick is all about the Bond if you love Bond (Daniel Craig) than you will love this movie. In the end they changed all the staff of MI6 like M, Q and Money penny (eve).<br/><br/>So, I think (expect) that the Bond-24 (2014) has more action than this movie and a good plot too. I gave 8/10 just cut 2 marks of action and just looking forward to Bond-24."

","I can not really be very original with my review, and most likely this will get lost under a ""mountain-slide"" of critics, however I just had to write how much I enjoyed this film. I have watched (like all movie goers) all the Bond films, and I think Daniel is one of the great ones. Connery has always been a favorite of mine, he gave Bond style and portrayed him as invincible. Almost like a super hero who fights for good. Shiny, Clean but Unreal. Craig has adapted the character to the modern age and has given him weaknesses and depth. I really like this approach. I always thought that Bond should have a human side too.<br/><br/>Regarding the ""reset"" of the franchise, I think that this is a brilliant idea. Whomever thought of that, is truly the future and last hope of Hollywood. What the movies need are not special effects, but people with original ideas.

"may_ustb","10","6","15","9 December 2012"," Great chemistry between Bond and Sévérine
","From the story itself, I don't think its well conceived as it's nothing new actually. A hard disk was lost and Bond was on a mission to get it back. He traveled to Shanghai, Macau, London and finally Scotland to defend his country,M and his belief. The bad guy was a victim of M's previous peace deal and had resources to blow off the MI6 head office and anything he wanted to destry or get in the world, unless Bond stopped him. And we all know that Bond would eventually kill the bad guy, no matter how many heartbroken losses we have seen, such as the terrifying death of Sévérine.<br/><br/>Yet, what struck me is the chemistry between Bond and Sévérine. She trusted Bond and Bond proved worthy of her trust. They spoke the same language, such as their talk about fear and Beretta. They were made for each other. I personally thought it was a significant regret that she died of a terrifying death.<br/><br/>Sévérine radiated such a stunning oriental beauty that I initially thought she were a Chinese actress. I liked her mystic accent, elegance and of course, the patent vulnerability of Bond Girl. I'm expecting the French actress to be more active on stage, and I highly recommend Chinese directors to consider this French lady for any upcoming international cooperations."
"mformoviesandmore","4","6","15","19 November 2012"," Lazy movie making

Then he pops up at M's place. Haven't we had that bit before? <br/><br/>Silly ideas from X-men, Bourne Trilogy and others. <br/><br/>Stupid CGI effects. <br/><br/>Poor acting. <br/><br/>That was the first half of the movie. I don't care if I never see the second half.<br/><br/>As a Bond movie I would give this a rating of 1 out of 10 (Javier Badem at least looked like he tried).<br/><br/>As a general movie it probably rates a 4 as a straight-to-DVD flick of the level Claude Van Damme used to be in."
"SamGGD","3","6","15","19 November 2012"," You fools are easily impressed.
","Mixing things up and changing the formula of a popular franchise, doesn't equal a good movie. Casino Royale was a blast, Quantum was a let down. I expected a return to form, I don't know what happened.<br/><br/>The opening scene was terrific, I was drawn in immediately. I loved the Bond sequence along with Adele's bond theme too. However, the opening scene ends with Bond unconscious underwater after being shot and falling 50-100 feet. The next time we see Bond he's alive and how he survived is never explained. Okay...<br/><br/>That aside, the film was still flowing well, until we were introduced to the beautiful Sévérine, whose character was completely irrelevant. She's set up as the Bond girl. Bond tells her he'll save her and everything, and she just dies very suddenly. I guess it was for shock factor, and because it's different. That doesn't make it good, however.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd be able to look by these things if the rest of the film was good. But it wasn't. Lazy decisions and pretentious shots of Bond trying to come across ""deep"". The whole plot was basically about some nut trying to kill M. Really? That's your best idea? It's as if the writers were thinking ""what's never been done before? Ahh, we'll make it personal. We'll have a nice emotional scene by killing off a big character (M) and we'll visit Bond's roots. Then people will love it!"" It goes from a Bond film to bloody Home Alone! Setting booby traps in Bond's home. It was ridiculous. Anyway, it's as if the writers thought their work was done after coming up with that rubbish. They should have focused more on a better plot, as well as the characters. We need a memorable villain. Has any of the villains in the new Bond movies been memorable? I think Jaws is a little more memorable than Silva. Everything about this film was just completely forgettable. Don't get me wrong, we didn't have much of a villain in Casino Royale either, but that was still a solid film. Brilliant actually. Then it all went downhill after Casino Royale. I don't know what happened. This film had potential, but was let down by a lazy, and simply dreadful script.<br/><br/>""This is the best Bond yet!"" - Shut. Up."

I have been so pleased with Daniel Craig's turns as Bond - even in QofS. Now all the pieces so carefully placed fall in line. This is the most ""full-on Bond"" of the Craig movies. One hears familiar themes, sees familiar characters, and falls back in love with the familiar formula. AT last we have a worthy opponent again - Javier Bardem is a hoot, and almost runs away with the movie. But only almost. Craig settles into the role even better, and Judi Densch is, as usual, pitch-perfect. The movie looks as a Bond movie should - gorgeous, elegant, with every dollar right there on the screen. Shanghai is especially striking, as is an Istanbul chase with Hagia Sophia in the background. We've got a new Q and two new someone elses, all of which I think I approve. Music's good, sacrificial Bond girl appropriately hot, and my beloved Aston Martin DB is there, so I think we're all set. Go see it immediately!"

I didn't feel that his usual suave relationship that he usually has with his female co-stars was there which to me is a big part of what makes James Bond who he is. Everyone seemed to be acting their part but something was missing. I never once felt on the edge of my seat or caught up in the moment. I don't think that Sam Mendes should really direct a movie with so much action and intrigue. But, in spite of this I'd still watch it again as I'm a huge Bond fan."
"aayush-vij","9","6","15","10 November 2012"," Bo(r)nd Again!
","2012 marks the 50th anniversary of 'Dr. No', the film which first marked the appearance of the iconic MI6 agent James Bond. Six actors and 23 films later, Bond still remains a cultural icon across the world and from Connery to Craig, almost every film has been a treat to watch. <br/><br/>So does Sam Mendes''Skyfall' fall in that category? Hell yes it does! And it successfully wipes our memory of the disappointing 'Quantum Of Solace' which I was sincerely hoping was not the last appearance of Bond due to MGM's troubles that followed.<br/><br/>The film begins with a thrilling chase sequence in Istanbul (which, I believe has been shot to death in action films this year after 'Taken 2' and 'Ek Tha Tiger') which involves Bond (Daniel Craig) and field agent Eve (Naomie Harris)in pursuit of a mercenary who has stolen a hard drive which contains the information on undercover MI6 agents. When an accident following a fight upon a train happens, Bond is presumed to be dead. Soon after, M (Dame Judi Dench) is politely asked to retire by the Intelligence Committee chairman, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). However, M is forced to confront her past after an attack on the MI6 headquarters in London brings Bond back in action. What follows after is a roller coaster ride of a film,anything of which to be given away would be a crime. <br/><br/>Speaking of the cast, Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are top-notch and have possibly given their best shot at it as their respective characters. Naomie Harris and Ralph Fiennes do their jobs adequately. Another wonderful addition to the cast is Ben Whishaw, who portrays 'Q' in a rather different and an interesting way than what we have seen of the character in previous films. But the standout performer who steals (rather,sweeps!) the film away is Javier Bardem as the film's main antagonist, the cyberterrorist Silva. He is perfect in every scene, perfectly creepy, perfectly menacing, never under or overdoing anything. In fact, I'll go as far as to say that his performance is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Heath Ledger's Joker in 'The Dark Knight'.<br/><br/>Technically, this is a flawless film with every action sequence making it worth a re-watch. The score is astounding and Adele's 'Let the Sky Fall' from the opening credits sequence is very easy on the ears. Also, this one has possibly the best opening credits sequence in Bond history from a visual perspective. <br/><br/>But the film has it's flaws as well,minor, but flaws nevertheless. The final act is somewhat underwhelming and does not match the awesomeness of the first two. Fans of the Roger Moore/Sean Connery era may not like the film, because there aren't really many scenes involving quintessential Bond elements. However,Mendes does make sure to feature those along with presenting a gritty, realistic 007. This film is probably the first one to touch upon Bond's past and how he came to be. More importantly, it addresses the question 'Is James Bond relevant in today's age, or is he a relic of the past?' Find that out for yourself. Do NOT miss 'Skyfall'!"
"rickblaine34","6","6","15","5 November 2012"," Skyfall is not a real Bond movie
","Skyfall was probably the worst Bond movie I've ever seen, except for maybe Moonraker in which Bond actually goes to outer space - come on you cannot beat that in epic failures - and for On Her Majesty's Secret Service which ends with the villain shooting Bond's wife right after their wedding. (what was even more intolerable then the ending was George Lazenby's acting) It just didn't have enough content and material to be a movie, was more like a lenghtened episode from a spy series. As opposed to many, I did not like Javier Bardem as the villain, he can play a terrific villain if he wants to, look at No Country For Old Men, he just couldn't deliver here, still seemed to me like Juan Antonio Gonzalo from Vicky Cristina Barcelona, one of Bardem's finer hours. Skyfall is a celebration of all things British, it is a celebration of England actually and I don't have a problem with that especially since it is the 50 th anniversary of Bond, nothing wrong with returning to your origins and paying tribute to the old 007s. But have too much of that stuff and you just overdo it, turn the movie into half a documentary. All in all, Skyfall might be a nostalgic feel-good action movie especially for the Brits but it's not a real Bond movie."
"divinours","5","6","15","5 November 2012"," Sometimes old things work best...
","As they say in the movie, sometimes old things work best. The makers of this film should have heeded their own advice and stuck to the good old Bond recipe (mainly action with a touch of English class). Instead they tried to flesh out characters that were never really designed to be profound in the first place, and to give them existential qualms. The result is better than the last Batman movie, where the same thing was attempted, but is still seriously flawed. It's not a real Bond movie anymore, but it does not do a good enough job with the characters and plot to make it into the group of intellectually stimulating movies...<br/><br/>__Main pros__: <br/><br/><ul><li>The general theme of aging and obsolescence in a quickly evolving world is very consistently developed throughout the movie - first and foremost by Craig's interpretation of an aging, depressed Bond, but also through the choice of locations (Battleship island, the old Scottish manor), the allusions to previous Bond movies (Goldfinger, Goldeneye), the replacement of Q by a smart but inexperienced youngster, the absence of gadgets, the depressing, stereotypical English rain... This consistency gives a nice atmosphere to the movie that makes it enjoyable to watch even through its slow parts.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The photography is great, and so are the locations (Battleship Island!), though they feel somewhat underused.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The directing is also very good. The first 10 minutes are classic Bond material, and are followed by a very nice opening sequence despite the rather weak Adele song - at that point I had high hopes for the movie. The final fight is also well executed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Great acting by Javier Bardem, despite the weirdness of his character.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We get rid of Dench! But Fiennes is wasted on M - he would make a much better Bond than Craig IMO.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A touch of humor - this is an essential element of the Bond recipe and was sorely lacking in the last few installments.</li></ul><br/><br/>__Main cons__: <br/><br/><ul><li>The plot is weak, even by Bond standards! The oh-so-important list of undercover agents is forgotten halfway through the movie. The villain's motives are not believable. Bond's plan of luring Silva and his goons to Skyfall knowing that he will have to face them with a few antique rifles and an old Scottish housekeeper makes no sense whatsoever.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The movie is at least 30 minutes too long. The middle part lacks action and feels drawn out.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Many elements seem arbitrary and out of place: Silva's homosexual innuendo to which Bond replies that it might not be his first time (and actually sounds serious too! Bond, the epitome of heterosexuality who has been screwing the most beautiful girls for 50 years!), the underused, underdeveloped Bond girl who just has the time for a quick shower before dying after 10 minutes of airtime, the subway crash scene...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The hacking scenes. Make them believable for heaven's sake! Especially since they are a replacement for Q's gadgets in previous movies...</li></ul><br/><br/>All in all, the movie does not live up to the hype - exactly like the last Batman. Oh, and also like Prometheus. I'm starting to see a trend here..."

","Before and during the ""reboot"", the problem with the franchise was the number of close competitors. It actually started with ""xXx"", but continued more obviously with Jason Bourne, Batman, Mission Impossible and to some extent even with the recent Judge Dredd. The solo hero, not well understood, effectively battling himself or versions of himself.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes had every reason to admire Christopher Nolan, and what he did with the excellent Batman movies. The problem with Skyfall is that Mendes has come to Bond as a viewer, maybe a fan, but not a director. He has produced a modern action film that takes elements of what he likes, but has utterly failed to churn out a Bond film.<br/><br/>It was rather strangely paced, and we know it was ""fucked"" by the writers strike, but Quantum of Solace was every inch 007. The very euro chic of an opera used as a backdrop to a perverted auction, the henchmen having just as much character as the villain, Bond following leads with varying success etc. And the presence of a fallen woman who isn't trying to be his mother.<br/><br/>Skyfall had all the elements in position at the start, but started to trade them away for gems from other films. A villain who thought he was the Joker, and in an Avengers plot. Hacking shenanigans from Die Hard, an ending from Home Alone. Even the classic pay off from someone using Dredd's Lawgiver. <br/><br/>The various plot holes which have been very well aired elsewhere were ultimately a product of losing focus because of so much borrowing. Mendes needs to stop being a fan, and become a director again. Apart from the lazy one note performance from Naomie Harris, there is no reason to assume Mendes cannot use his undoubted skills to work on a piece that fulfils the genre as well as innovates where it is required."

","I had watched this movie at its midnight screening and oddly enough I found it to be better than the other two Daniel Craig rendition of the man with a license to kill. That might be because of its director Sam Mendes (Academy award winner for American Beauty-2000) who actually tries to tell a story instead of making a mishmash of action and chase sequences, putting in a couple of really beautiful women, and of course the inevitable and implausible bond villains. It still has all that but this time it seems to have a coherent story line. If you have followed the work of Mendes over his career, you will be aware that he is a consummate storyteller and thats where Skyfall is different from its predecessors. It actually tell a story. It has a very stylized cinematography and has been shot in exotic locales. It has some surprise elements which will affect future Bond films (I am trying very hard not to give away spoilers). It also sheds a lot of insight into the origin of the man we have come to love and admire.<br/><br/>My only concern was the misuse of Javier Bardem as the villain Raoul Silva. Make no mistake,he is a brilliant actor but he seems to be miscast. His attempts to portray a megalomania-cal villain fit for the Bond genre fall flat as I believe his part was not well written. He tries to do justice to it but ultimately fails. Its a pity, as he was one of the primary reasons I went to watch the movie. And Adele's version of the opening track reminds us of the Shirley Bassey songs of yore (Goldfinger anybody???). Overall its a very interesting watch and its value for money."

The best part of the entire movie was the intro! still a bit flashy and over zealous in it's approach mimicking the Goldeneye intro or Casino Royale but going way overboard. Great song for Bond intros just wished they had toned all the mirrored images and obvious spoiling of the main sequences in the movie. I would rather watch Die Hard for some asshole shooting people with a vengeance. The plot was so watered down it made me think a high school kid wrote it.

","The movie is worth watching only for the special effects which are well done, which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, the NUMEROUS repetitive plot holes, weak acting, and non-Bondishness of the entire story just make it silly.<br/><br/>Plot holes and continuity problems - these have already been pointed out by other reviewers and I can only confirm them. Worst ones IMO - how does Raoul Silva escape from a locked guarded glass cage back at MI6 and kill two armed guards when he is dressed only in a jumpsuit and has no weapons? And how does Q, the most brilliant computer mind in the UK, allow all of MI6 to get hacked?<br/><br/>The implication of Bond being either gay or bisexual subtracted from the story. I am not homophobic but this was a ridiculous premise, added less than nothing to the story, and made an already weak script even worse. Ian Fleming is rolling in his grave. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig COULD make a good Bond, but he needs a director who can pull some emotion out of him instead of constantly being a block of wood.<br/><br/>Judi Dench turned in probably the worst acting performance in her career in this movie. So much so that her death at the end was almost welcome.<br/><br/>The one bright spot in the movie was Naomi Harris. Spot on performance from her.<br/><br/>It's an okay action movie with a non-substantive plot and dullard acting. However, it misses so many of the traditional Bond familiarities that it is not deserving of being called a Bond movie."

The whole movie is about a guy hunting M, but M has no guards at all, not even in a parliamentary hearing. She doesn't even have a generic ADT alarm system in her house. Mysterious hacking is used to explain how a villain who is kept in a super secret secure glass cell escaped and killed armed guards and crashed a train through a subway tunnel. Not even to mention blowing up MI6 HQ which apparently anyone with a laptop and Verizon Fios can do now a days.<br/><br/>After all the crap the Bond and M go through, Bond's most brilliant idea to escape Javier Bardem's oddly creepy Silva, is to go out into the country, without telling any of their allies, and playing Home Alone 5 with NO GUNS, NO EXPLOSIVES, and NO BACKUP. They easily could have just hidden M in a safe house (without a computer controlled gas line/built in terrorist self destructor button) and surrounded her with all the double 0 agents or something.<br/><br/>What a turd of a film, and BTW in case you wondered what happened to Mr. White and the nefarious QUANTUM organization...

One of the worst movies I've ever seen and a colossal waste of time, two plus hours of my life gone that I'll never get back.<br/><br/>I don't know why I'm writing this, it's probably not worth my time to review such a horrible movie, but the two plus hours I invested in watching Skyfall was even worse, and I hope I can spare someone the experience and wasted time.<br/><br/>I watched the movie with a friend and neither of us liked the movie at all, in fact, he said it was ""not his kind of Bond movie"", and ""one of the worst Bond films ever made"" and I commented, ""forget worst Bond films, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen."" Neither of us even wanted to finish the movie, but just sat through it because I suppose we didn't want to feel as though we missed the ending and possibly felt the need to see it again. Suffice it to say, neither of us will ever watch this movie again. In fact, I suppose I am writing this review as a kind of catharsis to rid myself of the dissatisfaction and disturbing feeling of having seen this horrible film. I need to get it out of my system and be done with it.<br/><br/>First let me tell you that, in spite of the plot being incredibly simple, particularly for a Bond film, the entire movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense, was all over the place, and in my humble opinion, is completely preposterous. It was also very, very, slow, with very little action or suspense which I believe the director was going for. Speaking of the Director, Sam Mendes, I have seen and enjoyed some of his earlier films, particularly American Beauty and Road to Perdition, but this film was just a complete failure.<br/><br/>I would try to detail some of the plot(which I did somewhat understand) and try to give my analysis, but I feel it's really not worth it.

"boneugen","3","5","12","21 April 2013"," Sadness prevailing
","It's a double edged spaghetti we are dealing with here. On one side, this movie is beyond any doubt the signal for the end of the Craig-generated Bond's career. On the other side, one can only hope that the future Bond will manage to be more light-hearted than this incarnation. Since Casino Royale, this series confirmed itself to be a more dark, morose, heartbroken, you-name-it member of the 007 installment. It's not that Craig lacked any charisma, quite the opposite. But his tuff guy persona simply didn't fit too well within the general picture. And on Skyfall, his character's rigid and relatively introverted personality (manky childhood checked and so on) is stunningly complemented by the general anticlimactic and dusty tone. This is the most adequate term to define this movie, in my opinion - anticlimactic. Maybe the heartbroken and introverted Bond would have been as good as any other, should this movie have struggled to achieve higher standards in terms of plot, scenery and so on. But instead, all you get is a rather unconvincing master plan from an ex-007 to whack MI6, abnormally restrained action (the fight scenes don't stand out as very impressive - the dynamics haven't been pumped up too much), and a wide technological gap. It's not that kind of old-school Bond that would pay a visit every now and then to the secret laboratory to see what kind of secret razorburgers the scientists of MI6 had manufactured in order to help him slice a terrorist's pants. Not remotely. No cars, no nothing... It's like a wasteland of the 007 franchise. That doesn't mean that it gets close to a new philosophical plane, it's as superficial as it gets. The actors' performances were quite solid, arguably with the exception of Bardem's slice (won't bug you with his flaws, but after hearing him in several lines you'll get to hate the sounds from the Pac Man game - beep!bloop!blap!).<br/><br/>Grosso modo, a misguided and highly disposable movie. If this franchise is to carry on, it will certainly need new conceptions - maybe a sunnier Bond, maybe a more engaging take on the plot and more thought in the scenery, maybe all of them (best case)."

","Not sure why this film has such a high average rating. <br/><br/>I thought it was a fairly mediocre, boilerplate Bond film. First hour was fairly interesting and well paced, but then the second really dragged on and I thought the pacing was really too slow. They could probably have taken out at least half an hour of footage without detracting from the storyline. <br/><br/>Not quite I got the Bardem character's motivation. Basically, he was an MI6 agent who was caught and then his suicide capsule didn't work, so he did a complete 180 and became a villain ? That doesn't make any sense to me. It's like if Superman decided to become a villain because he had a really bad day. <br/><br/>Craig is a very good actor, but the problem with Bond films in general is that it's already so over the top that unless you're able to find just the right balance, it comes off as machismo buffoonery. <br/><br/>By the halfway point, I had mostly lost interest in the storyline and watched it mostly to find out what eventually happened. <br/><br/>The story itself seemed fairly boilerplate and not terribly creative or well done. <br/><br/>As a side note, the female lead, Berenice Marlohe, was both stunningly gorgeous and a superb actress."

","I usually get to see Bond's at the cinema and have the big DVD boxset of all the Bond's up to the last, A Quantum of Solace. I missed Skyfall at the flicks and so when my local Tesco had it at ten to midnight, for £10, it was mine.<br/><br/>And I watched straight away. Bond's still aren't perfect and never will be - we all have different expectations on both who Bond is now, who he should be and how well Daniel Craig is portraying him.<br/><br/>For a start, no Bond will make total sense, which is good, you cannot have a 007 that isn't slightly barmy, fantastical and at least a bit macho. Sexism has largely gone, which suits the modern audience and the interplay between Judi Dench as 'M' and Craig is hypnotic. Others may find it incredulous. But, let's face it, Dame Judi can out-act anything and make it seem real, which is really what this milarky called acting is all about.<br/><br/>Brit director (American Beauty his best to date) has done a superb job, mixing an incredibly exciting, totally implausible opening, from which 007 cannot possibly recover, to big sweeping and (obviously) expensive locational shoots. The Shanghai set scenes are amazing and immediately make you want to go there.<br/><br/>There's an occasional and knowing irony and self-mocking of 'old' Bond, that's as dry as his shaken (not stirred!) vodka tonics, which are both clever and reassuring, aiding continuity within the franchise. Young Ben Wishaw makes for an unexpected (I had no idea) and effective 'Q', again keeping the franchise fresh and open to new story developments in the future.<br/><br/>The prerequisite Bond baddie is taken up by a quite weird Javier Badem, all peroxide blonde...! whilst Ralph Fiennes is supremely suited as MI6 Top Brass. The girls are all beautiful (of course) and Adele's title song (and having just won a BAFTA) is big on presence and stature - a very worthy addition to that title of Bond Theme.<br/><br/>Albert Finney is almost unrecognisable as a white bearded old Scotsman, defending a castle, in Scotland, where the film ends, in a rather Western style sort of shoot-out. I won't say any more on this!<br/><br/>I, personally, thoroughly enjoyed every single minute of Skyfall. I expected to and I wasn't disappointed. I'll watch it again within a few days, guaranteed!"
"lilantman10","8","5","12","31 January 2013"," Good movie, classic Bond maybe
","I've never been a big fan of certain franchises that people love. Lord Of The Rings, Star Wars, and James Bond come to mind. While I respect and give praise to all 3 I just don't quite understand the love. Probably because I've never seen most of them and when i do the hype makes my expectations too high. Ironically I've seen every single Daniel Craig Bond movie and my enjoyment is also mixed. While Casino Royale is a fantastic movie, it left me cold. It's me not you principal. This is along the lines of Casino Royale and while it's always tempting to compare the two, i'd say they're at the same level. Skyfall is bigger and more personal, Casino Royale is tighter and more specific. That being said Skyfall also left me cold. I can't help but think that if i had went in with no expectations i would've loved it more. But once again that's my fault not the movies.<br/><br/>The good. WOW. this is what I want to see in a james bond movie. Developed Characters, amazing action, great acting, solid script, two interesting bond girls, etc. Every praise this movie gets is earned in spades. The stuff I loved was the aesthetic. This is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. Jaw Dropping this is definitely something on blu ray. Also this is a very smart movie. For people who just want action it's there and for people who want drama there you have it. Also Daniel Craig, who always delivers as bond, knocks it out of the park. 2012 was definitely the year for action movies this Django, Avengers, and TDKR all having incredible set pieces.<br/><br/>The negative, and once again this will not have an effect on my overall opinion this is just me, Too long. I had the same problem with Casino so i don't know if it's me, but honestly I didn't notice the running time until this movie. The pacing is good in the first half but as the movie goes on there is a little drag going on. I didn't mention Javier Bardem in my positives. This year is also the year for underusing or undermining Best Supporting Actor performances in the third act of the movie. This , Prometheus, Django, Seven Psychopaths, The Dark Knight Rises, all great performances that totally don't get utilized. He's a revelation. He's incredible it's ridicicolous how amazing his intro into this movie is. But as it goes on he becomes less interesting. They even have his face covered up so he doesn't get to emote that well. Still an amazing performance I hope they keep going with this direction of villains. <br/><br/>Great movie, not in the slightest overrated and will definitely get better with repeat viewings. The flaws are there if you look for them , but other then those people, and idiots like myself, everybody else will fall in love with this movie<br/><br/>After re-watching the movie , most of the flaws I saw where fixed and it completely lives up to the hype, except for the ending which is still a tad anti-climatic , and some plot strands unanswered, but still great movie I do have to say this is the best Daniel Craig bond movie."
"dierregi","3","5","12","29 January 2013"," No matter what M:I and Bourne did for the spy genre, we're back to the same rehashed scenario
","Stripped down of all the Bond usual decorations (girls, chases, gadgets, exotic locations, etc) Skyfall has a very simple plot: a disgruntled ex-employee wants to take revenge on the employer who dumped him. Unfortunately, and proving once more that Bond films are just appearance over substance, this logic premise falls down the drain at every twist and turn.<br/><br/>So as not to attract attention to his plan, the villain steals a top secret list and makes it public. That is definitely the best way to be inconspicuous. But what the villain wants is simply to be captured and taken into custody, close to his intended victim. Such victim is a frail old lady who presumably can be dispatched very easily, just by taking a trip to London and ambushing her at her house.<br/><br/>However, it turns out that killing the lady is a lot more difficult than it seems and even placing a bomb inside the HQ of the secret service is not up to the task – although it spreads serious doubts about the professionalism of MI6.<br/><br/>Added randomly to the mix are bits and pieces from countless other successful movies: Mission: Impossible (the stolen list, which is forgotten half way into the movie), Blade Runner (the stunning Shanghai night scape), Inception (the Oriental casino), and The Silence of the Lamb (Hannibal's glass cage) etc...The result is a boring, overlong mess that does not make much sense.<br/><br/>The villain, played by an embarrassing Bardem wearing a blonde wig, is hardly scary at all. He acts like a rejected child who wants to attract the attention of his mummy. Bond is weary and demotivated (and so are we, at this stage). He beds a couple of gorgeous women in a couple of bizarre scenes, both superfluous. He is out of shape, but he manages to kill almost single-handedly a dozen baddies assaulting his home. One of the field agents is actually a secretary. Ralph Fiennes looks fat, bold and very middle-aged whatever<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I started thinking that even Quantum of Solace was better than Skyfall and that leads to the final questions: what about the delirious reviews about this being ""the best Bond ever?"" Were the official reviewers bribed to glorify the 50th Bond anniversary? What did they drink (or smoke) before writing their reviews? Did they watch the same Skyfall movie I watched or perhaps a special edition just for them?<br/><br/>Die-hard Bond fans will love it anyway. They love them all, even if it is always the same story, re-told with small variations: Bond is invincible and irresistible to women and he always saves the world, thanks to a few gadgets, his Martinis and his beloved car. No need to invent anything new."
"tyreeewebster","10","5","12","2 January 2013"," Retrospective Reviews- Skyfall (2012)
","From Sam Mendes, the Director of 'American Beauty' comes the brilliant, sensational, excellent 'Skyfall.'<br/><br/>PROS: I know that 'Quantum of Solace' was quite a catastrophe of a follow- up to 2006's 'Casino Royale', but I'm telling you, this IS the best Bond ever put to screen. The story is simple, yet powerful and engaging and after each scene you want to know what happens next right up to the end. The story is so good that I can not even include any of it in my review. Let's talk about actors, Daniel Craig is on top form as the suave spy, James Bond, being both a physically imposing Bond, and an emotionally scarred one, too. Craig has invented a Bond we have never seen before, particularly towards the end. Judy Dench as M is brilliant, obviously. She is actually part of the action and story, and it actually makes her the Bond girl as opposed to Naomie Harris' Eve and Berenice Marlohe as Severine. Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw were superb in their respective performances. BUT, the actor AND character that steals the entire show is Javier Bardem's ultra camp terrorist Raoul Silva, he makes me feel so uneasy in several scenes that you forget that he's a fictional character. The action is brilliant, I loved every action set piece in the film, the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>CONS: None.<br/><br/>Overall... BEST BOND. BEST FILM.<br/><br/>Directed by: Sam Mendes<br/><br/>Written by: Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & John Logan<br/><br/>Starring: Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Berenice Marlohe, Albert Finney & Judy Dench"

","Great scenes, good conversations, good execution but after the promising first half hour the main story is just so dull. Javier Bardem acted well but his character was the worst..blonde villain with an accent, thought we were past this. Whatever happened to the great main story of the first two? I thought it was supposed to be a trilogy! They left the first two unfinished. I would rather have watched Casino Royale (which is by far the best action movie ever made) again for the 20th time instead... Hopefully the IMDb rating will go down eventually from 8.1 as more people go to see it, but I it's currently way too high..too many people are raving about it, probably because it's just like an old bond movie with many good but pointless and not connected scenes following each other..casino royale was a breath of fresh air, but unfortunately unique and didn't get the sequels it deserved.."
"Leofwine_draca","7","5","12","19 November 2012"," Welcome return to form
","James Bond's latest adventure may not be the game-changing piece of cinema that I was hoping for (after CASINO ROYALE, with its new heights of intense thrills and heartfelt emotion), but at least it's a step up from Bond's previous misfire, QUANTUM OF SOLACE. SKYFALL sees Daniel Craig returning to the role for a third time, and there's a distinctly different feel to his story this time around: he's ageing, in many ways past it, something of a dinosaur in a world of youth. The suddenness of this transformation is surprising, but at least it marks new territory for the series.<br/><br/>Not so elsewhere, as for the first time in the Craig canon we see the return of many familiar tropes: Q is back (in the guise of the remarkable Ben Whishaw), along with Moneypenny, the gadgets, the cars. It feels a little odd to see these much-loved elements returning to the fold a mere two films after the film that made a show of doing away with them altogether, but nonetheless they're handled well and with a minimum of both fuss and cheesiness.<br/><br/>A shame, then, that all of this hinges on a central plot that actually turns out to be, well, pretty unremarkable. The slightly creepy Javier Bardem makes for a memorable bad guy – sometimes for all the wrong reasons – but the plot is nothing more than a simple revenge story, and an early sub-plot about Bond's disappearance turns out to have little to do with anything other than wasting forty minutes of the running time. At 2 hours, 23 minutes, SKYFALL feels a little sluggish in places, flabby when it should be pushing on with momentum.<br/><br/>The good news is that the action is much better than that of the previous outing. Marc Forster didn't know what he was doing in his attempts to emulate the shaky-cam work of Paul Greengrass, but director Sam Mendes is here confident enough to jettison the shaky-cam in favour of some elaborate, big budget, old-fashioned set pieces. A blistering chase sequence kicks things off and an explosive home invasion style climax ends things, and in between we get some great stuff going on in the Tube. A trip to Shanghai is less successful, but for the most part, SKYFALL works. Yes, the action is CGI heavy at all times, but this is decent CGI that adds rather than detracts from the experience.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, the film is less successful. For the first time, Craig doesn't feel particularly likable here. His quips and wisecracks have the effect of making him seem conceited rather than smart, and the hot-pot of writers who crafted the script are far too obsessed with creating pretentiously clever lines so that it really grates sometimes. Judi Dench offers the same one-dimensional bullishness that she's been slapping out since Goldeneye, but Ralph Fiennes is a welcome addition to the rank of officials and Rory Kinnear's return is another plus. Bardem is less impressive, hissing out lines like he's in a pantomime, and of the Bond girls Naomie Harris struggles with a light and superfluous character. Far better is Berenice Marlohe as a sultry femme fatale, although sadly she's only given extremely limited screen time. Still, SKYFALL is nothing less than an entertaining movie, despite the many plot holes and occasional inanities; fans will be in their element."
"jeremyfredrikson","6","5","12","18 November 2012"," Real middle of the pack Bond.
","When I saw all the hype from ""pro critics"", I went into IMDb to see what the general audience members were saying. While the film currently rates a 7.8 (which ranks it as the 2nd best Bond on IMDb tied with Goldfinger and only beaten by Casino Royale... rubbish), this does not reflect what people have written about it. I've read tons of 1 star reviews claiming it to be the worst Bond ever made. Then there are the Craig era knob slobbers who pop up to state how it's the best Bond ever (usually saying that it's as good or better than the bar they have set which is Casino Royale... however, anybody over 30 knows that there are over 20 fantastic other series entries to measure it against if compare/contrast reviewing is your bag). I can easily say that SKYFALL is neither the best nor worst James Bond entry. I'd put it in the lower middle of the canon. The Good: An overly choreographed, drawn out, and over hyped video game like opening extended chase scene morphs into one of the most colorful title sequences in the entire series, which set to Adele's extremely well sung title theme song makes it the highlight of the film. The Aston Martin is back (although, for no logical reason other than nostalgia; it ain't exactly the vehicle of choice for the moors of Scotland). The phrase, ""Bond, James Bond"" is back and so are a couple of welcome one liners (although Craig is nowhere near as adept at saying them as, well, any of the other Bonds). The villain's kept woman is a very sexy Bond girl. The villain's island was a nice change of pace locale. A male M returns! Maybe we'll see some of the good old M vs Bond one ups again instead of the feminist mother complex trash we've been subjected to since the 90s. The Bad: CGI Komodo dragons? Pathetic! A potentially suspenseful moment where Bond hangs from a bar beneath a moving elevator was totally blown by having Craig simply pop off with no difficulty; the ""how's he gonna get out of this one"" suspense question was answered like a Z grade serial cliffhanger cheat. There were only two Bond girls, one of which turns out to be Moneypenny (in yet another blatantly PC affirmative action pandering bit of horrible token casting) and the other was a sex slave who Bond takes advantage of despite her tragic history and then lets her die with no remorse as if she were a mosquito. The chases all seemed like forward movement video games with no sense of ""where am I"" and ""what do I do next"" decision making. The villain's overblown plans were ridiculously unnecessary and implausible. The best was that this brilliant genius of a villain planned and plotted for years and was foiled by a fire extinguisher. Bond dies at the beginning which was obviously going to be explained but NOOOOO. He just pops up drinking a Heinekin with some hooker in a seedy hotel room with no explanation. M and an old geezer use flashlights outdoors while sneaking away from baddies? Really dumb move by all involved in making that scene. Way too much psycho babble drama. Nobody gives a rat's backside about non Fleming, newly fabricated reasons for why this modern day Bond impersonator acts the way he does (it's because the producers are fools and Craig's proving himself to be a one note stone faced actor). There were no stand out action/escape set pieces that will remain etched in your brain years from now other than maybe those lame CGI Komodos or a Home Alone ""defend the castle"" style bit of twaddle. I mean, right after the heroes stop a phase one attack, they're ammo's been spent and a phase 2 helicopter armed with missiles destroys everything they just worked so hard to defend. It was a joke of a defense plan! And that's the climactic highlight to an action film that contains an awful lot of non-action. Oh, and the backlash Q casting was abominable. A young mop hair hipster Q with cosmetic only glasses and a complete dislike of gadgets? WTF! Way to whiz on one of the most beloved characters of the franchise, Ms. Broccoli. Overall: a so-so Bond, not a ""best"" Bond (there are WAAAAY too many other great contenders to choose from that blow this one out of the ice filled waters) and not a ""worst"" Bond (that honor goes easily to Quantum). Still, with the ending resembling classic Bond (Moneypenny, M's office, and a gruff male M), there's still possible (maybe?) hope for better, more ""classis"" style Bond films to come in the future. The producers really need to learn to embrace what made Bond what it is instead of fighting against that formula to square peg it into today's action junk genre that focuses more on ""feelings"" and pouting looks instead of quick thinking reactive action and cleverness. Witty and well executed action/escape set pieces and stunts that make you squirm in anticipation and excitement at ""how on Earth can he escape that!"" was what made Bond appealing in the first place, that and the fact that they were spy movies that felt like authentic pulp spy movies. Bond was and should be a classy, suave, womanizing gentleman again instead of a hulking, sulking, ""whoa is me, mommy"" sensitive jock. The Craig era started off great with Casino Royale (in HUGE part thanks to Fleming's story), but he's (sky)fallen so quickly that I can't wait for a new actor to play Bond. I've never said that about any of the other actors and wanted all of them to continue making more Bonds."
"nithinrajagopal","4","5","12","16 November 2012"," A 'SKYFALL' disappointment...
","The only reason i am giving it a 4 is because its Daniel Craig, who in my opinion has been the most macho bond so far (If you have seen the way Pierce Brosnan runs you know what i mean).<br/><br/>Anyway, cutting to the chase, this bond movie is high on hype on abysmally low on thrill. This lacks everything that Casino Royale had - an i-forgot-to-eat-the-popcorn opening sequence, great pace of the story narration, bond girl's 'screen presence' and connect with the viewer.<br/><br/>For each of the points mentioned here - think of Casino Royale and think of Skyfall... A. Was there an action sequence in the movie that made you go 'wow!'? NO B. Was there any mystery in the movie to keep you guessing? NO C. Was there a bond girl whom you couldn't take your eyes off off? NO D. Is Bond Aunt (M) so important? NO E. Are you better off not knowing what Bond's past was like? YES F. Did the movie remind you of Home Alone? YES<br/><br/>I don't know if Sam Mendes was intentionally trying to ruin Daniel Craig's run as Bond or what, but this has to be the next worst Craig Bond Movie after Quantum of Solace - which makes it 2 in a row. Not good Daniel.<br/><br/>The explosion at MI-6 was CGI, the whatever-lizard like creature was CGI, the foggy moor shots were boring and too long, Albert Finny is wasted in the movie as an actor, there is no mystery around M (her first name is mentioned in a very casual manner) - and I could sense the 'fakeness' of all of these.<br/><br/>I hope the rating will soon stabilize to somewhere around 6.5 after the initial hoopla with the crazy fans dies its natural death. I have seen Casino Royale many times, but this one tested my patience in one viewing. I am disappointed because somewhere i am still looking at another bond movie reaching or even surpassing the bar that Casino Royale had set - and my disappointment increases since it seems this is highly unlikely to happen.<br/><br/>I am sorry Sam, not impressed at all."
"clark44","6","5","12","11 November 2012"," Messy, rambling plot raises more questions than answers
","I don't know that I've ever seen a movie where my opinion was more out of sync with the reviews of users and critics. The cinematography was fantastic, the acting superb, but the plot was simply inexcusably lazy. Things happen for no reason. Sure, being shot on a train, falling off a bridge, and going off a waterfall is theoretically survivable. But no answers provided as to how? It's just not believable. In fact, the more details that are revealed about that scene, the less sense it makes. We find out that Bond heard M's order to shoot. (Never mind that simply waiting for the trained agent to finish the fight was probably a better bet all along than taking a risky sniper shot.) So why didn't he just move out of the way? Why didn't Naomie take a second shot? <br/><br/>In the first and second acts, a number of interesting questions are raised. Is there a still a role for a human spy in a completely digital world? Can Bond ever overcome the emotional and physical trauma of being shot on the train? Who has stolen the agent list, and what do they want with it? Who are the moles in MI6? Why does Bond still own his parents' house in Scotland? <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film provides the answer to none of these questions. The third act actually devolves into a ""Home Alone"" remake, and not even a particularly good one. It was fun to watch, but it simply didn't make any sense. At one point, the villain tracks back in on our heroes because they were using a flashlight to escape in the dark. A flashlight! Surely MI6 agents know better ways to escape at night? <br/><br/>It's too bad that the plot is such a mess, because this film really could have been excellent. There are one or two monologues that are simply masterful, and the long, single-shot fight scenes are among the best ever filmed. But in the end it's merely average."
"joben-525-633946","7","5","12","10 November 2012"," An impressive Bond debut for Mendes, but nothing groundbreaking.
","If 'Quantum of Solace' left you a little empty then Sam Mendes' 'ressurection' of the 007 franchise is enough to bury that hatchet, even if the highly anticipated blockbuster is not of the standards of Casino Royale in 2006.<br/><br/>Craig is superb as ever and is surrounded with an equally impressive cast consisting of Judi Dench as M, Ben Whishaw as Q and 'No Country For Old Men's' Javier Bardem who is excellently disturbing as international villain Silva. The cast overall is exemplary and worthy to be mentioned in the same bracket as a hugely popular James Bond title.<br/><br/>Cinematography and beautiful imagery is epitomised within the opening 20 minutes as we see Craig's athletic Bond undergo a nail biting pursuit of hit-man Patrice (Ola Rapace). It renders intertextuality with the opening sequence of 'Casino Royale' as Craig pursues Sebastien Foucan.<br/><br/>Although the film focuses on building on characterisation between M and Bond, it appears to refract off the road of Bond and you will question whether you are watching a Bond film on occasions. The plot follows a more original route and fans searching for originality will get there just deserts; however, it's never quite as exciting or groundbreaking as 'Casino Royale' was, following up from the mediocre 'Die Another Day.'<br/><br/>In short, while it's no doubt an excellent action flick with great casting members, 'Skyfall' is not a revolutionary movie despite it's powerful emotional strength."

"gregwetherall","6","5","12","31 October 2012"," Hmmm....
","Around the time of Casino Royale, the 2006 instalment of the James Bond series, there was not a great deal of expectation. Internet chatrooms and comment sites were filled with antagonistic references to the casting of Daniel Craig as Bond. It was an act of heresy to cast a blond Bond. It was heinous to have someone who was not overtly suave and sophisticated. The naysayers were plentiful. The aftermath of the Casino Royale release was that not only was Craig a fantastic Bond, he was quite possibly Bond's saviour. He had made the series hip again, when it appeared to be outdated and outmoded, a nostalgic nod to days of old.<br/><br/>After Casino Royale's runaway success – widespread critical acclaim and huge box office receipts (the golden ticket for any movie), came the first bump in the road in the form of the flawed and confused follow-up, Quantum of Solace. For a time, it looked as though QoS would be the full stop, rather than a comma, in the story of the British Agent. MGM pulled the plug on funding in light of the international monetary crisis and their own subsequent slide into bankruptcy. What a pity for this great institution to bow out on a whimper. In the years that followed, the faithful trumpeted up a lot of support and the cries for a further film grew.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Sony stepped in and enabled production and distribution for this particular offing (and this is abundantly clear from the neat product placement in the feature itself).<br/><br/>To outline the plot of a Bond film is not really essential to the review of the content. All Bond films are at once exactly the same, yet also different from each other. It is the routine and checklist of the format that forms part of its appeal. Accordingly, all the Bond tropes are adhered to in Skyfall. Suitably bombastic and dramatic theme song? Check. Gadgets (or lack of) dispensed by Q? Check. Opening scene chase sequence? Check. Memorable baddie? Check. The list could go on. What is important is that Sam Mendes has taken control with a healthy respect for the films preceding Skyfall, and also an enthusiasm to deliver his own stamp on the franchise.<br/><br/>This is Craig's third outing, and his presence is by this point familiar and comfortable. There is no shock in his brand of delivery. There is no updating required. There is a need, however, to reinstate the standing of the films after the aforementioned disappointing predecessor. The films opens with a strong hand; a suitably ambitious cross-city chase that incorporates cars, bikes and trains, before providing a heart-in-mouth moment that fires up the adrenaline and provides appropriate reminder, if needed, that we are in James Bond territory. Soon, Adele's theme song plays and the credits roll. The song itself is a welcome return to the grandeur of the theme songs of old, with a Spy Who Loved Me, 'Nobody Does It Better', and Goldfinger sense of import. Rather than being a periphery character, this version pulls in more substance for M, who becomes a major player. Forever reliable, Dame Judy Dench imparts necessary quintessential English reserve to the part. Javier Bardem, who enters proceedings at around the mid-point, is a revelation. One of the saddest aspects of the film is the fact that not more is made of the interplay and verbal interaction between him and Bond. With more emphasis on the psychological swordplay between the two, this could have been an outstanding film. As things stand, he is wily, assured, cunning and cool, marking a volatile cocktail of disenchantment and frustration.<br/><br/>This is a solid action film, and one that will arrive with a lot of good will resting on its shoulders. People like the series and want this to do well. Does it succeed? The inclusion of the basic elements of fire, ice and water lead to a full house of dangerous tricks, but some parts work better than others. The penultimate showdown falls a little flat, despite pyrotechnics flaring up in a supernova of light and smoke. The story is not really substantial or absorbing, despite a more than generous running time. Does this matter? It will depend on your own inclinations.<br/><br/>In short, this is another Bond film much like all the other Bond films, and yet also its own work Well, you probably knew that already. If you are fond of the antics and escapades of 007, then you will find much to enjoy and revel in here. If not, then this will not necessarily convert you. Business as usual then.<br/><br/>for more: toomuchnoiseblog.com and www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-wetherall"

I was also sad with M death because of long 17 years as M. But OK, if the death had to come it might be in some other way. I know that a lot of the Bond movies are unrealistic but even it seem to be realistic. Terrorists with these kind of ammunition can find out really fast where M is hiding even without GPS in an old Aston Martin. If M died on the heart attack somewhere in unknown MI6 shelter surrounded by 100 agents or something it will be more believable story than we could see in the film.

","This review is not detailing the plot of the film but is more of an overview of how Skyfall will join the other 22 members of the franchise.<br/><br/>This being Daniel Craig's third outing successfully portraying as everyone's favourite secret agent, with Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace dipping their toes into the world of James Bond. Skyfall has used both feet firmly to deliver what we have come to know and love in the world of 007. But with a modern twist. <br/><br/>This time round there is far more humour with one liners that 007 has been made a custom with and also a nice piece of homage to the legacy of Bond shown through the return of the original Aston Martin DB5 from Goldfinger. Still as beautiful and still fully equipped with its gadgets. Javier Bardem's character of Silva is a welcomed return to memorable villains. Silva is an interesting villain with much potential and shows this early on with a great introduction set on his remote island, but sadly is diluted as the film comes to a close. <br/><br/>One disappointment with Skyfall is with its Bond girls or lack of. Naomie Harris' Eve covers the most screen time out of the two Bond girls and makes quite an introduction for herself by shooting 007. This Mi6 agent is not like previous ones which have come and gone, as it appears that Naomie Harris' Eve is play a bigger role in future James Bond films. Compare this with Bérénice Marlohe's character Sévérine which is easily forgotten in the film due to such limited screen time and one has to ask the question of was this character really needed?<br/><br/>The easiest way to explain Skyfall is to look at the director. Same Mendes has gone on record to say that Skyfall was influenced by The Dark Knight Batman film series of director Christopher Nolan. This is very apparent throughout the film and which is why Skyfall fails to be a traditional Bond film in some ways, but succeeds in other ways.<br/><br/>The similarities between the two franchises are blatant, which takes away the fun fantasy of Bond and replaces it with a grittier colder realism. Bring Bond into the 21st century is not a bad thing but at the same time trying to stay faithful to the series is not an easy task. Weather it being the still shot of Bond standing on a roof overlooking London uncanny of Batman doing the same looking over Gotham City, or the plot that faintly resembles The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. It all feels like it has been done before only then it was in a suit of armour and not in a suit from Savile Row.<br/><br/>If after watching Skyfall you are still not convinced that James Bond has put on a cape to save London City then the ending sequence should put your doubts to rest. It's almost like Sam Mendes took The Dark Knight Rises last 5 minutes and just changed the character's names around. While it feels lazy it does work and sets up Bond 24 to be the first 'real' Bond film in a long time. With all the ingredients being slowly added since Casino Royale it looks to have come together nicely for Bond's next adventure to be one to remember for all the right reasons."

","If you judge Skyfall by comparing it with, say, Goldfinger, it is second best in almost every way.<br/><br/>Compare the film scores, incidental music, casting, quality of the dialogue, plot, arch villain, originality of the production, lighter moments, gadgets, M, Q, Bond girls or even the film advertising posters and you will see what I mean.<br/><br/>Sean Connery, John Barry, Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell, and the likes of Gert Frobe, etc remain unchallenged as the the definitive components of Bond. <br/><br/>Skyfall? Great action scenes and locations and I like Daniel Craig, but that's about it. In simple terms it's Goldfinger 10 points, Skyfall 4."

","Hard to believe it will be eight years since 'Skyfall' was released when the new Bond picture, 'No Time To Die' hits the screen.
I only hope that 'No Time..' will be much better.
No need to deconstruct 'Skyfall' and its many shortcomings since we've all seen it by now.
Suffice it to say that I found it disappointing; I left the theater wanting so much more (surprise cameos by a few of the past Bond actors, for instance). I remember the audience breaking into applause when the Astin Martin appeared (or should I say re-appeared), but even the iconic 'Bondmobile' got short shrift.
I'll compare my 'Skyfall' experience to watching The Academy Awards show in 2012 on the 50th Anniversary of the Bond franchise. We got Shirley Bassey singing 'Goldfinger' (she was astoundingly good), but that was it. Why, after she sang, did the curtain not raise to reveal ALL the past Bond portrayers walking onstage to wild applause? Because the producer of that particular Academy Awards show was still on a high over his production of the musical, 'Chicago', from years past, and it was given star treatment throughout the show instead.
Terrible. Let's pray for a GREAT final Bond picture from Daniel Craig in 'No Time To Die'."
"theresamgill","10","4","9","12 June 2018"," Not just the best Craig Bond film, this is the best Bond film ever. Period.
","This is truly the pinnacle of Bond films. Although perhaps not the best opening action sequence overall, it succeeds in introducing the tone of the film-- one that fits perfectly with the narrative. It also introduces Naomie Harris who is a welcome addition to this revamped cast. And maybe the animation sequence doesn't tell the best story, but it's so clever, and when matched with Adele's titular song, it is definitely the best theme.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Early on Daniel Craig briefly sports a scruffy look. He doesn't come close to passing the physical. The psychological examination is clever. All of this and more builds on the approach Sam Mendes beautifully takes this film. And it's all backed behind a stellar cast. Ben Whishaw plays one of my favorite (if not favorite actually) characters in the young and arrogant techno Q, and of course adding Ralph Fiennes into the mix is awesome. This also marks the best narrative given to Judi Dench as the aging M (although give Judi Dench credit because she looks great for however many decades old she is).<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you didn't know it was coming, I had to save Javier Bardem for last. He is a powerhouse actor who became familiar to American audiences with his villainous turn in No Country for Old Men (I'd describe his character as the combination of Joker and Two Face from The Dark Knight). Also shout out to his starring role in Alejandro Inarritu's foreign film Biutiful. And if you need any more evidence of his quality acting, look no further than his malignant and sophisticated role in this film. His introduction and monologue is memorable, his actions are remorseless, and unlike Christoph Waltz's antagonist in the sequel, the execution of his plan is smart and scary. Easily the best villain of this series.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something I haven't really discussed much from the other films but that is so vital to the success of this film is the cinematography. The film lost out to Life of Pi at the Oscars, but the shots of Shanghai-- in particular the silent action scene in the skyscraper is one of my favorites of any film-- are such a gorgeous combination of colors bursting from the dark surroundings (hmm, even a bit like the tone of the film).<br/><br/><br/><br/>This movie is the perfect blend of old and new Bond. Throw on top a great character-driven story, and not only is this my favorite film of Daniel Craig's series, it's my favorite Bond film (admittedly, I need to re-watch many of the classics, especially with Sean Connery). And not only is it my favorite Bond film, it's just a tremendous film on its own. Multiple scenes always pop out as memorable, and the climax is simply fantastic. Even if you haven't seen Casino Royale, or any Bond film for that matter, I can't stress enough that to anybody and everybody I give a high recommendation to go watch Skyfall.

"apstylianou","10","4","9","1 October 2015"," As a huge 007 fan, and awaiting Spectre this year, I highly disagree with all the negativity on this site about this film
","Skyfall is the perfect original Bond movie. Although I haven't seen exactly every 007 movie, but I am still a huge fan of Bond, I love spy movies and Daniel Craig is my favorite James Bond actor; he has a history, he has a mysterious past and the calm demeanor that the character should possess better than any other Bond actor I've seen.<br/><br/>Firstly, I have to disagree with all the negative reviews that I found on IMDb about this film to my surprise (although I respect other opinions even if I don't fall for them). Skyfall is at the top of the spy genre with the thrills, action, stunts and the performances. Daniel Craig is still the sh*t, Judi Dench was absolutely fantastic as M, she was in fact my favorite performance in the film followed by Javier Bardem as Silva, who was my favorite 007 villain ever. I feel like I could make the argument that Silva is just definitely up there with Auric Goldfinger and Ernst Stavro Blofeld.<br/><br/>He was 2012's Heath Ledger's Joker. He is unpredictable, has good humour to add up to his intimidating presence and like the Joker, he makes the stakes high for the film and its plot and story. The action is out of the water, the scene where they are on motorbikes chasing each other on the rooftops was my favorite action sequence of the film. All from that scene to the end with its climax with the helicopter at Bond's old house.<br/><br/>Now about the plot, the plot is very dynamic above most spy movies, this one is far from the clichéd spy film, the story is a great story about resurrection, survival and skill. The villain's story is one that actually has a history that is told to explain his motivations and evilness. Javier Bardem had the chemistry for that kind of character reflecting back on his Oscar-winning performance in 2007's No Country for Old Men. Bond still had a story about, we might not have gotten more of his history as we will in Spectre this year, but he still is the greatness that Bond is made of and it is still great seeing him deliver wit and humour with his one-liners and watching him kick ass like Batman is just great.<br/><br/>Oh, and the song, Skyfall by Adele is just incredible. Adele has an incredible voice and her performance and her song tops any other Bond song I've heard.<br/><br/>Overall, being a huge 007 fan and as I am highly excited for this October's most anticipated movie: Spectre, I loved Skyfall; it is my favorite spy movie of all time and while I think Spectre will be great, but I just don't know if it will be as great as Skyfall. Skyfall is my favorite 007 film and it has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, if I had to make that list, Skyfall has to be on there.<br/><br/>10/10"
"anshopkins","5","4","9","14 January 2014"," My Review...Honestly
","Honestly, the movie process was well done...with the exception of the storyline. Acting, very good. Cinematography, excellent. Sound & video editing, very good as well. Set design & location (even Turkey), good too. Costumes were wonderful. Superlative job of selling the movie in advance... However, it's about the play. What happens on camera? How does the story moves along? What emotions are pulled from the audience by the characters? How do the characters develop during the play? With a better story, this would have been a fantastic film! With story given, its a study on how to make a successful film without much of a story. Honestly, I really don't see much of a future for 24 or 25 unless the writing improves. I hope that in the future more work will be done on the story. The process is excellent. But it must begin with story."
"pinkybanana2000","3","4","9","2 January 2014"," If the name James Bond wasn't attached
","This is the fast-food equivalent of cinema. Just because this movie earned a billion dollars doesn't make it a good one, just as healthy quarterly statements don't prove that fast food is quality food. If this movie was called Skyfall with a generic actor, it wouldn't gross more than $30 million.<br/><br/>I have never been enthralled with Bond movies, because after reading all the Ian Fleming novels when I was a teenager, I always thought the movies were too far out with the gadgetry and superhuman abilities and all. Nonetheless, I watched some of them over the years because they were available.<br/><br/>A lot of things wrong with this movie have been catalogued, but I'll pile on for good measure: <br/><br/>1. Where is the suave, sophisticated Bond? You know, the guy who can order a drink with the best of them? Where is the tuxedo? In this movie, he was relegated to thuggery, like forcing his way into a moving train by basically yelling at the train operator. No sly, clever one-liners, this one.<br/><br/>2. Why ""humanize"" Bond by showing the place of his birth, and revealing the names and tombstone of his parents? Or showing him crying when M died? What does that accomplish, other than soupy, soap-opera stuff?<br/><br/>3. Why allow his parents' home to be destroyed? If he was human, wouldn't he want to save it to preserve the memories of his parents? What happens to Kincaid now that the house is gone? <br/><br/>4. Why show us that M needs to report a legislative panel? We assume that. We don't need to see her getting grilled.<br/><br/>5. What was the deal with resurrecting the Aston Martin and all the gadgets? It served no useful purpose. It seemed a contrived and desperate move to appeal to the past.<br/><br/>6. Why even make this film? Why not do a remake of the original Fleming novels? You know, a fresher, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" with new gadgets.<br/><br/>It might be time to stop making Bond movies (I know, I know, they'll never stop so long as the money keeps pouring in), but they clearly have run out of ideas. Pretty soon, computer-savvy kids will churn out this kind of movies anyway.<br/><br/>I watched this movie with my non-fluent-English-speaking wife. While she'd heard of the name, she has never seen a Bond movie. At least half a dozen times, she turned to me and rolled her eyes. Yet, we'd seen a few action movies which she liked. To me, her reaction said a lot."

","The first Craig/Bond movies were a breathtaking, wonderful departure from the cartoon history which preceded them, where the bad guys were deliberately unbelievable. Suddenly, with Casino Royale, we begin to pull back the veil of a global organization which actually, undeniably exists (google Bilderber Group, the Trilateral Commission). The next movie carried the investigation further, exposing the determination to control the world's water supply. One has only to pick up documentaries such as Blue Gold and Water to realize the truth of these dangers. Then, suddenly, weare back to comic figures--a totally unbelievable character, an embittered ex-agent, who has somehow amassed the money necessary to finance his incredible obsession for revenge against M. What bilge. Give us back the Bond with the courage to engage in real world challenges--not more Batman. The movie world is full to brimming with action packed make-believe cop stories--give us something with credibility in it--or has the Bond franchise been taken over by the organization it was exposing?"

I did think about pointing out all the ""daftness"", UK agents in charge of NATO lists in a NATO country etc, but I will limit myself to pointing out Bond needing to dig out the bullet that shot him to find out that it was radioactive and only three ""mercenaries"" use that type of bullet( would we not have carried out autopsies on the dead agents!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).

","Seriously - how can this movie score so high - i for one refuse to like a movie just because the media says it's good...<br/><br/>The problem with Bond since its reboot with Casino Royal, whilst a good stand alone movie and whilst Daniel Craig is a fine actor, it was not a bond movie nor is DC Bond. When it tried to be realistic and gritty it was now competing with Bourne and it is not in that league, meanwhile, up stepped Mission Impossible to take up the mantle of what Bond used to be and should be. Now the franchise does not know what it wants to be.<br/><br/>After a truly awful follow up, i did hold out some hope for Skyfall, what with all the media hype it had generated. Boy was i disappointed, i may have seen a worse movie but really i cannot think of one.<br/><br/>Without going into the plot holes (i'd be giving away the story, not allowed on IMDb) but why was the 'secret operative list' plot dropped, why did the super intelligent villain, become desperate and why oh why did he simply not wait in the shadows and shoot M in the head?<br/><br/>this movie has finished the franchise for me"
"mrcjoker","5","4","9","11 April 2013"," Could have been better
","I was really enjoying the film until they went to the cabin, where the rest of the movie took place. It got boring and uninteresting. Staying at one location in a bond movie does not work. Bond always goes places, like Russia, India, China... everywhere. He went to a cabin and stayed there, used old weaponry and talked to old people for the rest of the movie and made booby traps like Kevin McCallister.<br/><br/>Bond does not work defensively, it's too boring for him.<br/><br/>I started too wonder for about three days why I did not like the movie. Then it finally came to me. ""M"" should have died in the court room, then bond would be upset and be on revenge and it would also be a shock to the viewers of the movie.<br/><br/>Bond would have then been on the attack, went to Q to get more awesome gadgets, find him, and defuse the villain's master plan. I would feel satisfied at the end of the movie because M's death was avenged and the movie would end with more of a bang.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked the movie until the cabin, it got dull and stayed dull until the end, and most people I know feel the same way.<br/><br/>By the way, what happened to the actual bond music when action starts, it's non-existent in these Daniel Craig movie's. That music was made to make you feel like it's Bond time, this is a bond movie. I don't feel like I am watching a bond movie anymore. They play it in the trailer... that's cool I guess.<br/><br/>Compare the over the top action and Crazy nonsense in Die Another Day, where he traveled all over, had a cloaking car that had gadgets like a car from twisted metal, fought a British guy that was actually Korean because he changed his face, a guy that had diamonds shattered into his face, and went to a party in a mansion made of pure ice. Oh and compare the Song from that movie to this one.<br/><br/>Now think, is this new movie a Bond film?"
"heatsink98","4","4","9","22 March 2013"," Fan fiction made into a big budget movie
","If you are looking for a smartly plotted spy flick, this is not it. To reference another film, this movie merely attempts to insult the intelligence of anyone who attempts to watch it.<br/><br/>Some of the biggest problems stem from the technical aspects the writers chose to ignore with regard to plot devices. The main antagonist is a ticked off ex-spy with a penchant for hacking computers. So far, so good, until said ex-spy is given the ability the make computers misbehave in cartoonish fashion. He can access secret and secure networks that are not (or at least not in the real world) connected to the outside internet. He sets off an explosion in a secure building by hacking into the gas delivery infrastructure, which also seemed a bit silly and contrived. The main implementation of computers and networks in the plot is as magical technology the bad guy can command at will.<br/><br/>Toward the end of the film, an armed military helicopter with the bad guy and his armed degenerates flies across Scotland to attack Bond at the old manor. Are the residents of Scotland accustomed to seeing this sort of thing? It's not a remote atoll or middle-of-nowhere location where the attack takes place, it's Scotland.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Skyfall manor, the film made a strange detour into Home Alone territory with the defense of the location. The attackers were written as complete idiots, ala Home Alone, and I can't imagine the script writers did not notice the similarities.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie might barely be worth a one night check-out from the Redbox, but don't expect much."
"kdemon_power","2","4","9","17 March 2013"," A total waste of time
","Honestly, I haven't been a big fan of 007 in the recent years. In my opinion ever since Daniel Craig joined the franchise there hasn't been a single 007 movie to would come anywhere close to those made back in the day, which were entertaining, fun and enjoyable. And its not just because Craig's portraying of Bond is totally different from what the previous ones used to be (wit, handsome and full of irony and humor) but also because with every next movie there is less and less sense in the plot. The most recent edition beats them all from that aspect. We can clearly see that it cost millions of $ to make it, given all the FX in the film, but I just wish a fraction of that money had been used to pay a decent script writer. The movie has got good cast but its not enough to cover up the overall meaninglessness of it, which actually lasts over 2 hours of screen time. Gave it 2 stars for cast, otherwise its not even a 1."

","My husband and I saw this so-called Bond film, and while we both appreciate Daniel Craig as an actor, we do not think he is James Bond in any way. We adore Judi Dench and thought she was great, and we are sorry to see her go. I for one was not so sure that the fine actor Ralph Fiennes is a good substitute for her. Javier Bardem was suitably menacing as the villain. In this film there were way too many echoes of The Bourne Identity and Jason Bourne, which is too bad because because that Bourne series is much more clever and innovative overall, but this film seemed like ""The Boring Identity"" to us. While the ending was somewhat spectacular, we felt that the whole Skyfall back story was not very well done. It looked like Wuthering Heights. We were amused at least to see Voldemort and Mrs. Malfoy on a political panel together!"

","I still enjoyed it, and it is worth watching, but for me it felt quite contrived. Bond comes out of a building and a car picks him up just as the baddie passes down the street (when he should have been long gone). I felt both of the Bond girls were weak, especially the French actress. Why Bond has to go back to his old house I don't know, and Scotland didn't work at all for me. <br/><br/>I think Casino Royale is a better movie because it concentrates on the action and story itself, rather than forcing elements of Bond's past onto us, and trying to establish some 'drama' between M and Bond. <br/><br/>Bardem is a good villain and he has some nice lines. Again though, tying him into his MI6 past and his previous relationship with M doesn't work for me. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie is very good with great action sequences. The second half I think fell apart, for example, how does Silva get out of his secure cell? <br/><br/>Probably worth a 7 once I lower my expectations. Better than Quantum of Solace, for sure."

","I will say at the outset that I was disappointed with this latest Bond offering. I watch around 10 movies a week and have seen every Bond movie in the cinema since No1. For most of the movie Bond plays a less than adequate has-been spy, failing at almost every task, being beaten in almost every tussle. OK so he comes good in the end, despite his proved unworthiness in the fit-for-duty tests. On top of this there were many mistakes including crashing rush hour trains with no one on board, grenades exploding in a dining room without disturbing rows of neatly aligned chairs and a swim in a sub zero lake that would have rendered any human being dead in around 4 minutes. But, for all that, it was entertaining, which is all a movie has to be. Thankfully here in Turkey, a visit to the cinema cost me just $5, so I can't say it wasn't worth the money."
"Delamont91","5","4","9","15 November 2012"," 0023 misses essential Bondish elements
","After this year's long-awaited and much-acclaimed superhero summer blockbusters (Whedon's 'The Avengers' and Nolan's 'The Dark Knight Rises'), Sam Mendes' 'Skyfall' was to me the first in the row of cinematic adventures (Spielberg's 'Lincoln' and Jackson's first part of 'The Hobbit' still to come) that didn't quite live up to its preceding hype.<br/><br/>The third installment with Daniel Craig as our favourite MI6 high-profiled agent turns out to be a decent movie, though. After four years 007 resurfaces (quite literally in this instant) in a motion picture. And, let's face it, all hail to the 44-years old British actor. Craig is my favorite Bond, ever since 'Casino Royale' (2006); acting cold, emotionally detached, calmly sarcastic, distant, yet also vulnerable, both mentally and physically. He delivers once again a thorough interpretation on the character in 'Skyfall'. Also, cinematography and production design are top-notch throughout the entire film, contributing beyond any doubt to a sweeping visual spectacle. Colours, light, interiors and exteriors, they all add up.<br/><br/>After a thrilling and promising opening, the iconic and unique gun barrel sequence is strangely absent. However, Adele's title song and the animated stunning though repetitive credits even the balance soon enough.<br/><br/>With Bond presumed death after being shot by a colleague (Naomie Harris, who lacks certain depth in acting) and a classified ultra-secret list gone rogue, M (the always magnificent Dame Judi Dench) becomes subject to a personal vendetta in London. MI-6 HQ gets blown sky-high and the intel on operatives gotten from the stolen and decoded list is put online. Luckily, Bond rises from the death and returns to Britain. (Otherwise we would have had the ultimate daring take on a Bond film: one without Bond.) The audience is left clueless on this resurrection, one of 007's self-proclaimed hobbies. Director and writers would seem to have thought hobbies like this are instantly clear to worldwide eyes and would require none contextual footage. First unnecessary plot hole.<br/><br/>The reinvented Q (Ben Whishaw) is a whizz-kid who equips 007 with a Walther PPS coded to the spy's hand print. And that's about it. Oh, and there's a tracker, which one shall hardly call inventive. The plotwise important gadgets, having had great influence in defining both book and film series, are prominent in their nonappearance. Apparently, the nerdy Quartermaster relies more on his computed algorithms ('We don't do explosive pens anymore'), even when they're continuously hacked into miraculously and unexplained by the main villain, the dyed- blond Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem). Second unnecessary plot hole there. The positive fair note I should jot here on Q, is the comical dialogue he and Bond share. They constantly outmatch each other in their witty use of language. Kudos, script writers, for this one.<br/><br/>Bond tracks the list, after rigourous yet insufficient training, all the way to China. 'Skyfall' is the first in the series having been shot there and that brings some awesomeness to the screen. Bond fails to reclaim the list his boss so desperately wants, but does find his Bond- girl. The list is never again referenced to in the movie, since there are now far more attractive things to chase for our protagonist. Third unnecessary plot hole. In a not-so-brilliant turn of events, Severine (Bérénice Lim Marlohe) takes her new-found lover to Silva, because that's what Bond-girls do. Happy cliché. Marlohe actually is quite a good actress and should've gotten more screen time, which now amounts to a total of twenty minutes max. <br/><br/>All James Bond-films are only as good as the villain who nails them and there's no exception on the rule here. Bardem gives a fine take on Silva, who comes across tormented and revengeful. Even so, he never reaches anywhere near a nightmarish, lasting impression. His motives and past stay shrewd in darkness and are only hinted to, which makes him somewhat hard for the ignorant viewer to relate to. Unfortunately, the script writers themselves had to cope with these consequences of their own negligence, as none of the characters except M are believably interacting with the bad guy either. Just too many spots and dots are left in their respective clouded and unconnected states. An ovation for this fourth unnecessary plot hole shouldn't be unfit.<br/><br/>The last forty minutes or so came as a huge surprise to me. Nothing in teasers or trailers had given away any of it, so I won't here. It's arguably the best part of the last decade in 007 films, shared with the Madagascar crane scenes from 'Casino Royale'. Albert Finney hands a solid performance in a terrific role. The several plot twists near the end, hailed as climactic by both critics and audiences, were, despite their unpredictability, totally unconvincing to me.<br/><br/>And then, right before the end credits, the gun barrel sequence appears. Comes just two hours too late. Bummer.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have already noted the similarities between 'Skyfall' and Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. To the sharp eye they're overabundant, though I guess they are not disadvantageous to any viewer who still has plans on seeing the aforementioned trilogy, since 'Skyfall' plagiarizes only the best elements of it. Bond without a Batsuit is no Bruce Wayne and never will be.<br/><br/>Concluding, I'd say 'Skyfall' is action-filled eye candy, despite the obvious and numerous plot holes. However, it suffers tremendously from deliberately leaving out many crucial elements to a Bond film. There is basically no Bond-girl, there are basically no Bond-gadgets, there is no pre-title shooting icon and there is basically no explorative interaction between the main characters.<br/><br/>5/10. If it weren't titled, marketed and hyped as a Bond movie, I'd probably rate it 7 or maybe even 8/10."

Two, the Bond girls (if one can forget that M is probably the main 'girl' in this movie) are not captivating. Three, the 'action' scenes are not new.

The only way to enjoy this movie is to put on your dumb hat.<br/><br/>In the end though who wants to watch a bunch of failures.<br/><br/>Q fails to secure MI6 networks allowing the bad guy to hack them 4 times. I'm sorry what idiot would plugs a captured computer into your live network. You create a segmented network for working on captured computers.<br/><br/>M fails to have people who understand computer security to prevent them from being hacked. Maybe if she'd hired a Q that was older than 5 they would not have gotten hacked. Not to mention she made a bad call that nearly got Bond killed and lost them the Spy List. Why not tell Bond to duck, or the shooter to fire until they where both dead.<br/><br/>Bond is supposed to protect M at the end and she dies. HE FAILED.<br/><br/>What was good about this movie? Again have to say WORST BOND MOVIE EVER!!!!!"
"DannyHastie37","9","8","23","26 October 2012"," Modern day action packed, with a touch of class.
","Cast: Daniel Craig of course returns as Ian Fleming's James Bond, so nothing new to note there just a continuation of a great performance. Supporting cast and i have to say first that i loved Ben Wishaw as Q. When he first show and everything I was worried about this hipster kid taking over the iconic older part, but it worked and i love it. Ralph Finnes is a government official who, no spoilers, but keeps an eye on Bond and MI6. Javier Bardem plays the villain, and is fantastic. His character background is perfect spy action movie, and his camp yet genius take on the villain is brilliant. I liked Naomie Harris, she plays an almost Bond girl, sexy and smart, but providing a nice payoff every now and then, especially at the end. Finally, there is one member of the cast who if doesn't win an Oscar or every other form of award for best supporting role, it's Dame Judi Dench as M. No spoilers to the plot, but she is more involved than in the previous movies and she is just bloody brilliant.<br/><br/>Overview: Again no spoilers, but the story is pretty tight. No a direct sequel to the disaster that was Quantum Of Solace, thank god. Now I personally am not a big Bond guy. I've seen from Tomorrow Never Dies onwards, and I saw From Russia With Love, at a special screening at Cineworld, but even then, there are certain things, that in pop culture stand out as being James Bond. This movie recognises it's 50 year anniversary by having a lot of little moments that say 'Yes this is a Bond movie and here this is' I'm not going to spoil them all, but MINOR SPOILER my favourite was when Bond opens a garage door and sitting there is his old Aston Martin and the Bond theme kicks in, it was satisfying to me, a movie pop culture fan-boy, so real Bond fans brace yourselves. The action is very Bond over the top, there are some one liners, and the plot is very good. It leaves you and the characters guessing right up to the end. Eagle eyed viewers will see the entire plot of the film in usual Bond fashion in the opening montage as Adele sings her Skyfall song, not my cup of tea musically, but not bad.<br/><br/>Recommend: Definitely, as an action film and as a part of the Bond franchise. Overall: 9/10"

Poor Cubby Broccoli the original producer, must be rolling around in his grave. Shame on his daughter, Barbara, for letting go of the good old fashioned and Fun Bond.

","Slightly better than Spectre and tremendously better than the awful Quantum. Daniel Craig tries his best but doesn't have much to work with. There were a couple action scenes that held my attention and had me on edge, but that's about it. All of the Craig/Bond movies besides Casino Royale have been below average. The writers suck. Boring, no plot, tired plot, ok action scenes, average looking Bond girls, dull villains, ok villains, average theme songs. Nothing pulls you in. Nothing exciting or fun. No replay value. Watch Casino Royale again or Mission Impossible. Even Lifetime movies are more thrilling than the last three Bond films! At the end it copies Home Alone which was strange and very underwhelming. The entire movie was just ok. But Bond is not supposed to be just ok! It's supposed to be fun and exciting. They really need to write a good story and stop rushing for the money! It's so embarrassing how they have destroyed their legacy. I don't rush to watch Bond movies anymore. I see it as nonsense now."

","After I watched the 'Skyfall' first time few years ago, I totally forgot what happened in the movie. But I remember just a one dialogue, when Bond shaves with a cut throat razor, 'l like to do some things the old fashioned way.' Now that I re-watched it, I love how beautifully the theme of 'old vs new' is played entirely in the movie.<br/><br/>But there is a little irony. Bond is comparatively younger than the villain, who was also an ex-MI6 operative. An old villain acts as a cyberterrorist and uses advanced technologies. On the other hand, a young Bond tries to stick with the traditional techniques and methods. There is a funny scene, where Bond shows a tiny radio transmitter and tells the villain, 'It's the latest thing from Q-Branch. It's called a radio.' He likes to identify the gadget as an old invention, no matter how advanced it is.<br/><br/>Bond likes to drive an old car because the latest company cars come with the trackers. In the third act, M asks 'where are we going?' Bond literally replies, 'back in time. Somewhere we'll have the advantage.' In his old childhood house 'Skyfall', a housekeeper offers him a knife because there are no firearms but an old rifle. The housekeeper says, 'but if all else fails, sometimes the old ways are the best.' That knife results into the death of the villain. I also watched the 'Spectre' right after it, but the 'Spectre' lacks such fineness."

","I don't completely appreciate Q being so smart but not giving Bond any gadgets (although it does make some sense). But I love the fact that Bond became so realistic and vulnerable. Daniel Craig proves yet again why he is the best James Bond ever, period.<br/><br/>Ever since I watched this movie when it released, I've seen it multiple times, and each time was richly rewarding. The movie was never about how cool it could get. It was about the relationships that threaten the lives of these spies. The idea of maternal relationship overtones between 007 and M (or between M and Raoul Silva) was a masterful idea. One can see the similarities with GoldenEye (which is another Bond classic), but Skyfall is an improved version of the whole ""expendable spy-turned-villain"" trope. Bardem was brilliant as Silva, but it really was Judi Dench who took the cake. She played someone who knew the consequences of her actions, and was willing to live with them. She had the hardest job of all.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the jaw-dropping cinematography by a confirmed legend who goes by the name Roger Deakins. That shot of Bond running on the ice with fireworks behind is one of the best shots in movie history. Great opening sequence, all too haunting (thanks in part to Adele).<br/><br/>I didn't think I would ever say this, but Skyfall was actually one of the best movies of 2012. Certainly more memorable than that year's Oscar nominees for me. It only falls behind Casino Royale for me. Otherwise, it deserves a 10."

","I warn you from the start that my only goal here is a private one. This review is a practice in the art of film watching and certainly not a recommendation of any sorts.<br/><br/>Movie's plot, its only asset, was a clichÃ©. And yet it was not a well-made one. The worst part about it was its credibility, so you couldn't help but feeling stupid several times during the film for watching it, such as Q's stupidity for connecting Silva's computer to their system, Silva's escape with bare hands, the unrealistic hacking ability of Silva, and worst of all the 'Home-Alone' scene to name a few.<br/><br/>As for the actors, although some of them were brilliant, almost all of them shared a halo of artificial professionalism in the movie. It surely had some good elements, especially its music, but plot holes alone were enough to shatter the concentration of the viewer and kill the pleasant parts. Two other things that I enjoyed were the rat story and the visual effect of Silva's face."
"buiger","3","3","6","27 May 2019"," Bitterly disappointed...
","What where the critics thinking?
It really amazes me to read the accolades they poured over this really below average movie, probably the worst Bond film ever...
The only decent (but only decent) part of this movie is the sound and sound editing. Everything else is really, really bad.
Worst of all are the special f/x. Really? A Bond movie with bad special effects? Unfortunately yes. The CGI effects on Silva's 'island' and those at Skyfall mansion are so bad they are ridiculous. In the 21st century we have gotten used to much, much better. I dare to say that the special effects in the Roger Moore movies of the seventies where much better... and they had no computers back then!
Then we come to the screenplay... Oh my god, I do not even know where to begin!
The plot is so full of holes and inconsistencies it is not even funny...
It makes no sense whatsoever. In the beginning the issue is retrieving a stolen list of MI6 agents, but this is completely 'forgotten' half way through the movie...
The villain (Silva, who by the way is so unconvincing it hurts) wants to kill 'M' because of an alleged past betrayal, but basically does everything else but. He could have killed 'M' in a hundred different ways in a dozen situations in the film, but somehow he always chooses 'the hard way'...
In the second half of the film, Bond drags 'M', a frail old lady half way across Britain in order to get away from the villain, with no backup, no outside support (apart from an old and also frail Scottish gamekeeper), only to get her killed at the end of the film... Give me a break!<br/><br/>In my opinion, the main problem with all the recent Bond films (especially those of the 'Daniel Craig era') is that the authors have tried to make the movies 'realistic' which is in antithesis to what Bond is supposed to be.
Bond is supposed to drive cars that double as submarines, he never gets shot, he is never dirty, unshaven or sweating. He is a superhero, not a common mortal. Well, in the new Bond movies, this is all gone, he is dirty, unshaven, ill behaved, etc. All for the sake of 'realism'.
But then, very 'realistically', he gets shot in the chest and subsequently falls of a bridge plunging into a 500 ft. gorge, landing in a river... and survives! Really? How realistic is that?
In this film, the only 'gadgets' Bond gets from the new 'Q' (who by the way is outright laughable in the role) is a Beretta handgun and a radio transmitter. Really? Nowadays, we can all buy those items anywhere for a couple of hundred bucks!
Another major issue with the new Bond films is Daniel Craig.
I think he is the worst Bond in history (even worse than pierce Brosnan). He would probably be better in a 'Die Hard' movie, but not as James Bond!
He does not have any of the Bond stile, the 'Savoir Faire', the charisma...
He doesn't even even have a decent British accent for Christ sake!<br/><br/>To sum it up (but i could really go on for ever), a pitiful plot, horrible special f/x, below par cinematography and a cast of for the most part horribly miscast actors make for one of the worst Bond films ever!
Lets hope the next one is better."

","This is my second favorite Bond movie. I go back and forth with this and Casino Royale for the #1 spot, and even despite Javier Bardem's Joker-esque villain being the best Bond villain of all time, Royale still edges out the win, but just barely. This is the Bond series equivalent of The Dark Knight. Bond and Silva go back and forth like Batman and the Joker. The story delves the deepest into Bond's psyche that we have ever seen. Bond is in the worst shape he's ever been in and is still pushing himself. And I actually prefer his absence of a love interest. M finally dies (I can't stand her character)! The visuals beautiful as always. Craig gave it his ALL in this film. Sadly, I don't think we'll ever see another Bond film of this caliber again from Craig considering Spectre and his lack of desire (I believe he said that he'd rather ""slash his wrsits"") to continue playing this character. We'll have to wait for Bond 25 to find out."
"tabuno","6","3","6","17 January 2019"," Tired and Worn Out
","9 November 2012. This latest Daniel Craig and M movie is long as expected but the attempt at Sean Connery's version of Never Say Never Again (1983) doesn't have the same level of panache, and the attempt to humanize Bond doesn't ring through with all the fireworks and explosions that attempt to dazzle and delight. There are too many plot flaws, such as when Bond is able to negotiate getting back on the train without any trouble, or when M is conveniently without any protection. The crisp, intellectual and rapt focus of Bourne Supremacy (2004) is lost her, especially with the emotive human tragedy subplot themes. Oddly enough this latest Bond movie is both coldly cerebral even though much effort is made to bring back the Roger Moore's Bond humor and the intimate emotional connection seems distant and the demise of one of the femme fatales is really almost an afterthought. There is the remake of Total Recall (2012) location in an decrepit run-down.<br/><br/>In short this version has neither the sizzle nor the humanity that the director and scriptwriter attempted to bring to this movie. This somewhat predictable and pseudo-Predator (1987) low-tech vs. high tech seems to be stitched together scenes that are more warmed over from other movies as well as stretching into new action scenes that just don't resonate with intrigue nor excitement."
"cdjh-81125","10","3","6","30 December 2018"," One of The Greatest Action Films of All Time
","Skyfall is always going to be a special film for me. It's the first Bond film I ever saw in theatres and I vividly remember the hype this film had from Everyone around me. The film was everything I wanted it to be and more, to date it is my favourite Bond film of all time and, for my money, one of the best action films of all time.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Craig's film is that they make Bond into an actual character. He has his weaknesses and strengths and they're all conveyed perfectly in a way that makes him a better protagonist. Daniel Craig is again amazing as Bond it's a much more subtle performance than before that make his more emotional scenes a lot more fulfilling. It also gives the character a past and allows the audience to better understand how he became the man he did.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes is a terrific director, despite him not being know for action before this film I think he absolutely nailed it with this film. The action is absolutely pulse pounding and gritty, there's not a single action scene that isn't great and improves massively over the shaky nonsense that was present in Quantum. The film also looks spectacular thanks to Roger Deakin's cinematography, every single location looks different and every frame is visually alive . Without a doubt the best looking bond film of all time.<br/><br/>A great villains can make or break a bond films so it's so gratifying to say that this film has a truly wonderful one. Silva, played to perfection by Javier Bardem is a magnificent villain and one of bonds best foes. He has a fantastic backstory that really makes him a more personal villain than most villain. It's also great to see another unhinged villain in the bind series. The character is completely insane and it makes for a captivating presence. Bardem nailed his performance, another villain he played perfectly.<br/><br/>More than any other bond film, Skyfall made excellent use of its supporting cast. They all have a part to play big or small. Judi Dench gives her best performance as M in this film, her chemistry with Craig is perfect that makes the film about their relationship just as much as anything else. Moneypenny has a perfect return to the series, with her excellent chemistry with Bond and giving her a backstory as opposed to the fairly one note character that was present in the other iterations. It was also great to see Q back in the franchise as a younger less experienced version of the character. He has an excellent back and forth with Bond that creates for comedy gold and excellent dialogue. It's great to see Ralph Fiennes in the film that establishes him as a new presence in the franchise that makes it more satisfying to see him continue to play of Bond in future films.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a complete masterclass in acting, directing, action sequences and cinematography. It's the perfect action and bond film, my favourite in the series and it's going to take a lot for future films to beat it. It's one of the few films that both old school and new school fans can love and appreciate.<br/><br/>10/10 - A+ (Incredible)"

In every instance of the movie being disjointed it seemed like the director or perhaps the editor was suffering from an attention deficit.<br/><br/>There are glaring issues which can, for some, be washed over with a little ignorance, but overall the story had the apparent appearance of a young child excitedly, if rather poorly retelling it.<br/><br/>There are too many things in this movie that leave me frustrated that I can be anything but unsatisfied with my viewing."

Good action flick, although I do not consider this to be the best Bond film ever or even close. It lacked the fun gag names that makes for great spoofs, but did use Silva, the name of our bad guy from the urban dictionary: Silvas are typically the most handsome men one will ever come across in person.

"thefilmlawyers","10","3","6","4 November 2015"," The villain is not always the bad guy
","The third of the soon-to-be four Daniel Craig depictions of the cool James Bond is Skyfall. It is arguably the best, if not, undeniably the most successful Bond film to date. What made it so freaking awesome you ask? This question has been covered extensively elsewhere. In short, answers range from outstanding acting, excellent character development of the new 007 (ranging over three films), a fantastic plot, a captivating soundtrack, and, of course, a memorable villain. Indeed, Javier Bardem put on a mesmerizing performance as Raoul Silva, a genius cyberterrorist fueled by hatred from his past and vengeance for those he believed wronged him. If it weren't for Bardem, the movie would probably not have done as well as it did.<br/><br/>But, as always, I'm going to discuss what fascinated me the most, a topic which actually takes place in light of the overall discussion about Skyfall. People say the villain is what makes the movie so great, which is true. Raoul Silva is very flamboyant, funny, intelligent, and most of all, tortured, filled with agony from past experiences and the daily reminder of who he's become. I won't reveal too much about his motives, but I will say that you will sympathize with him; he's the villain, but not necessarily the bad guy. He isn't the good guy either, but he is human. He makes no attempt to cover up his insecurities and is quite frank about who hurt him. So let's see: a highly intelligent, talented, and tortured individual, does that sound familiar? I think Skyfall draws many parallels between Silva and Bond which, I believe, get to the core of the theme of the movie.<br/><br/>The most obvious thing that comes to mind when I think about the name ""Skyfall"", is the sky falling. It refers to a period of crisis or calamity. It is a point of great vulnerability and susceptibility to danger. The title of the movie denotes weakness and maybe even fear. It is at the lowest point, the point of no return, of no defence, which brings out the true strength of a person's character. Skyfall shows us that even Bond, the legendary, mind-bogglingly awesome secret agent spy dude, is fallible. He can be weakened. But just because he can be set back, it doesn't mean that he will accept defeat. His goal is to overcome his adversities.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie builds on precisely that theme of vulnerability. MI6 security is breached and several agents die in a bombing of agency offices. M watches in horror from her car. A message is sent to M's laptop indicating to her that the perpetrator knew exactly where she'd be, entailing that she could have been killed if the bomber wished for it. The agency is then forced to relocate to back up facilities underground. Bond himself is weakened both physically and mentally from a mission that takes place in the opening scene. He is accidentally shot and presumed dead by Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris). But he survives the shooting and retreats to a life of alcoholism and sex by the beach. This is highly indicative of his emotional dissociation with 007, and the desire to take a break. But, of course, he returns upon news of the explosion at MI6.<br/><br/>There are plenty more examples further underscoring the ""falling sky"" theme. One is a government enquiry into the conduct of M and the legitimacy of the 00 division. Another is Bond's return to MI6 as a different man. He's clearly weaker and has trouble passing basic physical and mental evaluations. But the most crucial implementation of the Skyfall theme takes place at the finale. The climax is too good for me to describe, and too important to spoil. But I will say this: it involves Bond and M (and a third character whom I won't mention because it would reveal too much about the location and thus spoil it for some), completely isolated from the confines of MI6, left with only their perseverance, Bond's training, Home Alone prowess, and care and commitment to each other's wellbeing. It takes place literally at nightfall, with the pitch black sky casting its shadow onto Bond and M's ultimate test of life. But they show no fear. They peer at the inevitable with steadfast eyes which cry out ""bring it on, do your worst!""<br/><br/>The worst arrives. Destruction ensues. A tragedy is suffered. Silva is destructive and self-destructive. He does not only foresee his own demise but plans for it. He wants to go down with his revenge. He has no need for life and no greater purpose. That's what separates him from Bond. Bond does have a purpose. He has commitments to M, to the agency, and to his country. But their similarities are also uncanny. Past traumas, a connection with M, and emotional vulnerability link them together. Both find themselves in particularly impossible situations (although how Silva lands himself at his low points is also a relevant fact which happens to be a spoiler), and manage to escape them. But their common weakness ultimately ends up being their emotional injuries, a message very clearly delivered to the audience by the location of the final showdown. Bond is forced to confront and maybe heal his wounds while Silva confronts the person he blames for his pain. Who wins in the end? I wouldn't be able to answer the question even if I did spoil the ending. It's as much a conflict with oneself as it is conflict amongst each other. Perhaps that's the point; at the end of a crisis, nobody comes out a winner, only casualties of humanity's flaws and permanently changed lives.<br/><br/>A masterpiece, A+.<br/><br/>Check out our other reviews at http://thefilmlawyers.wordpress.com"

","Skyfall was exciting in many ways. It started off with a thrilling opening in Istanbul Turkey, where James Bond is chasing a man who has stolen an important hard drive filled with revealing information regarding agents of MI6. After the train chase and the shooting of Bond. He eventually comes back to MI6 presenting himself as alive and ready to fight the villain. However It seemed to me that it was a little bit convenient for Bond to find CNN in English on a non English island but those are minor details. The problem about Skyfall was that it lacked a lot of action and was also a bit a slow at times. However, I must say that the villain played by Javier Bardem was great. As a Bond fan the one thing that I mostly look forward to before a 007 movie is the villain, and certainly Sam Mendes with Javier Bardem he served us well. Regarding the lack of action it seemed that at the final fight contained all the action that was needed in the movie was compacted in the end. However it was a great ending to a good Bond movie. *By the way it is the first bond movie where the villain achieves his main aim, which was to kill M*. I cannot wait for the next Bond."
"bowmanblue","9","3","6","2 April 2015"," It's won me over
","I'm one of those people who despises Daniel Craig's 'Bond era.' Not because I don't like him as an actor, or that I think he isn't the right man to play Bond. It's because I pine for the old days of loads of over-the-top gadgets, silly stunts and cheeky witticisms, delivered with a wry smile (or a raised eyebrow). In short, I liked pre-Craig Bonds.<br/><br/>I watched both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace and barely considered them entries in the Bond franchise, yet I still came back for more and watched Skyfall.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did. Bond is back. Yes, it was still gritty with a fairy revolutionary narrative structure (well, for a Bond film, anyway), but they've finally got round to inputting a little bit more humour in there. I'm not talking about gags all the way, but the (re)introduction of Q and Moneypenny are long overdue, as - like always - they play their part in verbally sparring with Bond (and sometimes putting him in his place). Plus the film-makers seemed to have remembered to play the 'Bond theme' a lot more. I felt this certainly helps remind me that I'm not watching just another 'Bourne' film starring Matt Damon or that other bloke who took over.<br/><br/>Basically, I won't go into details about the plot too much. If you don't know already, it's not about someone in a volcano lair, trying to take over the world. If anything, it's much smaller, but better with it. It certainly brings global terrorism down to a personal level.<br/><br/>Skyfall is definitely the best of the (new) Bonds.

It seems that way at least.<br/><br/>This movie follows the spirit of Casino Royale (2006) , with the exception that script writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade , joined by veteran John Logan (Star Trek: Nemesis), skillfully adjust Bond at last into the complete picture of the Post 9-11 world. <br/><br/>Bond (Daniel Craig), is as good as ever , as is some really exceptionally support in the effort to shift staff , owing to the discreet need to promptly exit Judi Dench from future production. Craig and Dench are fantastic together , and the support characters of Gareth Mallory (Voldemort..er Ralph Fiennes)and Money Penny (Naomi Harris) add to the film in wonderful depth. Once critic , director Sam Mendes , Directs sharp and yields great film flow that slows only slightly at the films end.<br/><br/>Adapted well once again.<br/><br/>Four Stars(of 5.)"

","Production Budget: $200 million World Total Gross: $1,1 billion<br/><br/>The reviews especially the one star ones are fun to read as people dissect the plot holes, I grade things a little differently since no Bond movie has ever been believable....I grade them on how much they make me laugh especially the outrageous bad women and villains who used to work for Spectre. Yes, I love the bad guys. But also the British stuffiness well any of the outrageous stuff is often funny.<br/><br/>This movie did not make me laugh once did it bore me? (my second criteria). Yes about half way through I started looking to see how much time was left...and by the time they got to Scotland it took a lot of restraint not to fast forward it. The villain in this one was fun but you know his fate. He was the only interesting character.<br/><br/>This movie was very successful so what do I know? Cost $200 million and grossed $1.1 billion. I notice that there is the requisite Shanghai scenes indicating China is an important market.<br/><br/>It's probably an above average Bond movie....so I give it a 6.5 It gets however an extra star for Bond saying ""Who said it would be the first time"" -- So 7.5 an honorary 8 rounded up--<br/><br/>Craig sure looks like drink and drugs have taken a toll--bulbous nose and all--they better dry him out good--or he will be retired like Dench. Ironic that he recently played a role he has now become: Flashbacks of a Fool (an older actor ruined by drugs and drink and general debauchery) Yes, I know he also had sort of that role in this movie...but look close they didn't need much makeup to make him look the part.<br/><br/>I am sorry I did laugh once, Dench made me laugh when she said to Craig about his Aston Martin...""I suppose that will be completely inconspicuous"". She played the perfect M even has a thick brow like a male.<br/><br/>RECOMMEND"

","Not a bad bond in the least. <br/><br/>When compared to Quantam of Solace, this Bond seems profound and phenomenal. That being said I had some issues with the flick.<br/><br/>For one, Craig's bond get's more broody and apathetic in each movie. While some would argue that that type of Bond reflects the Flemming Bond, I compare each Bond reincarnation to previous film versions. <br/><br/>The direction in this movie made Craig seem ruthless and cold. It would have been suited better for a Layer Cake sequel (although that would be impossible). <br/><br/>Some of the dialogue fell flat for me, as it was awkward and felt rushed. <br/><br/>But what was great about this Bond was the reintroduction of classic borderline cheesy fight scene's which worked very well. <br/><br/>TL;DR: A good flick with some odd directorial choices and writing that didn't mesh with. Lot's of fun, and a great summer rental, or download, or...... -_-"
"goettel-881-904368","6","3","6","25 June 2013"," Not too bad
","After hearing a lot of glowing reports on this, I thought I'd give it a spin.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a Bond movie, but more so, and less so. More so, because the story is fluff, the (female) characters are instantly forgettable and Bond's dialog is the standard sequence of somewhat fun but trite one liners.<br/><br/>It's less of a Bond movie because Bond is in bad shape. And I'm not talking about the main plot device either - from the first moments of the movie he can't hit a a single target with his mainstay Walther PPK. He constantly gets outwitted and outmaneuvered. His superior, M, is so stupid that she carries a torch around at the finale, evidently just so the bad guy can track her easily. That bad guy is laughable too - not badly acted, mind (some descent acting there) - but laughable in his motivations, his plans and their execution. And it's not in a fun Bond way either.<br/><br/>Simple fact is: Bond is a superhero, and a very shabby one. He needs his spit and polish to shine, and breaking him down, as this movie does to show us a catharsis of his character, obviously to reposition him to better face market demands in 2012, robs him of his purpose. Bond needs to be superior - he IS the superhuman without need of aliens, mythology or magic.<br/><br/>And that is the only positive thing I took away from Skyfall: that at the end, we see him back in the old office, ready for some REAL work.<br/><br/>Skyfall serves a purpose, and that purpose has been met - just. But as a singular movie, it's very, very forgettable, and that is unforgivable for a character potentially as epic as Bond, James Bond."

","This is not the best Bond movie I have seen but the story is unique and this film does add some new twists in it. Daniel Craig is back as this is his third James Bond movie. There are some good action sequences that make up for the typical Bond formula of a movie. I find this Bond movie to be more of a drama side to it as Daniel Craig's character expresses more emotion in this film. I did think this movie ran a little too long and there were a little too many dull scenes that seem they didn't need to be in the movie. The movie does run a little long like I said as right when you think it may be over it still keeps going. This movie does still have the classic vibes that goes in many Bond movies as there's the classic car and the opening action sequence. I think this film can definitively improve though. This movie is worth watching but take that it's not the typical Bond series movie."

","A former agent with a personal vendetta against M goes postal against MI6. It seems this franchise has undergone a number of reboots in the last couple of decades in attempts to stay relevant half a century after it was launched. Some of the changes make no sense, seeming to have been implemented in a vacuum, ignoring the preceding films. Other than long- term changes, this one is more low-tech than recent entries in this series, and this is a refreshing change. The final showdown between Bond and the villain takes place at an isolated mansion, and is a throwback to an old-fashioned action movie. In his third outing, Craig appears to be becoming more comfortable as 007. Bardem makes an amusing if goofy villain."

","I am not a huge James Bond person, in fact I've only seen a few Bond movies. However, I must say they are a work of art. The characters and storyline must have required a lot of thought. Huge movie legacies like this or The Godfather never gets old or played out. And as I said before, Skyfall is a work of art. Unfortunaly, I cannot say that about many movies. Honestly, very few films deserve the honor (in my opinion) of being call ""art"". The thing that made Skyfall good was not the action or the suspense, although that was good as well. It was the simple fact that it keep the 50 year old name of James Bond alive. You didn't see all those unnecessary changes and mix ups, like some directors like to do. That I think made this move a good one to watch."

","Skyfall, I watched the movie in the cinema before. It was outstanding. Everything, from the song sang by Adele, Skyfall, the choice of different locations to film the movie, the effects from camera and video shots in the movie, are perfectly matched to produce a successful movie, which is capable of winning at least a Oscar award for one of its components. Moreover, the storyline is unique and sensational. The title of the movie, the song sang by Adele with a mysterious tone, the name being mentioned by a character and the fictitious place where James Bond was born and raised as a adapted child by his adapted parents after his biological parents died, all of these are linked to the purpose of the personal self of James Bond's identity with his fictitious enemy, Silva. In the end, as usual, James Bond and the Bond Girls are still the iconic figures of the 50 year series who fight off bad guys and the license to kill them whenever they feel it is justice to do it. Skyfall, the best James Bond Movie I ever watched in the 50 year series!"
"robchat","7","3","6","14 February 2013"," how many times can you re-invent Bond and get away with it?
","READ THIS AFTER YOU HAVE WATCHED THE FILM TO COMPARE OPINIONS <br/><br/>As a huge James Bond fan, this is what I think ...<br/><br/>In a nutshell.<br/><br/>The first two halves/acts are great (and are definitely James Bond) The intro has a very exciting spy feel, Bonds resurrection and the bad guy being such a good actor (and hitting on Bond - loved that) all work excellently.<br/><br/>My first small criticism is what was the point of the Bond girl. He shags her and then she dies. He could have at least saved her life.<br/><br/>Then everything is fine and tense again. In the cell like Hannibal Lector. Liked that too.<br/><br/>Bad guy escapes and there is more tense action - all good all good.<br/><br/>Second small criticism is the tube train crash. Over the top - that's fine, but why is there no one in the train. I hate that! It's like The A-Team. No one dies :p Then there is a tense shoot out in the court (which is also good) I like the poetry. I liked the themes of old and new running through it ... all so good.<br/><br/>BUT WAIT ...<br/><br/>now I'm starting to get confused.<br/><br/>UP TO THIS POINT WE HAVE A FANTASTIC BOND FILM !!!! ...<br/><br/>But then a couple of things happened: <br/><br/>First - we find out that the master plan of the bad guy was to infiltrate MI6 so that he could locate M and set up a scenario so that he could walk into a court and shoot her. Hmm. That was his masterplan? Bond has broken into M's house twice now. Why didn't the bad guy just break into her house and kill her? OK. Maybe he wanted to punish MI6 and kill M publicly, but still, his masterplan was a bit rubbish. And in the end he just goes to the countryside to kill her in the middle of nowhere anyway.<br/><br/>Second - the third act ... = the big question mark. Do I like it or not? It's not Bond. You are right! Bond takes Sean Connery's car and drives M back home to Scotland for some MacGyver action. Random old Scottish bloke still hanging around and big shoot out. It was OK, but just OK. Not much spy stuff, not very Bond at all, and I just didn't feel the sadness when M died. I was a little surprised ..<br/><br/>(as a side note, I also know the history of M's relationship to Bond. In The World is Not Enough. She trusts him. In Die Another Day she doesn't give a crap about him. Then Casino Royale and the re-boot. She doesn't trust him. Quantum of Solace .. doesn't mind if he gets killed but starting to trust him. In Skyfall they are best mates!)<br/><br/>This would have worked better with a James Bond adventure between Quantum and Skyfall to establish this relationship. And that's the problem I had. I want a proper Bond adventure! We all want a proper Bond adventure! Stop reinventing yourself in every film!! <br/><br/>Let me explain ..... the final scene. Now I did like the idea of killing M, introducing Q and gadgets, bringing back Moneypenny and finishing the film with modern Bond in the situation of the original old Bond. I thought that was a really nice idea and it worked well.<br/><br/>BUT although I like it, I think that the Daniel Craig Bond's have been a bit lost ...<br/><br/>Casino Royale - FANTASTIC (one of the best action films ever along with Dark Knight). At the end, we have our new James Bond ready for Bond adventures.<br/><br/>Quantum of Solace - oh no wait. This is part two of Casino Royale. Bond is not Bond yet. First he needs to find his zen and then he is Bond. Forgive this odd Casino Royale add-on. At the end - Bond is ready. Yeh!<br/><br/>Skyfall - Bond is Bond look! Yipeee. Oh no wait. He was Bond for the intro ... but now he has apparently been Bond too long and he's done in. When did that happen? It seems he needs to learn some more and go through some more ... and now at the end of this film he is ready to be Bond.<br/><br/>Basically, I liked Skyfall a lot but what was missing was some normal Bond adventures between Casino Royale/Quantum of Solace story arch and this one. If they could have squeezed at least one James Bond adventure in between then Skyfall would have made more sense and worked better for me.<br/><br/>I don't need to see Bond becoming Bond in every film! He was already Bond before Daniel Craig came along! So now I am ready for Daniel Craig to be Bond.<br/><br/>In Skyfall Bond was all knackered and out of shape and lost his will to be a spy which was all good, but he hasn't done anything yet! We are just supposed to assume that in between Casino Royale/Quantum of Solace and Skyfall he has been doing lots of Bond stuff so that M and he have had time to develop a very close relationship.<br/><br/>Again, all good ideas but we wanted to see some of that first! Anyway, the ending is good and I hope now that they just give us some straight forward Bond adventures with clever story lines instead of trying to develop the new Bond every time.<br/><br/>That's what I think :-)"

","Skyfall. An interesting title, yet very fitting once you reach the end. The film opens with a stunning action scene. In fact, it's so stunning that I believe it isn't surpassed throughout the rest of the film. The climax is cool, but it really isn't anything we haven't seen in other action movies. The story is pretty well done. It's really a tale about a strained relationship between Bond and His boss M. There's also a new villain. Javier Bardem's Silva was good, not great. He was certainly better than the last Bond villain. I felt he was a little too much like the Joker from The Dark Knight. I tried to shake the feeling but it kept coming up, especially when he actually does a couple of things exactly like him. Don't get me wrong though, he is a good villain despite some flaws. Daniel Craig was also good. He played the part of an older, more vulnerable bond. It was a good comeback story of sorts. He did some awesome stuff. A scene on train and a chase on an elevator had me in disbelief, in a good way. You won't be disappointed if you're coming for action. One disappointing aspect was the ""Bond Girls"". I thought they were kind of shoe-horned in just because. They didn't add much. Bond's chemistry with Eve was non-existent. Casino Royale was much better at being believable in that department. I also noticed a lot of one-liners from all the characters. Many of them fell flat, one in particular ""Welcome to Scotland"" didn't draw a single laugh from the crowd. It was a minor problem, but it did distract some from the serous tone. In the end though this is still a great film. Thank heavens it was miles better than Quantum of Solace. In my opinion it wasn't the best bond ever, but still one of the best. See it.<br/><br/>tkubas1.wordpress.com"
"math_duarte","9","3","6","19 January 2013"," James Bond has evolved
","I think many were expecting to see ""explosive pens"", invisible cars, fights in outer space ... Well, that James Bond is dead! And died to birth a Bond more interesting. Today, James Bond returned to being a spy realistic and serious, referring to the good times of Sean Connery (Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger and Thunderball) and Timothy Dalton (in his two films), moving away from the stereotype created with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan (Brosnan even gave us entertaining movies, but without any content). Daniel Craig is James Bond like the books by Ian Fleming. It is a believable hero, not limited to sequences and surreal excesses of jokes and nasty beats. And Craig has, in this film, his best performance as 007, well being stronger on paper. Javier Bardem gives life to the best villain of the franchise and the first conversation between Bond and Silva is to devote himself as one of the best moments of the film. In fact, the entire cast is wonderful. The speeches of Q are spectacular, the participation of M is fantastic and Eve gives a more seasoned in history. The strength of the film comes from the able direction of Sam Mendes who knew very well condense action scenes and dialogs. The film is packed with action scenes without a brain. They happen when it is necessary. The final part of ""Skyfall"" is to cause nostalgia to any fan of James Bond. In short: very careful if you want to see this movie! If you watch it expecting a lot of action unnecessary, you will be disappointed greatly. As the Q said in the film, James Bond has evolved!!"

","Bond is back... both literally and figuratively. The first two Daniel Craig era Bond films took the franchise in a distinctly different direction. They were both good movies but somehow weren't fully Bond. Craig's Bond is a new Bond for a new age; tougher, edgier, and more serious. Bond had lost some of his charm and pretty much all of his sense of fun. Going into Skyfall I was resigned that my and my father's Bond was completely gone. It was a pleasant surprise to see I was wrong.<br/><br/>Skyfalll hits the sweet-spot between Octopussy and Casino Royale. It preserves the energy and grittiness of the new Bond but brings back just enough of the old Bond's levity to remind the audience that Bond is supposed to be fun.<br/><br/>Beyond the solid script and heart stopping action, Skyfall is far and away the most visually striking Bond movie yet. Whoever is is doing the location scouting and production design also deserves special recognition. Skyfall is the perfect way to celebrate 50 years of Bond. It pays homage to the storied history of 007 while pioneering a new trail for Bond to venture for years to come.<br/><br/>Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars<br/><br/>... and this has been The Mack Minute.

","Of course you have heard nil but good things about the latest Bond movie, and let me assure you that they are nothing if not understatements. From the first scene we can see the fabulously filmed, action -packed intro's that Bond fans love so much, followed by a beautifully written intro sequence song performed by Adele. A key aspect of this film was the superb range of locations Bond is dropped in, from the urban, city lit-skyscrapers of Singapore to the rural moorlands of Scotland, viewers will never be short of a stunning piece of scenery every so often. An excellent cast really made this film the 9/10 it so definitely deserves, giving is the wonderful acting from Ralph Fiennes and Javier Bardem, who both give their characters that extra prominence. Now we all understand that a Bond film needs an imposingly brilliant antagonist that questionably Quantum of Solace was lacking However Skyfall really hit the nail of the head with the character of Silva, a sadistically, terrifyingly cynical baddie that really stands out from most villains. In summary, Skyfall was definitely the highlight of the film aspect of 2012, dominating the likes of Batman and the Avengers, making it a well- worth experience that will leave you thirsting for a suit on your body and a gun in your hands."

","I live in the UAE and the movie was released here today for some very fortunate reasons and i managed to watch it. <br/><br/>First of all, it is quite different from your regular bond movie. there is certainly a lot more drama. it also have a quite personal story. even bond's past is looked at a bit. about his parents and where he grow up. I personally liked that. It gives him more of a human look. rather than just a killing machine. <br/><br/>Second thing i want to talk about is the acting. I am now completely convinced that Javier Bardem is a genius. if I had any doubts before, now they're gone. he was amazing. easily one of the best villains on Bond. also I think Daniel Craig's performance as James Bond was the best one so far. he did really well. Sam Mendez's directing was a pure beauty. loved it. I recommend this to everyone. even if you have never watched a Bond movie. cheers."
"sunraider","5","10","31","9 November 2012"," Disappointing
","I ran out to see this film because the reviews have been so enthusiastic here in the US. I loved Casino Royale, the only Bond film that I truly liked, but QOS was so bad that I wasn't sure what to expect here. Sadly, this film did not live up to expectations, and I can point to the exact moment this film went downhill: the introduction of Javier Bardem's clownish, cartoonish, over-the-top villain, Silva. Casino Royale gave us a baddie, Le Chifre, who was smooth and deadly but also grounded in reality. The Silva character is unwatchable. He whines about M having betrayed him, makes a pass at Bond, puts in motion a silly cat-and-mouse game that makes no sense, and comes across as someone so out of touch with reality that it's hard to see him as a criminal mastermind with a cadre of capable men working for him. You would think some of them would start to notice that the boss had a few too many screws loose and would cut and run. <br/><br/>The plot takes a nosedive with Silva's introduction and even the action sequences loose luster. No cool parqour (sp?)sequences or tension- filled poker game of wits. I was surprised how bored I became as the film dragged on. Even the climatic sequence, which is set in Bond's abandoned family estate in remote Scotland, is tedious, unoriginal, and flat-out boring. Rarely has a Bond film ending been so anti-climatic and ho-hum. Although there are some nice elements in this film that give one hope for future installments, such as the introduction of a younger, tech savvy Quartermaster or ""Q"" and Ralph Fiennes as a bureaucrat initially at odds with M., overall this is a mediocre film, which saddens me as Craig's version of Bond is still my favorite."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","17","60","27 October 2012"," One of the best Bond movies, and for me Daniel Craig's best outing
","I have a fondness for James Bond and for most of the movies. My favourite Bond is Sean Connery and my personal favourite Bond film is Goldfinger. To cut to the chase I do like Daniel Craig as Bond, he is very charismatic and has truly magnetic eyes. Skyfall for me is his best outing, I liked Casino Royale and didn't care at all for Quantum of Solace, and one of the best of the series. Craig himself is spot on, both of the qualities I mentioned are here, and he brings to the role charm and sophistication yet ruthlessness and grit, paying homage to all the Bonds before him. Craig is not the only actor in the cast who impresses. Albert Finney is always watchable and here is no exception, and Naomie Harris is very alluring. It was nice to see Ralph Fiennes too, who I've always liked and in recent years I have wished that there were roles that played to his strengths rather than waste them and thankfully his performance displays the former.<br/><br/>Even better are Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. Dench is outstanding as M, who is more complex than she is before, then again I wasn't surprised as she has always set a high standard in everything she's been in. Silva I don't think is quite in the same league as Goldfinger, Blofeld, Rosa Klebb and Jaws, but more than holds his own, as he is ruthless and always has a plan. Almost reminiscent of a lecherous and somewhat campy Hannibal Lector, Bardem has all the best lines and brings a sinister edge to his performance. I have always had a fondness for the Bond girls especially Pussy Galore, Solitaire, Vesper Lynde and Elektra King. Severine is a worthy Bond girl, enigmatic and the very meaning of glamorous.<br/><br/>Skyfall is the epitome of class in every other way as well. The cinematography is very polished, while the scenery is breathtaking. Anybody expecting action scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat, you will not be disappointed, as the pre-credits sequence in the Grand Baszar(Istanbul) is truly thrilling. Fans will also love the inclusion of the original Astin Martin DB5. Like with Craig's performance, it was another successful homage to the previous Bond movies. Sam Mendes as director was a risk, his directing could either have been great or awful. But it was a risk that paid off, as Mendes keeps everything perfectly, having a style that plays to his forte while incorporating the classic Bond elements to great effect.<br/><br/>He is helped further by a hugely compelling story, the action is beautifully judged but what was also special was how human the drama felt. Even the Brosnan films or the previous two Craig outings didn't have the complex relationship between Bond and M, that is done to intense and moving measures. The ending was a complete surprise, in a shocking and heart-rending way. The theme song was also wonderful, maybe not quite classic status like the those of Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, Diamonds are Forever and On Her Majesty's Secret Service but infinitely better than those of Die Another Day, Quantum of Solace and Octopussy. Singer Adele sings meaningfully, and it is on the whole very emotionally charged, which I loved.<br/><br/>The score is also excellent, John Barry it isn't, then again I wasn't expecting it to be at that standard. It succeeds on bringing the right amount of thrills, pathos and jauntiness. And to top it off, the script is very intelligently and wittily written, Bardem has the best of them but everybody has lines to care about without coming across as questionable. Overall, a triumphant Bond outing in every way, after Quantum of Solace I was dubious but after a film this good I have no need to worry now. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"judex1066","8","6","16","13 November 2012"," Why are IMDb Skyfall reviews seemingly so out of touch
","I liked this movie a lot. I am some what surprised by the number of negative reviews. Especially when Rotten Tomatoes is reporting high critical and audience numbers (91 percent). I suspect the Daniel Craig is Not Bond group is over-represented here and trying to flood the IMDb site with bad reviews.<br/><br/>Get over it. The Bond franchise has moved on from its descent into lame self parody. As one who started watching the series from its inception, it has been a slowly disintegrating formula beginning with Diamonds Are Forever (admittedly with the occasional bright spot).<br/><br/>Craig brings gravitas back to the series. Skyfall was a great action film with nice human moments. Come on you guys, you had decades of the slapstick, cardboard, comic book Bond. It is nice to have a James Bond with a some sort of relation to actual human feelings and failings. Skyfall has those human elements in spades."
"Fractology","7","6","16","10 November 2012"," Good storyline, makes Bond a more realistic character
","Without getting into spoiler details here, I liked the detour that the producers chose to take from the typical Bond storyline. The movie is focused on Bond and his relationship with M as well as M's past. If you are a Bond fan this is a must-see movie that fills-in a few gaps in Bond's history and a fine celebration of the 50th anniversary of the franchise. Positioning Bond as a human being who is aging and has limits was a fine idea given we that we are celebrating half a century of movies. I also liked the increased use of humor - it was just right, not over-done. Several movie goers clapped at the end of the movie and at first I thought ""what is wrong with these people, it is not a Broadway show..."" but eventually I clapped a few times myself. I recommend it."
"arnieiam","10","6","16","9 November 2012"," Bold, emotional and still a Bond film
","Daniel Craig isn't a traditional actor to play Bond therefore his Bond films aren't traditional either (yes even that abomination Quantum of Solace).<br/><br/>Even though Casino Royale is the best of the Craig series, it lacked the certain Bond clichés we all love. Here we actually have some throwbacks in this reboot franchise. So there is something for the die hard Bond fans.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this film is fantastic. Very organic, sophisticated, the bickering between Bond and his superiors and his colleagues is there, and we actually hear ""Bond. James Bond"".<br/><br/>The characters in this film are solid and multi-dimensional. We get introduced to a young Q, who actually does more than just introduce gadgets. Tia Dalma (I forget the black chick's name) plays Eve Mo- ahem a fellow agent and you actually like her and the sexual tension between her and Bond. M here is a huge part of the story. She no longer is just the MI6 director who barks order and tells Bond off, she's one of the foci of the story. There is a really beautiful woman who's another Bond girl, but I found this one sort of forgettable. Like well into the film I forgot about her.<br/><br/>And the villain. Wow his mullet was the most menacing thing I've ever seen. Javier Bardem plays Silva and as you can tell from the trailer he's a former agent. He's not a villain with a Machiavellian scheme, he's just out for (an elaborate sick, twisted) revenge. He's a great villain and he doesn't require a Persian cat or a hollowed out volcano.<br/><br/>The story is much more dense here. Bond is given a lot more dimension like Dalton's. Unlike Timothy Dalton's Bond, he still has a deadpan sense of humour though. In the first two acts you get a general Bond film. In the third act however it becomes incredibly emotional.<br/><br/>The ending of the film will remind a lot of people of Hard Target and Home Alone, this wasn't intentional but it happened. Nonetheless it's a very different kind of climax, and its refreshing to see one that doesn't take place in a villain's lair or submarine etc.<br/><br/>One thing that will strike you are the visuals. Each shot has a rich blend of colours. The cinematographer and director were very meticulous here, job well done. I guess it's because the director's the guy who did American Beauty. So for those of you who knock digital film, well there you go.<br/><br/>50 years into this series, and I'm pretty sure Ian Fleming would be proud."

","After 50 years of Bond many will want Skyfall to be a cookie cutter movie of bikinis and smart weapons, quick quips, and fast cards and faster cars. And that is fun. But it is not Skyfall. <br/><br/>In a confusing world, where cyberspace decides the fate we see Bond is a living in a grey world where good and bad are no longer absolutes - the villain (Bardem) is again much darker than any before and is a surprisingly complex character. Bond is shown deliberately not on top of his game - this is a film about the borderlines, the shadows, and reality of the spy game - well, to a certain extent, after all it is Bond, and there are a number of set scenes with motorbikes and trains that are as good as anything in any Bond film.<br/><br/>At 2.5 hours this is easily the longest Bond film to date - and it is also a character study - perhaps we don't really want to know Bond - we want him to be a superhero and fun and not human. Here he is human and the effort shows."

","Gosh, what a difference it makes when you bring in real artists!<br/><br/>Here we have essentially the same formula as always, produced by the same Broccoli thick heads as usual. Also, as usual, the production was 'troubled,' with fundamental changes occurring well into production. Plus for the first time we have blatant, distracting and excessive product placement. But the project works for me because the center of gravity has shifted.<br/><br/>Not every sequence could be affected by Deakins. The outside action sequences require conventions that are rather inflexible artistically. I doubt he even saw them. But boy, what a difference a master cinematographer can make in scenes that actually drive the narrative. Two struck me as masterworks of set design combined with camera-work. One was the scene in the glass skyscraper in Shanghai, including the establishing shots. There was much of Orson Welles' 'Lady from Shanghai in that, but done with more energy, and yes even competence.<br/><br/>The other sequence is where Bond, bound to a chair, meets Silva in a strange computer room on his island. Where the Shanghai sequence was without words, this is full of them. The set is largely defined by what is not in it, including the supposed supercomputer equipment used to control pretty much anything. More about that in a minute; the item of interest here is the use of space after we have seen that most of the skin of the buildings has been compromised. Much has been made of how director Mendes has been influenced by Nolan. It is obvious in these two sequences in tone and design, but I see a bit of genius here. A lot of risk in a gadgety genre, where too much information is the norm.<br/><br/>Unlike Tarantino who borrows without improving, these sequences at least do add something to the cinematic vocabulary. I see this vocabulary as one of modulated hesitation mixed with unexpected omission. Superficially, it is all about making things a little less straightforward than usual. The way lines are delivered; the way spaces are defined; the balances of greys (where the magic of the lens is enhanced by digital manipulation purely for tone). But it goes deeper than that, as deep as the contract filmmakers have with our preceptive mechanisms.<br/><br/>The convention uses a predictable rhythm to deliver information, mostly visual, either in spatial texture, objects or edits. When you dance around that rhythm, the viewer starts to worry whether he/she will miss something. When you do actually omit some details, even if they are trivial, it increases the eidetic anxiety and drives the viewer to be more engaged.<br/><br/>I think we can now expect Nolan to be as incorporated in new films as Hitchcock was in his day.<br/><br/>I cannot let this film pass without mentioning the computer issues.<br/><br/>The trope here is one we see a lot — a supervillian who seems to be able to predict every move years ahead and put in place all the parts to flawlessly execute a complex plan. This, I believe, came to us as a reverse noir — assuming you understand noir the way I do: as control over the universe within the film so that profound coincidences are arranged for our entertainment and poor, mostly innocent souls in that world are jerked around. I built a model of narrative folding around this understanding.<br/><br/>A modern version of this has a character on-screen with the same power to manipulate reality, in essence allowing our hero (and usually his girl) to defeat the noir control. It is nice enfolding that allows a talented filmmaker some clever options. I remark on this because this fellow is a hacker, and in fact does all his work via the internet, excepting the one planned killing. Usually, this is where I go nuts.<br/><br/>Either it pretends to be real, in which case the depictions grate because film demands that they do it wrong. Or it is clearly cartoonish (like most movie violence), in which case I am convinced I could do it better. But here we go into uncharted territory. This is Christopher Nolan reality, a version of the real world that is abstracted differently than usual. The balance between references to reality and those to genre are different and ambiguous. The actor is superb at being the fulcrum of this balance. Add in that noir complication and we are playing a different game, not one of computer magic in the hacker sense, but computer magic in the cinematic CGI sense.<br/><br/>Here is your clue. Our villain is never seen actually working on a machine. This is important because he is partly merged us as viewer and his bending of the world is filmmaking magic. Q on the other hand has to have all the trappings of a computer worker. Sure, he is supposed to be good, but good only at machinery inside the movie world proper. The best he can do is leave 'breadcrumbs' to Skyfall Lodge. He is a simple stereotype, where Silva is not.<br/><br/>So it is odd that things shift depending on whose world you are in. I am a computer guy and for me Silva is entirely believable in principle, even while standing in his bizarrely unrealistic computer headquarters. And this even though we know he is an old field agent, guys not known for smarts.<br/><br/>With Q on the other hand, we see what he does, including stuff supposed to be from Silva. It is all bogus, as screwy as 'Tron.' I think Mendes decided to make him this way rather than to use the approach Ridley Scott did in his recent Alien film.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

From the awful theme tune (Adele doing a very poor impression of Shirley Bassey), to the so called action scenes, dialogue, totally unbelievable baddie.

"Aaron1375","10","5","13","15 December 2012"," After a lengthy absence Bond is back with a vengeance!
","After I first watched this film I felt it was a very good Bond film, but I was unsure just where to place it in the three Daniel Craig Bond films. Initially, I was disappointed by the fact the organization set up in the previous two films was not mentioned or used. However, the more I thought about this Bond film, the more apparent it became that this was indeed Craig's finest Bond movie yet. This is due to the increased screen time of M played once again by Judi Dench and this film basically revolves around her character as it is a bit of a farewell film for her. Sure, the organization was not used this time, but after Dr. No and From Russia with Love Spetre was given a film off for Goldfinger. So I can see them once again having James Bond face off against this mysterious group again in the next film. So basically this Bond movie was great with great action which is usually a given and an emotionally charged ending that was not expected.<br/><br/>The film has Bond trying to chase down a man who has vital information in his possession. Suffice to say, this Bond movie has one heck of a chase right from the get go. Unfortunately, Bond is nearly killed right from the get go as well as he is hit by friendly fire. He later turns up, but not before the information he failed to retrieve is used to attack MI6 headquarters. Someone has a grudge against M, and James Bond is on the case to track them down. He has to go to the Orient where he discovers a former 00 agent is the cause for the turmoil, this man is not what he appears to be as he is cold and calculating to the extreme. Bond soon uses M as bait as he takes her to his old family home, ""Skyfall"". There he will face off against this madman hellbent on revenge against M.<br/><br/>If I were to have a complaint about this one, it is the villain. He is good, but they do not develop him quite enough. He needs more screen time as Javier Bardem does a good job with the relatively small amount of screen time this villain receives. However, that is about the only complaint I can muster against this film. I loved how they brought back two staple characters from the movies prior to the Daniel Craig films, and while Judi Dench will be missed, I like her replacement. To me, it almost felt like the Sean Connery days as they were ending this one...and that is a good thing as Connery is my favorite Bond. Granted, Craig is close to tying him at this point.<br/><br/>This film was amazing. At first I did not realize how good it was, but it sticks with you long after it is over unlike so many other films that just vanish from your brain a couple of hours after viewing. It was also good how Judi Dench's M had such a major role...I loved the scene with them in the classic Bond car. It is a shame it took so long for them to get Bond back on the big screen, but I am happy to report that the film was everything one expects from a James Bond film and a bit more. Hopefully, we will not have to wait four years for the next installment, and perhaps the organization set up in Quantum returns."

","To start out let me say I'm not a Bond film fan. I like action movies though the Bond films never appealed to me. I found them not intelligent enough, until now... Sam Mendes is a filmmaker, not an action filmmaker, and a good one. He knows you don't need a whole film to develop a character but one good dialog scene. He knows how to film a good action scene, how to make actors give their best, how to show respect to the series without falling into their mistakes. He is a master of his class. The performances from Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Judi Dench are amazing, but Ben Wishaw was my favorite character because of his well written dialog. The action was not pointless, it furthered plot and characters. The film is unable to be compared with the rest of the series because this ones is actually a good film, not an action film. Sam Mendes did what Joss Whedon did for Avengers and Chris Nolan did for Batman. He breathed life into an impossible franchise. Good job Mendes! Keep it up!"

I believe this is the first Bond movie that he never orders his signature drink by name - its just made for him, it does show the bartender ""shaking"" the drink... kinda cool.. and in all the books ""M"" is a male and when you see this movie, you'll see what I'm talking about. In addition, in the books, Miss Moneypenny is M's secretary, you'll see what I mean also once you see the movie - great movie. Took my son last night , 14, he's a Bond fan and is going back today. I think it's great that these movies can keep going. Just shows what a great story/character Ian Fleming created years ago. little fun fact - Casino Royal was the first book ever written in the Bond series from 1953."
"barnabyrudge","10","5","13","21 November 2012"," The best Bond film since the original 50 years ago... possibly the best ever.
","Contrary to what a lot of critics and viewers say, my choice for no.1 Bond movie has always been Doctor No. ""The original and still the best"" has been my assessment of 007's big screen debut since I first saw it as a youngster. A few subsequent 007 films have come close (From Russia With Love, Goldfinger for instance) but Doctor No remains the only film in the series that I have considered worthy of full marks, a perfect score, a 10-out-of-10. Until now. Skyfall sees ace director Sam Mendes taking up the helm after the disappointing Quantum Of Solace, bringing a new sense of direction to the franchise and managing the near-impossible trick of doing something fresh and unpredictable with a formula that is now into its fiftieth year.<br/><br/>Following a botched mission in Turkey, James Bond (Daniel Craig) goes into a self-imposed exile, drinking and whoring his way into oblivion. Meanwhile, back in England M (Judi Dench) and the rest of the Secret Service find themselves under attack from a deadly enemy, a mysterious faceless adversary who delights in blowing the cover of various agents around the world and creating havoc and destruction in the supposedly impregnable halls of power. 007 eventually comes out of his exile, returning to the fold to find himself facing a new kind of opponent – no mad mastermind out for world domination here, just a seriously unhinged ex-agent named Silva (Javier Bardem), who has a personal vendetta against M and the service and will go to extreme lengths to have his revenge. When it becomes apparent that the enemy is one step ahead of them at every turn, Bond takes M to his boyhood home – the remote mansion 'Skyfall' in the Highlands of Scotland – where he prepares to take on an army of bad guys on his own familiar turf.<br/><br/>No Bond film prior to this has demonstrated a depth of characterisation like this – the maternal relationship between M and Bond; the origins of Miss Moneypenny and her banterish rapport with Bond; the psychological mechanics of a Bond villain Skyfall really changes the ball game for the better, while still providing enough heart-in-mouth action to keep series' fans happy. Craig is still the most serious and sullen Bond to date (even more so than Timothy Dalton, which is no mean feat), but his troubled moodiness actually suits this film to perfection. Bardem's villain is the best in years – perhaps ever – an adversary all the more dangerous because his objective is merely to wreak vengeance. Adele's theme song is also one of the best in the series in many a long year. I didn't expect great things of Skyfall – it was, I expected, going to be another fun but disposable action flick in a familiar old series. However, this film is simply excellent one which will surely be looked back upon as a classic in another 50 years time."
"greekmuse","7","5","13","14 November 2012"," Roger Moore is still the best Bond
","It was worth the ticket price but it didn't surpass my expectations.<br/><br/>There were a few clever lines by Bond and the motorcycle chase scene was very good. That's what I remember most about the film. The acting was fine, the cinematography and direction excellent, yet at the end of the film I still wasn't wowed. Why? It wasn't so much that the plot was bad, but rather too many of the scenes left me wondering, ""Huh, how did he do that?"", especially in reference to the bad guy.<br/><br/>As a side note, I understand that the Bond franchise is all about moving forward and I'm not saying that Daniel Craig or any of the new faces aren't good, but IMO Roger Moore brought out the best of what Bond is all about in a very particular British way. He didn't need to be buff, he was just more clever, with humor."
"estebangonzalez10","8","5","13","13 November 2012"," Skyfall has the best Bond villain and a Western vibe to it
","¨ It always makes me feel a bit melancholy. Grand old war ship. being ignominiously haunted away to scrap... The inevitability of time, don't you think? What do you see? ¨<br/><br/>¨James Bond will return¨ is one of the few promises that have never been broken, and that is where Skyfall jumps in as the 23rd film of the franchise. There have been several changes along the way, this is the third film Daniel Craig stars as the main character, but it is the first time Sam Mendes (American Beauty and Road to Perdition) directs. Long time screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade are back again writing the script although this time John Logan (Gladiator, Hugo) was brought on board to help out. I think these new additions improved the film and gave the characters a lot more depth. This is a very different James Bond film; it begins as your average spy thriller with a motorcycle chase but ends like a Western film with a final shoot out in an open field. Skyfall is beautifully shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins who should receive his tenth Oscar nomination for his work in this film. The film has a much more artistic feeling to it than most other blockbuster Bond movies and much credit has to be given to all these new additions. The film has a nostalgic feeling to it as we finally begin to see how the inevitability of time can catch up to even the greatest spy on Earth. Like we saw in the Dark Knight Rises with Batman, James Bond too has begun to feel the weight of time over his shoulders and he is much more vulnerable in this picture. Sam Mendes also does another thing very well in this film: he pays homage to some of the earlier Bond films near the end. Skyfall was a great film and definitely among the best Bond movies. However I would still rank Casino Royale as the best one so far.<br/><br/>Unlike with Quantum of Solace that picked up right where Casino Royale left out, Skyfall takes place several years later as we see an aged Bond (Daniel Craig) chasing yet another foe who has stolen a computer drive which contains all the names of the MI6 British agents and their locations. Bond is not on his own; his partner Eve (Naomie Harris) is also following the evasive man who is getting away with the drive. Bond chases him to the top of the train and Eve is waiting for the perfect moment to take the shot but time is running out. M (Judi Dench) orders Eve to take the shot before they get out of her reach and the bullet hits Bond. The man disappears with the drive, and Bond is declared death after he falls wounded into a river. A few months go by and M is in trouble for having lost the drive and putting all the MI6 agents in harm way. Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) insists it is her moment to retire, but she refuses since she wants to solve the problem. An explosion takes place inside the headquarters and several other agents die. M receives a threat claiming that the name of 5 agents will be revealed and that she should pay for her sins. Bond, who of course hasn't been dead but enjoying of his early retirement decides to return to England after hearing about the explosion and enlists once again as 007, although a bit more rusty. M sends him on a mission to find the man who has the drive and retrieve it before more harm is done. Here we are introduced to some other characters like Q (Ben Whishaw), Severine (Berenice Marlohe), and Silva (Javier Bardem) and the spy games begin.<br/><br/>I must say that Javier Bardem portrays one of the best Bond villains I've seen. He steals the show from the minute he walks in. I think another Oscar nomination is on the way for his supporting performance here. It is a villain unlike most other ones. Silva is seeking revenge but in a much more calculated and methodic way. Skyfall is much better thanks to him. Daniel Craig is in my opinion the best Bond and he had a lot more depth in this film as well. The Bond girls were also perfectly cast. You can't have a Bond film without them. Berenice Marlohe and Naomie Harris were both great in their roles. Judi Dench is marvelous as M. She has been playing this role for nearly two decades and here we see her making a lot more difficult decisions. She is portrayed in a much darker light here. The film works extremely well, I loved the new characters, the nostalgic feeling to the film, and the beautiful cinematography. This is a different kind of Bond film, but one you will want to see.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

It starts off nice with a few twists in the plot that makes you raise one eyebrow, but sure enough, they disappear quickly and the movie becomes very expected.<br/><br/>The plot on its own is interesting yet it is executed poorly and it does not reveal everything you expect to find out based on the facts you receive.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie which is so recognized with the James Bond series was missing and you could not figure out where and when the movie reaches its peak. It's simply a flatliner.<br/><br/>Special effects are cheap and the soundtrack was terrible. The only performance worth mentioning is that of Javier Bardem who plays Mr. Silva. He managed to get the most out of the cheesy text and the plot.<br/><br/>I'm used to sitting at the edge of my seat during Bond movies, but unfortunately, that feeling was missing here and I found myself staring at the screen without much excitement for most of the movie.<br/><br/>This production feels very rough around the edges and it lacks the style and chic that the series is known for.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I'll give it a 5 mostly for the beginning of the movie, a few good scenes in the middle and for Javier Bardem's performance, however, you can pass on this movie without caring too much.<br/><br/>Rather disappointed."
"AlxP-64","6","5","13","4 November 2012"," Is this truly a Bond movie?
","The action genre is evolving. Some people like the direction taken by recent action movies, and others don't. In the constantly changing world of action movies, James Bond used to be the steadfast rock of Gibraltar: one could always (for conveniently chosen values of always) count on Bond to deliver a uniformly pleasant experience, including — an entrancing credit sequence; a larger than life villain; a fantastic plan to take over the world; awesome gadgets straight out of a science-fiction novel; a gorgeous Bond girl; beautifully photographed exotic locations; and, of course, breathtaking action.<br/><br/> Skyfall's credit sequence is, well, meh. Adele is a great singer, but the visuals are nowhere near the level expected.<br/><br/> The villain is under-meh. If you can call him a villain at all, since he's more in the nature of a killer. Real villains use killers as hired help.<br/><br/> Plan to take over the world? what plan to take over the world?<br/><br/> There are no gadgets to speak of, outside a handgun taken from The Weapon Shops of Isher (fortunately promptly lost and forgotten) and a vintage automobile (proof that the heyday of the British motor industry is well past). And a radio tracker.<br/><br/> Bond girl? there are two characters which sport a faint family resemblance to a Bond girl, like second cousins twice removed, and that's that.<br/><br/> For exotic locations we get very brief glimpses of two south-east Asian cities, or rather one city and one den of perdition. Unless you accept that a misty and brooding Scottish moor is an acceptable substitute for an exotic location in a Bond movie.<br/><br/> Which brings me back to the problem of the underwhelming action. The pre-credits sequence is very good. And that's it. The only other Bond-level sequence lasts for less than 20 seconds and involves an underground train. An empty underground train.<br/><br/>Overall, Skyfall is a decent film. It has a tinge of action, and it illustrates certain uncomfortable areas of the relationship between democracy and secret services. But is it a true Bond movie? I don't think so. Anyway, I'm eager to find out whether this will remain a one-of-a-kind or it will open a period of evolutionary change in the Bond franchise."
"akasacoral","9","5","13","3 November 2012"," It was a nice touch adding the roots to the equation.
","I would say that the movie was a nine but there were a few flaws. What I enjoyed about the movie was that for the first time, the movie was entirely about Bond and M and the past of them. How a past villain shows up and they go to Bond's home and how they prepare the finale with it. I think the movie's plot really fitted the finale. In the beginning, I thought to myself, what the ef, is this a Bond movie? It's so not clear.<br/><br/>But as the movie carries on, you see that they added something new this time, making it less of a Bond and a girl thing and more of a Bond thing. <br/><br/>I also liked the acting of Q. I think he was picked out very well and I really liked his character as he played. And Javier Bardem puts on quite and act.<br/><br/>What I didn't like was, the plot was apparently supposed to be about Bond's past. That wasn't so clear. Throughout the movie, there are blank spots. Like they wanted to keep it thrilling and not so much drama but there are blank points. That's the only flaw that I see. Like they start something in the beginning and for the rest of the movie, it just turns to catching the person who did it and nothing about the action. <br/><br/>But the locations were well-chosen and used.

","I was extremely excited for Skyfall, especially since Daniel Craig is my favourite Bond by a long mile, but I just wasn't pleased with the movie. <br/><br/>I felt as if it took a while to really get off its feet, the first half of the movie was just how Bond was unfit for service and how he came back to MI6 since he had been shot on M's orders. It was really a 20 minute plot detail stretched over 70 minutes. <br/><br/>The acting in the film is superb though, Daniel Craig delivers another hardcore performance, and Judi Dench got much more to do in this film. Javier Bardem was the man who really carried this movie, he was realistic and funny.<br/><br/>It was when his character Silva was introduced that I felt the movie really took off, the action truly began. The one thing I felt was that they really copied off the Dark Knight with Silva's character, he had a messed up face like Dent, he wanted to be caught like the Joker. At the end of the movie, as Silva desperately tried to kill M and the action was reaching it's cilmax, I was finally feeling happy. But then they ruined it as again.<br/><br/>I had felt for a while the M was going to die, and she did, but not in some big bullet shot or raging anger by Silva, no she died of blood loss, and it was just stupid, a waste of time.<br/><br/>It's a movie worth seeing, don't get me wrong, it introduces new characters like Moneypenny and such, but I had seen so many reviews and it had been built up so much that I had expected something better, maybe the was the problem."
"vostf","7","5","13","29 October 2012"," An all-around winner... except for the script
","It is a pleasure to eventually watch a Bond movie that is not just a quick and dirty actioneer. Especially since the franchise, in its Daniel Craig days, had clearly accepted the Greengrass/Bourne way to shoot action as a basic requirement. All-out action is still here but the other scenes are not just rushed intermezzi. Efficiency is not the only thing that matters here as opposed to the 22 previous instalments.<br/><br/>The villain is good. The character is perfectly tailored and brilliantly flesh out by Javier Bardem, but then the script forgets to build an engaging story around him. OK we didn't need a 23rd variation on a plot to rule the World, and it was an interesting idea to have the villain hunt down 007 instead of the usual formula with Bond sneaking inside the villain's base. But this should have been a -suspenseful- beginning, this cannot be a climactic ending.<br/><br/>Anyway Craig's Bond really shifts the paradigm. He is a somber agent only enjoying high life and hot gals in between brooding phases. Before Craig 007 was a comics hero, then they wanted to make him more human (the original Casino Royale story more or less implied this), for fear of wearing out the audience expectations after so many sequels, copycats and - worst of all - spoofs. Having grown up with the lighter-hearted Connery and Moore versions it is difficult to feel the same buoyant enthusiasm. Allegedly Licence to kill was a flop because James Bond had suddenly become a violent machine with hardly a sense of humour. Then Brosnan was the silliest of all. Skyfall goes so far as reaching for the hero's youth backstory. Let's say there's a backstory but we don't want to watch 007 with a shrink. Digging up backstories is really a lazy screenwriter's hack job.<br/><br/>Fortunately images and action are both great in the last part, but then you feel you was given the wrong medicine. This could have been the setting for a Living dead or Vampire movie shootout, but this bucolic/pyrotechnic ending really doesn't feel like a Bond movie Third Act.<br/><br/>So, I can appreciated the different Bond as played by Daniel Craig and I certainly appreciated to watch 007 move around in a more polished product, but I still need some real creative story to be told around these. Is the franchise turning into a series? Including some surprise at the end of the season? Some can't wait to watch Bond 24, not me. My expectations were quite low for Skyfall and I was able to enjoy it despite its flaw, but now I am suspicious, I am expecting them to reproduce only the less good parts."

","After seeing this movie, I was a little confused. What I saw was one of the best movies I have ever seen. On the other hand, I was about to cry. Because this is, in my opinion, the 2nd James Bond movie that had little in common with our beloved British spy.<br/><br/>The DB5 from Goldfinger, Q and all the little references to previous movies, triggered that lovely ""I'm watching a Bond movie""-feeling (and touché for bringing back those funny catchy James Bond reactions in the dialogs, I missed those in QoS and Casino Royale). The DB5 and the other references totally mess with the reboot idea, but I'll get over it and so will you.<br/><br/>But what about villains that want world domination? Why for god's sake suddenly involve M into a personal vendetta? And what about the Bond girls? Those couple of minutes of Severine didn't do for me. Like I said, I was confused. On one hand you have all these iconic 007 elements. On the other, it is nowhere near a Bond story. I feel like this is a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>About the score... it didn't feel punchy enough to be Bond, I wasn't impressed.<br/><br/>But, we're here to judge the movie, not whether it's Bond or no Bond. I'm gonna give it a 8.5. Dynamic story, great directing, phenomenal acting, good action... it's all there. This is definitely a must-see. But for ""Bondness""? A 5/10. (but don't let that keep you from watching it.)<br/><br/>For hardcore Bond fans: it might be a tiny bit disappointing (especially the story)... but the DB5, the references to previous movies,... And once you see the final scene; boy, does that feel like homecoming. It's a great way of celebrating 50 years of Bond, and it looks promising for Bond 24."
"rockproductions","10","6","17","19 November 2012"," A Peek Through the Door of a Secret World!
","As I was born in 1960, & my father was a huge fan of James Bond, both the books & films, James Bond is amongst my earliest memories of movies. I grew up loving & idolizing 007. As a young boy, who would not want to be the man to win all the battles & save the world? As a teenager, who would not want to be the man who got all the girls? Yes, James Bond was the man, no doubt about it. Sean Connery's (the best Bond) smooth & suave demeanor, was the definition of virility & sophistication that just about every man wished he could be. George Lazenby's physical approach to Bond, & apt portrayal was promising, but faced the insurmountable task in following Connery. He was given maybe the best Bond film ever made (certainly if Connery was Bond), but was highly maligned. One has to wonder how he would of molded the role had he choose to play Bond more than once? Roger Moore's tongue in cheek portrayal of Bond, which later turned more into him sticking his tongue out at the audience, while he blatantly winked away. Timothy Dalton's quietly sincere interpretation of 007, which I thought was a very good Bond, but maybe to sincere after Moore's bastardization of his later Bond films. Pierce Bronson, the man who I felt never quite fit in the role, then given later films that would further 007's downhill surmise.<br/><br/>Then there is Danial Craig! Not since Sean Connery has there been a Bond so all commanding of his screen presence, & hence, the silver screen it's self. Craig, who looked at first glance to be an unlikely & unwise choice for Bond, after the succession of pretty boys with their pretty gadgets, as the superspy. Danial Craig who made Bond believable again, through pure physical charisma & an acting ability far above any other Bond since Connery, in fact, he rivals Connery in many ways. Craig whose tough as steel persona & physique, yet a vulnerability underlying his commanding presence. A Bond driven by past torments, who only lets you see glimpses of his core nature. The coldest killing machine of a Bond that ever was, but yet a warmth inhabits his performance.<br/><br/>If there was a doubt that anything I just wrote about Daniel Craig is true, it surely has been put to rest & cemented by his latest film ""Skyfall."" The most intimately personal look at James Bond ever given a houseful of Bond lovers at the theater, with possibly the exception of the last 10 minutes of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" Here Bond is stripped naked of all his armor, to show us a man who has been tormented all his life in one form or another. Here is Bond, a man unsure of himself, looking for resurrection & redemption, & here he finds it all in one film, ""Skyfall."" ""Skyfall"" is certainly one of the greatest Bond films ever, it has all the action & intrigue of the best Bond. Yet, one can not compare it to other great Bond films such as ""From Russia With Love,"" ""Goldfinger,"" ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" & Craig's own superb, ""Casino Royal."" For it is a different breed of Bond, letting us inside his secretive world. Even it's villain ""Silva,"" Javier Bardem's (""No Country for Old Men"") tremendously maniacal performance as a man driven by psychotic revenge, is another door unlocked to the secret world of the 00's. His villain certainly is the most complex of any Bond film. His acting unquestionably the greatest of anyone to play a Bond villain, even Telly Savalas as ""Blofeld, & Gret Frobe as ""Goldfinger,"" fall to Javier's, ""Silva."" Finally, Judi Dench's ""M,"" is the third door that opens in this most revealing of all Bond films. Her tough as nails persona gets deconstructed brick by brick, board by board. She mirrors the self crisis that Bond is experiencing, am I all that I was, or seem to be? Can I overcome all that I fear? So here it is, a film like no other Bond film ever made. A film of self doubt. A film of self reliance. A film of determination to overcome any obstacle in one's way. At once an intimate film, but that is huge in it's execution, drive, suspense, & thrills. A film with a few surprises not mentioned here, & lastly, a film that will secure Daniel Craig's place as a great Bond, & the making of more Bond films in the foreseeable future!"
"Gsean20","10","6","17","16 November 2012"," An Incredible Film
","Skyfall, the latest 007 film, is an incredible film and a nonstop thrill ride. It arrives on 50 years after, Connery first entered as Bond in Doctor No. It is a fantastic film, gifted with a superb plot, exciting action, and phenomenal acting. Its theme, of loyal and betrayal are intense and helped created a film which is epic in scope, but one that feels intensely personal.<br/><br/>The opening sequence in exotic Istanbul sets the tone for the film. In it Bond and Eve, a fellow MI6 agent, pursue a target who has stolen a encrypted flash drive containing information vital to MI6 and western intelligence in general. The exciting chase takes place on the streets of Istanbul, along with the roofs. It is brilliantly choreographed as Bond transitions from car, to motorcycle, and finishes in a life or death struggle atop a moving train. In the end disaster occurs. M orders Eve to take a risky shot, which results in Bond being shot and falling 50 feet from a bridge into deep water to a presumed death. The shot of Bond falling is an intense image, even if you have seen the trailer, it is shocking and sets the tone for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The titles sequence is another masterfully made part of the film. It is filled with omens an images of death such as skulls, grave, and deadly weapons. A sequence in a hall of mirrors where Bond shoots his reflection and one where Bond shoots his shadow are brilliant and artful. Throughout the sequence, Adele's theme song leaves us sitting on the edge of our seat. It is one of the few title sequences I am sure I will watch all the way through when Skyfall makes its way to DVD.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is excellent. MI6 falls under attack from a cyber terrorist, Rauol Silva, who is a figure from M's past. M's leadership of the agency is called into question just as Silva executes a daring plot, using his computer skills to set off a Bond in the MI6 headquarters. One of the films most powerful images is M standing solemnly in a room filled with coffins covered with Union Jacks. Bond returns to service out of loyalty to M, but the Bond that comes back is different from the one who left. No longer clean shave, Bond's hands shake when he fires a gun, and he struggles physically and mentally to recover from the experiences he has been through. Though she is not sure of Bond's readiness, M sends her to find Silva. The relationship between M and Bond is deeper that ever before as secrets from her past come back to haunt her and MI6. The mission is a dangerous one, with twists and turns a plenty, but it grabs hold of you and never lets go.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is incredible. Daniel Craig owns the screen as Bond. He shows us the strengths and weakness of a complex character. He also has great chemistry with the other actors and he brings more banter to the part than in his other two outings. Judi Dench is magnificent as M. Though she has always been formidable in the role, she raises the bar again. She displays the toughness of a boss, willing to sacrifice her agents to achieve her goals, yet she also shows the vulnerability of a character whose time maybe coming to end. No one shines brighter in Skyfall than Javier Bardem who plays the villain with a giddy flamboyance but never seems ridiculous. Looking truly unique with his blonde hairdo, Bardem creates a complex villain, one who is sure to take his place among the all time bond greats. His entrance in the film, in which he strides towards a tied up Bond while relating a story about rats eating each other, is mesmerizing. He brings back suave to the Bond villain, which Quantum sorely lacked. Yet he is also able to appear creepy and darkly menacing. He is a mix of new villains and old. He is a cyber terrorist yet he is ruthless and willing to pull the trigger, as he brutally shows Bond. The rest of the supporting cast is incredible.<br/><br/>The complex themes of loyalty and betrayal helped make the film relevant and powerful. In addition, Mendes asks the bold question of whether M and Bond are relevant any longer. Yet the incredible story and intense action prove that Bond isn't going anywhere and that perhaps his new adventures can match his old ones. Well done 007. Nobody does it better."
"sean-dolan1","10","6","17","12 November 2012"," Skyfall
","It takes so much to label anything as ""the best ever"". And sure, the term is thrown around way too much. But sometimes, it can be used with the best intentions; not necessarily making a big deal out of it. What I'm about to say is backed up by hours of contemplation. ""Is this the best Bond film ever?"" I would ask myself. It came down between From Russia With Love and Skyfall. Ladies and gentlemen, whether you want to stone me, agree with me, praise me, or what have you for saying this, just hear me out. Skyfall is the best Bond movie of all time. Period.<br/><br/>I'm the first person to love a classic Bond movie. I've seen every single one multiple times and without a doubt they are some of my favorite films. I'm a 007 expertise, and I was beyond excited to see Skyfall. Going into the film, I had heard wonderful things; but I was not expecting to see the best Bond film yet.<br/><br/>Skyfall had everything right. It was classic Bond meets future Bond. It was action packed, but still extremely graceful. Craig playing bond was smooth and stylish as hell, and Bardem as Silva was the best villain portrayal since Donald Pleasence as Blofeld. I'm not trying to jump to conclusion; Skyfall was honestly the perfect Bond film. I was more than pleased at everything Skyfall had to offer. The return of Q and Moneypenny was refreshing. Plus the other dozens of twists, surprises, and returns was enough to make a grown man cry tears of joy.<br/><br/>Perfection sums up this modern day masterpiece, and I can't wait to see Bond 24. Skyfall will forever live in Bond history as truly one of the best films to date. Bravo Bond. He's back and better than ever."
"mlunsworth","8","9","29","27 October 2012"," Welcome back 007, it's been too long!
","With the temporary glitch from Quantum of Solace and then the suspension of filming due to financial troubles, it seemed that Bond's best days were far behind him. Surely whatever followed would be better no matter what we saw. Oh how true this is. Four years later, Skyfall doesn't just surpass expectations; it smashes them and then some. <br/><br/>With the longest running Bond film ever at two hours twenty two minutes, Sam Mendes has given us a very satisfying Bond entry; everything hits the spot: the narrative structure, the development of characterisation (allowed to be explored even further thanks to the simple plot), the action sets and locations (despite most of the film being set in England which surprised me), I couldn't fault the film at all. It's one of those films where I couldn't stop smiling throughout. From the adrenaline fuelled ten minute pre-title sequence, Adele's fantastic Bond song, to a very intense and emotional ending, Mendes has created a landmark Bond film. It's sophisticated, clever, original, and plays homage to the conventions that defined Bond all those years ago – the gadgets, vintage cars, subtle humour, and of course Javier Bardem's hide out, an island full of crumbling ruins which has all the splendour of Stromberg's floating palace and Blofeld's volcanic base. <br/><br/>The acting is top notch. The chemistry between Bond and M is so real it feels there really has been a 50 year history between the two. M's character is explored deeply, as is James Bond's, more so in the gripping and spectacular final scene in Scotland. Javier Bardem gives us simply an Oscar-worthy performance as one of the most disturbing Bond villains ever, and the supporting cast is outstanding, with Albert Finney, Ralph Fiennes and Naomie Harris all on hand to help our hero.<br/><br/>My only criticism would be the positioning of the gun barrel sequence, again; it feels misplaced at the end, but hey, you can't have everything. <br/><br/>This oozes class, and Mr Craig has well and truly moulded into the role, and I can't wait to see what he does for Bond 24 in 2014. Dare I say it, the best Bond film ever? Happy 50th anniversary Mr Bond! An absolute pleasure to watch."
"tavm","9","8","25","15 November 2012"," Daniel Craig once again scores as James Bond in Skyfall while Judi Dench does a more dramatic M here
","Who would have thought that 50 years after initially beginning the film series with Dr. No, James Bond would continue on his 23rd in the official cannon with Skyfall? Daniel Craig is back for the third time in the role while Judi Dench is once again playing boss M for the seventh. It seems her career is on trial for some fatal mistakes during it and Ralph Fiennes looks to be taking over. But first, there's Javier Bardem as the latest villain to contend with. All I'll mention now is that while there's still some good action here, there's also some great drama concerning Bond and M and also a nice juicy part for veteran Albert Finney. Really, all I'll say now is I highly recommend Skyfall."
"arranhicks","10","8","25","26 October 2012"," Absolutely Brilliant.
","James Bond celebrates his anniversary in possibly the best fashion imaginable. Everything from the story, the acting and the action scenes were just superb, and the time flew by when watching it.<br/><br/>First of all, the story. Since it's the first Bond film not to be based on a novel, it gave the series a chance to change its style, and this story definitely shows this. The days of crazed billionaires taking over the world with nuclear weaponry is gone. The film is based on a psychopath looking for revenge. No complex story, no bundles of characters chucked at us, just simple revenge. And it works oh so well.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting. Thesis probably Daniel Craig's finest performance as 007, and almost makes 'Casino Royale' a distant memory. In my opinion, he's still second best to Sean Connery, but all that I'm sure will change shortly. The other M16 characters also play their part. Judi Dench's performance was brilliant and passionate, and newcomers Ralph Feinnes, Naiome Harris and Ben Whishaw in particular were equally superb. And Javier Bardem? One of the best Bond villains ever, and he gives a performance almost reminiscent of Heath Ledger in 'The Dark Knight'. It was a joy to watch him play Silva.<br/><br/>Finally, the action scenes. Everything from the opening scene to the subway to the end was all so smoothly put together, it was a great thrill ride.<br/><br/>Oh, and the theme song? Best ever.<br/><br/>Overall: 10/10, best Bond to date, go and watch it."
"Vikram19867","10","7","21","5 November 2012"," Incredibly well directed, structured Bond Movie, with a dark, gripping opening & final act
","Bond movies have been my favorites, not only because they're exciting and have huge action set pieces, but because the screen play is fantastic, the directors are veterans, and they all deeply explore the vivid, often dark world of Agent 007. He is human, which is a point brought out very very well in the previous 3 installments, and justified by Daniel Craig's stellar performances.<br/><br/>The opening act is great, and sets the tone for the entire film. The opening credits were incredible. What is great is that Daniel Craig has now perfectly understood his character. He is human, but this time, he isn't too emotional or sulking about it. He is tough, and has M's confidence. He is in his best act.<br/><br/>M is the one who is in focus here. And Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) who stuns everyone with a chilling performance. The deserted island set is incredibly beautiful, and the neon lit Shanghai building in which a major fight sequence takes place, is one of the most stunning work of cinematography in any bond movie so far.<br/><br/>In the last half hour, Bardem steals the show with his underground train wrecking, and maniacal ways at the 'Skyfall' palace. However, I say this again, Daniel Craig isn't weak, or a wreck this time. He knows his ways. Agent 007 is a smart and strong character, and he does what his expected of him by fighting his way extremely well, and by protecting M till the end, in a very charismatic way, which was a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>So what makes a bond film a great one? A mad villain, a well-knit story, an incredible opening sequence, an intense final act, bond's handy fist work, explosions, some smart gadgets, a huge train wreck, and some of the best beautiful cinematography. 'Skyfall' has it all.<br/><br/>One of the best movies of the year. If good action movies are your fare, you cannot miss out on 'Skyfall'!"
"Ivanrosario247","1","4","10","17 August 2018"," Utter mess.
","I have have a huge problem with this film which masquerades as a ""Bond"" movie.
Apart from the opening credits it really was laughable. In every way.
Bad guy=about as cliche as it gets.
Script=please
Judi Dench=annoying and unconvincing 
Plot line=shockingly cliche
Where the hell did he get the Aston from with ejector seat??
Q tells him ""we don't do that exploding pen thing anymore??? HE HASN'T DONE ALL THAT YET
Aghhh 'frustrating mess.
Don't get me started on the ""Home alone"" nonsense at the end.
And remind me never to be so stupid to run around with a torch in a dark field when the bad guys are a stone throw away looking for me.
Ending..still in shock how awful it was.
""Casino Royale"" was fantastic so how did this go so wrong?
The lovers of this film??did you have a different version of it?"
"stp141","1","4","10","19 September 2015"," mean-spirited movie
","I got the strong impression that this movie is promoting gay-hating. The only apparently gay character was the villain, who made advances toward Bond. This scene appears to have been introduced solely to promote hostility toward gay people. The writers, producers and actors deserve scorn for participating in what appears to be an attempt to vilify a group of people through a totally fictional plot. Even though, in reality, gay people are probably completely innocent of being super villains and molesting super spies.<br/><br/>Sadly, it appears that some Brits still have problems with homophobia, rooted in archaic Victorian priggery, from which they cannot rise above. <br/><br/>It is particularly appalling that these people are in the movie business where they seek to propagandize their primitive malice through dishonest scripts that get produced and acted out."
"Skydiver86","1","4","10","9 October 2013"," You've killed James Bond!
","Yes, you killed James Bond! I put 1 on this one just because this should be a JAMES BOND movie, not another typical thriller made these days full of FX & with a weak story. James Bond should be James Bond, not an part time alcoholic drug addict who didn't pass on the tests. I know that the original James Bond character is very much old school, but that's exactly how James Bond should be & stay .. Nothing against Daniel Craig, but he really isn't a character for a James Bond movie. It seems like that the director of this movie didn't see any of the previous James Bond's, I just can't understand that someone can step out of the character that far & make ""just another"" thriller (the movie itself isn't bad, it's good, but has noting to do with James Bond)."

","1. The music. Adele sounds like she was at the dentist and had anesthetic injections which results in the mumbling and complete lack of diction or she had just woken up. It doesn't explain however her complete lack of vocal ability including any vocal range whatsoever. To make matters worse she even wrote the song, that sounded something like a toddler would put together. OMG I am updating this review, I have just learned that Adele got an Oscar for this AN Oscar!!!!!!!!! :-O<br/><br/>2. Bond doesn't actually get the hard drive back. <br/><br/>3. Bond gets shot at the start and falls into a deep river and is rescued by the opening Bond Graphics. What was the big hand, a mermaid? Neptune? The big hole he sank into what was that? <br/><br/>4. M knew she was dying, so when Silva puts his head next to hers and then puts his gun next to her head and asks her to pull the trigger and kill them both. Why doesn't she? <br/><br/>5. The beautiful Severine could have been saved by Bond. She is made to stand with a glass on her head and Bond is forced to try and shoot the glass as a killer points a gun at him. Instead of using his gun to kill the man with the gun, he waits until she is murdered by Silva and only then does he use his gun to do so, so why did he not do it in the first place? It involved the same risk, the same movements. By waiting he gained nothing, just her death. <br/><br/>6. Bonds secrets. Why are we now forced to learn all about the Private life and History of Bond? No other Bond film had to resort to this. I think it is a sign of the times, celebrity has gone so far we even (according to Bond producers) need to know more about Bonds private life. This is a huge mistake, if they pick away at the layer of mystique that makes Bond so intriguing then he will no longer be Bond. <br/><br/>7. Bond crying when M dies. Bond does not cry ever, and now he does. <br/><br/>8. Bond walks past Tanner to see M. As he walks past him Tanner is slightly in the way and Bond has to twist his torso to get past. Directing mistake, Bond does not twist past people, they get out of the way, completely out of the way. Scene should have been retaken. <br/><br/>9. No gadgets. That's it no gadgets. <br/><br/>10. The Aston Martin. Gorgeous car but it's a museum piece now, they may as well use Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, use the McLaren MP4-12C Spider it's English and it's a Supercar, what is there to think about? <br/><br/>11. Is Bond Gay? When asked by Silva if he'd be interested in a first time poke at some cup cake sex, he says 'who says it's the first time'.<br/><br/>Please let me write the next Bond, I'll do it for free. It will be set in Dubai involve a Helicopter chase through the centre gap of the Atlantis hotel. A fist fight on the monorail with the back drop of the city. A speed boat chase through the abandoned islands of 'The World'. Tons of gadgets, a bad guy who has a bodyguard who has a selection of bionics, such as a laser eye and super crush grip hands. Plus of course the McLaren MP4-12C Spider. I'd also introduce a recurring fun character (like Sheriff JW Pepper.)I am not swayed by any nonsense arguments that the audiences are too sophisticated for the classic style Bond. The new one is super lame and is very human, who needs a human Bond?"
"dellabrown66","1","4","10","2 September 2013"," Very Disappointing .....
","After all the hype surrounding this movie and this being the best Bond ever, it turned out to be a very big disappointment. I guess it starts with him being shot and falling to what should have been a death fall considering the height. He then inexplicably turns up on a beach in bed with a beautiful woman. That part was annoying. I thought maybe the film had gone back in time and going to lead up to what happened in the opening chase scene. But this wasn't the case.<br/><br/>Next, he befriends an absolute stunningly beautiful woman (Berenice Marlohe) in Macau. He finds out she was abused as a child sex slave and Bond says he can protect her. At this point, you really want to see some justice for her. But then, Bond jumps naked into the shower with her and she gets killed in cold blood soon after. Yes, we all know Bond is a womanizer who uses woman to defend Queen and Country. But this particular conquest was in line with that of a sexual predator. <br/><br/>I'll jump to the end where you learn Skyfall was just the name of Bond's childhood home. The setting is a dark and grim landscape and that's OK because you're anticipating a huge climax to the movie. For whatever reason, Bond has chosen to bring M to an isolated area with no backup knowing full well the bad guys are coming. And instead of a climax, you find out Bond has come to the fight ill prepared with little fire power. So, he rigs the place with MacGyver- like booby traps. In the end, Bond of course wins but the franchise as a whole loses a step."
"Ratisbonanza","3","4","10","30 August 2013"," This movie fulfills his own underlying issue, in a different way.
","What that is? It's the claim that agents and spies are no longer needed, and if you look at this version of Bond, you could honestly say that. Also, the super enemies can be trashed because this Bond has none.<br/><br/>// spoiler // This enemy gets himself caught to be able to shoot M personally, planning everything in advance, even having planted a bomb in the subway as if he could have known what would happen there, but what's happening then? You wouldn't believe it, an ordinary shooting in a rehearsal room, where of course he kills all guards who are protected by protection vests with one shot and - belonging to the underlying theme: old style agents are still needed! - the somewhat older once agent Mallory can add his arguments that the MI6 is still needed by helping to defeat the bad ass. Also, there's no Bond girl. Bond has one assistant but the woman deemed to be the Bond girl dies after roughly ten minutes screen time. So no Bond style here, too. // end spoiler //<br/><br/>There are more points to mention, but this is most important; Bond is no spy anymore, he's just an ""Apparatschik"". Don't misread me, I think Craig is a very good Bond very close to the Bond Fleming created, tougher and more cynically, but the stories are simply no Bond stories. Even the first Bond with Craig wasn't really, and it was a remake (sort of) an older story. After that, essentially two non-Bond stories have been made to Bond movies which they are not. The new action style is okay, less gimmicks than in the past, very much okay, but the stories are not, the style is not, and you really don't want to see a Bond running around with an earplug all the time to play M's executing agent on demand.<br/><br/>The final nail to the coffin are the references to the original at the end, that left me speechless. First you ruin the franchise, then you claim for yourself to represent it; the other way round compared to Star Trek, but not an inch better."

Then the plot just wasn't good. The bad guy, Silva, steals a list of under cover agents and is going to post 5 names every week. Why, he never ask for money, it is just to get back at M. He has a grudge against her. And it is like so what if he reveals the names, just pull those agents out.<br/><br/>The only film was just boring and the plot was confusing.

In fact I'd rate it as above QoS and below Casino Royale in the ""Daniel Craig trilogy"". <br/><br/>!!!SPOILERS BELOW!!!<br/><br/>The problems are numerous. There are too many plot elements here that we've seen before in other Bonds or in other movies. And worse yet is that they were done better in those movies. The worst for me however is the ending and that lasting impression wiped away any good will that was accrued in the first half of the film. It made no sense to have a ""plan"" that would isolate Bond and M from the rest of MI6 - how is being stuck in a medieval mini-castle out in the middle of nowhere a good idea? <br/><br/>OK so good stuff.... hmm... the new money penny is pretty and she has some decent dialogue with Bond. the New Q is a bit annoying to me but my buddies thought he was a good addition. the initial action sequence is good as is the scene in Shanghai. <br/><br/>But once Bardem comes on screen with his cheesy bad guy it gets to be just a weird film. The villain is a mastermind but his motive is neither complicated nor interesting. Is that it? You've got a bad Hate-On for M? <br/><br/>the standards for Bond films are higher in my books.

How did Silva managed to plan to plant bombs at the appropriate places in the subway where he knows he might be caught to distract Bond not once, but twice, the second time to derail a out-of-service train at exactly the right moment. On the frozen lake where the baddie had a chance to shoot him but didn't, and allow themselves to fall into the lake and yet Bond is able to hold his breadth for so unbelievably long, to kill his enemy and surface.

In fact, he doesn't even appear until the middle of the movie, and even then he isn't given much of a back story aside from a few lines of dialogue, which is the worst way to give expository information on a character.<br/><br/>Now couple this with an aging Bond that some deem isn't capable of doing the job. It's hard as a viewer to understand this logic given we know Bond will always prevail, so instead of him going through a series of test, which were edited and directed poorly, they should have focused solely on his almost paternal relationship with M, that way the ending had much more impact.<br/><br/>Moreover, with most Bond movies aside from Casino Royale, you never get past the surface to see how Bond feels. Even in the dramatic closing scene with M in this move, the director decides to pan back, instead of giving us the close up to see Bond's pain, to feel Bond's pain. Worst of all, they drown out his sorrow with music. This scene had the potential to be one of the most powerful emotionally in the Bond franchise, and they failed to execute it.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie borrowed plot elements from a wide variety of movies including the Bourne series, the Dark Knight and there was even a surprising Home Alone sequence, which was executed well.<br/><br/>The biggest upside to the movie is the ending, as they set it up for Bond to go an a number of different directions. Let's hope for fans of the franchise such as myself, they choose to go up."
"AngstromStrongbeard","2","4","10","16 March 2013"," Disappointing
","This film was extremely dull and watching it was a draining experience for me.<br/><br/>The beginning chase scene, though heavily borrowed from other movies (I'll forgive that), was the most exciting part of the whole thing. After that was an hour and forty-five minutes of drawn-out, painfully boring garbage.<br/><br/>James Bond is no longer recognizable as a franchise. The new direction that it's taken is trying so hard to take itself seriously that it does so at the expense of entertainment value. Skyfall tries to carry itself like it's such a smart sophisticated movie, but it's not. (Don't even get me started on M's poetry recital...) It's still James Bond in its simple/porous plot and its fairly lousy dialogue, but it no longer makes up for it with guns blazing action, gadget-wielding explosive sabotage, nearly humorous levels of womanizing, and general liveliness. What do I mean by liveliness? James Bond was always a smooth operator, rarely breaking a sweat, but now he, and pretty much every other cast member for that matter, emotes so little and has such a FLAT, depressing personality that I can't connect with the character, let alone be entertained by it. SPOILER ALERT: when M died at the end, I felt absolutely nothing. I wasn't invested in the story or its characters at all. That is a problem.<br/><br/>The villain wasn't scary, but he was confusing. An ultra-brilliant computer genius with secret agent level skills and years of meticulous planning gets thwarted by a fire extinguisher-induced smokescreen and some Kevin McCallisteresque booby traps? I don't buy it. The way they built him up, I expected a LOT more.<br/><br/>All that said, I will grant the movie this: the locations and backdrops were excellent (kudos to the locations scouts) and the whole thing was filmed beautifully!"

"kyle-mcdonald","8","4","10","1 March 2013"," Well worth the wait.
","I am in my opinion the biggest James Bond fan, I own all the movies on bluray and have an old set of dvds and a few VHS's so I am always pumped for a new Bond movie and after four years the movie I've been waiting for forever finally came. After a big four year gap between Bond movies Skyfall finally arrived and completely wowed me. I must say though there were a few things that brought me down a bit but there were many more excellent things that made up for it to make this movie spectacular.<br/><br/>MI6 is in crisis and with an ageing Bond who appears to have lost his step everything seems to be going nowhere but down hill. On top of all that it seems that Bond feels he can no longer trust M but due to an unknown terrorist Bond will do anything to fight for his queen and country. Everything is put to the test, Bond must overcome feats he never expected to experience and go head to head with his most ruthless villain yet.<br/><br/>I'll begin with the storyline; I found the storyline was the best part of the whole movie. The amazing test of trust plot between M and Bond absolutely blew me away and couldn't have been portrayed much better than what was produced. Also the good guy turned bad was a great touch and also the back story between M and the main villain Silva was really an eye snatcher and really will keep your attention throughout the whole movie. The whole betrayal storyline really took me in and was the real wow factor and how by the end questions are resolved and rivalries are fixed and disaster strikes really makes this movie what it is.<br/><br/>Once again we are met with an excellent cast with of course another stellar performance by Daniel Craig as James Bond; I really enjoyed his darker performance as Bond, just the way he portrays Bond as a broken down agent who seems like he's at the end of his rope and will never be the same due to his age and newer generation. Also his big back story showing why he is how he is really made Craigs performance even better. Arguably the best performance is Javier Bardem as Silva just the way he is so sinister and pure evil, and how he will do anything to get his revenge on M just really makes him the most interesting and well done character. Judi Dench as M was wonderful. Dench gave her best performance as M and just the way she played as the boss who everyone thinks needs to retire and can't handle the job anymore was really well done and Dench deserves a standing ovation. Now here was one of my down sides in the movie Ben Whishaw as Q, not that he didn't give a good performance, he's a great actor and did a wonderful job I just really don't like the young Q it really made me feel sour but I think it's just because I have to get use to it.<br/><br/>The action sequences were really well done, the best was probably the motor cycle chase at the beginning. My second down side was the special effects, they were bad and you could easily tell it was fake. Although special effects were below par the action sequences and everything else made up for it.<br/><br/>So in the end Skyfall was a great movie with an amazing storyline with tremendous actors. I feel they will have to do a lot to top this one but I have nothing but confidence that they can. So make sure that if you're a James Bond fan or even just like a really good action flick give Skyfall a watch.<br/><br/>Overall rating: ******** out of ********** <br/><br/>**** out of *****"
"Jenny_4120","4","4","10","29 January 2013"," Tarminator?
","At the beginning of the film Bond is shot in the chest. Minutes later he receives a new bullet from an assault rifle. Then he falls from high enough to break bones and rupture organs. Is he dead? Nope. He is stronger than Indiana Jones and Terminator. Is not too much even for Bond? <br/><br/>This time it's getting even worse than Quantum Of Solace. The story is lame, the nonsense plot is build around a melodramatic inside view of Bond's psyche. O.K., when Bond is no bigger than life daredevil anymore, it seems to be a logical consequence, to let the audience learn more about the ""true"" psyche of Bond. <br/><br/>The real Bond is a classical archetype male and a chauvinistic, arrogant womanizer with a very dangerous job (secret agent), no woman can withstand although she knows what a heart breaker he is. This worked for 40 years and would have worked for another 40 years or so. The Bond we knew until Craig appeared might not be the type of man radical left-wing Eco- activist broads would like to welcome to their sit-in. <br/><br/>Fact is, the real Bond is dead!<br/><br/>This is a private version of Mrs. Broccoli's fantasy Bond 008, a guy who deeply comprehends women instead of bumping them before they can count to three (which might be a challenge for some real Bond girls...). Of course it's intended not to be ""your dirty old father's"" Bond. It's a Bond for the masses not for the classes, offering a bit of everything the average movie goer under 20 (Twilight-fans) might want to consume.<br/><br/>Craig's Bond has become a sissy, who has a complex oedipal relationship to elder women, especially to those he calls ""M"". Now, in Skyfall, we will learn that ""M"" is for ""mother""... <br/><br/>There really was no need to change the Bond franchise so completely, except to squeeze out some dollars more out of the franchise. R.I.P. 007!"
"lurpak","2","4","10","2 January 2013"," A franchise falling apart
","Main spoilers near bottom look for warning.<br/><br/>What have they done to Bond, this was not a film that lives up to the expectations of the Bond franchise. As a film in it's self it was okay, nothing to write home about, in fact had this film not had a character in it called Bond it would have gone straight to video (DVD BLURAY whatever it is nowdays).<br/><br/>This film has enough quality actors to deliver. I do however care if I am able to follow the plot, accept that the reasoning and rational is not too contrived to make a storyline. This film falls at both these points. <br/><br/>The fact that I can say points about this film is a bit of an irony, in that it is pointless. Rules of Bond are quite simple, he saves the planet from devilish madmen hell bent on world domination, he does not bother with petty shoplifters, car thieves and in the case of this film, some balloon who has a vendetta against M. <br/><br/>From the outset it was a sequence of ""bond Style"" locations and chases but lacked any sequence, unravelling of story or development of either a ""evil villain"" or ""Bond Girl"" in fact there was not a bond girl in the film. So it went from car chase to bike chase to train chase to casino to boat to island to London to Scotland so all the ingredients but without a purpose, nothing unravelled. This film made no sense.we were just expected as viewers to trust that bond had some reason to go to the places listed above without any real reason other than they are ""Bond Ingredients"". Hints were dropped here and there that normally would have some depth, instead they were just keywords to associate one scene with another ""Principally the word SKYFALL"" which gets a mention by a shrink to bond but then gets brushed under the carpet like its some hidden codeword that cannot be talked about leading us to believe the shrink had some purpose to bring up such a word....nope it was apparently random to the shrink.<br/><br/>Please when watching this (as no doubt you will, hell its Bond) just separate the franchise and evaluate the film as if it was a new spy character series like Bourne, and when you do that you see this film has no substance whatsoever. Awful awful awful.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes should not be allowed behind a camera again if he can cock up this tried and tested formula. Craig is looking rough, and while still better looking than me, I wouldn't pitch myself as Bond and neither should he.<br/><br/>below more direct spoilers<br/><br/>It introduced a new Q character, cashing in on the geek chic by making him an attractive chap, but didn't give him enough substance for him to reoccur in the next film. <br/><br/>They take a trip to Scotland for reasons only known to Mendes himself which turns out to be Bonds childhood home called ""skyfall""... hurrah a meaning to the title, not quite on par with goldfinger, man with a golden gun, moonraker etc, Skyfall a derelict old house where Mendes cannot decide if Bond was an orphan or had a father or whether all his possessions upon bonds premature bodyless death were put into storage or sold off. <br/><br/>bond goes to Skyfall to have the villain come to him instead of being on the backfoot, however bond goes completely unprepared and has to resort to old shotguns (Bond is never unprepared for anything you idiots..shaken not stirred is his catchphrase mendes !!).<br/><br/>gets helped out by an old man that recognises this 44 year old craig who has been looking after the place faithfully for what must be 40 years by my reckoning despite his parents being dead and him being orphaned, he kept the place batman esq ideal for Bonds return, who this gamekeeper will now lay down his life for, even though clearly bond has not been in touch.<br/><br/>and does bond succeed in protecting M..no he fails and M dies...BOND SHOULD NOT FAIL !"

","I have seen some reviews from various critics that call this the best Bond ever? Ummm in my opinion not quite however it was entertaining. Are they doing the new Bond films with Daniel Craig in storyline order? Cause we end up with both a new M which is fine, however i will miss Judi Dench in the role, and from what i believe is Bond's introduction to Moneypenny? Little confused here...so if anyone wants to shed some light feel free to message me! Anyhow.. the storyline this time round has the film starting with Bond on a job, another agent who is working alongside Bond ends up shooting 007 after a direct order comes from M (Judi Dench) to do so...007 goes missing as M comes under fire for the death of M16's best agent. It's not long before 007 once again resurfaces and comes to M's rescue as not only is she forced to retire she has also found out that a bit of nastiness from her past has risen to seek revenge.<br/><br/>All this in an effort to save M he dives headfirst into his past pulling at all his roots to face this new enemy.. OK i'll call myself a whiny Bond fan brat here as i love all Bond's gadgetry...we only get a gun that is can only be shot by Bond himself. However the Aston Martin with machine gun turrets is back which was a pleasant surprise. Sadly though they seem to be turning Bond a little too human for my liking and not so much comic book fare as i love my British hero to be. Damn you Batman!!! What worked for director Chris Nolan is not necessarily gonna work for Sam Mendes!!!<br/><br/>Having seen every single one of Ian Fleming's 007 films (Brosnan is still my fave bond) i will always watch these films however i can only hope that they bring back the unrealism and gadgets as that is what draws me to this franchise!"
"foolofatoook","6","4","10","20 November 2012"," Nothing spectacular for the 50th year anniversary
","Well, let me mention at the outset that being a huge fan of the Bond franchise the anticipation and expectation from every next bond film has ever been growing. I personally feel Daniel Craig makes the best Bond of all times - Rugged, realistic, dark in demeanor.<br/><br/>Having said that, Skyfall falls short of being a good film. (Not just talking about being a good Bond film). The artistic cinematography, the strangely varying pace and the theme which tries to blend old school and state of the art technology makes you wonder if it is skirmishes with film noir. Nevertheless, the plot gives it away, with no real meat or strength in development, the movie does not offer anything to stimulate the grey cells of the audience. It actually makes you rethink the definition of Bond film itself by overly trying to make it transformational from the out-of-the-world-gadgetry Bond to more real- life human being who is explicitly advised by the new, younger, geeky Q that the real world don't need exploding pens.<br/><br/>Even comparing to the earlier Bond movies by Craig, it seems all the more diluted from the Bond franchise. After all, we do expect villainy of gigantic proportions when it is Bond who is on the screen and not such a predictable climax which revolves around expected personal vendetta. <br/><br/>All in all, it is a must watch for any true Bond fan, I can't stop you from hitting the theaters. But you would rather enjoy the old Goldfinger or From Russia with Love, thinking in retrospect once you reach home."

","Stylish, classic opening scene with a theme song to rival any of the classic Bonds. You are immediately thrown back in time to the bonds of old. A by-gone era of style and understated ""Cool""<br/><br/>But unfortunately for this viewer, this is where the nostalgia ride ended. I even said to my cinema buddy after the opening song and traditional beginning ""this is going to be good""<br/><br/>I go to a bond film for the wow factor and the promise of : GADGETS : Which you know bond will have to use to save himself later on in the film. CARS : A dream car which will be driven hard and is on every mans ""secret bond wish list"" WATCHES : BEAUTIFUL WOMEN : Which it has.. and is nice that it is not a sleazy portrayal.

I want to spend the night in the cinema dreaming of flash cars, nice suits, and ass kicking abilities at everything. I recognise that it was a homage to bond of the last 50 years .. But every bond has a formula which makes him ""bond"" This also feels like a reinventing of an older genre. I hope this is not the case as with some films of recent years...

"gaidenk7","6","4","10","12 November 2012"," Desperate Bond - a Batman with less gadgets
","First impression of 007 vs villain in this movie is like Batman vs Joker.<br/><br/>They wanted a 'fresh' Bond to revive the 007 franchise, well they've got one, except the sacrifices were made on several key Bond aspects which I thought was important character and the movie series. The story have some unnecessarily long scene that made it boring and unfortunate short scenes that could have helped strengthen 007 and his relationship to other characters.<br/><br/>Spoilers Alert! and sorry for any fragmented sentences..<br/><br/>First of all, the lack of gadgets. Whatever happened to all those high tech weapons that used to wow every viewers in the cinema? All this one got was a slick pistol with a finger print recognition lock and a fun sized GPS device that I've have almost mistaken it for Zoolander's phone? Has the economy hit 007 as well that he had to go old school on his old ride in order to satisfy his 007 gadget crave?<br/><br/>Second is the lack of women and art. The 'verbal jousting' conversations between 007 and female characters has always been one of 007's main traits. A good looking guy who fights evil, saves the country, and sweeps women off their feet. This movie has 2 women(3 if you count a the early one nighter in the movie) in which he had a 'thing' with, but I could only called it a 'thing' because there was maybe 3 minutes out of the 143 minutes of vague camera work that barely suggested some sort of sexual encounter. Bond did, however, had a homosexual conversation with his nemesis, reaching for new audience much?? 007 (especially this one) has a nice body and so are all other female characters show something, make it look like art, come on! I hope they didn't minimized these sex (oh let's just call it that) scenes because the present view on 007 being a womanizer icon is a bad thing then I would say they might as well chop off 007's balls - because people who made this movie have none. I also missed the Bond 'silhouette' music intro as they decide to opt for semi-silhouette which is disappointing. I've always enjoyed that guns & girls silhouette art show before a good action movie of 007!<br/><br/>Third is the whole Bond approach. What makes Bond tick? He make the approaches! The Skyfall story is quite the opposite. There was no approaching to a fight in this one. Bond ended up doing a defending a fort type of fight and stabbed bad guy in the back.. if they are going for a more human 007 then they did it, because 007 look desperate.<br/><br/>Not to compare anything between MI series and the modern 007's but after watching the Skyfall all I wanted to do is to watch MI4 so I can feel better.. I guess Skyfall just left an unfamiliar taste that struck me as out of place."

","This review might be a little lengthy, so let me give you the short version just in case you don't have the time: This was an excellent movie and if you are a fan of the franchise, once you see the ending you'll wish the next one would come out the following week.<br/><br/>Before going to see this third movie, I went back and watched Casino Royale and Quantum, both of which I thought were good (both held true to the formula of some of the most classic Bond movies, despite exploring the character from a different angle).<br/><br/>Casino Royale was James Bond's first ""outing"" and when it was over I assumed that the character was fully introduced and as ready for action as he was in Dr. No. When Quantum came out, I realized that it would take more than one movie to fully sculpt the double-0 agent into the man that we all know. Skyfall brings in any missing element into action.<br/><br/>We all know that Q is in this film (from the trailer). Any respect for Desmond Llewelyn is still there. The new character is excellent and holds true to the original. The Walther PPK is back, and so is the Aston Martin (she has a good amount of screen time)! Fans of the franchise will love Skyfall. It holds true to every aspect of the James Bond formula.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is a spoiler (better safe than sorry) but let me just say that the ending of Skyfall could lead right into Dr. No and, despite the different actors and decades, we wouldn't miss a step! And even though the transition is seamless, the possibilities of future installments is endless!"
"ryanhartford86","9","5","14","10 November 2012"," Finally the pieces are fitting together
","As a fair warning, I discuss crucial plot points, and reading can ruin some of the movies amazing qualities. I suggest if you plan to see this film, stop reading reviews and see it. It's a great movie and it's worth seeing. Then come back and read my review and lets discuss it. <br/><br/>As a huge fan of James Bond, owning every VHS tape, I could barely keep from humming the iconic James Bond theme song all day waiting for my movie show time to come; and I was not disappointed! <br/><br/>Although, my personal feelings toward the film, it wasn't an amazing movie. V for Vendetta was amazing. Forrest Gump was amazing. But the things in this film, made the last several with Craig seem that much more special all leading to this one. <br/><br/>This film seemed so much more like a James Bond movie than the rest of Craig's, and I believe it to be completely intentional. He had finally said Bond, James Bond. The catchy bond music is finally apparent throughout the film. And he finally is not hesitant to ask for his Martini shaken not stirred while at a Casino. The past few movies had one objective, to give the character depth and back story, not to prematurely give us an international super spy, but to hint at it until both us and Bond was ready. <br/><br/>It's what happens at the end where it all makes sense. (again, if you haven't seen this, STOP READING already, and see it). After M's death, the series goes full circle and lands probably some time before Dr. No; which is, to me, a strange paradox. Judi Dench is M in the chronologically future bond movies with Brosnan. Then starting over with Craig in Casino Royale. She then dies before Dr. No which is when they hire the new male M, the replacement to the one you might remember from the earlier Bonds. I know it's a movie, but it's kind of funny to think about. <br/><br/>The moment he steps into the new office with Moneypenny, it's finally very clear on their intentions with this series of Bond. I believe the direction they are taking is a series of Bond movies that are more tied together as a narrative unlike the older bonds which is more episodic. <br/><br/>I love this new Bond series. It's been a great ride, and from what I've heard, we may have many more to look forward to. Like it? Hate it? email me, I'd love to discuss. ryanhartford86@yahoo.com"
"uttiyo-sarkar56","8","5","14","6 November 2012"," Brilliant Tribute to 50 Years of Bond!
","Thrilling, Action-Packed, Brilliantly Acted and Directed topped off with witty dialogues, Skyfall is probably as good as a total action-packed thriller can get and does justice to a Bond Movie and highly benefits from the great portrayel by Daniel Craig and a brilliant performance by Javier Bardem as the villain, and its topped off by some great direction from Sam Mendes and brilliant visually thrilling sequences.<br/><br/>So The Story based on the characters created by Ian Fleming and written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan, is about MI6 agents James Bond and his adventures as 007. In this movie, he is tested to save M(Judi Dench) from a highly brilliant maniac former agent Silva(Javier Bardem), who is adamant to kill M for betraying him and kicking him out of the MI6. Bond must catch and kill Silva before he does more mayhem to the MI6.<br/><br/>The Acting by the cast as a whole is quite great and all of them have done a decent job in their respective roles in the movie. Daniel Craig is great as ever as James Bond and he can really play the character convincingly and does again so with his style and he has everything that is needed to be Bond. Jarvier Bardem for me stole the light in this movie as the villain Silva, and he can be really menacing when he is in a villain role, and he does absolutely perfectly here as well as the brilliant maniac who is adamant to kill M. Ralph Fiennes who played Gareth Mallory in this movie did not have many screen time in this one but he is a brilliant actor and did a convincing job. Judi Dench had a big role in this movie and her great acting skills were proved here as M. The rest of the cast also portrayed their roles very well and did a convincing job.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes is a brilliant director and he makes a brilliant Bond movie which is the best in many years, and his handling and picking of the cast was great as he controlled everyone brilliantly, and he also put all the other elements of this action-packed movie brilliantly and he synchronised all the sequences of this movie brilliantly with all the visual effects, the music and also the witty dialogues throughout the movie and Daniel Craig and the rest of the actors also benefited from him.<br/><br/>The Story in this movie was a great one for Bond movie lovers and also for Action movie lovers and it also consisted of all the things a great Bond movie needs and the great witty dialogues topped it all off. The Cinematography in this movie i thought was top class and all the places in the movie are displayed brilliantly and the scenery's and places shown in the movie are visually pleasing. The Cinematographer Roger Deakins has done a great job with the cinematography of this movie and it contributed very well in the movie.<br/><br/>The Music which is by Thomas Newman is top class as he sychronises his great thrilling music with all the action packed sequences brilliantly and it keeps the movie from getting dull and keeps the audience glued in the movie and the Song by Adele in the movie is also excellent and its a great contribution to the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I really liked the movie from the start till the end and its a great one for Bond Lovers and Action lovers too and its backed up with great stuff from all the elements that is needed in this type of a movie and it can be enjoyed by any movie/bond lovers.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8.5/10"
"manendra-lodhi","8","5","14","5 November 2012"," ""Do not expect much action, just focus on the progress.""
","Apart from the good action chase in the beginning, the film will also be remembered for a great opening title sequence. There are thrilling moments every now and then. However what seems to be lacking in the entire film was that the focus at all times was not on Bond but over the past of M. Bond fans are obvious to feel betrayed when the villain is not at all bothered on a particular mission, and rather on digging the past. The sole Job of Bond in the film remained to save the reputation of the organization. Well I do consider that from all the previous mission specific films, this one was a relief being focused on a much engaging story.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/>The performance by Javier Bardem is awesome. All major roles were performed well. The cinematography in particular was nice, compelling and makes the film a great watch. The dialogs at certain times too were humoristic, funny and preserved the wittiness of Bond. The story this time looked more authentic and did not just focus on a mindless mission in which bond eventually beats his way out. It dealt properly with the genuineness of fear caused by a villain who is as skilled as Bond. At one point it looked as if bond was the only one in the whole organization who could stop this guy. The charisma of Bardem is what drives the film in the second half.<br/><br/>CONS: <br/><br/>The first half was particularly spent in confusion regarding where the story is really going or whether any great action would come. But the second half was more proportionate in many ways.<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""Most recommended."""

","Skyfall is quite possibly, one of the best the franchise has produced so far and is most definitely the best Daniel Craig has performed in the totality of his 3 bond movies. <br/><br/>There were so many factors making this specific bond movie outstanding and up to par even with its original bonds. Starting with the opening credits and the incredible graphics they entailed working so harmoniously with Adele's theme song ""Skyfall"" specifically made for this movie. Usually not a lot of people pay attention to the opening credits of a movie, but everyone's eyes were glued to the IMAX screen here at the Villagio Cinema in Qatar. <br/><br/>The movie focused a lot on the story and the plot as opposed to having it too action packed and meaningless. Simultaneously the plot and the climb to the climax wasn't too twisted to the point of losing the audience. However the action scenes in the movie were by no means undermined. It was the perfect balance. <br/><br/>The movie finally included the James Bond trademark line ""Bond, James Bond"" which was missing from the last 2 bond movies. Sam Mendes really outdid himself with ""Skyfall"". <br/><br/>The movie' had a sense of simplicity to everything about it, resulting in an overwhelming sense of authenticity. Another successful addition to the James Bond franchise. Terrific line delivery by all actors, superb performance, directing and Camera angles to be taught. Overall the movie comes very highly recommended."

","Skyfall 007 is (hopefully) the end of the Daniel Craig Bond trilogy. It's about how some Spanish hacker break through M's computer and blow up her apartment and then Bond has to stop this guy and then all this stuff in Shanghai happens and then I won't spoil anymore.<br/><br/>Skyfall 007 is a movie that I was of course not anticipating. What, do you think I'm a Bond fan or something? While I haven't seen the old movies, I have seen Casino Royale 007 and Quantum of Solace 007, both of which are forgettable. Skyfall 007 is better than both those movies, but not by much. It's filled with some funny gags and a few great lines and action scenes, but it's long, drawn-out and extremely boring overall.<br/><br/>I've said this before a couple times, but if they're gonna have Daniel Craig play Bond, the least they could do is give the character a mechanical, emotionless face and have him walk through battlefields while looking at his watch, poisoning his enemies with his arm-pits, and fart to deflect atomic bombs. THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS MAKE HIM AN EMOTIONLESS ACTION HERO WHO NEVER LISTENS TO THE LAWS OF PHYSICS!<br/><br/>I enjoyed a couple scenes here and there, but most of it was really bland. It would've ranked a point or two higher if it was shorter and had a couple scenes with Bond peeing right in the middle of a chase, or spitting on bullets to turn them around.<br/><br/>Skyfall 007 is a bland movie, but it is a lot more memorable than Casino Royale 007 and Quantum of Solace 007. I think there's little reason to watch it if you don't like the two previous movies in the franchise."

","Craig's Bond is gritty & serious, a more human bond than some of the previous incarnations. I found myself empathising with his weaknesses which I don't think I ever done with another Bond. <br/><br/>Xavier Barden plays a wonderful Silva. A somewhat complex sexually ambivalent character, a bit hetero, a bit homosexual with a gilf oepidal complex thrown in. <br/><br/>Silva has several chances to kill Bond & M but in the true tradition of Bond doesn't take the opportunity. On several occasions I found myself thinking about Dr Evil's plan to kill Powers with sharks & lasers strapped to their heads. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes superbly plays an almost believable character which is somewhat of a novelty in a Bond film. <br/><br/>The plot is a bit thin at times, the location scenes are good except for the subtitles telling the audience the name of the city.

","Absolutely Loved the movie. Everything about it was awesome from the opening chase to the shoot out at the end. It would be great to see some Oscar nods, especially for the cinematography and the song during the opening credits. Hoping they can get Mendes/Deakins back for another one because you can tell right from the start that this a much higher caliber Bond film than we have gotten for decades. What a way to bring Bond back after a 4 year absence. I am such a happy movie goer. I cant remember the last time i enjoyed a movie this much. If there is anyone that has any doubts about this movie, let me put them to rest. Already looking forward to the next one. Happy 50th anniversary Mr. Bond!!!"
"Christian_Dimartino","10","6","18","10 November 2012"," It took 50 years, and after a few great installments, Bond has now done it right.
","The James Bond series turned 50 this year. So after a four year hiatus, probably recovering from all of the bad rep from the previous installment, Quantum of Solace , Bond (played by Daniel Craig in his third outing) is back in Skyfall. It's unknown what to expect from a 23rd Bond movie, considering some of the series is a mixed bag. But if a letdown is expected, don't let it be.<br/><br/>There are a lot of delightful surprises here, so here's what can be told: After a mission goes terribly wrong, the fate of MI6 is in jeopardy. Bond's feisty boss M (played wonderfully by Oscar Winner Judi Dench once again) is the main target of this cyberterrorist named Silva, probably the most twisted Bond villain yet, played perfectly by Oscar Winner Javier Bardem. Who can save her? We should know the answer to that.<br/><br/>Craig's first outing, Casino Royale, was a masterpiece, and a tough one to beat. I liked the sequel, Quantum of Solace, but it's big flaw was that it wasn't Casino Royale. It did everything that Royale did, minus about fifteen percent. For those that agree with me, I have wonderful news: Skyfall could possibly be the best Bond film in the series. It's a Bond film like no other (will get to that later).<br/><br/>This is what you get when you put an Oscar winning master (Sam Mendes) in the reigns of a Bond movie: the best Bond movie. Skyfall is a smart and loving tribute to the series that slapped a smile on my face within 30 seconds, and that smile didn't fade away until the credits, which then brought sadness because it was over.<br/><br/>Every single action sequence is a knockout. There are a lot of nice references to previous installments which will definitely bring a smile if caught. No film in the series has ever looked better, thanks in part to Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins. There is a great twist in the end, and the film ties together nicely, leaving plenty of room for the future. Also, that Bond humor, which was sort of absent in Quantum, is back.<br/><br/>But there are two things that need mention: One, it's nice that Judi Dench, who has been on the sidelines most of the time she was involved in the series, finally gets to do something. And two, it's a Bond film like no other because never in the 50 years has it explained Bond's past. In the 50 years, the thought has probably never crossed anyones mind, and it's nice that they finally did it.<br/><br/>It's rumored that Mendes wanted to win an Oscar for this movie, and he has my support 100%. Casino Royale definitely transcended the series to new heights, but Skyfall takes it one step higher. It took 50 years, and 50 years spent right. This is one of the best movies of the year. Don't hesitate, just go.<br/><br/>A+"
"jamesdburke","9","6","18","9 November 2012"," A beautiful addition to the Bond series
","When I first saw the lineup for the most recent addition to the James Bond series, my expectations were rather high. A cast and crew compiled out of my favorite films. I will get to the obvious actors in a minute, but first I want to mention the talent behind the camera. Skyfall director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, best director) has done a tremendous job in creating a film, which I believe belongs among the top Bond films of all time. Mendes' Bond is well directed in the traditional sense: the action, chases, near-death escapes, sexuality, old-school British class, and subtle humor all mix well into a Skyfall martini—shaken, not stirred.<br/><br/>While Mendes certainly is the brains behind this recent Bond success, cinematographer Roger Deakins is the eyes. The film is beautifully shot, to say the least. There is no way I can really capture Deakins' beautiful use of color, lighting, shadow, and silhouette throughout this film without actually showing it to you. So, here is my one plug, even if you are not a fan of the Bond series go see this film. It is beautiful and well shot film. <br/><br/>I knew that Daniel Craig had performed well in his first two Bond films, showing much respect to the long-standing tradition of Bond, but at the age of 44 it was hard to believe Craig's performance would be fully up to par. I was wrong. Craig gave this film his all and he delivered another performance worth noticing. (And apparently he has more to give with the announcement of Bonds 24 & 25 in the near future.) Craig's performance has the drive and determination of a true action film star combined with the wittiness and high-class demeanor we've come to expect from Bond. But when I saw that Javier Bardem would be playing across from Bond, I knew this would be a special role for Craig. <br/><br/>It's not easy squaring up against a man whose screen presence is as strong as Javier Bardem. Bardem's opening shot, a slow stroll through a long shot while delivering a lengthy discourse to a tied up Agent 007, makes you cringe and smile at the same time. Bardem's screen presence is one that always confuses me. Not confusion in the sense that his acting is poor, but quite the opposite. Maybe it's the slightly detectable accent through his well-articulated English. Or maybe it's the look in his eyes that pulls you in, traps you, and deceives you into believing that Bardem is the real thing. In the film Bardem portrays Silva, an ex-MI6 agent who is using computer hacking skills as a sort of cyber-terrorism. According to the story, Bond and Silva were MI6's best of the best, but Silva was betrayed and has come back for vengeance. Bardem's character is cranial; not a chaotic criminal running wild with no plan. He is smart, conniving, and witty—with some subtly homoerotic undertones that add a unique twist to the sexuality we expect to find in Bond films. Bardem's performance in Skyfall is by far the best villainous role he has played since his work with the Coens in No Country for Old Men, for which he won Best Supporting Actor in 2008. <br/><br/>Judi Dench returns for her seventh Bond appearance as the beloved M and does not disappoint. Dench is the definition of a strong, female character and will stop at nothing until her job is done. Ben Whishaw makes his first appearance in the Bond series as Q, the technologically savvy head of Britain's defense division. Whishaw's appearance in the film makes it the first time that Q has been portrayed as younger than Bond, a decision that I believe is a sign of the times. Whishaw's Q is a Zuckerberg-like fellow with an aura of nerdy wrapped around a slightly stylish young boy. While it certainly is a change from the Q that the late Desmond Llewelyn portrayed for most of the Bond films, Whishaw seems to hold his own in Skyfall. And lastly, Skyfall's themesong, which was written and recorded by British vocal sensation Adele, is a beautiful track that reminds the audience of the roots of Bond in the 1960s.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give this film an 8.9/10. While I found many sequences to be easily predictable, as most Bond films are, I was still happy with film as a whole. Craig and Bardem go back and forth in a battle for control throughout the film in a beautifully crafted way. Mendes' direction and Deakins' cinematography certainly add to the beauty of the film and high standards of the Bond legacy. The best Bond film I have seen in a while and what I hope to be a new standard for the quality we will see in Bond 24 & Bond 25."

","As a fan of Bonds such Dalton and Connery, I was slightly apprehensive about the reintroduction of 'gags' and humour. It's such a relief to see all that stuff well balanced and not awkwardly shoehorned into scenes.<br/><br/>It's pretty clear that the aim was to crank up the IQ level of the film's script and style. Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins and John Logan all pulled it off perfectly. It's so satisfying to have a Bond film with a central theme running from start to finish (unlike QoS – I actually got bored after the fifth explosion) – the whole idea of Bond and M being tied to past events. I see it as an evolution to a more ""thinking man's"" Bond. Just the mere presence of Ralph Fiennes gives the film an additional intensity and class.<br/><br/>I also love how the film promotes Britishness in a contemporary, Spooks-eque way without the usual flag-waving nonsense – from cinematography to the choice of locations. There is something cool about watching a black Range Rover cruising across the River Thames under grey skies with Thomas Newman's score pumping in the background. It's all so subtle and yet so informative. Very Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. <br/><br/>For Bond nerds, it's all there - girls, action and cars... in addition, a huge dose of great filmmaking, dialogue, and script. Craig and Mendes together have made a traditional and classy Bond. Love!"

It was something different the film certainly had its moments and if after following the opening it would have been an awesome James Bond film. Unfotunately as the film rolled on it transformed into something else.<br/><br/>Even the opening song Skyfall while sung beautifully, was visual and seemed to be about a part of Bond but not the entire film. It was full of striking visuals but not James Bond or Bond Girls. Instead seeing Chinese dragons and other visual scenery.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment was seeing the Classic Bond car, the only Bond car get blown up.<br/><br/>I'm sure if you look out for it a henchman who James Bond kills comes back in a later scene to be killed again <br/><br/>6 out of 10.

"p-jonsson","1","3","7","19 March 2018"," This is NOT a Bond movie!
","Me and my oldest son have been doing a bit of pseudo binge watching of James Bond. Every weekend we have been watching two of the movies starting with Dr. No quite a few weekends ago. Last weekend we arrived at the Daniel Craig ones. I had actually not watched those ones before. I have to, grudgingly (I am a Sean Connery fan), admit that the first two we watched were not at all bad.<br/><br/>However, today we watched Skyfall. What the f...? This is not a James Bond movie! If it had been just some other movie I would probably have thought it would not be a too bad one. However, it pretends to be a James Bond movie and as such it is utter crap. It is a bloody Hollywood drama written by someone with a total lack of respect for the Franchise, not to mention the old Bond fans.<br/><br/>James Bond should be out hunting international villains. Villains with a good chunk of bad guy charisma I might add. What we got however was some loathsome prick having a grudge because M didn't come to his rescue when he fucked up.<br/><br/>The British Secret service should also be just that, a powerful organisation protecting Britain (and the rest of the civilized world) from communists, terrorists, criminal superorganisations like Spectre or whatever. Having scenes with M more or less on trial and having to defend herself in front of a bunch of clueless political asshats is just crap and it is definitely not the kind of crap that should be in a James Bond movie.<br/><br/>The whole movie is just full of sensationalist shit, politically correct crap, killing of popular characters, sentimental bullshit and other nonsens of the kind you would expect in a bloody Hollywood soap opera. And what about the new Q? A boring brat with a over-inflated ego. Not fun at all.<br/><br/>Even the special effects are debatable. For example, if you make a subway train crash by blowing a hole in it's path then for Christ sake put some crash test dummies or something in it to at least make some pretense of it not being an empty mock-up!<br/><br/>This is undoubtedly the worst Bond movie ever. My disappointment with this movie cannot be overstated."
"achmoye","2","3","7","15 December 2017"," Nice movie until it starts
","I liked the opening. This is where belong my two stars. <br/><br/>The Bond opening are always beautiful. <br/><br/>Actually I'd rather watch 2 hours of Bond opening instead of this garbage. <br/><br/>1. Daniel Craig has only one expression. No wonder he doesn't pass the psychological test in the movie. Maybe it was the actor answering. 
How could he pass the casting. Remember Pierce Brosman, his fine humour traits ? What happened to Bond's personality ? <br/><br/>2. My Lord this movie is so sexist. Women just fall drooling in Bond's presence. Their only goal is to go in his bed. 
The random sex scenes are killing me. Is it Game of Thrones ? 
Funniest example is first car chase, when his female colleague is driving, and he actually push her, take the driving wheel to turn on the right. Because she could'nt do it obviously LOL <br/><br/>3. The plot is ridiculous and predictable, with cliché hacking like it is a superpower or something. <br/><br/>4. Bond risk his life to chase a ...guy. Why ? Couldn't you, like, make a police perimeter instead of running if a GOD DAMN TRAIN ??? 
Can't you just take the actual elevator instead of hanging yourself to it ? How does that help you chase the guy ??? He could just have called the button XD <br/><br/>So yeah, a hilarious pile of cinéma clichés. 
A skyfall on action-movies. 
I don't recommend."

","There are a lot of movies that are really popular but you do not like them, then there are those movies that many people like you do not understand why and why you need a time or look at them again and slowly understand what people love and then there the movies are probably the columns of opinion because exactly the things the other people love about you just did not like you. ""Skyfall"" is not one of those movies that is a movie I did not like from the first time and with each new watch it got worse and worse. I still can not understand why anyone can like this movie and still am still shocked to see how many people worship this movie. That people love this movie is bad enough but that they praise this movie as much as anyone else that is the biggest tragedy ""Skyfall"" contains no suspense the drama is passable but the effects are funny there is no real plot I third of the movie is just jumping from one place to the next and so I really really took a long time to follow the process of the movie It's always going to be bad if you only see an action movie but you have to read through the Wikipedia article to get the plot (I mean that's not Blade Runner what the complicated storyline?), but I'm a lot more baffled the train that arrives so well on the ground nothing done dirt that has no special quality or anything special. I even go so far as to say that the film would not even have received a third of the money of praise or prizes if not for the brand name James Bond. Everything in this movie is stupid the characters you suffer can die all the ones you do not like die sometime later but then not in a good way, Javier Bardem looks like they painted him the visage, and the movie is literally anti-climatic you because the entire last third is even more boring than the rest of the movie. So the movie starts okay, then gets annoying then gets boring and ends in just awful. I do not understand today it was the people who loved this movie so much and I honestly lost interest in the answer, of course I know the tastes are always different and not all like that but if he changes me half a puzzle want and say that is the most beautiful picture in the world although over half missing and what you see looks like ass then I miss the words. My conclusion, of course, is that the James Bond films are not always the best in the world and I know that they are made for entertainment only because none of these films will get you an Oscar or be represented very much in the general movie encyclopedia but Skyfall is absolutely shitty, Direct are pretty stupid, the drama is tolerable, the record is super stupid, the end is a single insult and the music would be pitiful even for a Disney musical.

"Arenjee","6","3","7","15 June 2013"," Underwhelmed
","Now am I a bond music person and the First ominous sign about the movie's tone was Adele's Skyfall theme, released prior to the movie. As lovely sounding and deftly delivered as it was, there was a certain drabness about it. It just lulled and lumbered, and titillated, but never arrived. (No, I wasn't expecting a full house, belting, herald like Tina Turner's, or Shirley Bassey's, after all my most preferred Bond themes are the tame Carly Simon's 'No body does it Better' (TSWLM), and Armstrong's 'We've got all the time in the world' (OHMSS), not to mention the divine Chris Cornell's 'You Know my Name' (CR)). I listened to skyfall over and over again to maybe gain an acquired taste for it...nothing. Its a lovely theme, but it won't make my top 15 bond themes.<br/><br/>Then I  saw the movie, it was the same: nice, lulling, with deftly shot scenes, and the whole shebang. But something was awry, and that something is the thin line between a movie that is somewhat off because certain viewers find it hard to seamlessly suspend belief from the start to finish, on the one hand, and on the other hand, a movie with a plot so speckled with large enough holes that a large percentage, albeit a minority, of viewers leave the theaters feeling happy but less than satisfied, without fully appreciating the scope of the void that it had left in their movie loving hearts.<br/><br/>When I first shared my misgivings with some of my movie paddies, they felt the same way as I did, but there was a hesitancy to readily admit it, proving that everyone wanted skyfall to be all it aspired to be for an eagerly awaited Bond Movie. We all wanted it to work; and here lies the keystone to the puzzle: There is a large gulf of a difference between the aspirations of the Bond fans who really welcomed and wanted more of the freshness of 'Casino Royale' and accepted 'Quantum of Solace' for what it was worth. On the flip side, are the desperate aspirations of the Skyfall's producers and writers, vastly different from what the fans had in mind.<br/><br/>First Skyfall felt like a fresh Bond reboot too soon after the Casino Royale reboot. It could even be argued that it was a reboot of the Casino Royale reboot much in the same way 'The Amazing Spiderman' or 'X-Men First Class' were considered to be reboots done too soon, thereby making Skyfall somewhat unrecognizable as a bond movie to dedicated bond fans.<br/><br/>Second, the producers possibly aimed at and succeeded in pulling in a fresh audience through effective marketing and a bringing on a blinged up ambiance and grandeur of a feel to the movie, thoroughly Nolanizing it. What resulted was a visually satisfying action flick, but the skyfall characters, like many in the super hero genre, lacked depth and development. There was no chemistry between Craig and eve (Naomie Harris), M was too grim, Bardem's Julian Assenge like Silva was too demented a bond villain ever, and was more Ledger 'Dark knight' crazy, than the evil genius 'super villain' Blofeld like antagonists we've come to love and expect. In fact the debonair,gravitas, and level headed lunacy of the typical Bond villain is one of the striking attributes of what makes a Bond movie, a Bond movie. Bardem was brilliant, Silva was very irritating and confused (roll back to his attempted suicide scene, argh!!!).<br/><br/>Third, there was no Bond girl in Skyfall, its that simple. There were bond females, but no bond girl (no decent feminist should watch a bond movie so no complaints about my attachment to the term Bond girl). So I repeat, there was no bond girl in Skyfall. The emotional, tortured sex slave of Severine didn't sell as readily as Mariam D'Abo in TLD, Maud Adams in TMWTGG, or Jane Seymor in LALD and many others. I didn't get her, her easy access to bond, and her over staged death. Then lest I forget to mention the movie lacked any hint of a believable love triangle.<br/><br/>Forth, and most tellingly are the plot holes. Most movies have plot holes that we tend to ignore, but gaping ones leave you drained trying to fill up the voids as the movies progress.<br/><br/>Fifth, the Sykfall Bond is unrecognisable as Bond. We all always wanted some insight into the true bond after 50 years, we shouldn't be surprised that producers would want to fill his character out a bit. A plausible back story would be welcome. Bond is actually basically a spy and an assassin (which means he should be conflicted and disturbed to some extent, and most fans expect that), but he needn't be drunk, disheveled, and bungling, boss killing, and dumbed down to make him more human. Bond ain't no Hancock.<br/><br/>Bond is action fantasy A.k.a. Our Man Flint. Plenty in a bond movie should defy reason and transport you to another world. But it must have cohesion, an it must make sense. Funny thing is this movie has been a huge success, honestly it was well made. But its not a Bond movie, it could have been, and then it would be one of the greatest bond movies ever, but it wasn't. So far, with Skyfall, Bond is dead. I hope the next one revives the bond we know and will simultaneously bring on all the Nolan bling to boot"
"storyguide-axel","3","3","7","4 May 2013"," Just another Bond movie..
","Bond (Daniel Craig) is on another (important) mission somewhere in the big world, this time on the heels of someone who has stolen a hard drive with all the names of the British agents who work for MI6. On the mission, Mr. Bond is shot by one of his own (an agent named Eve, played by Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. However, Bond is not dead, and when he resurfaces, he jumps right into the game in the pursuit of an old agent called Silva (Javier Bardem), an old favorite of M (Judi Dench).<br/><br/>While Bond is out in the world, M discovers that someone, presumably Silva, has hacked their computers and threats to expose the true names of the British agents. However, it is also clear that the enemy has other plans, plans of terrorism. Bond is now in a race against time before more agents are revealed, or worse yet, before M is killed by their mysterious enemy. Fortunately, everything works out perfectly for 007, who finds the mysterious Silva with little effort.<br/><br/>OK, admittedly, this was a very short summary of the plot in Skyfall, but in all honesty, there isn't a big plot in this movie. I could have given some spoilers about the ending, and maybe added a bit about Mallory (Ralph fiennes), but really, this is an extremely simple plot. Not at all worthy of a big iconic character like James Bond.<br/><br/>It is classic 007, with everything thats part of such an adventure, like product placement (not a favorite of mine, in fact I get rather annoyed when its as obvious as the watch in the opening of the movie), car chases (in this case, more like a motorcycle chase across the roofs of some unknown city), beautiful women (which are exactly as shallow and pointless as you would expect), and lastly a total lack of emotions and realism.<br/><br/>I am not a big Bond fan, and haven't seen all of the movies in the series, so I am probably not the right person to review this movie. I do not understand what it is that draws people into the cinema time after time, to watch yet another Bond movie when they can watch something original with a real plot and real characters. Perhaps these people like the shallow characters, who care little for the safety of the innocent people in the world, yes, I said it. Look carefully in the opening sequence, how the female agent cares little for the people on the bridge, as she shoots after the enemy. Later in that scene, she finds it really hard to shoot the enemy, because what if she hit Bond instead. I may be wrong in this assumption, but isn't MI6 here to protect the innocent people? Perhaps these people like the almost infinite number of one-liners that made my ears bleed at one point. Why are we treated this way? Do the people who makes these movies really think we are so stupid?<br/><br/>Before I actually say something nice about Skyfall, because I can do that, I just want to give a small piece of advice to future Bond villains, because who are we kidding, there will be more Bond movies in the future my advice is this: Always remember to close the door behind you, whether its an actual door, or maybe a manhole (cover). If you don't do this, Bond will surely find you. But of course, perhaps you are dying to have him on your tail, in which case, you are doing it exactly right!<br/><br/>OK, something positive. Skyfall is a beautiful movie, in a very obvious (and superficial) way. The colors are just stunning, especially when we follow Bond swimming through the night of Shanghai, high above the streets. There is no denying the imagery and action of the movie, in every possible way, this is some of the best the world has to offer. I'd also like to give a shout out to Albert Finney, whose character (Kincade) raises the quality of the movie, and actually give it some human emotion.<br/><br/>The very last thing I want to say is this why hire Sam Mendes for this movie? Why hire him when he is not allowed to use the powers that God have given him? Where are the human emotions, where are the dark humor, where are the personal stories that capture our hearts as much as our minds? If you want to watch a real Sam Mendes movie, I suggest the following American Beauty, Jarhead and even, Revolutionary Road.<br/><br/>Only watch this movie if you have nothing to do at all and if you are a hardcore fan of 007 and feel forced to watch every movie in the franchise. This movie reminds me why I only rarely watch big Hollywood blockbusters."

","Nobody does it better. Everybody with an ounce of sense knows this. But just to dispel any doubt, EoN immaculately raise the qualitative bar for the modern action movie/espionage fantasy thriller once again and Bond blows away the competition just like that. The doom-mongers, naysayers, whingers, whiners, gloom-merchants and malodorous Bond misanthropes have got it wrong again.<br/><br/>SKYFALL is good. Very good. It taps effortlessly into the pop culture iconography and history of a fifty-year old movie franchise sparingly and with thoughtfulness and care. Then, with deadly accuracy and magnificent potency, updates and upgrades it to fashion one of the most audacious and dynamic Bond movies ever made.<br/><br/>Painstakingly choreographed action set-pieces litter the film strategically. They are framed by and rendered in some of the most dazzlingly beautiful cinematography to ever grace the franchise. Truly a feast for the eyes. The neon and glass track-down and hand-to-hand combat sequence with Patrice in Shanghai is one of the most sublimely original and retina blistering events I have ever seen on screen. Yet this is not even the best bit of the film.<br/><br/>Sonically, it is both crisp and precise, with Thomas Newman's subtle and marvellously nuanced score complimenting the visuals to perfection. The music and sound effects match the visuals blow for blow in terms of aesthetic aspiration and achievement.<br/><br/>Anyone with concerns that Sam Mendes might not have what it takes to direct an action movie need have no worries. Mendes is creatively inviolate here, his vision and sense of tone and dynamic is right on target, and he probably turns in what is technically his best and most consistently sustained job of screen work to date.<br/><br/>As for the performances, some are near faultless. Craig, Dench, Fiennes, Bardem, Whishaw don't put a foot wrong. Craig, Dench and Bardem are especially notable. And Craig IS James Bond 007 in the here and now. He is the super-cool super-conductor, the core element of the entire film – and he is damn good at it.<br/><br/>As a 50th anniversary item, SKYFALL pays skillful homage the franchise with pleasing nods and winks that are carefully reverent and respectful whilst retaining a playful, mildly satirical sense of humour. In some other movies, DIE ANOTHER DAY for instance, the approach was one of blunt sledge-hammering parody and was tediously crass and distasteful. Fans will get a big kick out of the use of the Aston Martin along the sly digs at the way in which gadgets for the sake of deus ex machina moments have become terminally passé, chronically outdated.<br/><br/>The plot is relevant and suitably reinforces Bond's relevance in the modern world, so paving the way for future adventures. The payoff gives us a return to the way things used to be but in a modern and updated context, so anyone who was ever a fan should be deliriously happy about that and the way in which it provides Bond with somewhere to go – even if it turns out to be the line of least resistance in the long run. If - and it's a really big IF – but if the Oscars has a complete cultural and ethical transplant and actually started to give awards for real cinematic achievement rather than for morally bankrupt and intellectually corrupt reasons, SKYFALL would garner a limo-load of statuettes.<br/><br/>Witty, clever, literate, smart, funny, some great dialogue, wonderful visuals, breathtaking action, good music, emotional punch and meaningful contextual architecture. It builds on the CASINO ROYALE reboot, the QUANTUM OF SOLACE conclusion to that thematic story arc, and consolidates it seamlessly into a fabulously intoxicating Bond cocktail, making it not just a great standalone piece of movie entertainment but a great and significantly important Bond movie.<br/><br/>Nobody does it better. Indeed."
"sabre_pg","10","7","23","26 October 2012"," Bond is back!
","I'll jump straight to the point here. This has to be the best Bond movie since Connery shhhluurped his way through his last on screen vodka martini! The trademark 'pre-title' sequence is back in all its glory with a fantastic chase through Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, taking the audience on one of the films many white knuckle rides. This sequence closes into the opening credits backed by the powerful voice of Adele belting out the movie's theme song.<br/><br/>The storyline is about a stolen computer drive containing the names of NATO agents embedded in terrorist organisation's across the globe for which Bonds chief 'M', played again by Judi Dench, must take responsibility. Ultimately the story focuses on Dench's character as she becomes the target for revenge by a former agent, Silva(Javier Bardem)she abandoned to the Chinese some years ago.<br/><br/>The action rockets the movie through some fantastic scenes which are mostly played out on Bonds home territory, with some explosive action through the London streets and on the tube, and a fantastic shootout finale' in the Scottish Highlands which may leave a lump in your throat! <br/><br/>Daniel Craig's Bond has matured since his last outing yet still has moments where he is shaken and stirred a little more than his Martini, even though he seems to prefer lager straight out of the bottle these days. I've often thought that Connery's Bond was tough enough but with not enough emotional side and Timothy Dalton's Bond was sophisticated but far too sensitive, a mixture of the two could make the perfect James Bond, in Skyfall Daniel Craig come's closest there has ever been to that Bond!"
"coiffuremixte","10","6","19","7 November 2012"," agile blockbuster with depth and style
","What do we expect from a Bond film? Above all, we expect the self-satisfied aura of invincibility the titular character exudes and a parade of dazzling consumable goods (women included). Generally speaking Bond films are bad even when they are good; stale.<br/><br/>Since Daniel Craig took the role the general idea seemed to be dragging the franchise and its hero into a brave new world, with Skyfall they succeed third time lucky (Casino Royale was in many ways excellent but dragging too much baggage from the past it narratively veered from episodic melodrama to gratuitous sadism not knowing quite what it was doing in the end) <br/><br/>What makes Skyfall different? The boldness of the narrative vision, the dramatic presence of Craig, the balance between humor and pathos, the brilliant cinematography, the weight of the cast... In all areas Skyfall is a departure from our expectations while still remaining the story of James Bond: a daring British spy pitted against a master criminal with action, romance, drama and humor; all the expected ingredients are present, except the staleness which is replaced with true excitement, a welcome sense of danger, and suspense.<br/><br/>The director Sam Mendes deserves special mention for his versatility which helps the whole film gel and gives us a classic film which is bound to finish as one of the biggest blockbusters of the year.<br/><br/>The Avengers gave a similar buzz of fresh popular cinema earlier this year and exceeded expectations, even for a much-hyped super-production, I think this will be a definite turning point for the Bond franchise."
"lerochka-572-401309","10","5","15","17 February 2013"," Fair successor to Quantum of Solace
","Loved the beginning. Ten minutes of pure chase/fighting but I was fully engaged. Touching shot by Eve, great effects as Bond falls off the train and floats into the water underneath as the pre-movie credits begin to roll. Fitting Skyfall song by Adele during these beginning credits, as well as later on when Bond is on the boat in Macau after the scene with Eve and throughout the movie. Like the cold open in the first episode of Breaking Bad - draws you in and makes you want to know what's going on.<br/><br/>Actors are great - LOVE Judi Dench as M, and of course Daniel Craig is made for the role with his stoic demeanor and piercing gray/blue eyes.<br/><br/>Interspersed with humor, too: e.g. when 007 returns to M and she justifies her decision to tell Eve to shoot and tells him his house's been sold (guess he ""should've called""); when Q tells Bond ""told you"" about backing into the subway door just as the train approaches; when M asks if she's to be the bait as Bond is ""kidnapping"" her in the car, and then sarcastically comments on how completely inconspicuous the beige bmt car is. <br/><br/>Well shot, well made movie - all the money, action, special effects are there without being over-the-top. Beautiful shots of Shanghai, lots of nice filming from above, blue/dark color scheme throughout that matches the film's contents. Scenery complete with komodo lizards/dragons and all. Gorgeous image of Raoul walking in front of the fire explosion.<br/><br/>Speaking of Raoul, the bad guy is actually witty and endearing - interesting and unique approach, I liked it. Also relatively attractive (especially in police uniform!) which is again a nice digression from the typical beautiful hero and ugly villain approach (think Bain in ugly dog-type face mask in Dark Knight Rises, etc.).<br/><br/>Speaking of attractive - hot computer science nerdy guy Q. Keeps up variety with his snarky comments, too.<br/><br/>Love how Severine played, even though she didn't play for much. Especially when Bond revealed her tattoo and predicament, she showed fear but some trust and a little half-laugh so realistically. Thought she looked very appealing.<br/><br/>However, did find some parts of the film unrealistically shot (no, not just the impossible action). I'm talking about when Bond and Severine arrived to Raoul's deserted island, and the houses on the island looked more like a backdrop painting than anything else. Same backdrop painting goes for the scene where Bond and M get out of the car for a stop in Scotland and talk - they really look starkly separated from the trees and mist in the background. Also unrealistically empty train (i.e. no one on the train..) that crashes down into the tunnel after Bond when Raoul sets off an explosion.<br/><br/>Creepy but interesting end at the house. Very different from the fast- paced chases in the rest of the movie, where main characters are always surrounded by many people. This time they are alone, and it's different (like in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, when Harry ventured off just with Dumbledore to destroy the Horcrux).<br/><br/>Loved the movie but didn't like the end. First off, with all the orphan discussion and Raoul looking at Bond's parents' grave, I was expecting some blood connection between Raoul and Bond. But to my main problem with the ending - M died?! She died after Bond saved her from the bad guy, without really getting shot and just a wound on her hand that she'd been sporting for a while up to that point. It also wasn't poignant or sad, which it really should have been considering she's the second main character behind Bond. Small redemption in that the gamekeeper stayed alive - it gets old when the secondary good characters get mandatorily killed off in order to compensate for all the bad characters that get killed, so this was a nice change.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Very long movie (2 hours 20 minutes), but a great action film with some good variety of attractive, interesting, funny characters. Not a philosophical masterpiece by any means but what you want from a good old James Bond movie, plus beautiful scenery and great artistic special effects from Chris Corbould."

","Anybody who is reading this, I would strongly suggest disregarding all bad reviews about Skyfall. This was the first Bond movie I have ever watched, and it blew me away. In fact, I went and saw it in theaters twice...twice folks. After watching such a fantastic movie I decided to buy and watch a ton of old Bond movies. All of them bored me. There were a few great parts in all of them, but for the most part, it was hard for me to make it through them. Daniel Craig is by far my favourite Bond, and probably will be unless they make Robert Downey Jr. Bond some day. Anyhow, I highly recommend this movie. Buy it, watch it, love it."

What bells and whistles you say? – well let me open Bond's – that's James Bond's - special attaché case. Now be very careful – it may be booby trapped (or would that be boobie-trapped?

And you know – you just know – those hot Bond – that's James Bond women just can't wait to strip naked and jump 007's body. And of course there are those rotten no-good bad guys and girls. Each of those villains were very well versed in evil laughter and they all sounded just like Boris Badenov (or Natasha, if they happen to be a bad girl.) This movie has all the ingredients one expects - and more. Daniel Craig really nails Bond – that's James Bond (along with Miss Money-Penny and some of them evil Natasha-sounding woman.) I truly enjoyed this gala theatrical event – and what a superb continuation of the saga of the world's best secret agent – yes – that's Bond – James Bond.

But this one was riveting, interesting. It was fantastical but just shy of over-the-top. Loved it. Adele's song and the beginning movie credits was interesting, entertaining, beautiful. Javier Bardem played the best Bond villain I've seen since the '70's. His acting was a work of art. Judy Dench was, as usual, perfect. Daniel Craig was more than eye candy, more substantial. Sam Mendes is obviously an amazing director. He was able to make even the couple of corny lines work to the movie's advantage. And the filming/editing was flawless.Those who haven't watched the old Bond movies might miss the punch of some of the really enjoyable moments, like the Aston Martin, Moneypenny, Q... I was delighted at the memories."
"jeanetteandbrian","10","5","15","13 November 2012"," Any honest to God 'Bond' fan, will love this movie....
","First off, I am a 007 fanatic...so, do not take this review as if it's from someone who does not understand the Bond universe. I do! I have read most of the Fleming novels (and the more recent ones by different authors) and have seen every Bond movie at least half a dozen times each (some many many more times then that.) I have every movie on VHS, DVD and now on Blu-ray and, leading up to the opening of 'Skyfall', I re- watched EVERY movie (yes ALL) 22 movies again at home. I grew up during the Moore era, but thoroughly enjoy the Connery movies also. I did not see Casino Royale in the theaters only because, after the mostly disappointing Die Another Day, I was someone who felt that they owed Brosnan a much, much better send off then that (and he was practically begging for one more chance until they 'shot' him down too.) That being said, I really liked Casino Royale when I eventually saw it at home. I do think that they could have added more of the Bond music (though you can pick it up if you listen hard enough), but all in all it was a nice reboot for the franchise. Then I went to see Q of S in the theater and was thoroughly disappointed. The editing was awful, but it was an okay action movie, just not a 'Bond' movie (any true 007 fan will know exactly what I mean.) So, I was a little bit skeptical about Skyfall (it being the 50th anniversary movie and all), though I was really pumped after watching all the previews and reading all about it on IMDb. <br/><br/>And now, I've just returned from watching Skyfall in IMAX (highly recommended by the way) and I LOVED IT! Now, I've read a lot of fan reviews that have said ""if this is your favorite Bond movie, then you haven't seen them all...or...your not a true fan."" Every 'true' Bond fan has their favorite movie, it depends on a lot of different things: like, for instance, when you grew up or which was the first you saw or just how engrossed you are in the whole 'Bond universe.' But, any true Bond fan who did not like this movie must have something seriously against Daniel Craig or the producers (or just be plain crazy!) This movie was done absolutely, 100%, RIGHT! The 007 theme music is back (thank GOD!), the 007 moments are back (the quick quips, the wink, the fixing of the cuff links, the car, the gun etc. etc.), the beautiful locations are there and lastly the movie is NOT afraid to BE a Bond movie. It is not just an ordinary action movie. One which simply moves the hero from 1 big explosion to the next (like Q of S)...this lets Bond, well, just be Bond. He actually has to unravel the mystery and takes us along for the ride. The Bond girl is excellent (and what happens to her, is one heck of a nerve shake.) The villain is the best in years. I've also heard a lot being said about his 'homo-erotic' tendencies...he may be bi-sexual, true, but the scene in question is simply about him trying to make 007 (and the audience) uncomfortable...and he definitely succeeds...then Bond simply gives him a one-liner and throws it right back into his face as if to say, ""stop trying to throw me off my game."" The movie tends to re-invent it self while still preserving the past. It's beautifully directed and by this time, Craig has BECOME James Bond (it fits him like a finely tailored suit..pun!) And, the ending, though I won't spoil it (I hope I already haven't said too much) is plain and simply...AWESOME!!! I can't wait to see the next one!!! Here's just hoping that they have finally found their 'niche' and continue from this wonderful point and not try to stir things up again (its shaken, not stirred anyway ;-) <br/><br/>Anybody..from the casual fan, to the most hardcore enthusiast , will love this movie. I certainly did..and though I'm not sure if its my favorite (only repeated viewings will eventually tell), I do feel that it is the most fun that I've ever had watching a Bond film for the first time. And, it was my best movie experience in a very very very very long time. I cannot recommend it enough. Go see it...I know I will be seeing it again soon!!! Enjoy!"

","If you only read the first line of my review, heres my opinion, its fantastic, well worth your time and money, see it in IMAX though.<br/><br/>I was a little concerned when i first heard Sam Mendes was directing the 50th Bond movie, as a similar unusual choice of director was made with Michael Apted on The World Is Not Enough.<br/><br/>That was Pierce Brosnan's third outing as Bond and the Brosnan Bonds, i feel, deteriorated as they went along, even then Bond was still slavishly following the Goldfinger/Thunderball schematic.<br/><br/>That rigid, moribund take on Bond culminated in Die Another Day, Bond was starting to look silly, he was becoming a parody, invisible cars were not the way forward.<br/><br/>This was the point where it seems to me the producers realised Bond isn't about scale, rather drama and intensity.<br/><br/>Since that realisation, they have re-cast, re-tooled and re-booted, the results have been re-markable.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig has proved that what may seem like a questionable choice at first, can often be shown to be a wise one in the long term. In our modern times where ""reality"" is the watchword, he has, with a little help from the Bond people, brought us an abrasive edge (not seen since Connery) and emotional facet to the character, that will ensure his longevity well into the 21st century.<br/><br/>Having loved the Bond movies as a kid, reading the books, its a pleasure to report that Commander (RNR) James Bond is reinvigorated and reporting back for duty, ma'am.<br/><br/>Skyfall, without wanting to get too bogged down in tedious semantics, now falls within, i'd say, the three best Bond films to date.<br/><br/>After snatching your breath away, with a hell for leather opening chase across Istanbul and a seemingly inescapable cliffhanger, the film settles down into a story where, Bond is emotionally stripped down, questions his very raison d'être and emerges triumphantly to...well i'm not going to spoil it.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem provides a Bond villain, with one foot in the past (figuratively) and an eye on a vengeful future, he represents the flamboyance of earlier villains and the elusive spectre of the modern terrorist.<br/><br/>Dame Judi Dench is fantastic, she even gets to shoot a gun, what more could you want ?<br/><br/>Before the dust settles, we've visited Shanghai, the Bond family home, popped into the National Gallery to view Turner's ""The﻿ fighting Temerarie tugged to her last Berth"", fed the Komodo Dragons and quoted some of Tennyson's Ulysses.<br/><br/>Bond is experiencing a renaissance and you will be shaken, stirred and thoroughly entertained."

It took me back to some of the original films and was witty and clever.<br/><br/>I think Sam Mendes did a good job and the characters came to life, the story was well thought out and the music was great.

","This film is ambitious. The more I think about it the more I appreciate the real, raw emotion that was captured on screen and thrust at the audience. I don't believe any other Bond film has ever had the ability to do this; the campy, guns blazing, invincible Bond is not what a real-life Bond would be. <br/><br/>My opinion the best opening/credit sequence of the series. One of the best Bond villains. The acting and directing couldn't be better.<br/><br/>In terms of the tone of the James Bond series, there was only meant to be one Skyfall. And it's done brilliantly. Now that Craig is signed for two more Bonds he needs to save the world, and dare I say venture into space?"

As it progresses, we get to see a side of Bond and M that is not revealed in any Bond film so far. I enjoy the change and the deepening of the Story plot. I've read other reviews saying it's the worst Bond ever. That's ridiculous, have you seen the original Casino Royale? Daniel Craig has been criticized as being a blow up, high impact, no smart gadget Bond. I agree. He's a Bond for today's generation. Q is nerd, but most people today identify with the gadgets and electronics that previous Bonds were so famous for, the element of blunt instrument violence lends a great appeal for movie goers now.

","Skyfall (2012)<br/><br/>In many ways this is a return to a full-fledged Bond archetype. The special effects are still spectacular, and the tricks and impressive smarts and physical stunts are still terrific. But here is the man, James Bond, with a sense of history, character, persona. And just as the Nolan Batman movies rise above through character development, so does ""Skyfall"" make the most of the essence of ""Bond"" the legend and uber-spy.<br/><br/>The key to this was in the middle of the opening chase and fight scene, highly and wonderfully improbable, where he lands after a series of crashing and crushing cars (VW Beetles as his sidekick almost too obviously notes), suddenly he's inside a train car full of passengers and before dashing for his life after the bad guy, he straightens his cuff. That, after all, is James Bond, with gorgeous suits as important as gorgeous women.<br/><br/>Walking out with my girlfriend slightly unimpressed by the whole two hours plus of this, despite the strong beginning, I heard the key to it all. She said it wasn't fantastic enough, it didn't push the edge enough. Think of Dr. No or other early villains with their incredible complexes of evil set in exotic locales. And I think she's right, because this lacked some kind of unique 007 flair. It's a really well made movie, exciting and bold, that much we can all agree on. <br/><br/>But guess what? That's the norm these days. There are so many movie with tremendous chases, fights, fireballs, and even crashing trains these aren't distinguishing traits anymore (including the ""Incredibles,"" which borrows tropes like they were your neighbor's tools).<br/><br/>What's new? In a way the biggest ""trick"" is the dipping into the past, literally. A classic Austin is pulled out complete with machine guns mounted in the grill. A joke is made about low tech gadgets like the radio (a radio!) he is given, and then it saves him. And there is Moneypenny, the twist being only that she is now black. I'm not sure that's a triumph--I'm ready for a black Bond, actually. Now that, think about it, is new. It's a new world. Check out the U.S. elections.<br/><br/>What about Daniel Craig? This is his best Bond, to my naive eyes (I'm a Sean Connery fan at heart). But he manages a coolness that doesn't just become lack of life. The ""women"" around him (a Bond cliché) are actually held in check, so we aren't subjected to the same sexualized objectification as the earlier films. Good.<br/><br/>And Javier Bardem? He's great. But he's no Joker (either Nicholson or Ledger). In fact, the whole attempt at being outrageous (the computer stuff, the glass cage) is painfully small minded stuff. Maybe this is Sam Mendes's fault, ultimately. He's a first rate director, but normally plays deft with psychology and creepy human types, not action-adventure. <br/><br/>See it. It's a good film, a good Bond film. The fact it isn't what it could have been by several important levels is not so terrible. It's fun, powerfully made, and a necessary step in the evolution of the genre--the genre of its own making, Bond, James Bond."
"eschetic-2","8","4","11","19 November 2012"," Thoroughily enjoyable Bond outing only a little let down by Mendes' direction
","Daniel Craig and Ian Flemming's great James Bond character are always worth spending time with - both for the adventure of seeing where this 50 year old franchise can go next and the joy of seeing subtle acting in a very unsubtle genre. One notices however, after enjoying a couple hours of solid escapist adventure including both touching transitions (a great character exiting the series given a meaty role on the way out!) and smile inducing re-introductions of minor iconic characters (it's clear THIS Moneypenny is going to have more to do in future films even if the classic Aston Martin may not!), that by the next day between the standard set pieces (the thrilling chases, the smooth erotic encounters and the lavishly filmed travelogues) there seems to be a certain lack in the connective tissue holding director Sam Mendes' story telling together.<br/><br/>Yes, we do have a new villain who has freshly creepy kinks to offer, and a few jokes all too parsimoniously doled out, but neither the kink nor the comedy get enough screen time (or have the impact to FEEL like they have enough screen time) to fully satisfy! The great first challenging encounter between Craig and Bardem seems particularly shortchanged (even though it contains the movie's most memorable line, ""what makes you think it's my first time?""), and the ""Hannibal Lecter"" style transitional confinement scene is simply a time waster, but any film which can have the fun this one does with a pair of komodo dragons and a throw-away line about ""the circle of life"" is not so very far off the track with which the series has always bonded with its audience, and there are other delightful surprises as well (I defy anyone to *recognize* Albert Finney in his sublime turn at the family estate which gives the film its title).<br/><br/>This is a smooth enjoyable Bond from the superlative opening credits (among the best in the series so far) to the final rooftop passing of the ""inheritance"", neither shaken nor stirring, but a worthy addition to the series and pointing the way to potential greatness still to come. ""Rebooting"" an adventure series which had gotten the not entirely deserved reputation of being a Cold War creation (only FROM Russia WITH LOVE really went there) into a Post-Cold War environment where the nature of the threats have evolved is not a bad thing - even when copycats from Helm to Bourne to all the earlier Bond incarnations makes keeping ideas and visuals fresh difficult. Ben Whishaw's new ""Q"" offers impressive potential if we can take his unfortunate assertion that ""we don't go in for that sort of thing any more"" as mere hyperbole and something the DEPARTMENT will back off of when they see the potential for the sort of ""toys"" his kind are good at - particularly if interacting with the fascinatingly flawed Naomie Harris' character, Eve, and while the initial introduction of Ralph Fiennes here was none too smooth until the exciting scene in the Committee Hearing Room, there is great potential to be mined in his persona as well.<br/><br/>It is easy to note that Sam Mendes is a wildly uneven director in his stage work - sometimes brilliant, sometimes simply misguided - and he shows the full range of that unevenness in this film. Two of the important new ""Bond women,"" Bérénice Marlohe as a supposedly frightened adversary and Helen McCrory as an aggressive MP are essentially wasted in his apparent effort not to be ""politically incorrect"" (to do a Bond film is to free yourself from such concerns unless you can honor them with *humor*). Nevertheless, he gets the broad sweep of the film right and if he returns for another go in the series, one can expect the ride will be smoother and the ""highs"" of comfort, kink and comedy even higher. I look forward to it - or ANY film in which Daniel Craig or Dame Judi Dench hold forth."

","I have not really enjoyed the last few James Bond movies, however I still go along to see them hoping that one-day they will return to their former glory. Whilst ""Skyfall"" is better than the last two, it still falls far short of good James Bond entertainment. The film lacks the large-scale sets, the gadgets, the humour, the glamour, and the escapist scenery. It is dark. Being a Sony (MGM) product, there are plenty of product placements in the film. One advantage of digital film making and projection is that it is possible to have a rock steady picture as there is no film movement in a projector gate. This showed up fairly unsteady camera work in the scenes in some interior shots. As they have by the end of this movie replaced the cast playing all the regular main characters except the actor playing James Bond, I hope in the next film the new Moneypenny, Q, and M will bring back some of the original Bond movie features again. Pity that they did not, whilst replacing the cast, find a new actor for Bond as well. I wonder where the money that they say it cost to make this film was spent. It does not have big sets, or a huge cast. Maybe some of the cast had high fees. Please Bond makers, bring us back the Bond we loved from the earlier decades."

","Just saw the movie over it's first weekend in India. In much anticipation as I have seen previous bond movies of Craig and liked them for pure BOND charm of it. SkyFall, did not came even nearby to fulfill the expectations. <br/><br/>In fact many a times I was in nostalgic mood realizing quite a few OLD Hindi spy flicks with similar scene or setup. In fact SKYFALL was by the book SPY Thriller if we see the script scene by scene. Motorcycle chase,Train-top fighting, a big unnecessary suspense created but did not sustained, Villain with ambition to rule over the world. Only thing which looked different(and every bit force)was the villains escape plan and computer gimmicks added to support it.<br/><br/>Villain was impressive and with a decisive laugh or looks same as many Hindi movie like SHAKAAL in SHAAN or MOGAMBO in Mr. India.<br/><br/>The only charm I found was the characters and actors who played them so nicely. Thats the only reason to watch SkyFall. The old and new M, Q, Ms.Moneypenny gave it a good touch. <br/><br/>Another good part was storyline sticking to the CRAIG's bond movie themes which are exploring personal life and times of BOND than extravagant bond-necessary multi-gadget actions. In fact if I look at the Daniel Craig's BOND movies I feel like the last 3 movies were ""Making of a SPY - James BOND"" and at the end of SkyFall, it just confirms the belief.<br/><br/>I may have to read many bond books to understand why bond needed to take the war at ""SKYFALL""<br/><br/>It left me wanting so much more as if there is a new bond movie coming in just next 6-10 months."

","After the previous poor effort, i had such low expectations of 'Skyfall' but the third Craig Bond, really delivers and is easily as good if not superior to 'Casino Royale'. In fact the only aspect of a classic Bond caper missing, is the mind-blowing musical score by John Barry; otherwise it's a full-blown, exciting action yarn. There are so many nice touches in 'skyfall' and Daniel.C, has really cemented in confidence with the character, although interestingly being at his most vulnerable. The William Tell scene is such a stand alone classy scene. Another feather in the cap is a masterly, sinister performance from the Spaniard, Javier Bardem and whoever comes next as the Bond bad guy, will be hard pushed to top this."
"Mr-Fusion","8","2","4","10 April 2015"," Washes out the disappointing taste of ""Quantum of Solace"" quite nicely.
","Seen simply as a spy movie, ""Skyfall"" is plenty exciting, bursting at the seams with the juiced-up action of the Daniel Craig era. That cold-open is gobsmacking, dramatic not just in its stunts, but in setting off down a suitably dark road; one that leaves Bond's exterior shaken, injured and off his game. There's good story material to be mined here, fleshing out the nasty side of double-O work. Not to mention questioning MI6's old ways in a new world. Bardem certainly leaves his mark as the tortured villain, and the rapport between Craig and Dench's grand ball-buster is wicked.<br/><br/>But it's the little touches here and there that I really love about this movie. There's certainly globe-hopping, but it all leads back to London, which is nice for this series. And between the final scene and the Aston Martin, I love that they bring the 2006 reboot full-circle with classic Bond legend. Q and Moneypenny are in place, we're back, and I can't wait for ""Spectre"".<br/><br/>8/10"

We see no evidence that the bad guy has the physical or mental characteristics to make him an equal to Bond, which is what the movie suggests. (He's more like a rich jerk with a lisp who talks too much.)<br/><br/>Also  as the ""Honest Trailers"" gag points out  what happened to the stolen list? Wasn't that the point of the movie?"
"SpeakingEye","Null","2","4","12 January 2014"," We've been expecting more Mr Bond
","With every new release of a Bond film there are two predictable events. Firstly, that some journalist will proclaim it the best Bond ever. Secondly, that the marketing campaign for the film will be the equivalent of a continual sledge hammer hit over our heads for a full month with no hiding place. The result of these two events is that in the minds of the Bond fan and any other interested film goer that the film they are about to see had better be damned good.<br/><br/>And so we have Skyfall. As you have seen through your perusal of the other hundred odd reviews, opinions vary from an absolute triumph to a colossal turkey. In my opinion it is neither as Skyfall is a mixed bag of a film. The plot is weak and changes tack half way through and the villain a poorly thought out one. However, in places the film shines from a script clearly written by intelligent writers as there are some really well delivered dialogue scenes. The action scenes are not particularly exciting and we are ""treated"" to maybe the worst one in the series – the crashing of an empty tube at London rush hour. It also suffers from an M who is clearly past pensionable age and a supporting cast of forgettable characters (Q is a wise cracking ""yoof"", Tanner a grey bureaucrat more suited to managing the staff car park etc.) The shining light is the introduction of Ralph Fiennes character who will be a big asset for many Bond films to come. <br/><br/>So the best Bond film? Definitely not. Did it merit the relentless PR machine? Count the numbers and see. But it is possible to see a next film delivering more but only with the following provisos:<br/><br/>1. The next film must be developed around a credible villain. The ""crazed individual"" approach has had its day. There are plenty of villainous governments out there for Bond to fight against. Bringing back a SPECTRE style approach would also work as countries form alliances with each other. 2. Daniel Craig needs to learn how to do suave. Mr Craig brings everything to the Bond role except this and it makes for a poorer Bond. This aspect is important as it has always formed part of the reason why men want to be Bond and not the Terminator or Rambo. 3. Make the most of Ralph Fiennes – he is the only credible supporting character and is capable of making any scene involving for the viewer.<br/><br/>There will always be a Bond and there will always be the machine that delivers it. The trick for those operating the machine is to deliver that special quality that makes us still want Bond fighting our battles. As Sheryl Crow once said, you are not the only spy out there."
"rsabnis1","6","2","4","9 November 2013"," Skyfall: Sadly the best Bond movie ever...Only question is...How??
","One of the best Bond movies ever (at least what the film experts call it) 'Skyfall' gathered a whopping 1 billion at the box office thus being the only highest earning James Bond movie. Having a budget of 150-200 million, Skyfall takes you to some of the appealing locations in the world. Thanks to Sam Mendes's extra-ordinary imagination, the film takes us on a mini tour. May it be the ostentatious city of Shanghai to one of the magnificent gambling dens in Macau; Mendes has done an impressive job in the director's chair. <br/><br/>As a movie buff, I would give my thumbs up to the director without a slight reluctance. Only problem lies with me is the weak plot of the movie clearing giving clichés at some points. I am quite sure that this utter statement which I made might drop some jaws enough to tag me as a hysterical person altogether. But I personally found Daniel Craig starrer 'Casino Royale', a far improved & an impeccable endeavour than Skyfall. <br/><br/>The movie starts with two agents James Bond & Eve Moneypenny chasing a man named Patrice down the streets of Istanbul who has a very important hard drive; something which acquired can save a cataclysmic event. A terrific bike chase sequence is shown where Bond & Patrice end up falling on the top of the train. ""Ok! Now I am excited. Let's see what Mendes has to show now "" was how my thoughts were directed watching Bond & Patrice engage in a pernicious fistfight. <br/><br/>But somehow I was disappointed when Eve who got herself positioned alongside with a sniper rifle under the pretext of shooting Patrice, shot Bond instead. It was her mistake. Mistakes do happen. But a man who falls from a height in the waterfall with a bullet in his shoulder is sure to die. But he doesn't. The question of 'Who saves him?' is still unresolved till date. C'mon Mendes, show some realism while making such sequences. Only Indian audiences can put their faith here only because they have been subjected to many such mindless sequences in past.<br/><br/>A presumed-dead James Bond soon returns back to London when his organization MI6 is targeted to massive gas explosions as someone underground hacks into their highly secure systems. Put out on the field by his boss M (Judi Dench) even though he is degraded & merely held on his feet by alcohol, Bond makes himself ready to chase down this hacker who has started a grudge mission against British Secret service. The film is magnificent, Bond happens to look cooler than before but the plot is flawed at places but somehow those flaws aren't important enough to be noticed by viewers. <br/><br/>But some scenes did deserve some more thinking, brilliance & realism. I recollect a scene where Silva, the hacker is caught up & held in MI6 headquarters but he soon escapes the cell with no bigger fuss than you could imagine. Mendes did his best to imitate the Joker sequence from The Dark Knight but ended up doing rather childishly. I mean as soon as the bespectacled geeky-looking genius 'Q' connects Silva's laptop to the main server, the port generates an algorithm hacking the entire system thus setting the cell door open. Now you don't really require a cinematic vision to think about such a plot. Even a not-so-expert naive software engineer can think about such an idea. The movie deserved better considering the hype it left behind after its release. Then they mention that Silva's planning the escape since years. Oh really! I mean he really knew the new changed location of MI6 after gas bombing since years. Admirable foresight he has I must say. <br/><br/>The action sequence towards the end of the movie looks promising except few unanswered questions which still linger in my mind. I heard bullet in legs can take days for an unattended victim to die. So how does M succumb to her injury just after hours of being shot on her leg? A helicopter falls on the mansion & there is a massive explosion & anything within a radius of few meters of the bungalow is sure to be caught in fire. But Silva who is just standing in front of the house escapes without even a small burn or a bruise. How? Jump in the water beneath the ice & I am confident you won't even be able to stand properly when you get out. But here comes James Bond as if he is just back from his regular swimming sessions. <br/><br/>Overall, I have no qualms with Skyfall except the fact that a small love story or a romantic angle at some point could have been poignant on the celluloid. The film is opulent & deserved more judging Craig's superb acting. Nevertheless I personally feel the tag of the highest Bond earning movie would have looked better on 'Casino Royale' rather than 'Skyfall'. <br/><br/>But for action lovers, Skyfall is not worth giving a miss. It remains brilliant if the sluggish flaws are proudly overlooked. I tried doing it but I failed to know why. Maybe others can. Good Luck!"

","As Adele warbles the theme tune during the introduction, you realise: There's been a 10 minute opening sequence just to get to this point. Only the Bond films could get away with this. In case you think this is overlong though, savour it... As there isn't much else in the way of conflict for the first hour, besides James's psychological scars and M's attempts to stop herself getting fired for gross incompetence. Yes folks, this is a brave new world... Bond is seen as a bit of a dinosaur from a bygone era, and his philosophy of drinking dry Martinis and sleeping with anyone with a pulse doesn't cut the mustard with the modern 'enlightened' MI6. By the same token, the Bourne movies are starting to catch up with the 007 films in popularity AND quality, so has this recent entry got the to keep apace with the competition?<br/><br/>Why, yes it does. It feels somewhat like a changing of the guard, with a big departee (no spoilers) and a few new additions who'll probably go on to be series regulars. As I said, it does start off s-l-o-w but this is more than made up for by the latter sections, which feature thrilling confrontations in the heart of London and right down in Bonnie Olde Scotland. To be honest, the story about a disgruntled ex-agent taking revenge on his old boss did not leave me shaken or stirred as it has been done to death in a million similar flicks. Javier Bardem scores as the baddie though, with his peroxide hair and his homosexual leanings he instantly cuts a memorable character. Him and Bond have a nice rapport, maybe, if things could have been different...<br/><br/>Above all, it's a worthy addition to the franchise, and whets our appetite for the next entry. There's life in the old dog yet... 7/10"

","Some have praised this as the best, others have slated it as the worst. Personally, I find it somewhere in between.<br/><br/>The plot is fine, but pretty straightforward and nothing new. Some really good scenes, but some weak ones too.<br/><br/>The movie starts off strong, but gradually takes a bit of a nosedive into the second act and the pace drops from the adrenaline action of the opening scene to really sleepy scenes with not much to keep you going. The non action scenes in the second act have dry dialogue and don't really keep the attention. The arrival at Skyfall helps to pick things up a bit and has a wild west feel to it but I can't help feel that overall, they missed the mark here. It just doesn't feel like a Bond movie.<br/><br/>Also, why did they wait 3 movies in to introduce Moneypenny and Q? They should have been brought into the fold sooner and could have been more established now. Instead of being key in helping Bond albeit in smaller roles, they seem more like bit part characters and what they add to the movie could have been provided by any character in the story."

Even though I didn't find Skyfall a very good film I still thought it was an enjoyable and welcome addition to the long-running franchise. Skyfall succeeds on many things, albeit not on everything. What's good about Skyfall is that it has a couple of engrossing action sequences and a surprisingly gripping and finely constructed storytelling, and managed to exceed my expectations! Way to go man! The movie has other strong points as well, such as the settings. Shangai, the devastated island, Scotland and Istanbul were good settings and I thought that there were enough of them to satisfy. Moneypenny is a good looking Bond woman with humour and sensual charm. The Bond villain is well played and well cast by Javier Bardem and haunting in personality. I loved the song, opening credits and the new gadget, which I thought, in addition to storytelling and action sequences, were high-up achievements in the James Bond franchise. I was, however, badly let down by the film's weak plot and it got me annoyed and frustrated and so did the movie's failure to reach a desirable height, that of being a great and incredibly memorable film. This isn't the kind of movie to make you die to see a few more times. Sad. Skyfall is riveting nevertheless and ultimately a smart action- thriller movie. My rating for Skyfall: 7.3/10"

","It is to my immense delight, that Skyfall has turned out to be a masterpiece and a true return to the Bond film fans have been yearning for.<br/><br/>Skyfall is without question the best Bond movie since Goldeneye and is possibly the best of the entire series (yes it is that good!).<br/><br/>I was never convinced by Daniel Craig as Bond until now, but he turns in a truly fantastic performance. All the elements of Bond are there, the 'glib remarks and pithy comebacks' as Alex Trevelyan would say, delivered without any cheesiness <br/><br/>The rest of the cast are all great, stand outs of course being Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. Ben Wishaw is also excellent as the new 'Q'. Anyone who had seen the BBC series 'The Hour' would already know the guy can really act.<br/><br/>I think credit for Skyfall being so remarkably good, is down to helmer Sam Mendes and of course his DP. The film hits all the right notes and is genuinely riveting from start to finish. The pacing is great and it never feels like one action sequence pointlessly rolling into another, as it did with Casino Royale. Instead it is a complete and extremely satisfying experience<br/><br/>Having suffered nothing but disappointment since 'The World is Not Enough' (the last semi-decent Bond until now). I'm almost ecstatic at this amazing return to form, and sincerely hope Mendes will direct the next one<br/><br/>To sum up the past few bond films:<br/><br/>Die another day: A total mess - could see what they were trying to do, with nods to virtually every other film in the series, but just doesn't work. And as for the invisible car, well suspension of disbelief is taken way past breaking point 4/10<br/><br/>Casino Royale: Not a bad action film taken on face value, but not Bond! Tries way to hard to be Bourne, and Craig's Bond is very muffled and forcibly over-serious. Product placement is also ridiculous! 6/10<br/><br/>Quantum of Solace: Absolute bunk - have tried to watch it a couple of times, but never been able to sit through the whole thing. Dreadful shaky-cam simply compounds the multitude of problems the film already has 3/10 (I think that's quite generous!)<br/><br/>Skyfall: A dazzling return to form for the franchise - really can't fault it. It also shows that with the right director, Craig makes a really excellent Bond and in my opinion puts him up there with best. It has everything and more Bond fans could want, without ever veering into silliness and it's also funny; something that has been so sorely lacking in last two outings. The chemistry between the cast is also terrific. This the Real reboot of the franchise 10/10<br/><br/>Anyone, who like myself, had completely lost faith in the franchise, needs to see this - it will restore it, and you'll be a happy Bond fan again! It should be nominated for a stash of academy awards, whether it will, or will simply be overlooked because it's Bond, time will tell<br/><br/>Finally as an aside, I've always thought Craig was earmarked for Bond after his performance in Layer Cake; particularly the scene where he is throwing shapes with the gun in his flat. Ben Wishaw 'Q' appeared alongside him in that film, funny how things work out ;-)"
"OneMovieLover","9","5","16","11 November 2012"," Rightfully praised as one of the best Bonds yet
","'Skyfall' is certainly not flawless, but it is one of the best films of the year. The movie yanks the iconic character right into action, and he fights the murderer of an MI6 agent on top of a train. I really can't say much about the plot because there's suspense everywhere, and I'll feel as if I'm spoiling a part of it if I do say any more.<br/><br/>The film, as expected, contains lots of action, as Bond jumps on the bottom of an elevator and dodges a falling train. In a good way, the setting jumps from set-piece to set-piece: the London Underground, a public inquiry, a casino, a childhood home named after the movie title - - so while there are some scenes that are a little slow and driven by mostly just talking, it's difficult to get bored.<br/><br/>Some people have criticized the lack of chemistry between Daniel Craig and Naomie Harris, dismissing it as ""non-existent"". However, Eve is not a big character in the film; thus, it doesn't bring the whole movie down. 'Skyfall' doesn't have to be a romance.<br/><br/>The third act also, to a few critics, didn't live up to what came before it, which I don't understand because the third act is practically non- stop action, and frankly the most entertaining part of the movie to me.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Skyfall' is an awesome 50th anniversary present. It's stylish, it's action-packed, it has expansive set-pieces, Daniel Craig is a good Bond, and it's entertaining for a majority of its (somewhat long) running time. On a smaller note, the theme song is definitely an accomplishment for Adele. Highly recommended."
"h-oates","10","5","16","2 November 2012"," One of the best Bond films ever made.
","I have long been a fan of the James Bond franchise. I was brought up with the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. The first one I ever saw was Goldeneye, from that moment I was hooked. But his movies got worse as they went on, being a Bond fan I liked them all, but I had to admit they were getting worse. This culminated with Die Another Day. It was at this stage a reboot was needed. I was wary of Craig at first, I didn't think he would cut it as Bond. I really liked Casino Royale but I felt it was a tad overrated. Maybe it's because I wasn't used to this more darker human Bond. Quantum of Solace was a step down from Casino Roayle, and I felt this could be the end of Craig's Bond. I was wary that the critics were overselling Skyfall, and that it would be not as good as they said. I am happy to report, I was totally wrong.<br/><br/>Skyfall is in my opinion one of the very best Bond films ever made, arguably the best. A blistering pre-credits sequence, in which Daniel Craig destroys half of Istanbul in a quest to recover sensitive information from an enemy operative, initially suggests Bond is back on track after the stuttering blip that was Quantum Of Solace. No sooner are we settled though, when James is shot in error by one of his own (Naomie Harris), plunging from the roof of a moving train into the opening title filled with skulls, tombstones and other totems of death.<br/><br/>Bond survives, of course – he always does. But when he comes back to life he is far from his best, Craig's unshaven chops and bloodshot eyes betraying a man whose heart isn't in it (if it ever was).It doesn't help that Judi Dench's M also looks set for the scrap heap, or that the new Q (Ben Whishaw) is a techno-nerd barely half his age. (""You still have spots!"" sneers Bond contemptuously during their first encounter in the National Gallery.) Put through his paces after some Mediterranean down- time involving scorpion-baiting drinking games and post-shag Heineken, 007 can hardly manage a chin-up before collapsing in a heap. He can't even dangle from the undercarriage of an ascending elevator without wincing in discomfort. If Casino Royale was Bond finding his footing, Skyfall is him remembering where he left it - a clever turnaround made all the more effective by giving 007 an adversary who, for much of the film, is crossing the finish line while Jimmy's putting on his trainers. With his shock of blond hair, dodgy dentistry and vengeful M fixation, Javier Bardem's Silva is that rarest of creations: a cyber-terrorist who genuinely terrifies. But he also has a playful side; witness the literally thigh-rubbing glee he brings to one stand-out interrogation scene. It's far from the only sexually charged moment, cue a steamy shower clinch with Bérénice Marlohe's femme fatale Sévérine, plus some saucy banter with Harris' Eve that positively fizzes with winking innuendo. But in line with Craig's summer assignment at Buckingham Palace, the real Bond girl is of a more seasoned vintage: Dame Judi herself, here evolving from 007's testy taskmistress into a surrogate mother he will kill to protect. The casting of Dench was always a master-stroke, but it has taken seven outings, and one Oscar-winning filmmaker, for her to be exploited properly. Mendes' ambitions, though commendable, don't always fit the material. The Bond series has lasted half a century without referencing Shakespeare, Tennyson and JMW Turner, so why shoehorn them in now? Thankfully they don't interfere with the standard Bondian trappings, Skyfall boasting all the glamour, excitement and exoticism we have come to expect and then some. A floating Macau casino, complete with firework display and komodo dragons, supplies a perfect setting for cocktails, fisticuffs and Live And Let Die in-jokes, while Bardem's hide-out - a deserted island full of crumbling masonry and broken statues - has all the grandeur of Blofeld's volcano with none of the impracticality.<br/><br/>A splendid mid-section in London, meanwhile, spurns the city's overexposed architecture for a chase beneath its surface, Bond pursuing Silva via sewer, tunnel and Tube while still finding time to crack the odd funny. Indeed, for all its intimations of mortality and harping on obsolescence, Skyfall is more often than not a hoot, Craig having the confidence at last to lace his Bond's killer instinct with a bone-dry wit and wry nonchalance. The scene where he contemplates utilising one of the series' oldest and most famous gizmos is a perfectly judged grace note, while an appearance from Albert Finney near the end of the picture exudes warmth and good humour. It all adds up to the 007 adventure we've been waiting for: a flawlessly assembled thrill ride with a cast to die for and a nakedly emotional undertow. Happy birthday, Mr Bond. Here's to another 50 years."

It is also made ​​into a film SKYFALL debut with highest earnings in non-holiday weekend. The good news continues for SKYFALL also grossing film debut in the history of Brazil.<br/><br/>With so many records were broken as well as the positive reviews on the film, it is quite possible circulation in America later would be hugely successful.

Let's wait how the results for Skyfall later."
"xfilian","10","6","21","28 October 2012"," A breath of fresh air (again).
","Lets start by stating the obvious - this film (as with the previous two in the Craig era Bond)will divide audiences. There will be those who mourn the loss of girls, gadgets and humorous Bond and there will be those who welcome this new era of strong, silent Bond whose jokes, gadgets and one liners are kept to a minimum. Personally, I fall into the latter category. Those fans that mourn the 'real Bond' are actually missing the point - the real Bond as envisaged by Ian Fleming is far closer to Craig's interpretation that that of Moore in the 70's or Brosnan in the 90's. So, a breath of fresh air that we have something approaching the real deal instead of increasingly ridiculous gadgets and cheesy one liners that would not be out of place in a Carry On film.<br/><br/>I saw the film in IMAX and it is a treat from the breathless opening sequence to the satisfying conclusion. Mendes produces to big action set pieces when they are called for, which contrast brilliantly with the quiet, brooding moments, especially those involving the bad guy, played brilliantly and with evident glee by Javier Bardem. Judi Dench again produces a top acting turn as M and this time has far greater involvement in proceedings, much to the film's benefit. In fact, all the supporting cast contribute greatly to the film - Marlohe giving us the sex appeal and Whishaw surprising me with a convincing Q. And then there is Craig - the first Bond since Connery who you watch and actually believe that this man is a British spy. He is human, he has emotions but at the same time he is cold and dedicated. Everything is in place to give a well rounded, thoroughly believable character, consequently giving the film that gritty edge as opposed to throw away popcorn fantasy. If Fleming were alive, I'm confident he would applaud."
"theonewithallthecontacts","10","6","21","28 October 2012"," Bond is back where he belongs!
","OK, so I finally watched Skyfall after a long and painful four year gap. When I heard they were going to bring the old Bond back with gadgets, more Bond humor, etc. I was very thrilled. But the first teaser trailer sort of felt like this same dark side of Bond. But I went to the cinema, watched the movie and was completely stunned to put it mildly! Sam Mendes impresses with his brilliant and tireless direction, Thomas Newman made a fine job with the new score, Adele made a brilliant Bond song and Roger Deakins sure as hell did a good job with the cinematography!<br/><br/>Mendes really redefines Bond 100% percent to the better! A good old throwback to the sixties! Skyfall is at least as good as Casino Royale and beats the crap out of Quantum of Solace! You can't really help that a flow of nostalgia hits you when watching this fine masterpiece! <br/><br/>The only thing I will say about the plot, is that the movie starts out with an assassin stealing a list of all undercover NATO operatives! A classic and phenomenal Bond chase through Istanbul ensues, where Bond gets shot and disappears! MI6 then comes under attack and Bond resurfaces to find them responsible and bring them to justice! The plot is in fact very simple and very smooth. I can't imagine you're gonna get thrown off.<br/><br/>As mentioned, Roger Deakins' cinematography is very well done, providing you with the best 007 image to date! Newman's score is very subtle in its own way, but still very ""bond-ish"". Sam Mendes directs Skyfall with finesse and dedication, and he can also make action look beautiful (especially that first part)! My only regret is that they use too much CGI in the post-credit scene, which is very sad, because the only purpose it serves, is to show a background, when an unnecessary closeup of Craig on a bike ensues. The sound and sound mixing is fantastic, and so is the editing! Very few gripes in the technical department. <br/><br/>The screenwriters really give Craig the opportunity to redefine his Bond, giving him more depth and making him so much more emotional. Craig masters this in every scene in this movie and puts his fingerprint as one of the best Bond actors (if not the best) so far. Javier Bardem is also really brilliant in this movie. His acting is a little over-blown at times, but he still delivers a great performance! Bardem is a classic Bond villain, but still makes Silva his own. Unfortunately Naomie Harris and Bérenicé Marlohe fall for the same trap. Not enough screen time. They aren't really important to the story, which makes you stop caring about them. Their performances are solid, though. Judi Dench IS the real Bond babe in this film (not meant literally). She's much more personal and much more emotional in Skyfall. Ben Whishaw as Q was also a positive surprise! Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney, Helen McCrory, Rory Kinnear, and Ola Rapace also fill out brilliantly supporting roles.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes has set the standards for how the next Bond movie should be, which makes it so much easier for the next directors (if Sam Mendes doesn't return for the next project that is). The movie has in its own glory, celebrated the 50th anniversary for James Bond, in the best possible way! Skyfall is a brilliant and classic Bond film, but I still miss the feel and formula ""Casino Royale"" introduced us to back in 2006..."
"cremonese64","10","6","21","28 October 2012"," Bond Is Back
","Bond is back. Was there ever any doubt about it? Skyfall is a magnificent return to form for Bond and in the franchise's 50th year anniversary is almost certainly going to be considered one of the best Bond movies ever.<br/><br/>Skyfall is brilliantly acted, well paced, with some touches of dry humour and some great references to Bond movies past. Visually, the movie is stunning with some beautiful locations Shanghai and Macau being the standout places.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes has made his name through excellent art house movies, yet this is the British director's first British movie. An accomplished theatre director, Mendes is a real actors director and has got great performances out of his cast. Mendes is a rare director who rarely does a bad movie, and although Jarhead was perhaps a little misjudged, American Beauty, Revolutionary Road and Road to Perdition are masterpieces.<br/><br/>Craig is the best Bond and the best actor to play Bond. He is an experienced, rough around the edges and dangerous Bond who is entirely believable. Judi Dench has more to do than ever in this movie and her stunning performance should surely receive recognition. Bardem impresses and chews scenery as a very interesting villain whilst Naomi Harris and Bernice Marlohe are gorgeous as two very important characters. The cast is rounded off with a hugely effective role for Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw as the new Q. Even Albert Finney pops up to lend hugely experienced support in the gripping finale.<br/><br/>Bond is back, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."
"carlton-fisher","10","6","21","28 October 2012"," Sometimes the Old Way is the Best
","After years of uncertainty, studio bankruptcy and a less than impressive box office display from its predecessor, Skyfall has arrived on screens.<br/><br/>As a classic Bond fan it might not be surprising that I share the common low opinion of Daniel Craig's outings in the role. The 'gritty-realistic' fad of Hollywood threatened to squeeze out every drop of charm, cheese, suave and, let's face it, fun that makes James Bond such a loved franchise.<br/><br/>Skyfall is much more of a love letter to classic Bond. From the very first shot, the first note in the score the nostalgia comes rushing back, and with a grin on your face you know you're about to embark on a thrill ride reminiscent of the Connery days.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig finally seems the part of James Bond, gone is the brooding, replaced by magnetism and a glint in his eye, a perfect sweet spot between commanding and charming.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem plays what will doubtlessly go down as one of the all time best villains in Bond history in Silva. He's subtle, sinister and all together creepy. It is his vendetta running the plot. The film has a very intimate feel, not a contrived end of the world threat but a tense personal affair.<br/><br/>The film is full of a host of top British acting talent, Naomie Harris (28 Days Later), Ben Whishaw (Layer Cake) and Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) all giving strong performances. Special Mention must go to Dame Judi Dench, having portrayed M in 6 films previously, this is her crowning moment. Skyfall belongs to her just as much as Craig or Bardem.<br/><br/>All in all this is a beautifully shot, expertly directed film and must be considered as one of the best Bonds of all time."
"the-timelord-victorious","10","6","21","27 October 2012"," Nobody Does It Better Than James Bond!
","After the Luke warm reception of 'Quantum of Solace', and various MGM financial troubles, there was doubt in some peoples minds whether SKYFALL, or 'Bond 23′ as it was referred to then, would actually be made. However, 4 years down the line, SKYFALL just proves that James Bond can always make a triumphant return.<br/><br/>After trying to retrieve a stolen hard drive, James Bond (Daniel Craig), is accidentally shot down by field agent Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), and plummets into to the depths of a ravine, presumed dead. A terrorist attack on MI6 rocks the Secret Service and M is brought into questioning by Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, who questions her ability to run the Service, after the contents of the hard drive are still in enemy hands. Hearing about the terrorist attack on British soil, James Bond returns to aid M, and track down the villainous Silva (Javier Bardem), who appears to have a blood lust for Bonds beloved boss.<br/><br/>The plot is brilliantly straight forward, and more importantly, takes it's time. At 2 hours 20 minutes, SKYFALL is one of the longest films in the franchise, and it feels long. That isn't a complaint either. The problem most people had with Casino Royale was it's pacing issues in the final act. However, despite minor pacing issues in the first 45 minutes of the film, Skyfall does nothing of the sort. It feels satisfying, which is probably the most important aspect, considering the reception of it's predecessor.<br/><br/>If you all thought Casino Royale was the most human portrayal of James Bond's character, think again. Not only does Skyfall go deeper, it also allows us to see Bond's traumatic childhood. Daniel Craig manages, fantastically, to bring an even more vulnerable side to the character, be it his inability to complete an exercise programme, desperately trying to hang on to the bottom of an elevator, or failing to miss in target practice. This isn't the James Bond we know, this is James Bond recovering from substance abuse and depression, which isn't just a way of making him more human, it's a way of challenging whether James Bond is relevant for todays world.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes (Director of American Beauty and Road To Perdition) is not an action director, which is why Skyfall is such a remarkable achievement. Not only does Mendes bring depth and character, but also manages to show breathtaking action sequences, which is easily some of the best stunt work to date. Mendes also manages to fantastically intercut action and drama, a prime example being Bond running through the streets of London, intercut with M's reading of a Tennyson poem <br/><br/>We are not now that strength which in old days<br/><br/>Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;<br/><br/>One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br/><br/>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br/><br/>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.<br/><br/>Another master stroke for this film, was the casting of Oscar Winner, Javier Bardem, who turns in a completely, camp, hilarious, but genuinely chilling performance as Raoul Silva. Who isn't even a match for Bond, in fact, the brilliance of the film totally resides to how far ahead Silva always is. He is completely underestimated, and surprisingly always has the upper hand. ""What makes you think this is my first time?"" Bond quips, as Silva seductively unbuttons Bonds shirt and stokes his bare chest. Craig and Bardem play at each other with great effect, which makes it difficult to even consider who steals which scene.<br/><br/>It's Silva's total calmness that makes him all the more chilling. ""You're hurt? What have they done to you?"" he asks, spotting a bloody wound, on a terrified M. ""Finish it for both of us."", as he pulls her in for a tight hug and forces a gun into her hand, in one of the most moving, and tense scenes in the franchises history. With shades of Max Zorin, and Francisco Scaramanga, Silva will go down in history as one of the best Bond villains of all time.<br/><br/>Skyfall also marks the long awaited return of Q, now played by British actor Ben Whisaw. Which shows us that we don't need gadgets anymore to make Bond contemporary. The entire film is beautifully written, delivering snappy dialogue and totally oozing dry wit and good old British humour, made more hilarious by Craig, as he delivers the humour dead pan.<br/><br/>The whole thing roars along like a speeding bullet, with beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins. And despite a few fishy moments of CGI (Which doesn't even detract from the overall enjoyment anyway) the film is perfect. One of the most remarkable achievements in the film, consists of the beautiful relationship between Bond and M, in which Judi Dench is finally given the chance to show her remarkable acting ability. At the heart of the story lies a tragic and motherly relationship, which doesn't fail to bring a tear to the eye once everything is brought full circle.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a film that isn't scared to stray away from the iconic Bond formula. From the opening strains of the Bond theme, as Craig steps into the light in a dimly lit corridor, we can tell that this is not a traditional Bond film. In fact, what Mendes manages to do well, is still incorporate classic elements (The Aston Martin DB5, the James Bond theme, and opening closing gunbarrel sequence), but at the same time, willingly force upon you a fantastic, emotional, gripping, tense and down right hilarious film, that proves that still, after 50 years, nobody does it better than James Bond."
"john-bray-513-382444","10","6","21","27 October 2012"," He's BACK
","After the disappointment and bafflement that was The Quantum of Solace, and the almost Chick Flick that was Casino Royale I was ready to write Daniel Craig off as another George Lazenby. BUT.....what a difference, thank god for talented directors and writers who actually have a clue what Bond is all about. Connery, Moore....move over the new boy has come of age the name is Craig, Daniel Craig. This bond is back to the formula we all loved before Dalton and Brosnan, ridiculous chase scenes, pithy one liners and above all putting the Great BACK into Great Britain. Gone is the 'Ra Ra America' back is 'Rule Britannia', MI6's oh so helpful colleagues across the pond who of late seem to have saved James's bacon more than once do not even merit more than one line. Q branch makes a welcome return with Q's relationship with Bond back to the normal sparing matches of double entente although sadly no submarine cars or exploding pens. The Bond Girls really don't feature much, so in that respect this isn't the Bond of old (no Mr Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang)<br/><br/>But most of all the story line is simply stunning, we have glimpses of all aspects of Bond, the inner turmoil, his past, his future, what drives him. The story line also appears to be a subtle 2 fingers to the British government, defence cuts, civilian oversight of something civilians can never understand and the treatment of service personnel. I think it only fair to mention the much beloved DB5 makes a return worthy of Bond, I actually heard intakes of breath and cheering when she finally appears on our screen (and no it wasn't just the blokes). There are welcome moments of light relief through what is a very gritty and brilliantly suspense filled film, Bond's 'present' from Q and from Mr Silver both generated a laugh or two. The final sequences are beautifully poignant and play to the strengths of the surrounding scenery with amazing ability, plus an entrance any man of a certain age will love.<br/><br/>A fantastic film for Bond lovers and everyone else, be prepared for the ride of your life, discover Bond like never before, take a tissue (and not just to wipe the saliva from your mouth after the cars, girls, guns, chases, fights, helicopters, explosions. Or the tears of laughter from your eyes from the British wit, the one liners, and the down right insanity.), enjoy the best Bond film in 50 years."
"mark-mcphee","10","6","21","27 October 2012"," Great Movie
","Certainly one of the best Bond movies made. Great acting and directing.<br/><br/>The film plays tribute to the past 50 years of Bond and has re-introduced some old familiar characters that have been omitted from the past 2 Daniel Craig Bond films.<br/><br/>Although this is a great film, the only change I would make would be to have the gun sight moved to the beginning of the film as it was in the first 20 Bond films. I know Sony like to add their own stamp to films, but as a life long fan of the films, Sony, please don't mess too much with the chemistry.<br/><br/>The humour in the film is catered to both audiences, from action fan films to die hard Bond fans with subtitle jokes relating to previous films.<br/><br/>Again, the Aston Martin is not in the film much unfortunately, but when the DB5 is, it pays tribute to Goldfinger very well.<br/><br/>The ending is a bit predictable I found as nearing the last 30-45 mins of the film I twigged what would happen to M and how she was going to be replaced and how Miss Moneypenny would be introduced and who it would be.<br/><br/>The addition of Q back into the films was a great thing to see, although the lack of gadgets in comparison to previous Bond films was a bit disappointing but the humour in the scenes with Q reminded me to the Desmond Llewyn/Sean Connery films.<br/><br/>The small gripes about the film were mainly from a Bond fan point of view and should not take anything away from an absolutely brilliant film."

","Just seen Skyfall and have to say that it is a great film. I've been a Bond fan for as long as I can remember and have enjoyed each film in the series. Craig is a great Bond and has really bought Bond up to date. The story for Skyfall shows Bond as you have never seen him before. It brings out the inner workings of what makes Bond tick and why he has the attitude that gets him into trouble.<br/><br/>The other great thing about Skyfall is that it has bought back the old characters and again updated them. The producers have done themselves and the Bond legacy proud. Without giving to much away its a great film for the die hard Bond fan. Its has all the things you would expect in a Bond film and a lot that you wouldn't . The last thing to say is don't and do go with the thought of expecting the usual style that Bond films bring, but be ready for the twists that the story line will bring. Its a great transition."
"Metal_Star","3","4","12","3 February 2013"," Well, what can I say? It sucks in it's most complete form. The Legend Killer.
","Skyfall, a fraction of the Bond series, with a promising title for assurance of greatness and an descent of one of the greatest ancestor. To be given such an opportunity and to destroy it is a very difficult job and they have done it with pure perfection! Skyfall, the name of the city where Bond came from, an useless concept in a movie where the agent is supposed to think of new ways to destroy ""evil"" and protect the world. This movie falls in line with other movies like ""The Bourne Legacy"", ""X-Men : First Class"", ""The Dark Knight Rises"", movies that have no significance to it's Box set. Bourne Legacy, ironically, destroyed it's legacy with a single move! :) The Dark Knight Rises rose to it's glamour and fell to it's knees with a single knife to the back of the ""Dark One""(which wasn't the techniques of Ras'Al Ghul). X-Men First Class has nothing to offer, no logic, no irony, just a portion of stupidity and crap, which is more than enough, now that I think about it! I haven't watched the previous parts of 007, but now that I've watched this, I'm glad that I'll be feeling happy that nothing can be worse than what has just come to light. If you haven't watched this yet, do not do this mistake. It really is an Legend Killer. It has great graphics..that's it. Everything else has been made room for disappointment, it is just a point of us filling that room. Seriously, I do not understand how someone can say this was a good movie using their brain and have the will to post to share that message to the Internet using facebook. A spy movie doesn't contain spies who talk to each other to get the job done. Spies are classy, they keep thinking of new ways to get out their own messes. They are ready for any event to occur, no matter what age they are. They are built for all circumstances in life, and destroying the character of James Bond, 007 wasn't worth pointing out the message, 'People Get Old'. And, worst of all, M dies! Might not be a bad way to continue a ""story"", but the people of an secret agency are not dumb. They cannot break character, and they do not die without a fight. It is not too late to turn away from this awful story, filled with bullshit(Dirt would be saying the movie is dull, but this is filled with loud noises, women-who just take up time for no reason-, and meaningless action--qualifies for the location in the Pile Of Crap). The Sky has fallen, and it cannot rise from this. Because they couldn't afford to use their money and innovative abilities, they didn't use any new gadgets, thus proving to themselves that people can get fooled by the actors and the name of the movie, thus making us a delusional pack of fools. After finding out there are 2 more movies to join 007, I packed my hope up and left for the past--to go back in time-- and watch the classics, where, at least they gave a rat's ass about questioning the story and the way the characters in the movie are. With popularity of the movie to rise so high, the world has gone blind. I can't believe that they allowed this movie to be released. Quantum Of Solace was the last normal-good part and Casino Royale was the last best part, and I don't believe there's a possibility of this series to be good anymore. I'm going to satisfy my disappointment by watching different possibilities of how it could have ended, go to sleep and wake up to another day of disappointment of movies--Frankly, the cracks on the wall give out more better stories, they make sense-- and move on from this horrible day. Have A Good One! :)"
"rparham","7","4","12","10 November 2012"," A solid Bond entry
","50 years after the release of the first James Bond film, Dr. No, the world's best known spy returns for his 23rd official screen outing, and the third with Daniel Craig in the role, with Skyfall. The good news is that Skyfall is a strong entry in the Bond canon, exploring character and story material never before considered in a Bond film. The less good news is that Skyfall still manages to fall a little short of greatness, partially due to an inflated running time and saggy midsection.<br/><br/>Skyfall opens, in standard Bond tradition, with a rousing pre-title sequence in which Bond and partner Eve (Naomie Harris) attempt to stop a list containing the identities of the British Secret Service's deep cover agents in terrorist agents from falling into the wrong hands. At the end of an energetic chase through Istanbul, Bond is accidentally shot by Eve and believed dead. He isn't, of course (now, THAT would be a real departure for a Bond film), but decides to engage in an unplanned vacation. However, when MI6 headquarters is bombed, and head M (Judi Dench) receives some ominous electronic threats, Bond returns from self- imposed exile to try to find the parties responsible. However, age and his recent injuries make his fitness for the job questionable, with Garreth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), questioning whether it is time for Bond to retire for real.<br/><br/>With M's backing, Bond heads to Shanghai to locate the hired killer who stole the list, and the trail leads to Silva (Javier Bardem), a former MI6 agent who was turned over to the Chinese authorities by M in the past due to him operating outside of protocol, and Silva hasn't taken that lightly, leading him to engage in a personal vendetta against M. Bond must try to outwit Silva, who proves a formidable adversary on a variety of fronts, and keep him from fulfilling his mission of revenge against M.<br/><br/>Skyfall is not your typical Bond film in a number of ways. Instead of the usual globe-trotting antics of many Bond entries, much of Skyfall unfolds in London and the countryside of the UK and the immediate neighbors. Sure there are some detours to China and Turkey, but this is the most a Bond film has been set in it's home base than I can ever remember. Skyfall also elects to engage in much more character development of Bond than most of the series. Bond finds himself put through an emotional and physical wringer, dealing with both the onset of age and the wounds generated in the line of duty. Skyfall is the first Bond outing that seems to truly exist in a post-9/11 world, with the nature of espionage and whether the decisions the leaders of those organizations have made are correct in the world as it currently is. Skyfall isn't content to just rehash the standard Bond formula, but engage in a degree of self-deconstruction of that formula as to whether it is still viable.<br/><br/>Back in the lead for his third time, Craig brings a degree of world- weariness to the role of Bond. With a multi-day growth of greying stubble for the first half of the film, and sporting a shoulder wound from a tussle with a enemy operative, Craig truly makes it appear at the outset that Bond is ready to be put out to pasture. Once again, despite a few brief encounters with some secondary characters, Craig's Bond is also less interested in bedding the ladies than he is in taking on the bad guys in his current incarnation. In Craig's hands, Bond is largely a man of vertical, not horizontal, action.<br/><br/>As Silva, Javier Bardem gives Skyfall the most memorable and formidable villain the series has seen in some outings. Sporting a blond wig, a number of effeminate traits (in one scene he is practically seducing Bond) and skill at verbal jousting to rival Hannibal Lecter, Bardem largely commands the screen when he is around. Silva also is a villain who isn't without a degree of method to his madness, as he challenges the modern, corrupt world we live in, introducing the idea that perhaps it is time for individuals to take matters into their own hands.<br/><br/>Judi Dench is handed the largest role the character of M has ever received, and she makes M less of a plot device and more of a central person in Bond's world. Over Craig's entries in the series, M has been given more of a presence than in the earlier films, and her part in Skyfall represents the character at it's pinnacle. M, much like Bond, is studied with a critical eye here, forced to deal with questions of her organizations relevance in the modern world.<br/><br/>Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes, helming his first full on action film, proves strong at staging the usual set pieces of the Bond universe, and he and cinematographer Roger Deakins craft a visually arresting look for Skyfall. At times almost monochromatic in color, Skyfall oozes craftsmanship in many of its moments. The title song, performed by Adele, is also one that hearkens back to the days of Shirley Bassey during the Connery era.<br/><br/>Skyfall does have weaknesses, largely due to an excessive running time. Bond films have never been brief affairs, but Skyfall seems a bit padded at times, especially in it's middle to late 3rd, where the narrative slows a bit too much. And also, despite plumbing some new depths of character, Skyfall still manages to fall a little short of true emotional resonance at times, displaying all the right trappings, but still feeling a little empty.<br/><br/>That being said, Skyfall is certainly a solid entry for James Bond, and one can only hope that whomever takes the creative reins next will build upon the strong foundations of Skyfall and make the next film truly soar."

The purpose of the villains capture in most movies is to benefit from it, not risking for a failure.<br/><br/>Eve is terribly played and so terrible that i forgot halfway thru that she even exists in the film, M becomes his mum Bond crying who is supposed to be an emotionless man, mix of Bourne x MI x Home Alone. <br/><br/>What is missing:<br/><br/>Bond movies are supposed and expected to be very educating about different countries and cultures and British sophistications but he barely goes to any foreign country taking a private jet or boat or train where he gets attacked and has a love making and good old Scotch, a few sophisticated conversations and a smile before killing a tough guy, well thats what is an expected scene and is done in all the bond movies.Bond was too panicked at all time and too serious whereas Bond is supposed to be relaxed and cool and take it easy and smile and still be a badass, one word: Lost the charm.<br/><br/>There was not enough class or elegance or poshness in this Bond film. It was very British tho :). But it just lost the taste of traditional James Bond films of Connery's time. Craigs films are just getting worse with every new bond films. <br/><br/>The Good: Great acting by Craig but terrible story, and directors instructions and screenplay and terrible cheapness. <br/><br/>Re installation of Moneypenny and male M. But God plz replace the actress for moneypenny. She is terrible. Same facial expression thruout the movie and disgusting accent.<br/><br/>But Casino Royale was awesome. It was simple, classy, nice camera movements, conversations and dialogues and acting and showing off of brands and spy nature and awesome story including multiple villains and betrayals."
"arcangel79","6","4","12","8 November 2012"," where has James bond gone?
","I just came back from watching the movie with my brother and i must say that we were both very disappointed with it. Although i am pleased to say that this is not the worst of them. i need to declare that for me this movie was the last nail in the bond Coffin. I think that putting Daniel Craig in bonds shoes Symbolizes the downhill slope that the movies were going to take from that moment on. The James bond we all grew to love and admire, the one who used his wits and charms before going for his fists or guns is gone,and all is left is just a thug with a gun and no charm at all. All the suspense is now completely gone from the movies and in every plot you just know his going to go for his gun or kick someone when he runs out of ammo. Where is the mystery the swagger the old bond which i grew up wanting to be,charming the ladies and his enemies with a smile and some Witty line, not just a hail of Bullets and blood up to his ears. sorry, i won't be seeing any more bond movies because clearly the magic is gone, it's just a plain bad old action movie with good stunts and effects, marvelous scenery and nothing more."
"adhipar","7","4","12","5 November 2012"," My Name is Bourne.....Jason Bourne
","What makes Bond's series so special? In my opinion, because they have the best villains who want to rules the world, conquer some countries, killing million of people just for their breakfast, girls who have rare qualities not just some bimbos, highly advanced technologies which may hit the market pretty soon, unlimited support from MI6 even some helps from CIA, Interpol, government, military etc around the world, even in the isolated area and any other 'over the top' things we could imagine. Yes, these aren't real, but we get that picture long ago. So by stripping those and replace Craig with Damon will make Skyfall another Bourne movie. And somehow the grand Bond's theme we normally get in the beginning and the end of the movie sounds well..too grand.<br/><br/>Now, apart from that, this movie actually pretty decent as an action movie. The story, acting, action scenes, etc are quite gripping. The first 20 mins of this movie will immediately put you right in the middle of the story and you don't want to miss it till the end.<br/><br/>There are some plot holes. I guess, when people make a movie as real as they can, the plot holes also became easier to see. For example, when the villains in police uniform are after M, Bond already warned her, but the security in that building is quite loose and those villains infiltrate the building with less resistance. In fact, the villains practically do their plan so smooth almost like getting candy from a baby. While Bond's team struggle to keep up. I'm also wonder why MI6 seems has no support from their own government, police, military etc, while the bad guy could easily get police car, military chopper etc.<br/><br/>So, while the movie is quite good, I can only score it 7 for not being a true Bond movie. I hope the next one could be better, if it's just become a follower of Bourne's series, well the Bond's era will be gone."

","The lead man Daniel Craig as 007 does not seem to take the audience inside the movie and establish a strong emotional connection. What takes you in is the long chase and fight sequences, great cinematography, beautiful locations, but in my book a movie is not about the above elements rather it's about the truthful experiences of the characters and the human life involved in those given situations. I didn't get these from the lead man, disappointing. This movie basically takes off the ground when 'Silva' (Javier Bardem) steps in. His first scene which is longer than any other scenes is a great hook, played well, convincing and entertaining. Though he is the antagonist, you'd actually want more of him. In overall assessment this is an average movie."
"ryokan_wc","8","4","12","3 November 2012"," A great Bond-ing
","To say the least, this latest movie of the Bond franchise lives up to its expectation- Skyfall!<br/><br/>I have to admit, i'm not much of a Bond fan, or even Daniel Craig. But my perspective of him has now changed, and this movie is pretty awesome. The trailer looked promising and the reviews were great- how was i to resist this? So i entered the cinema, expecting a two-and-a-half hour movie that is filled with high-pumping adrenalin scenes, girls, cars and a mission we all know, in the end, he will succeed. There was more depth and substance in this installment, to which i think, brings James Bond to a whole new level.<br/><br/>There was no slowing down, not especially in the opening scene. The car- bike chase, especially on the rooftop, and on the train scenes were intense and definitely, they set a tone for the rest of the movie. Then, we were serenaded by Adele performing her opening credit single 'Skyfall'- like all other Bond movies where the opening credit takes about 3 to 4 minutes. The main essence of this movie relates to M and her past, which comes back to haunt her- and all those standing between them will suffer. James Bond, who returns after a 'hiatus' from the agency, has his loyalty for M tested when he meets the villain, Silva.<br/><br/>Somehow, Silva reminds me of the Joker and Bane from The Dark Knight saga. I had this odd feeling like he would play into Bond's mind and cause mayhem. One of the best scenes in this movie was when Silva broke out from his prison and sought for revenge at M in a council hearing. The script written for M and the timing of the movie was executed perfectly, with the right dose of soundtrack to keep suspense flying high. In an attempt to be ahead of the villain, Bond devised a plan with the help of his trusted team, Q, Tanner and later Mallory. He returned to where he began- Skyfall, Scotland, and i thought Skyfall is some metaphor for something, probably a departure.<br/><br/>The way Bond and his limited resources built a defense 'fortress' reminds me of Home Alone, but with much more violence. The climax was brilliantly done- right timing, right length of time, right amount of explosions and shootings, and right lighting. The ending was a little less expected- or i had not seen it coming, but it was a good ending to the movie.<br/><br/>There was not much 'girl' scenes to woo over- M was the leading lady and Severine was temporary eye candy, and not much 'cars' to envy. Perhaps, more gadgetry in this. Needless to say, the action was top-notch, the acting was great. Some scenes can make you burst into laughter. I got to learn more about James Bond and M.<br/><br/>Skyfall is definitely worth the money and time. Whether it is the best Bond movie yet, some may say, but i can't because i have not watched the older ones. But it is one of the best of this year's competitive movie list."
"fran_262","8","4","12","30 October 2012"," Fantastic- the best effort of Daniel Craig yet
","Having seen this film today, I was extremely impressed, I found the film to trump Quantum of Solace and even Casino Royale. Daniel Craig really fits into the role well as Bond, he is a slightly rougher, less slick version, but he is intense, emotional and powerful. The opening credits were excellent and very mesmerising. Having previously heard the song by Adele, I found it to be an excellent fit for the credits. The opening scene was typically fast, intense and chaotic, with very impressive action scenes, which were very well-directed. The story, which revolves largely around M, was not difficult to follow nor uninteresting, and it was enjoyable to see her play such an important role in this film. As for the character of Severine, I found that it was maybe even a stretch to call her a Bond girl, as her role in the film was rather limited and not entirely key to the story as a whole, compared to the previous two. I also enjoyed the character played by Javier Bardem; he brought a quirky element, and performed well in the action scenes. The cinematography as usual was excellent, with impressive shots of London, and also a contrast with scenes taking place in the Highlands. The ending was dramatic and saddening, bringing M to an end. Overall, the film was retro and also modern, with an interesting plot, and one which is very visually pleasing. I would wholly recommend it!"
"jens-513-631850","8","4","12","27 October 2012"," Very good movie
","First of all, I have to say that Daniel Craig now owns this part. He is the best Bond ever in my view. <br/><br/>This movie was very, very good, and deserves the accolades it gets. Even so, and this might be unfair, it didn't quite do the trick for me, and I prefer Casino Royale to this one. CR had the kind of gritty quality that this one lacked. For me, there was too much a return to the wise-cracking character a la the 80's and 90's. I preferred the deadpan seriousness of CR, which I would give 10/10. <br/><br/>As I said, it might be unfair to judge a Bond film this way, but even so, Casino Royale for me at least, transcended the Bond mold, and made it into an classic, even outside the Bond universe, whereas there was somehow too many one-liners from Bond and silliness in the villain (sorry Javier Bardem) for me to take it as seriously as CR. <br/><br/>It subtracted a little every time Bond delivered a zinger, as I really liked his more dangerous and dark persona in Casino Royale. But still, a very good movie."
"Screen_Blitz","9","3","8","1 December 2015"," Skyfall is madly entertaining
","Daniel Craig makes his return as the iconic action hero James Bond in this compelling installment directed by Sam Mendes this time around. James Bond is assigned on a mission in which quickly goes wrong when he is shot down and wounded. Things eventually get worst when MIG is attacked by terrorists lead by computer hacker Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem who's intent on killing M (played by Judi Dench) who he once knew before she betrayed him. With MI6 occupied and M's leadership becoming questionable, Agent Bond seeks through the shadows to find help from field agent Eve Moneypenny (played by Naomie Harris) to hunt down Silva and take him down once and for all. Complete with electrifying action sequences, astounding plot, and phenomenal James Bond material, Skyfall stands what maybe the James Bond flick yet.<br/><br/>This movie was a tense thrill ride from start to finish, and the opening action scene taking place on the high speed train really sets the tone of the film. The action scenes serve astoundingly well in this film, and this greatly done by the solid cinematography by Roger Deakins; definitely something Oscar-worthy. When the action lets down, viewers are introduced to some interesting characters including the main villain Raoul Silva who's sinister identity is fueled by a strong performance by Javier Bardem who made an impressive portrayal as a villain in Joel and Ethan Coen's 'No Country for Old Men' in 2007. Then there is the main protagonist James Bond who remains as charismatic and enthralling as ever, and Daniel Craig's performance certainly gives credit for this. The film also presents some eye-catchy action set pieces, one of which is set on Hashima Island, an uninhabited island south of Nagasaki, Japan, where buildings are rusty and completely rundown in a war-torn like setting. <br/><br/>Skyfall is a highly entertaining action film and definitely deserves the praise it gets. This film shows that Daniel Craig still has the James Bond energy in him and is a perfect fit for the iconic British spy. All in all, Skyfall is a must-watch."
"mhendrickx","8","3","8","1 December 2015"," One of the best Bond movies
","After I watched Quantum of Solace, I really hoped for a different kind of Bond movie, and it came in the form of Skyfall.<br/><br/>Where Quantum of Solace really focuses on being spectacular, Skyfall returns to the form of older Bond movies. The focus lays more on storytelling, however the producers didn't forget to let some really nice action bits in the film. This is what you already see in the opening scenes of the film with the motorcycle- and car chase. However, there's also a point of criticism: how on earth did Bond survive the gunshot from Eve?<br/><br/>When you look at the rest of the film, it's actually on a really high level. In my opinion the villain (performed by Javier Bardem) and the Bond girl (performed by Bérénice Marlohe) lift this film to great heights. Not to mention Daniel Craig an Judi Dench, who I think also did a very good job.<br/><br/>The villain Raoul Silva is such a great villain. Throughout the film you discover that he actually is a tragic figure, who is on a constant search for himself. On the one hand he shows great anger when fighting Bond. But in the final scene of the film he looks really concerned when he sees M heavily injured. This makes him a man with two faces and also makes it hard to fathom him.<br/><br/>But what I especially like about his film are the final scenes where it all comes together. First of all there's Silva's men entering the Skyfaal mansion. After that the entering of Silva himself by helicopter (also notice the music coming out of the speakers underneath the helicopter, brilliant!). Of course there also are the usual explosions involved. But the last scene is actually an atypical ending for a Bond film. I think this is one of the very few moments we could see emotion from the character James Bond when M dies. It's a shame that Judi Dench got written out of the Bond films though, such a great actress!<br/><br/>If you are looking for a very nice Bond movie, including both great storytelling and great action scenes, this is the one you've been looking for!"

"ThomasDrufke","9","3","8","6 November 2015"," Business And Pleasure
","Skyfall was really a perfect storm for a Bond film. You have one of the best theme songs in the series' history with Adele's Skyfall, strong female characters led by the expanded presence of Judi Dench's M, and one of the best villains with Javier Bardem's Silva. I may like Casino Royale a little bit more, but it switches on a day to day basis. The important thing is that Skyfall isn't just a great Bond film, it's a great film.<br/><br/>Right from the electrifying opening pre credits sequence it's clear we are in for a ride. It's also clear that this film will focus on M and Bond's relationship which has been so well documented in this series of films. I love that M tells Naomie Harris as Moneypenny/Eve to take the shot even though she doesn't have a clear shot. Then seeing her reaction and emotions unfold as she believes Bond to be dead. It's been clear ever since Casino Royale and through his rogue adventures in Quantum that she has a fondness and a soft spot for James. In many ways Skyfall completes the Bond origin story into the Bond we have known throughout the years to be. This film is absolutely a deviation from the typical formulaic process to Bond though. But trust me, it was a good change.<br/><br/>Bardem as Silva showed shades of Loki and Joker in that he's always one more step ahead of MI6. He's also going after them instead of them going after him for most of the film, and in particular, he wants M. I genuinely believe Silva belongs up there with the best of the Bond villains. There's just so much emotional undertone mixed with a strange sense of humor that fits so well opposite Bond. To go along with that, I think Skyfall is probably the most emotional Bond film to date. There is a real sense of heart to this movie that most of the other entries don't have. <br/><br/>What's more impressive is that there is still the fantastic action that we love from the series to go along with the heart and terrific character writing. This film is definitely not for every Bond fan, in fact I don't think hardcore fans would find this to be as good as the casual fan. Even though I consider myself one of those hardcore fans, I can acknowledge the deviations the film took. For one, Bond doesn't sleep with every flipping lady in the film, and two the villain doesn't have global aspirations. But that's why the film works so well, it's so fresh and exhilarating. Something I hope the franchise continues to be. Wow, and that concludes my 2 month long Bond marathon in preparation for Spectre. Here's hoping it's good!<br/><br/>+Fantastic villain<br/><br/>+Changed up the formula<br/><br/>+Focused on the Bond & M relationship<br/><br/>+Theme song<br/><br/>+Brillaint action<br/><br/>9.5/10"

The action scenes are really not the highlight.

Granted he is not getting younger but I can easily tell this Bond is on roids, painkiller and Ritalin. Ralph Fiennes probably slept thru his role and Judi Dench I will mention below on a new category for her. The new tech is a model from Zara/Top shop. Saving grace is Javier, the sole star carrying the entire work load on his shoulders.<br/><br/>Bond girl - now how can we have a Bond movie without P-galore? Or some memorable Bond girls like Halle Berry, Michelle Yeoh, etc. No! This round the true Bond girl is Judi Dench, yes, believe. Thankfully there is no s-scene between her and 007. Enough said.<br/><br/>Action - there is still plenty action, but Daniel is no longer the same from CasinoR and QuantumOS. Try picture the Invictus Eastwood trying to act Jet Li, yes, that difficult to watch.<br/><br/>Direction - BIG Problem - if you think American Beauty and Road to redemption could ever have a deformed incest baby, this is the One. I am a big Sam fan, but in this movie at times actors seemed lost in their own scenes, as if the camera is not relative to what it was shooting at - Bond is busy working but Director is treating it like gallery day job. You just can not get art-sy if it's a bad guy chase.<br/><br/>However, given the big budget, the movie manages to pull off a coherent overall feel, largely thanks to fine editing, thus my 5 of 10.<br/><br/>Overall, one can not help but feel sorry for Daniel Bond, a sadness reserved for watching the decline of Great Britain from its former glory, like walking into an antique yard sell only to realize the toys you used to worship are now worth 2 dollars."

","what's up with you people ? i LOVED this film! my only problem with it is introducing Ralph Fiennes, who to me radiates cruelty and at the very least always triggers mistrust - I always am suspicious he's the bad guy. So why give him this role? why him? please BondMakers, rethink this and bring someone else in at the helm. NOT so OTT as I find most action films to be these days. Not sure about the choice of Bond's receptionist either, they went off kilter - her role is quite different in the books and they should stick to some things to keep it Bond. Loved the cinematography - Some of the scenes were beautifully shot - the Scottish manse in the light of the helicopter, for one."

Then, after reading some reviews, and because I liked him as Remington Steele, I decided to give Goldeneye I chance (big mistake) and then once more with Casino Royale and this last one. <br/><br/>Without loosing Bond identity features, its roots, I would expect the scriptwriters to squeeze their brains a bit more cause today is not enough if you make a cocktail with just a sexist man, a fancy car, a pretty girl, some random killing and action and a villain (shaken or stirred) and serve it thinking that as the ingredients are good anything with them in it is gonna be tasty and good, wrong! I need a more elaborated plot. Is like having a carpet in the kitchen or in the bathroom, sure 50 years ago was fashionable in UK but today I just do not want it.<br/><br/>Reviews were good so I decided to go. Also for its 50th Anniversary, for Bardem, for Scotland. I liked the tributes made to the first Bond movies, I liked Bardem in his first 10 min but then as the story cannot be more absurd there's no way the actors can hold the movie. <br/><br/>At some point I thought I could be yet surprised when action is translated to Scotland: ""could it be? Will Sean Connery make a surprise cameo?"" After all the tributes at least I could have given that to the movie, a nice surpricse and the ability to laugh at themselves but not, wasn't Sir Connery, WASN'T even Scottish!! <br/><br/>I tend to take now 007 as a joke, a comedy, a bad action movie and even worst thriller and I will try to refrain myself of watching next ""best bond"" movie yet to come as that was 50 years ago.

","James Bond films are always great action movies, regardless of what actor is playing Bond, the movies are always fun and entertaining for the viewers. In this respect, Skyfall delivers, it's as good as any and all of the Bond movies, so if that is what brings you to the theater then you will not be disappointed. In the latest effort, there is plenty of action, special effects, situations only James Bonds could escape from, and tons of edge of your seat chase scenes. In the end to me, it just seems it goes on too long, I found that the drama and anticipation of doom and dread became weary, and in truth I was waiting for it all to end. The acting was excellent, the storyline was decent, the action suburb, and the special effects were truly outstanding. Those elements earn this a 7 out of 10, but sometimes a little less may actually be better."
"morrison-dylan-fan","6","3","8","22 November 2012"," Falling from the sky....with a thud.
","After being surprised to learn that American Beauty director Sam Mendes had been chosen to direct the movie that celebrates 50 years of James Bond being on the big screen,I started to become increasingly interested in the film,when I found out that Bond baddie was going to be greatly modelled on Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. <br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Returning to MI6 after having been left for dead, thanks to a failed mission where he was assigned to retrieve a stolen computer hard drive, containing a list of all NATO secret agents currently undercover in terrorist organisation's,James Bond discovers that MI6 is being attacked by a computer hacker,who seems to be doing everything in his/her power to bring MI6 to its knees,and is also launching a vicious attack on the head of MI6,and Bonds most trusted mentor M,in an attempt to ruin her entire legacy.As he starts to search for the perpetrator,Bond begins to wonder if they attacks may be connected to something ""secret"" that M committed in the past. <br/><br/>View on the film: <br/><br/>Taking the supporting character's in a similar direction to the one taken for Bond in the wonderful Casino Royal,screenwriter's Neal Purvis,Robert Wade and John ""Gladiator"" Logan brilliantly deconstruct all of the character's who have mostly spent their time in the past sending their ""man on a mission""..on his mission.Easily giving the strongest,most rounded performance in the film,Judi Dench shows M to be someone who uses her stern,blunt exterior to hide fears that her role maybe shortly dismantled,and also struggling to be completely at ease and satisfied with her tenure,due to ""dark shadows"" that have quietly been growing over her career.Along with Dench,Ben Whishaw gives the movie some nice indie charm as the young and eager Q,whilst Ralph Fiennes and a returning Rory (son of the much missed, late actor Roy) Kinnear give the film a great dose of extra gravitas as Gareth Mallory and Tanner.<br/><br/>Sadly,due to the film's eye being focused on the supporting character's,the writer's unexpectedly leave the major character's of the movie on the sideline!,with Daniel Craig being left to re-tread and take Bond down a muddy,darken path that had originally been so fresh and bright in Casino Royal,but ,with the possible exception of a half- hearted look into Bond's ""family past"" has now just become a circle for Bond to repeatedly run round.<br/><br/>Whilst Bond is at least given some ""family issues"" to deal with,the Bond girls (played by the gorgeous Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe) are given the cheerful role of being ""filler tracks"",with Harris's only highlight being a happy,last minute punchline,and Marlohe being given a plot line that barely has any connection at all to the main plot,that along with being used by director Sam Mendes to set up a stylish,but completely useless set piece of Bond wilfully not stopping a ""glorifed extra"" assassin,also has Marlohe go from being a distraught character,who has spent her life being a forced sex worker,to just being another notch on the 007 bedpost in the space of 5 minutes! <br/><br/>For the villain,the writer's initially appear to be using Silva (played by a calculating Javier Bardem) as a way to take the ""Bond villain"" into a tantalisingly complex,realistic moral area,by showing the things that Silva wants to achieve ( such as expose MI6 being illegally compliance in torture.) may actually be something that Bond should not be attempting to shoot down.Tragicly,after spending the first 10 minutes to show the intellectual side of the character,Sam Mendes pushes any of Silva's complexity aside,to instead create a ranting psycho,who in fact does not care a bit about MI6 being involved in torture,but is instead simply suffering from ""(M)ummy issues"",that lead to this Bond film falling from the sky with an almighty thud."
"Likes_Ninjas90","7","3","8","18 November 2012"," He's not ready yet to be called the spy who came in from the cold
","When a list of MI6's agents falls into the wrong hands James Bond (Daniel Craig) pursues the man who stole it. But during a tense standoff on a train, M (Judi Dench) makes the call for a shot to be taken. Bond is accidentally wounded by fellow agent Eve (Naomie Harris) and the list vanishes with the man. With Bond presumed dead, M takes the fall and is set to be replaced, with the relevancy of the 00 agents questioned by the Intelligence Chairman Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). Bond briefly takes to drinking until there is a terrorist bombing against MI6. Returning to Britain, Bond remerges, bitter at M, but determined to serve his country. Although weakened, Bond vows to get the list by travelling globally to places like Shanghai and is given some help by a younger agent codenamed 'Q' (Ben Whishaw) and the mysterious Severine (Berenice Marlohe). He eventually discovers that his nemesis is Silva (Javier Bardem), a criminal mind of the computer age, who has a personal vendetta against M herself. <br/><br/>Some will argue that in the 50th year of the James Bond franchise Skyfall is the spy's pinnacle adventure, taking us into a new age of invisible terrorism, far beyond Ian Fleming's post-war espionage novels, while also reintroducing staple characters from the series and finally teasing at Bond's past. The film's craft alone, at the hands of British director Sam Mendes, rates as a series highpoint. However, true greatness still remains another entry away. This is the most overtly political and conservative Bond film to date, which is jarring for a franchise that defined the term ""reboot"" in mainstream cinema not long ago. This conservatism harps back to the Bond novels and their fear of the declining British Empire. Fleming was a journalist and a naval intelligence officer. He prepared intelligence units and modelled Bond on various agents and commandos he met. Fleming wrote at least a dozen Bond novels, some of which were criticised for a lack of ethics, being ""sado- masochistic"" or adolescent. The film series rarely grew up either. It's been spoofed, imitated and even toyed with self-parody too. The stunts and gadgets grew silly and the puns were increasingly lame. What separated this once colourful franchise from production line blockbusters anymore? The Daniel Craig era looked to rectify this: a darker tone, less CGI and Bond projected as a human being. Skyfall shares this attitude, along with the same visceral nature and physicality as Casino Royale (2006). It's an exciting, often funny adventure, but even as it postures towards a changing era, it's still Bond. In this half-century of vodka martinis, little has changed, and here Skyfall doesn't follow-up on some enticing threads and possibilities, signposted in the first half. <br/><br/>What can't be faulted however is the photography by Roger Deakins. He frames this movie beautifully, with more width than we've ever seen in a Bond film. It makes Bond resemble a smaller piece of a much greater spectrum of world terror. There are some gorgeous sequences in this film, my favourite being a martial arts battle fought in a glass building. The blows are photographed with dark shadows, like a silhouette, and the screen is shrouded by a blue filter lens. Action sequences like this, selective in a strong, leisurely first half, have more weight to them, fused with questions over Bonds fitness and the relevancy of M and the 00 agents - clever metaphors for the franchises own relevancy. Though the first half is witty and promising, with Dench and Craig's sparring sessions a delight, the second portion is bombastic, tense but unsatisfying. The cracks in the screenplay coincide with the introduction of Bardem's Silva, whom the film gambles heavily on. French actress Berenice Marlohe is thrown by the wayside; her character is a mere waypoint leading to Silva. As for Bardem, his villain in No Country for Old Men (2007) was a case of less is more. He's been cast to do the same, to be scary, but the character is underwritten. His acting style is broader and over the top to compensate and it's an unusual concoction of humour and weirdness. At most, his character provides an interesting suggestion about M's poor treatment of her agents. <br/><br/>A great seed of conflict between Bond and M is planted by this, only to be diluted by a number of action set pieces, several of which owe too much to The Dark Knight (2008). Huge plot holes become startlingly visible too: If Silva is a wizard in electronic sabotage and can place bombs on MI6's doorstep, why does he personally go to such extraordinary lengths to attack M himself? If he specialises in cyberterrorism, and has a sophisticated background, why are his tactics in the final climax so lead-heavy? Bond wants to be a serious franchise, it wants to be Nolan's Batman, but we're expected to ignore the plot inconsistencies. Bond still dazzles, but there's disunity around the direction and future of the series too. It's repackaged beautifully, but inside is a political tool, with references to the London bombing, shots of the British flag and a main character that is decidedly immobile, though not through circumstance. In Casino Royale, Bond returned to the circus out of personal tragedy and revenge. Now he's back only because Britain needs him. He's not ready yet to be called the spy who came in from the cold."
"ayoreinf","9","3","8","18 November 2012"," Not the best Bond ever, but easily the best Bond of Daniel Craig
","I don't like reviewing a movie that was reviewed hundreds of times, though I do make an exception every now and again. Well here's one, and the main reason I do write it is because I saw too many claiming it's the best Bond ever - I could never pick a single one but It's one of the top ten which is quite an achievement considering the two previous ones which I rank at the bottom of the list. I hated the reboot, I think it was done for all the wrong reasons and in the worst possible way, and I think Quantum of Solace kept a bad thing going in the wrong direction. This one does go back to the older style, which in my book is the only reason for Bond to exist. If Bond tries to be another Jason Bourne, it takes an original and makes a copycat out of him, and it's plain shame. This one feels like Daniel Craig was eventually allowed to give his own version to Bond, and it's a good one. The whole cast is stellar, Javier Bardem is as superb as everyone has said, Albert Finney gets five minutes on screen and as the old pro that he is, uses them to steal the show, and all the would be new regulars of the series are doing a great job. Sam Mendes, does show a great flare that does suit the film well. All together it's a great fun film, but I personally can't compare it to any of the other great Bonds of the past simply because they are all so very different and dependent on the personality of the actor in the role (or lack of it - at least in one case)."
"diac228","8","3","8","15 November 2012"," Good action movie that almost feels like a Bond flick. Almost.
","It still barely feels like Bond, but this is still the best of the latest generation bunch and the best since the 1995 gem Goldeneye.<br/><br/>Skyfall borrows from this recurring theme of cinema of taking well-known franchises and adding this dark reboot twist to give it a fresh perspective while also throwing some old-school flavor into it. The technique might be a bit odd, since this already happened in Casino Royale. Behind the camera is indie darling Sam Mendes, an accomplished director, to add some visual flair and technique to a film series that is mysteriously devoid of good directors and cinematographers. And Mendes' direction not only enhances the exotic film locations and exquisite action sequences, but also manages to hide most of the errors and setbacks behind the movie.<br/><br/>The movie immediately takes off from the getgo, revealing the conflict within the first minute, and leading to an extended action/chase sequence that rivals among the best Bond has ever been involved in. And then we get taken by one of the better title sequences in recent memory featuring another strong Adele performance. How on earth was this film going to maintain the momentum of the first twenty minutes? Here's a little hint: it barely does.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig has gotten a lot of criticism from the old-school Bond fans about his portrayal, and his performance here will not dwell the flames. That being said, Craig in his third round as the famed hero displays that he is indeed able to pull the charm, humor, sophistication, and suave of the other Bonds----if the writing staff can ever let him. But the writers and producers are hellbent on making sure that the Connery/Moore James Bond never makes its way back into the big screen.<br/><br/>And this is where the movie mildly stumbles, not in directing or acting, but in the writing department. Composed by a three-person team, the plot never allows for us to get too comfortable with any of the supporting characters; from the Bond girls to not even the main villain—whom doesn't even show up in the first act (Despite it being brilliantly done by Javier Bardem, even if his character becomes extremely uneven towards the end). The final third inexplicably treads into prologue territory, when it could have been used earlier when the agency was in disarray as the conflict elevates when the entire cast of protagonists are under attack. And lastly, they still fail to give the movie the special James Bond touch, that little catalyst that for decades has separated itself from the usual action movie fare.<br/><br/>Skyfall is part of the biggest enigma I face in cinema today: am I willing to accept this new direction of James Bond and his more brutal, dark, but more realistic look? Or should I yearn for the old-school days when it was hapless escapism that can hide any ridiculousness or stupidity with layers of charm, sexiness, and classy adult fun? These recent Bonds have been done with plenty of effort and quality, but what gets sacrificed is the little nitty-gritty sparks that made James Bond an icon in the first place. So I'm torn.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I will accept Skyfall as a good, perfectly-directed action movie that survives a third act flounder and some questionable writing and hangs on as the best Bond since Pierce Brosnan."
"Highteqz","6","3","8","15 November 2012"," Fun action movie, but script has too many loose ends (minor spoilers)
","I am not saying this is a terrible movie. It is an action flick and appropriately loud with explosions and constant suspense. But when it comes to the script, I feel like they had the opportunity to do something more and tell a compelling story. All the ingredients seemed to be there, and the actors casted are more than capable of carrying a story that goes deeper than what is currently presented. It is therefore especially frustrating that the movie constantly seems to try and tell a story but then never sees it through. People are introduced, questions are raised, but are then forgotten like they never mattered.<br/><br/>A few examples:<br/><br/>-Female ""interests"" for bond are introduced and almost immediately cast aside.<br/><br/>-They create sympathy for the bad guy, but then do nothing with this feeling that they seemed to intentionally give to the audience. <br/><br/>-We get to see a new young Q, he must be amazing right? But, he does nothing the entire movie apart from making some foolish mistakes. <br/><br/>-The punchline, which I guess is ""in the modern world the threat is invisible"" which is underlined in a speech by Judi Dench, feels like an afterthought. It is not moving at all. Not because Judi Dench does not do a terrific job, but because it only vaguely fits the script.<br/><br/>-The question of Bond being replaceable, how he feels about it and how it affected him is never explored. The movie brings up this issue but again, does nothing with it. Once Bond gets back into the action, it is like these issues did not exist."
"mikeymcdo","7","3","8","6 November 2012"," Adele's song makes sense now!
","50 years have definitely been kind to the Bond franchise the appeal of car chases, brutal action, snazzy suits, gadgets, larger than life villains and Bond babes is a spectacle that definitely endures to modern day audiences and has been implemented in other films and TV shows but Bond has had some catching up to do with the likes of plot and character heavy movies of today while maintaining its identity. The first 2 Daniel Craig Bonds haven't quite reached these expectations but Skyfall has definitely created something new yet retaining Bonds swarvness. Mendes is to be commended for his vision, style and flair and combining it with character richness making this probably the most character driven Bond film yet specially into the second act. Some Bond purists may be up in arms about making Bond more human and attached but it is only a small part of his character it is not delved into its only touched upon and shown and never explicitly told. The only grumble I have with this is that the film becomes slightly more complicated when the franchise is more about style than substance but I would much prefer to see a more vulnerable human being then just a womanising action man. Despite seeing a more vulnerable James Bond this is strictly meant in the psychological sense not the physical sense, the action scenes are as ludicrous as ever normally he would dodge the bullet and get out of sticky situations but even when he doesn't dodge the bullet he survives with hardly an explanation no bullet proof vest or nifty gadget he just shrugs it off, bones some chick and pretends to be dead for awhile (which is starting to become a cliché that is really pissing me off, main characters pretending to be dead with the audience for a brief moment believing are hero to be dead but revealing not to be and is integral to the plot e.g. The Dark Knight Rises, Sherlock, Dr Who) The story starts off with this recent cliché and starts off slow because of this we know Bond is alive and is going back to MI6 he is not just going to sit around in Istanbul or wherever he is since we have another 2 hours of film left. So it's a little hard to get into the first 30 or 40 minutes of the film because of this implausible even for James Bond standards opener however once the villain starts to come to the forefront of the film the film picks up brilliantly. Javier Bardem as Silva is quite simply the best Bond villain ever he is every great Bond Villain rolled into one he is maniacal, sinister and slightly camp with a really intriguing motive for revenge. I won't reveal what it is but he and Bond are sort of like the 2 sides of the same coin and both of them have their similarities. Through Bardem's performance the script writing really shines through. Silva's reveal brings excellent writing, excellent direction and excellent performances all at once to the screen. Once the momentum gets going the plot of Skyfall is brilliant normally the plot of a James Bond film will follow a formula of stopping the bad guy and his cronies while making smart quips and driving fast cars along the way but in Skyfall it felt like they done that in the first half and show of the locales then make the movie more character driven Bond is a wreck and is losing his skills because of old age the future of a nation isn't really at stake it's more about loyalty and a bit of self reflection. Overall Bond is well and truly back with the classic style the older films merging with a more credible and personal story creating something fresh yet familiar. The action set pieces are as excellent and as explosive as ever. It probably isn't the best Bond film but probably has one of its greatest Villains in the franchises 50 years of history."

Silva (Javier Bardem), who had been betrayed by M and now is seeking out revenge against the veteran leader of the MI6.<br/><br/>""Skyfall"" is another entertaining but forgettable full of action adventure of James Bond, with the traditional explosions, car chases, shootings and beautiful Bond girl. Unfortunately the subtlety and the refined British sarcasm of the characters is gone replaced by rude and unpleasant attitudes. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""007 - Operação Skyfall"" (""007 - Skyfall Operation"")"
"aircodh9","9","6","22","28 October 2012"," This is a proper Bond movie, but more thoughtful than any before
","The 50th anniversary is a landmark which the promotional hype for Skyfall has not shied away from, and so expectations are high. But are they sky high, or bound to fall?<br/><br/>A third outing for Daniel Craig has undoubtedly meant he is now comfortable with his double-oh role, which is good because these are big shoes to fill even for a veteran. No concerns there then, but there are also new avenues being explored in terms of production and casting, and this is the real concern for Bond fans, the vast majority of whom have embraced Craig, but are aware that Bond is a franchise which has to continually reinvent itself. The most successful Bond movies are often a careful mix of tradition and innovation, and it is this more than anything which determines whether we get a classic Bond movie, or merely another one of the set of 23 Bond films. So which is it?<br/><br/>Skyfall kicks off with a lengthy chase sequence which, for a movie going generation who come with attention deficit syndrome fitted as standard, lights the fuse at the pre-requisite mach 1. The inclusion of a Land Rover in the chase helps to stamp that 'Brit' label on proceedings. Clad in metallic grey, echoing not only the DB5 but also Daniel Craig's similarly classic grey Tom Ford suit, with its sixties-esque tailoring a nod to Connery, thus we can see from the off that this is a thoughtful production.<br/><br/>After the establishing opening sequence, we swiftly determine this is one of the more grounded Bond movie plots; no underwater secret Caribbean base, no super-laser threatening the planet. Nope, this time it is a simpler tale, of revenge and redemption, albeit one which takes in a few exotic locations. Having been wounded in the opening sequence, upon his return to London, Bond addresses being older and the need to stay in trim. Ghosts from his own and M's past emerge. These manifest for M in the guise of a former operative who seeks revenge, and for Bond in his childhood, hinted at during a psychological profile test to determine whether he is still fit for duty. Thus the stage is set for a subtly-nuanced showdown.<br/><br/>The villain of the piece is played by a very sinister and disturbing Javier Bardem, who slowly emerges as a credible threat in the modern landscape by having embraced technology, again here we see the theme of old and new which echoes the challenges the Bond franchise itself faces. The point of old and new merging is further driven home with the introduction of a new, younger Q, in the shape of Ben Wishaw. It's no small task to replace the virtually irreplaceable Desmond Llewelyn, but thankfully this is a good try, also succeeding in hammering a nail in the god-awful appearance of John Cleese as a substitute for Q.<br/><br/>The simpler approach to a plot might not please those who prefer seeing Roger Moore do battle aboard a fleet of Space Shuttles to prevent a megalomaniac taking over the world. But Skyfall's more emotive plot brought a gritty, believable aspect to matters suitable for a modern audience who want to see him at least have a bit of a stab at living in the present. It won't be everyone's cup of Vodka Martini, but I'd like to see more of this kind of thing. I daresay the journey Bond takes with M being a metaphor for the journey the Bond franchise is taking into a more modern world of cinematic exposition might have sailed over a few people's heads, but they can at least take a quantum of solace from the fact that there is still plenty of debris to be found sailing over their heads in Skyfall too, as an explosive finale sees Bond and M confront and defeat MI6's nemesis. <br/><br/>Along the way there are numerous nods to previous Bond films too, the DB5 shows off its features, the Walther PPK is a plot device, there is a hint at Roger Moore's run across the alligators in Live and Let Die and many more such salutes to previous movies.<br/><br/>CAUTION: SPOILER ALERT!!<br/><br/>Still here? Okay then, Dame Judy Dench's M dies at the end of the film, having sustained a gunshot wound. <br/><br/>What?! I hear you say? Bond fails in his mission to protect M?! Well, nope, actually he doesn't; with a mere two months left to serve in the role as head of MI6 before she is to be forced to retire owing to the perceived intelligence failure which drives the plot, she acts as the bait to capture the villain, successfully avenging agents who have been killed and finishing off the villain, also going out fighting and winning, rather than retiring to boring obscurity, which would be the real death of her. Needless to say Bond is suitably upset at the demise of the mother figure whom M represents for him since he is an orphan, leaving him once more alone, but this sadness wonderfully echoes the chilling end of On Her Majesty Secret Service, which as any Bond fan knows, is certainly a contender for the best Bond film of all.<br/><br/>As the titles roll, we see the familiar 'James Bond will return' message, and we can only hope that when he does, it will be with this kind of thoughtful scripting and direction. If you want to see massive fights with hordes of boiler-suit clad henchmen driving Mini-Mokes around underground secret bases as Bond makes smutty one liners to bikini-clad bimbos, then this won't be the Bond movie for you. But if you want to see a great and thoughtful modern spin on Bond, here it is."

","I went to see this film on the premier opening night at the Xtreme Screen At Vue. Full capacity, sold out and excellent atmosphere. The whole film is just a wow factor throughout. Daniel Craig's grittiness matches the dark essence of the film. The acting was spot on throughout and the effects could not be flawed and were some of the very best I have ever seen. It feeds into previous bond films showing respect to the 50 year anniversary of the biggest franchise in the world.<br/><br/>Light humour every known and again gives the audience a sense that the film is not taking itself to seriously. Overall this film is simply a must see movie, and arguably the best bond film of all time, except for gold finger."

","After severely damaging the James Bond franchise over the last couple of movies, the producers appear to be coming to their senses and returning the franchise to its roots.<br/><br/>What are its roots? Welll, James Bond is supposed to be a guy movie. Let the girls have their Twilight and Magic Mike. The series is supposed to be about an Alpha Male who defeats a super villain working for a rival spy agency, poking hot female eye candy along the way. There's supposed to be a high-tech car and high-tech gadgets. And let's not forget the abundance of memorable stunts that burn up adrenaline like skydiving, punching someone in mid-air and taking his parachute. The feminist revisionist attempt to assassinate the James Bond character, like they've done to other male symbols by making him weak and humiliating him, has failed.<br/><br/>Instead, an accident has been arranged for the female M, and Bond's female spy sidekick has been returned to him as his secretary. Cheers! I hope to also see damaged-goods Daniel Craig be replaced soon.<br/><br/>After boycotting the previous few movies for clearly alienating the male audience, I was glad to see this one."
"writers_reign","7","8","33","26 October 2012"," Scotch Mist
","I tend not to watch long-running franchises like Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings and the Bond series though in each case I've seen at least one early entry. In the case of the Bond franchise I saw most of the Sean Connery titles and perhaps one of the later Bonds - it may well have been Casino Royale with Craig as opposed to Niven. The new title however has attracted lots of favourable reviews most of which mentioned that Judi Dench enjoyed much more screen time in this one so on that basis I ponied up at the box office. They were right. Dench does have a prominent role and Dench gives the film what class it has. It was slightly disconcerting to see a Greg Wise lookalike as an initial villain when Wise hadn't been mentioned in association with the film and certainly wasn't listed on the opening credits. They appear to have struck a balance between credibility and fantasy and it's far less colorful than the Connery titles when the screen was often awash with color. This time it almost lapses into sepia at times. Nice also to encounter a heavy who is NOT intent on destroying the world and is happy to settle for an individual. All in all a fairly entertaining couple of hours."
"julian-mumford","9","4","13","9 December 2012"," Almost iconic Bond
","Stripped of almost all gadgets, Bond is back fighting for Queen and country, ready to face a very uncertain and different world.<br/><br/>After Bond's complete re-invention in the superb ""Casino Royale"", followed by a meandering and disappointing ""Quantum of Solace"", we are back on solid ground. Arguably completing the three picture transition to the fully rounded Bond character, that audiences have embraced for 50 years.<br/><br/>Opening with an excellent played for real stunt filled prologue, Bond (Daniel Craig) then promptly disappears. Returning only when a real threat to ""M"" becomes evident and agents lives are at risk, following the loss of a stolen data disk. That threat arriving in the slightly effeminate, disturbing and clearly ""a few rounds short of a full clip"" Bond villain, Silva (Javier Bardem).<br/><br/>It is unusual for the Bond villain to arrive so late in the piece and to have such a narrow goal. It is obvious that the image of huge villainous lairs, with boiler-suited armies and world domination was destroyed forever by Austin Powers.<br/><br/>Late perhaps but what an entrance, Bardem demanding we listen to him and watch every movement he makes, playing every scene he gets to the maximum. A classic interrogation scene that no doubt will be discussed on the Internet for some time to come.<br/><br/>This is Bond at his most workmanlike, with a job to be done, ill-prepared on occasion and with more introspection than ever before. There are many quiet thoughtful scenes and Bardem makes for an excellent villain, you are never sure what he might do next.<br/><br/>Judi Dench as ""M"" has her work cut out with a huge part in the film and carries it well, no doubt not expecting to be involved in gun fights at age 78. We also are introduced to Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) and the new ""Q"" (Ben Whishaw) both fitting well into the story. Agent Eve (Naomi Harris) defies usual Bond conventions by being adept in the field, beautiful of course and sharing perhaps the most intimate Bond scene yet, without hitting the sheets.<br/><br/>The film swiftly moving from Istanbul to Shanghai to Macau but overall feels firmly based in Britain and latterly Scotland. There is a well choreographed fight scene back-lit with neon lighting, a grand entrance into a lantern lit casino, enough action and yet the film feels very grounded in the realities of the modern world. Self aware but still able to provide that hyper reality that Bond has always represented.<br/><br/>Of course the film depends on the actor personifying our version of Bond and Craig fits the role like a glove. Difficult to believe now there was consternation when he was first cast. He manages to believably play a character that could either seduce, amuse or kill you, all without a moments pause.<br/><br/>We get more background to Bond, as ""M"" admits that orphans make the best recruits. The latter scenes suggesting there is a desire to move the franchise forward again, seeking closure on the past and re-inventing for the future, although classic car lovers should look away.<br/><br/>Like anything else, movies are about timing. This captures the zeitgest perfectly, a very British film riding on an uplift of nationalistic pride following the 2012 Olympics. Director Sam Mendes has created a serious film, although Bond has never looked better from a cinematography point of view and the franchise never in more robust health.<br/><br/>There is no question that the combination of well executed real action sequences, tied with that iconic soundtrack is as good as cinema gets, a good Bond film is to be treasured and this is up there with the best.<br/><br/>The film strangely opened much later in New Zealand, therefore box Office figures already indicate this has been the most successful Bond film ever, $700 million and counting. Clearly Bond will be back and soon.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>As good as ""Casino Royale"" but in a different way. Not as iconic perhaps but lays solid foundations for the next two pictures Craig has signed to make, due in 2014 and 2016.<br/><br/>If you love cinema you cannot walk past a good Bond film, this is one and therefore comes highly recommended<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"

","In ""GoldenEye,"" the modern M (Judi Dench) calls Bond ""a sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War"" and announces to him in that same film ""If you think for one moment I don't have the balls to send a man out to die, your instincts are dead-wrong,"" a sentiment put to the test in the bang-bang motorcycle rooftop turned train chase outside of Istanbul that opens ""Skyfall.""<br/><br/>M's decisions to protect an encrypted list of embedded spy names thrust the film into the dazzling title credit sequence, a swirl of underworld imagery, with Bond being sucked into a whirlpool that dissolves into a skull, a cemetery with an open grave, Chinese red dragons swirling about, and shattering mirrors featuring Bond shooting himself. Post credit sequence set to the incomparable Adele theme song, Mendes then cuts to M, and this film centers itself on her. She is the Bond girl in this film, facing an imminent forced retirement from Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) as well as an oversight board for her running of MI-6. M is seen drinking a lot in this film, and Trevelyan's words from Dench's first film regarding drinking to silence the screams could be directed at her. Her words and actions put her agents in mortal danger, and culpability is hers. ""Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,"" the Bard wrote in ""Henry IV, Part 2,"" and M struggles to relinquish hers until the job is done. <br/><br/>Bond returns to action after a mission gone awry with a bullet in his shoulder and grudge against M. He returns to a subterranean M1-6 as a result of a terrorist attack on the headquarters itself. In the tunnels underneath London, M reevaluates Bond and sends him off to China to retrieve the stolen list. The hunt leads to a shimmering assassination sequence in a Shang-Hai skyscraper with the complex interplay of light and shadow as well as a spooky scene in a Macau casino, all reds and yellows and Komodo dragons. Bond is shown entering the mouth of the dragon that marks the casino's front (he might as well be crossing over the river Styx with his coin for Charon), and Mendes's film embraces this image: Bond entering death, Bond entering his own past. Komodo dragons swirl underneath the steps of Bond as he meanders into more and more trouble. Another ship to an abandoned island. A bad guy awaits, over one hour into the film, and Javier Bardem delivers a provocative performance filled with verve and fun, as well as pathos. Bardem is given three powerful entrances as villain (one a long extended monologue as he approaches a captive Bond, one a Hannibal Lecter-style incarceration, and one announced by an Animals cover of John Lee Hooker's ""Boom Boom"" as he steps off a helicopter-ride of death, automatic weapon in hand, revenge on his mind). Bardem proves capable in all three sequences, a lethal Byronic hero who implores M to ""Think of your sins"" as well as proves a mirror to Bond. Silva's tortured past implicates M, and he serves as a reminder of her own guilty conscience. Silva is what Bond could become and also a tie back to Alec Trevelyan. Silva is the collateral damage of the actions of both MI-6 and M. <br/><br/>""Skyfall"" delivers a Bond film of impressive emotional heft. Mendes has won the Academy Award for directing (and Bardem and Dench, both for acting) and seems as interested in the visual palette of the film (tunnels, abandonment, archways) as he is in letting his small cast dig into the material.<br/><br/>The staging of the final thirty minutes of the film in Scotland at Bond's ancestral home is quite possibly the most exciting Bond action sequence ever put to film. The less said about it, the better. Dench is strong here, as is the supporting cast of Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, Ben Whishaw, and the great Albert Finney. There is a sufficient amount of wry humor in the film, ably delivered by Craig; Silva asks Bond his hobby, and Bond spits out, ""Resurrection."" <br/><br/>Mendes has resurrected the character and the series from the depths of ""Quantum of Solace,"" a nonsensical, muddled step backwards from the character-driven ""Casino Royale."" He has resurrected the notion of a Bond song being a smash hit, something entering the pop culture beyond Bond. He has resurrected the conceit that Bond the man is infinitely more interesting than Bond the visual effect. Pierce Brosnan left the series several years back in ""Die Another Day"" with an invisible car and hang-gliding while a laser sliced an iceberg behind him. Craig and Dench have, with help from director Martin Campbell and now Sam Mendes, grounded the Bond series in a man, a man who was a child once, wounded and vulnerable by his parents' death. Bond is a man gripping by his fingertips, yet able to pull himself up. Bond is haunted, yet capable and confident, able to stand on a train track and ignore the approaching train. Bond is a lone warrior, staring out from the rooftops at the end, in a nod to the recent ""Batman"" series, always on guard. <br/><br/>""Skyfall"" is about the changing of the guard with the Bond series in many ways, and I am proud to place it alongside ""From Russia With Love,"" ""Goldfinger,"" ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" and ""License To Kill"" as a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Four stars, my highest rating."

","Best Bond ever worst Bond ever dull and boring exciting poor direction great direction, everyone seems to be an expert on how to make a James Bond film! First time I watched Skyfall I loved it but there was a sense of disappointment at the end but I didn't know why? Second time was better I picked up on bits I had missed first time but still that sense of, have just been to see it for a third time not something I would normally do no matter how much I enjoy a film but Skyfall really is that repeatable, this time I realised why I had a sense of disappointment the truth is this film is that good I just didn't want it to end it was as though there was more to come even though it had a definitive ending. Third viewing again I picked up on things I had missed previous, watch and listen carefully everything really is tied up nicely. The appearance of the DB5 makes no sense whatsoever when you think about it but it is actually one of the great moments of any Bond film and a brilliant turning point in this film each viewing the audience got very excited at this scene which set us up for what is a cracking showdown in the Scottish Highlands. Skyfall is a credit to the people who do know how to make a Bond film, definitely something a bit different from what's gone before but surly this can only be a good thing? I won't be seeing it a fourth time at the cinema but I was left wanting more and can only hope we don't have to wait too long for James Bond to Return."
"basilisksamuk","8","4","13","14 November 2012"," I live in a different universe
","I usually read a few existing IMDb reviews before writing one myself and that is how I came to the conclusion that I live in a different universe to most of you. Despite Skyfall's high (8.1) rating it seems that most of the reviews posted are highly negative, not to say downright hostile. Clearly I live in a different universe and saw a different film to most of you.<br/><br/>In the universe that I inhabit I was able to watch all the Bond movies as they came out – that's right, it may be the 50th anniversary but I'm so old I saw them all on release. In my universe there isn't a single Bond film that had a decent plot or one that made any sense or had much relationship to normal life. In fact they were distinguished by their utter lack of verisimilitude, plot cohesion and utter preposterousness. For the naysayers on this Bond film to cite lack of believability or plot holes and to complain that the villain is a camp cypher who spends precious time filling in exposition and threatening bond with some unlikely fate (sharks, teeth, laser beams anyone?) instead of putting a bullet through his head proves that they have never seen any Bond film ever shown in my universe. The absolute cornerstone of any Bond movie plot is that it is nonsensical guff that no sane person would ever believe. Even the actor who plays Bond changes every few years – how's that for lack of continuity? <br/><br/>For dwellers in the universe I live in I wish to inform you that this is indeed probably the best Bond film ever made. There are some exciting action sequences which match anything that has been done in previous Bond films; Craig is still the definitive Bond for our time; the plot is exciting and involving though containing no more believable logic than any previous Bond film. It's stylish and well directed and the cast are uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>What really made this film the best Bond in my estimation are the elements I suspect a lot of others didn't like. It does not go mad with CGI and often uses miniatures instead (though Craig's face superimposed on the motorbike stunt guy was clunky). It doesn't give Bond a load of unlikely gadgets and it relies on characters and the good old standbys of guns and vehicles.<br/><br/>To complain that the plot of a Bond film was illogical or the villain ridiculous makes as much sense as complaining that Strictly Come Dancing contained elements of choreography."

They kept to the James Bond references that make Bond, Bond.<br/><br/>I never thought Daniel Craig could pull off such a good bond.

"scott-sw","10","4","13","10 November 2012"," Bond's Full Circle
","It took 50 years, but Daniel Craig brought Bond back to Earth and full circle to the original ideas of both the first movies and the books in his latest venture, Skyfall. Silva is a former agent of MI6 and has declared war on the organization and M, played by Judy Dench. Once a 00 himself, he wants a vendetta for her abandoning him. Bond, too, feels somewhat betray as he was hung out to dry by M when trying to recapture a hard drive containing the name of MI6 agents undercover in terrorist cells. The two are tied together. Bond disappears for a short time, only to return when he learns of the first terrorist attack on MI6 and the threat of the security breach. He's not ready, he doesn't trust M, and he's stuffing anger. Eventually, he is reactivated as M and her branch come under heavy scrutiny. She makes her plea because of how the world has lost clear, definite enemies and how they have scurried away into the shade. Silva attempts an assassination of her. Bond then takes it upon himself to protect M in his childhood home, Skyfall. Ever since Bond was re-invented in 2006 with Casino Royale, many people have lamented that Bond changed from their childhood memories of cheesy plots, megalomaniacs, cool gadgets, hot women, and a comic book persona evident ever since You Only Live Twice. Others simply think Bond is a rip-off of the modern Bourne series. Frankly, Bourne goes back to Bond. In the books, and in the first three to four movies, Bond was a ruthless assassin. He was a blunt instrument bent on stopping lethal terrorist forces and the KGB. This is probably the best part of Skyfall: it comes full circle back to the beginning. We meet Q, a young computer expert and arms expert. He's not inventing exploding pens, watches with buzz saws or super magnets, but radios and improving firearms. That is also what Q did in the books. We also meet a Moneypenny - in a round-a-bout way. There are also tips of the hats to other elements of Bond: the classic theme, the Bond entrance into the moving eye, and the best was a cameo appearance of the old Astin Martin in Goldfinger. There is also some depth. For a change there is exploration on the psyche of being a spy - also a theme in the books. And there was also an exploration of where Bond came from - but not too much so we are still left guessing. Finally, the villain, Silva, is not a megalomaniac, but a genius, vindictive egomaniac. His mind is warped by his disfigurement. True, as the villain he wasn't exceptional, but definitely competent. So for those who love the comic book Bond made famous by Moore and Brosnan, then buy those movies and enjoy them to your heart's content. Yes, I enjoyed many of them, but they are pale in comparison to the real James Bond of the books and early movies ... and Skyfall."

The return of the ""Goldfinger"" car was classic. The performance of Javier Bardem.... CLASSIC VILLAIN. Played the part so well. They made him feel like a classic villain because he has a deformity, which I shall not reveal.<br/><br/>My only complaints were the fact Bond heard M give the order to take the shot, and Bond did NOTHING to get out of the way.

","Bond is back. From the very first notes of the score to the last thrilling shot, the Bond franchise has made it through the murk of financial problems and, more importantly, the underwhelming and complicated ""Quantum Of Solace"" to deliver a superb mission.<br/><br/>That's not to say this is business as usual. Though old faces (human and vehicle) appear again after a notable absence, this is a film firmly set in two camps: Daniel Craig and Sam Mendes. The Craig Bond films have been and always will be gritty, dark, edgy affairs, the type to rival the competition of Bourne and other more realistic action films. With Mendes, the first Oscar winning director to helm a Bond film, we get perhaps the most beautiful looking Bond film there's ever been. A gorgeous looking neon set fight scene in China, for example, or the one long shot that heralds the arrival of the film's antagonist, Silva (a dazzling performance from another Oscar winner, Javier Bardem).This is a different kind of Bond film, one that may stand alongside ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" as a world apart from the usual Bond formula.<br/><br/>Though the film starts with a thrilling pre-credits sequence involving cars, bikes, trains and cranes, the story is very character driven. An important piece of technology has been stolen containing names of undercover agents throughout the world; M's job and soon her very life is on the line. M is the Bond Woman in this film - driven, determined and at times ballsy, Judi Dench proves in her biggest role to date of the franchise just why she is the head of Mi6. Being a Mendes film, there are other suitably brilliant performances too from other British names - Ralph Fienes, Ben Whishaw and Naomi Harris, plus an excellent cameo from Albert Finney.<br/><br/>The action, when it comes, is fast and furious, with as much work done for real as possible, something the Bond films should be commended for (and something that shows up when it isn't, case in point: ""Die Another Day""). The final third becomes a kind of mixture of Bond stripped of everything but the essentials, ""Home Alone"" and ""Straw Dogs"", a weird mix that actually works. When it's all over, you breathe a sigh of relief and, more importantly, you're already impatient for the next instalment.<br/><br/>Though excellent, it's not perfect; despite having the best Bond theme for ages from Adele, the score by Thomas Newman is probably something that will grow with time. You miss the Barry-esque qualities that David Arnold brought to the series. As for the Bond theme itself, it feels slightly underused, though fills you with a guilty pleasure when it does kick in. The film could also arguably have been cut a little shorter, but the time really flew by when watching.<br/><br/>Such a fantastic work and proof of Bond's hobby: ""Ressurection"".<br/><br/>9/10"

","Every new James Bond film that comes out claims to be the ""best Bond ever,"" and even if ""Skyfall"" maybe isn't the best ever. Its certainly one off the better ones. As well as being the best one for a while.<br/><br/>Some may argue that ""Casino Royale"" was awesome. But I was underwhelmed by it almost as much as everyone else seemed to be by Daniel Craigs second outing as 007 in ""Quantum of solace"" (Which despite having the worst title ever, I thought was better). ""Skyfall"" is trying to capture again what worked for the best in ""Casino Royale."" It has the plot focus on the earlier days off Bond and gives the character an interesting back-story. Starting off by getting the over the top action out off the way, before getting on with telling a more realistic plot.<br/><br/>""Casino Royale"" had way too much card playing for my liking. But despite ""Skyfall"" having a similar slump a mere half hour into it (I'm not interested in seeing Bond get laid again. Get on with the ACTION!) most off the film works for the better. The action is nearly always interesting, and builds toward a great finale. Something which a lot off Bonds get wrong by having Bond invade yet another bad-guys fortress. There's a successful jokey side to the movie. Another thing the series can sometimes get wrong, and this Bonds good eventful story, shows you they've really pushed the Boat out in not wanting this to be ""Just another Bond film."" <br/><br/>It may go a little overboard with trying to be modern but then again the Aston Martins appearance makes up for that, and the films so full off surprises you can almost forgive it for having a camp bad-guy and some terrible CGI iguanas in it for some reason."
"andrisicy","3","7","28","3 February 2013"," Worst Bond Movie so far........
","I can not really express my disappointment with this latest Bond movie. I really like Daniel Craig as he is good actor and i mean it, but the plot is so badly written and scenes are so unrealistic that you could forgive it 25 years ago, but not in 21st century. Start of the movie is exciting, really cool, but how on earth you can get info from HDD that has nothing on it(only OS)Files are stored on servers not HDD (especially for organizations like MI6, i mean come on?)were you have to log in with key fob or secure password that you change every week or month and you only have read permissions and you can not store data on HDD. So the plot of the movie was lost here. More or less then we come to the final scenes were it all blows to smithereens with 2 gas canisters. Would be fine to blow a room - yes, not much more, mansion - not so much and take down the chopper(stupid idea and how much outdated???) REALITY CHECK FOR WRITERS. Then Bond was a about kilometer away but Silva catches him on foot and some other guy appears from nowhere and then the freezing water, how bad else it could go wrong. I could do much better script and write any day and for the movie with such a humongous budget somebody had to get a better writers. Disappointment for me as i really love Bond movies and it looks like it is going backwards and does not follow modern day life."
"mariaanders","1","3","9","23 June 2019"," The worst of them all
","Bond is really dead and Daniel Craig killed him off. This is not even a Bond-movie. All is gone that made Bond. The thrill, the romance, the humour, the good music, the incredible villains. This is just a bore. Bond looks like a English football huligan. No style, no charisma. Barbara Broccoli really managed to kill Bond off for good. Bond died when Daniel Craig took over. Then it went from fantastic adventures to just boring disaster. Even a trained monkey would be a better Bond than this. Daniel Craig really sucks. If you are a Bond-fan, avoid this mess. I saw this film once and that was enough - never more. What a torture. One had hoped that it would be the end of Bond but he came back in another total disaster, Spectre. Please - kill Bond once for all and let him out of his misery. RIP 007"

","Skyfall (2012): Dir: Sam Mendes / Cast: Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Judi Dench, Berenice Marlohe, Ralph Fiennes: This is so far the best Bond film that Daniel Craig has graced. It regards the overwhelming advance of evil and it opens with an exhilarating action chase where James Bond is engaged in combat atop a train and the orders are made to make a shot. This puts Bond on ice for months with the belief that he is dead. When the headquarters is bombed, he emerges once again. Central plot regards the termination of several agents and Bond out to track down the terrorist. Director Sam Mendes made such remarkable films as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road and here he creates such awesome action scenes including a nail biting sequence where a subway train careens through a hole made via bomb. Craig brings determination and wit in his portrayal of 007 and this is absolutely his best outing in the franchise. Javier Bardem plays the crazed villain out to kill M for a past that involved himself as a vengeful ex agent. Judi Dench as M is at her best because she is forced to face her past as well as confront her future and it is the broadest the role has ever been. Berenice Marlohe plays the latest Bond girl who is seductive and sexy until she faces a gun barrel while balancing a shot glass on her head. Ralph Fiennes picks up in the position once held by M, and that is something considering his acting status. These films are basic pointless fun and rarely done badly but this presents Daniel Craig at his finest with a script that brings down more than the sky. Score: 9 / 10"

"caseynicholson","9","3","9","10 November 2015"," A Return to Great Storytelling
","This third installment of the Daniel Craig contribution to the James Bond franchise makes for a great movie experience. Its immediate predecessor, ""Quantum of Solace"" was a bit week in the storytelling department. That's not the case with ""Skyfall"". Here we have a great movie with an engaging script and good pacing. The characterization works well, with Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes making major contributions to the film. A new Q is introduced as well, and Javier Bardem makes for a spectacular Bond villain.<br/><br/>My lone criticism of this movie is that there was less of the dramatic action sequences that serve as the standard formula for a 007 movie. ""Casino Royale"" hit the perfect balance of action vs. storytelling, while ""Quantum"" was heavy on the scenic action scenes without much regard for the script. ""Skyfall"" gets the storytelling done in a superb fashion, and the film certainly does have action scenes--but there's no boat chase or ski slope drama the likes of which comes to mind as the standard formula for a Bond movie. The exception to this is the opening train scene, which is well done and clever, but it was just slightly disappointing not to see more of that style of scene in the movie.<br/><br/>I will note that the first time I watched this movie, I saw it with two children and they found it hard to keep up, which was a disappointment for me since I loved my first Timothy Dalton 007 movie as a kid. It's that lack of action scenes that may make this harder to enjoy for a young audience.<br/><br/>That being the case, I've given this film 9/10 stars. It's close to perfect, but just a tad bit off of the mark set by ""Casino Royale""."
"rawiri42","4","3","9","7 November 2015"," I Gave Up!
","Not to say that all Bond films aren't very far-fetched but this one insults the intelligence of anyone who ever bought a movie ticket! That is unless 007 has shifted from the thriller genre to the fantasy one and I missed it.<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes were SO ridiculous that I couldn't be bothered watching any more. We start with a high-speed vehicle chase through over-crowded streets (although no one is visibly killed and then on motorcycles across rooves (funny how all those rooves were built to withstand the weight of speeding motorcycles landing on them after jumping from other buildings). Then the chase continues off the side of a railway bridge and, (guess what?) BOTH parties successfully land on the moving train which, as well as being a passenger train, also has a huge excavator on board which (more guess what?) is fueled up and ready to go - not chained down or secured at all!<br/><br/>Then the antagonist is able to shoot the couplings of a train apart (yes, that's the couplings capable of pulling a that multi-tonne digger) and yet the train keeps right on rolling with the vacuum or air brake lines broken and the driver obviously has no idea that he's lost half his train. But then, shortly afterward, the train comes to a tunnel that the excavator would never have got through so perhaps the driver was expecting to lose it anyway!<br/><br/>Eventually the girl, who is able to keep pace with the train in a Land Rover runs out of road but is gifted with a clear shot of Bond and his adversary fighting on the roof of the moving train - except that she is scared of hitting the wrong guy. However, M (who is also in full voice contact with everyone except the bad guy) tells her to take the shot anyway which she does and, of course, Bond falls from the roof of the train. But (yet another guess what) the train happens to be on a viaduct at some dizzying height above a fast-flowing river into which Bond falls. Meanwhile, Bond's girl accomplice is left with a wonderful clear shot of the bad guy for several seconds before the train disappears into a tunnel but (last guess what) - she doesn't take it!<br/><br/>And that's when I left! What a load of garbage!!"
"Buddy-51","9","3","9","1 March 2014"," Bond grows up
","Seems James Bond, aka 007, ain't quite as young and as spry as he used to be. After years of chasing the bad guys and suffering one too many injuries and wounds on the job, the world's premier secret agent is beginning to feel his age.<br/><br/>In this outing, a noticeably creakier Bond goes in pursuit of an ex-agent who's targeting MI6 and particularly its chief, M, for wrongs he believes he's suffered at their hands.<br/><br/>In addition to providing a more relatable Bond - replete with autobiographical back story - and M, ""SkyFall"" is that rare action movie that actually finds time to probe some surprisingly heady themes amid all the obligatory shootouts and chase scenes (which are excellent, by the way, especially the tour de force opening scene).<br/><br/>For instance, the script ponders whether MI6's old-school reliance on secret agents has become a hopelessly antiquated business model for a world in which technology has begun to replace time-consuming footwork and in which the enemy is no longer out in the open but operating in the shadows.<br/><br/>The movie also questions M's practice of cutting loose her most loyal and valued agents (Bond included) - essentially treating them as disposable assets - when a greater goal is to be achieved through their sacrifice.<br/><br/>The dialogue between Daniel Craig as Bond and Judi Dench as M is some of the best in the whole Bond series, and there is a genuine connection between the two individuals who, although they're working for the same team, often seem more like adversaries than allies.<br/><br/>""Skyfall"" also provides us with one of the most effective villains we've come across in quite awhile, in the person of Javier Bardem as the former operative who's decided to exact his revenge on the people and the organization that he feels have done him wrong.<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi even manages to achieve some genuine lyricism in his direction, something one almost never finds in an action film.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the Bond franchise has really upped its game since Craig hopped aboard in 2006's ""Casino Royale"" (despite the stumble of ""Quantum of Solace""). Happily, ""Skyfall"" restores that upward trajectory."
"brando647","9","3","9","25 May 2013"," A Triumphant Return for 007
","As I see it, we were incredibly lucky to receive the twenty-third Bond movie, SKYFALL. There were a lot of problems with MGM, the studio that owned the franchise and brought us each of the twenty-two previous entries, and for a while it looked like the franchise might be dead in the water. As a major fan of the series, this was an incredibly depressing possibility for me. So the eventual announcement that Bond was on his way back to the big screen and he was being directed by an Oscar-caliber filmmaker was an exciting time. The final product was lauded by critics and audiences (with a final score of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes) and I couldn't agree more with all the praise. Personally, I loved it as a triumphant return after a five-year hiatus and a perfect blend of the modern 007 that Daniel Craig has come to embody with loving homages to the classic 007 we've loved. SKYFALL is one of the rare 007 movies where the mission is a more personal venture for our hero. The villain doesn't have grand schemes of world domination or financial gain. Instead, the mana former MI6 agenthas a more personal agenda and targets M (Dame Judi Dench) in a series of terrorist attacks meant to discredit her. But he has no intention of stopping there. Meanwhile, James Bond has been MIA since a mission went awry and is forced to return to service when MI6 is publicly targeted in an explosive attack.<br/><br/>Just about every quibble I have with SKYFALL is minor. This movie is fantastic and there are no major issues that ruin the experience for me in any sense. I do agree that the movie does run a bit too long. Well, that's not necessarily true because I've sat through longer movies without a problem. I guess it's more that you can feel the run-time in SKYFALL at some moments, especially in the final act. The final act, a massive on-going action set-piece and a glimpse into the James Bond's past, drags on a little. It's explosive and exciting at the start, but the energy sort of peters out by the end and leaves the final confrontation with the villain a little anticlimactic. My only other complaint, and it's more out of selfishness than anything else, is I would have loved more time with the villain. Javier Bardem is the film's antagonist, an MI6 agent who goes by the pseudonym Raoul Silva who maintains a grudge after having been abandoned to suffer in the hands of an enemy nation. While just about all of the Bond villains in the past have obviously had some sort of screw loose, Silva comes across as full- blown psychotic. He's calm, calculating, and not averse to sacrificing lives to get his point across and accomplish his goals. Silva has jumped through the ranks to become one of my favorite all-time 007 villains, and I wish we'd gotten some more time with him. He doesn't arrive until around 45 minutes in the film, and I'm cool with that. Let the suspense build and give him a cool reveal late in the gameI'm down for that and Mendes pulled it off perfectly. But then he disappears again after some fantastic action sequences and we don't see him until the end. It feels like a wasted opportunity, but I suppose too much of a good thing would've ruined the effect.<br/><br/>SKYFALL shows some love for the fans who made James Bond so long lasting and popular with plenty of loving references to classic 007. The Aston Martin (from GOLDFINGER) makes a return after a nearly twenty year absence; I believe the last time we saw Bond in an Aston Martin (though not necessarily THE Aston Martin) was the beginning of GOLDENEYE in 1995. We also get our first introduction to Q since the series was rebooted in 2006. Ben Wishaw is a little younger that we're accustomed to in our Quartermaster and it's too soon to tell if he'll successfully fill the shoes of the late Desmond Llewellyn, but he brings confidence and a more modern tech edge to the character. No bizarre gadgets here, just a Walther with palm print identification. The rest of the MI6 staff is filled out in SKYFALL but I won't go into details here to avoid some pretty major spoilers. Newcomers to the series include Naomie Harris as Eve, a relatively new field agent, and Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, a bureaucrat who is brought in to investigate M when MI6's mission in the opening sequence falls apart.<br/><br/>True fans of the 007 franchise should find plenty to love here. I was excited to find that the story was presented on a much smaller scale (personal revenge as opposed to some grander scheme) but giving us the exotic locales and beautiful women we expect from the series. SKYFALL is a nice blend of the more serious, action-oriented new Bond with a taste of the classic, and the ending left me excited for the inevitable next film in the series."
"xboy614","10","3","9","31 March 2013"," James Bond is no Shawshank Redemption....
","I've heard lots of negative comments coming from this film. Someone said that they weren't going to watch this film because he heard that the film had, ""too many plot holes and was overall tried to be arty."" I'm having none of that and I forced him to watch it and the guy enjoyed it immensely. Just like I guessed. The truth is, the film is terrific, it is powerful as a stand alone film with the much needed elements which make a Bond film so enjoyable in the first place. You really feel like the Bond team have put everything they've got into making a film for the 50 Year anniversary of the Bond film franchise. It really pays off and during the ending credits my mouth was wide open. Daniel Craig gives another show-stealing performance, his dark and moody looks mixed in with his funny one-liners will remind you of Sean Connery. M as Judi Dench gives her best performance of M out of the seven films she's been in as playing Bond's boss. I would also go as far as saying that it was one of her best performances full stop. Raoul Silva played by Jarvier Bardem might give you flashbacks of the Joker, but he brings his own twist to the character and he would of stolen the movie if the other characters weren't perfect. Bill Tanner gets a decent amount of screen time and you get to understand his character in this movie. To tell the truth, there's more characterization and emotions shown in this movie then in all of Roger Moore's 7 Bond films. It works, really well and that's all that is important. People have heard about this and are expecting Shawshank's level of themes and ideas. But, no, the film has a slight melancholy theme and the film approaches the idea about sometimes old is better then new but this just improves the storyline. If you haven't seen it, get it out now! It has enough in the film for Die hard Bond fans (like me) to get excited about little scenes and references as well as pleasing action movie fans. The action is really good and clear. No shaky-camera Bourne stuff in the film. The score, by Thomas Newman done the job well and reminds me a little of the great John Barry and the Adele song is sure to be another Bond song great up there with Goldfinger by Shirley Bassey and For Your Eyes Only by Sheena Easton. Best Bond film ever? Quite possibly on many people's lists."
"shawn_m_roeder","9","3","9","27 February 2013"," Daniel Craig Brings Bond Full Circle
","This is one of the finest Bond films made. The opening stunt sequence is brilliant. Daniel Craig was given the task of giving the origin story to Bond in Casino Royale. The origin story comes full circle in this tale by introducing classic Bond elements, characters, cars and musical cues from the old movies. The way the dazzling imagery from the exotic locations was shot transcends the genre. Far from the usual two-dimensional villain, Javier's Silva exhibits a sweetness that makes him even creepier. The film continues to probe Bond's past taking us further into the roots of the character than even Casino Royale did. So, in addition to the usual well-choreographed action sequences and unique settings, this film is lavishly shot with an emotional resonance that begs multiple viewings."

","Yes, its a bad pun for a title but just take it for now and stick with me.<br/><br/>So this movie has gotten some mixed but mostly good reviews by critics and some pretty damn atrocious reviews by the regular mortals who flock to the movies to look for disappointment. The good news is, however, that Skyfall, (the latest Bond installment as you damn-well know) is actually quite a great film.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes introduces us to his refreshed Bond character, though still plaid by Craig, in a fast-paced chase scene in Istanbul, before pulling on the reigns and slowing the pace of the film to make way for some character development across the board (a swathe of new characters are introduced for this as well as some familiars).<br/><br/>Though there are a few clichés' to be found here, the new James Bond story has got quite a lot to offer, including a great story centering around M, and a new villain who is fantastic (but not the best bond villain). The story also makes Bond face some of his demons as well as tackle with his loyalty to Queen and Country, but also his boss, M.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie is to be found at the end with a fantastic finale set in Bond's pre- MI6 residence of SKYFALL. (and some lovely shots of the Goldfinger icon, and worlds most famous car, Bond's (Connery's) Aston Martin DB5. <br/><br/>This movie is in no way a traditional bond film. Though it does try to hark back to it's golden days with many a reference. But that is not to say it isn't a good film. Whether you view this as ""just a spy movie"" or ""James Bon's return"" you will be in for a treat. Bond goes to many locations, all of which suit the movies desired tone. As certain scenes require the feeling of desertion, a location is utilised and helps emphasize this and help the audience realise the emotions the various characters could be feeling. This could be a deserted island, or the grim, wet countryside of Scotland, used at a time when the situation that Bond ends up in is looking dire.<br/><br/>It does not need to be said that some people wont enjoy this film. Some people will believe that James Bond movies should never-ever change (I am a huge Bond Fan and have not taken this view) and others are the kind of people that cut holes in the shoes so they are able to complain about having holes in their shoes. <br/><br/>All movies can have holes in them. If you watch this looking for them, I'm sure you find things to complain about. However, I must then say, that if you are one of those people, who are always looking for reasons to hate things, then maybe there are some bigger problems in your life that you should be focusing on.<br/><br/>Rating = 8,5/ 10"

","I don't know if I can add anything more than what has been said on the previous 105 pages, but here goes: When I heard what a high-grossing movie this was, I thought, ""Great, they have moved beyond Quantum of Solace and emulated Casino Royale and other great Bond films."" My son saw it before me and said he only liked the last 1/3rd of the movie, the first 2/3rds was too slow and dull. That didn't stop me because I usually disagree with him, and I still do, but only because it seemed the whole movie was rather dull except the opening sequence. And the opening showing him shot, plunging down a waterfall left me wondering not just how he survived but why did he remain unavailable and not report back immediately? The film makes it look as though he would have been out of touch permanently except his conscience bothered him when he saw the attack on MI6 HQ. I can understand re-using some story lines but wasn't the rogue/traitor agent also used in QoS, the previous Bond film? In The World is Not Enough, M was also targeted, but when she was imprisoned she rigged a clock to a nuclear locating device to get help. That plot device works well for characters put in situations that they have no control over; however, in this film, why would Bond take M to a secluded house with no back-up of any kind, just jerry-rigged devices? Couldn't Q have given them some kind of assistance? These plot holes go on and on. Funny, though, I did not remember any plot holes in the previous two movies but this one is full of them and I was not amused. IMHO, this movie could make View to a Kill look good."
"rubenm","6","3","9","17 November 2012"," Not your average James Bond movie
","A gay villain. Almost no gadgets. A low babe-factor. 007 shedding tears. No, this is not your average James Bond movie. It's as if director Sam Mendes said: I'll do a Bond movie, but I'll do it my way. <br/><br/>Mendes seems to make clear that the old Bond is no longer relevant. The childish gadgets from Q, the mindless cavorting with beautiful babes, the over-the-top story lines about madmen wanting to rule the world: it's over and done with. Modern intelligence is no longer about spies drinking their Martini's shaken, not stirred. It's about computers, about hacking, about whiz kids trying to outsmart each other with their programming capabilities. <br/><br/>The references to this line of thought are numerous. The villain is a hacker, embarrassing MI6 by breaking into their computer system. M has to defend herself several times about the way MI6 is still doing things the old-fashioned way. Even parliament wants to know what's going wrong. It's all made clear by Q, himself a computer whizkid, telling Bond: 'I can do more damage on my laptop sitting in my pajamas before my first cup of Earl Grey than you can do in a year in the field.'<br/><br/>Of course, it's impossible to make a James Bond movie about only computers, hacking and digital intelligence. 'Every now and then, a trigger has to be pulled', concedes Q. So, there are still lots of action scenes, shootouts and chases in the film. Even Sam Mendes can't ignore the Bond tradition and the commercial interests. <br/><br/>And most action scenes are a joy to watch. The first minutes, before the credits, are an adrenalin-soaked succession of stunts, chases and spectacular actions. Who can deny that it's great fun to see motorcycle riders chasing each other on the rooftops of Istanbul's old bazaar? Or to see a moving train carriage being torn apart? Or to see a couple of VW's being crushed by a bulldozer? I can even forgive the makers for including the tired old scenes of cars racing through a crowded market and reducing fruit stalls to splinters and pulp. <br/><br/>The new era of intelligence is also symbolized by setting some action in the most dynamic city in the world: Shanghai. These scenes are the best in the movie. The scene of Bond shadowing a hit-man on a skyscraper with the neon of the surrounding city reflected in the glass of the building, is cinematographic perfection. Here, cinematographer Roger Deakins shows that Skyfall is no run-of-the-mill Bond film. The ambition was not just to make the 23rd Bond movie, but to make a really good movie in itself. <br/><br/>Some say Skyfall is the best Bond ever. And according to the IMDb-rating, it is. It's the only one in the top-250. It seems Mendes's message to renew the Bond-theme is commercially successful. Personally, I think the best Bond is still to be made. Skyfall does try to get rid of the more ridiculous and over-the-top aspects of most Bond movies, but there is still an excessive amount of violence (it would be interesting to do the body count), there are still crowd pleasers like a crashing Underground train and a helicopter going down. I'm waiting for the Bond movie that relies mainly on sharp dialogue, good atmosphere, tongue-in-cheek humour and a credible storyline."
"pinkled5","7","3","9","13 November 2012"," Average Bond Film...Nothing Spectacular
","This film met my expectations, which are never high for 007 films. I expected some action, chase scenes, attractive women and plot twists. I also expected shallow characters and substandard story lines. What I didn't expect was such a slowly developing plot. After the opening chase scene, which is very exciting, the film flat lines for about 30 minutes. Then, we're not introduced to the antagonist until nearly an hour in to the film and his motivations are revealed even later than that. That makes for a difficult film to be drawn into. But script writing has never been the strength of the James Bond franchise. It's best to just sit back and enjoy watching things blow up. Fortunately, the climax of this film has a lot of that to offer."
"hammy012","7","3","9","10 November 2012"," Good, but was expecting more.
","I have a confession to make. I have never seen a Bond film until now. <br/><br/>Okay, forget it. I enjoyed this movie somewhat... but there was something missing. All the action scenes, from the opening chase sequence in Turkey, up till the final battle in the Scottish wilderness were pretty decent, nonetheless. As the modern Bond films have shown, Craig's Bond is a tougher, more realistic Bond, with his own depth and frailties that shine through even with the mock-tough lines he says throughout the movie. <br/><br/>However, Skyfall was quite a letdown. Sure, the buildup was decent and everything, but when the villain shows up, it just falls apart. As for the plot, there wasn't much of a plot there. The film could've been character driven, but it just wasn't enough to make me feel for any of them, they had a lot of potential. Silva, Bond and M weren't as deep as the synopsis of the film here described. I was actually expecting Bond to show more of his own morality and insecurities instead of sticking to protecting M for the rest of the movie, even going as far as to betray MI6 could be good, M's past and whatever wrong or bad choices she made to have Silva on her tail, and send Bond into doubting her, and Silva to be more complex, his motivations for killing M explained further. A few plot twists could've been good too.<br/><br/>About halfway into the movie, I was actually wondering, ""What the hell are the supporting characters there for anyway?"" Moneypenny and Mallory were just a waste of space... they were just there to fill in the rest of the scenery. They could've been further developed, especially Mallory.<br/><br/>However, the film's production values were all great, never an issue. The wide, sweeping landscape of the Scottish hills to the fight in a office building in Shanghai with glowing neon signs in the background... well, they were all beautifully shot. The editing was decent, the action scenes are great... however, what made me speechless were the opening credits. They were beautifully done, all evoking the apocalypse inside Bond's world... with such emotion and the haunting song sung by Adele just makes me all hyped up for the film... but it just wasn't that impressive.<br/><br/>All in all, Skyfall is a pretty entertaining watch. 7/10"

Or is the viewer to ignore Bond acquiring the car in Craig's first Bond movie?<br/><br/>ANOTHER QUESTION - The climax takes place in Scotland, but there's no way that M is smart enough or Bond is not Bondian enough to get help from MI6 even on home soil? I found that to be a stretch--too much of a stretch that spoiled my suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>We needed a scene showing help on the way, with maybe Moneypenny, Q, Tanner, and/or Mallory watching the events at Skyfall via satellite, knowing that the helo with the troops will not arrive on time. Therefore, Bond and M are forced to MacGyver it up at the estate. Help arrives as M dies, of course.<br/><br/>My Opinion: CASINO ROYALE - 5 stars - One of the best films ever made. QUANTUM OF SOLACE - 4 stars - A very good Bond film. SKYFALL - 3 stars - A good Bond film with some disappointing aspects."

","If you're expecting to see the continuity of the tough,brutal and intelligent Bond that Daniel Craig played in the previous movies well this movie is a disappointment. I was so eager to see this movie and had really high expectations as i hoped it would be as good as Casino Royale but towards the end i just wanted it to be over. The plot is pretty simple even pathetic making the MI6 look like a bunch of imbeciles (first - for the movie) The opening action scene is ..... well not too good (another -). After that we just get a lot of different sceneries, people talking, Bond running around, M all frustrated well OK it could have been all good if we'd have something that would satisfy the viewer (there is nothing to think about, no intelligent conversations, seriously we've seen it all a 1000 times or more in other movies) - Oh and don't get any high hopes for any great action scenes because there is either a lack of them or they are exaggerated. Well what can i say this movie bored me and frustrated me to the point that i realized i am not a Bond fan after all. I just hoped that once in a while someone is going to make a Bond movie that would be aiming a little higher than the minds of a 13 year old."
"gridoon2020","6","3","9","2 November 2012"," Arguably the best PTS and the worst climax of the entire series in the same movie....
","""Skyfall""'s pre-title sequence ranks right up there with the series' very best (""Octopussy"", ""GoldenEye"", ""The World Is Not Enough"", etc.): it's an exhilarating action mini-movie, expertly directed by Sam Mendes, that instantly washes away the memories of the terrible editing of the action scenes in the series' previous entry, ""Quantum Of Solace"" (unlike Marc Forster, Mendes understands the importance of establishing shots, so that we know who is where and what he or she is trying to do). After this PTS gets you pumped, there is Adele's very beautiful title song (easily the best Bond song since the underrated ""The World Is Not Enough""), coupled with some unique and fascinating images during the opening credits. The movie seems to be on the right track, and then....we get a ""Rocky""-type ""comeback"" story about an (initially) out-of-shape, weathered, almost resigned Bond; isn't that the same Bond that JUST started his career as a 00-agent two films back, in ""Casino Royale""? How can he be getting sick and tired of his job already? Daniel Craig himself gives his most confident performance as Bond so far, and ""Skyfall"" also re-introduces some classic series characters: their appearance may not be what you expect, but they all have good chemistry with Craig and they look like they will make a solid team in the following Bond film. However, the villain of ""Skyfall"" is such a patchwork of previous Bond (and non-Bond) villains (Max Zorin for the hair and the crazy laugh, Alec Trevelyan for his MI6 past and betrayal, and that's just the Bond ripoffs) that even Bardem can't create a new fresh character out of that recipe. And the entire climax of the movie, where Bond devises a mind-bogglingly stupid plan to ""trap"" the villain, is an almost total misfire, apart from two outstanding moments: Albert Finney's ""Welcome to Scotland"" (which is also probably the best line in the movie), and Bond's seriously angry look when the bad guys destroy his beloved Aston Martin! One more good sequence: the London tube chase - during rush hour, no less! It's funny and exciting. And one more bad: Severin's cruel death. It's crass and distasteful. **1/2 out of 4."
"rooee","8","3","9","29 October 2012"," Question of Sport
","We can all pretend that Quantum of Solace never happened. But how does Skyfall compare with Casino Royale? Daniel Craig's Bond debut was an exquisitely made, neat and nasty exercise in sexual and violent tension which brought Bond bang up to date. But reboots are always at an advantage - the filmmakers have a pre-stocked toy box of tropes and expectations to play with. Skyfall, on the other hand, comes four years after a dud, with a director more suited to symbolism than stunts. Barbara Broccoli and MGM need Skyfall to be a success, lest the series is dragged back into the obscurity of the Dalton era or the preposterousness of latter Brosnan.<br/><br/>After the stylised pyrotechnics of Road to Perdition, the war-inside war film Jarhead, and the masterful but talky Revolutionary Road, one might expect that director Sam Mendes would put the brakes on Bond. But the 143 minutes fly by. If anything, I found myself longing for more. More time constructing the icy relationships between Bond, M (Judi Dench) and Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), and more time sparring with Bond and Silva (Javier Bardem).<br/><br/>Bardem's magnificent monster (part Hannibal Lecter, part Anton Chigurh, part Joker, making an entrance like Frank-N-Furter) appears at first to be an offensive, old-fashioned equation: campness = homosexuality = evil. But then great writing makes sense of the love triangle. Silva adores M (for Mother), but feels betrayed by her. Silva is expressing the repressed abandonment issues felt by Bond. And the relationship between M and Bond is precisely the mother-son bond (!) coveted by Silva.<br/><br/>Even more interestingly, Silva seems to embody Bond's deepest fears. With a threatening caress, Silva directly challenges our hero's ferocious heterosexuality; and he's secretly deformed, while Bond possesses a paranoid obsession with physical perfection. Silva is the expression of the scared little boy hiding behind the ""cool"" facade; the child who could never grow up, still playing with the toys that Mummy allows him, and still sulking when he's told off.<br/><br/>The dynamic between Bond and Silva takes the film in the thematic direction of The Dark Knight. And why not? This new Bond is as conflicted and repressive as Batman; damaged goods doing good in a modern world that promises safety and intimacy but provides neither. But while the final act of Nolan's flawed opus went wildly awry, Bond 23 ends entirely appropriately for a 50-year celebration, by returning to its beginnings. The raw, stripped-down finale recalls Straw Dogs' final storm. With its dwindling characters cast black against its fiery backdrop, it's as primal and mythic as Bond himself.<br/><br/>The only missteps are when it feels like the filmmakers seem to feel the need to actively remind us that we are watching James Bond and not The Dark Knight, such the casino fight scene that ends with a cheesy reptilian death. Typically Bond, maybe, yet it comes straight after an atypical, empathic exchange between Bond and Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) about her induction into child prostitution and the imprisoning nature of fear.<br/><br/>Overall, it would be a hard task to name a more satisfying or sophisticated Bond film. Budding screenwriters should take a leaf out of the screenwriters' (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan) book: the last line spoken by M in this movie is an absolute killer, bursting with meaning without spelling it out; a reminder that, in a world of pragmatists and assassins, love is expressed in actions, and the significance is in the subtext."

The plot of the movie is excellent. The exotic places in the movie, from Shanghai to Macau and then to Scotland, the director chose the best of the locations.

And somehow we come to experience what Bond is experiencing mentally.<br/><br/>This film is not for the narrow minded Bond audience who think only bond girls, cars, gadgets and the ending line,""Oh James!!"" make a classic bond film. This film is for those who accept change, for those who can very well do with out bond bedding a beautiful girl in the end and for those who can bear the sight of bond as a normal human being like others.<br/><br/>Even if you are not into bond you will like it so do see it when it comes out in your country"

","First of all, this Bond is surely made to amaze you even if you aren't a big Bond fan and/or lover. Having seen all Bond movies, I have to say that there are some little details which really give you a deja vu relating to other movies in the series. The Introductive part of the movie is set in Istanbul. It doesn't have the charm and sensation which it gave in From Russia with Love. But times change and so does Bond(it isn't anything new that Craig is much more of a dry Bond than the others, but this is his style and we all have to accept it). The credit sequence is really nice, the idea of seeing Bond during it sort of reminds you of Die Another Day, but the rest of the movie is as opposite to Die Another Day as it could be. It really is surprising for me to see that really no action at all is placed in the U.S.A. I really think it is a great choice. The locations remind me of those old Bonds like Dr.No, The Man with the Golden Gun and so on, which were really trend-setting in my opinion. To get back to the movie, it deals with a very interesting point of view : Modern Asia. It sort of brings the old Bonds back into the modern times, also giving it a bit of retro- style. Let's talk about the villain. Silva. I think there is really just one way to describe Javier Bardem's performance: The best bond villain ever. Exquisite acting. Just extraordinary. Is it enough? I don't think so, but i do not want to stretch my review unnecessary. As a matter, i wouldn't be surprised to see Skyfall with quite a view Oscar nominations next year... The finale : The location for the finale located in that lovely welsh? Scottish? house. It's OK all in all, but the credibility has to suffer a bit from the action scenes. Now just a few finishing touch about some characters: M : I think that the end of Judy Denchses performance has been exquisite. It is credible, and it doesn't surprise so much as changing M's in other movies. Q : Lovely performance, maybe a bit to dry. I don't think that the one toping Desmond Llewlyn is born. Mallory : For bond fans, it was quite predictable that Judy's character would die, letting him to become the new M. Eve (Moneypenny) : I really became happy when i heard Eve Moneypenny. Not only do we now the full name of Miss Moneypenny, but the character itself is lovely. To put it all in a nutshell, i have 2 conclusions: 1) It is a very good movie. I don't know whether it beats Goldfinger, but time will see(And i would say that it for sure is as good as Goldfinger). 2) It would have been great as the first Bond movie in the series."
"ticket_for_one","10","5","19","29 October 2012"," Bond meets Dark Knight Rises.
","Now let me just start with this. Daniel Craig is the best James Bond. Without a doubt this guy has transformed the womanizing secret agent, Moore, Brosnan and Connery played over the years and has transformed him into a powerhouse of a protagonist . Not only is he the closest version to Fleming's literary character, but after he hangs up his boots as James Bond (wait for it), they should close the franchise down. Because they will never, ever be an actor who'll match the on screen presence Daniel Craig has with the character. Now after seeing several trailers for Skyfall, I was very pleased with what I saw and had high hopes that this latest offering, would equal Casino Royale.<br/><br/>Skyfall is the best Bond film, I have ever seen. Not only does Skyfall equal the awesomeness (if that's a word) of Casino Royale. It surpasses it! Now I don't usually believe in any film hype, but Skyfall lives up to the hype and delivers in spades. Not only is it excellent on every level, it really is a triumph in filmmaking.<br/><br/>Performances are excellent from everyone who plays a major part. Daniel Craig not only continues to play the hard as nails side to Bond brilliantly, his vulnerable side is on show more than it has been in the previous films. Not much has been mentioned of Bond's past in previous films, but Skyfall gives you everything you need to know and more. This is not only Craig's best performance as Bond, it's the best I've seen from him as an actor. This time he allows us to see a totally separate side to the James Bond character. Old wounds are opened and left open for all to see how much of a wreck he has become after doing the job he was required to do. His performance is only outmatched by Judi Dench as M, who just like Bond has to deal with the sins of the past when she realises one of her old agents is after her. Again it's the first time we see M show her human side. Showing behind her well fortified MI6 office desk, she becomes just as afraid as any other person. M is regarded as a relic by the Prime Minister and her peers at a committee hearing, but she fights and back quotes TS Elliot, which is her way of telling everyone she won't quit, until the job is done. Judi Dench is excellent in this, and her chemistry with Craig is very much a mother looking out for her son kind of relationship. Which has been more or less been the story between the two throughout the three Craig films.<br/><br/>One of the many problems with Quantum of Solace, was that it had an extremely poor villain. So poor, he's not even memorable. Javier Bardem did a job in No Country for Old Men which rightly earned him an Oscar. But I had doubts if he could pull off being a Bond antagonist. He's fantastic in this and plays a really scary unhinged villain. Think Max Zorin from A View to a Kill with a dash of Heath Ledger's Joker, and you'll get Silva. The thing that's unique about Silva is that, his blond hair and campy cream suit jacket almost make you underestimate him. But he is a really dangerous villain and excellent match Bond, physically and mentally. Bardem makes Silva memorable with one scene, and I won't spoil it, but trust me, you'll know what I'm on about once you see it.<br/><br/>Supporting cast does a great job. Naomi Harris, Ben Whishaw as the new Q, Bérénice Marlohe, Rory Kinnear, Ola Rapace, Albert Finney and Ralph Fiennes all do a great job supporting, with Whishaw and Finney being standouts. Mendes' direction is visually beautiful. It's clean, crisp, polished, picturesque and well-edited. The scenes in Shanghai are amazing, and those scenes only confirm why Mendes is held in such high regard as a director. Not only does he have a great eye for detail, he also allows his actors to breath more life into their characters. Add veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins to all of this and you have a visually amazing film. Every frame is given attention and every frame looks as if it should be photographically framed. Nicholas Refn did a similar job with Drive, but Mendes (with a bigger budget) has shown he is a master at it. There's even a fight scene between Bond and an assassin in Shanghai that's worth the price of admission alone because of how it's been shot. The whole film is wonderful to look at and wonderfully put together. The nostalgic references were welcomed as were some of the jokes that went with them.The set pieces, visual effects, writing, acting even the score from Thomas Newman had me engaged throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>In essence, you could say that this is the Dark Knight Rises of the Bond series. It's picked little elements from previous Bond films like, Her Majesty's Secret Service, You Only Live Twice and Licence to Kill to make Skyfall work the way it does.<br/><br/>All in all, Skyfall is an amazing film and the best Bond film I've seen so far. But with Craig signed on for three more, how will they top this? Will Mendes helm the next Bond film? Or will they get another director with a different vision to handle the next instalment? Either way, it will take a lot to surpass Skyfall."

With Sam Mendes on directing duties and showing us that Bond can be and have another fifty years of movies at least. As seen in the trailer and the pre-title sequence Bond is back to his best with the train stunt that's exciting and action packed whilst being full of Bond-isms (Straightening his cuff links). There's a lot of reminders to the last twenty-two movies including the Aston Martin DB5 back on the screen, a good game is when you see the movie see how many you can see. <br/><br/>The whole story is a roller coaster of excitement with a look into the future and past of the franchise and characters. There's still the world travelling elements seeing locations including China, Turkey and Britain. With Q-branch and a new Q to work with Bond for this and future films James Bond is certainly establishing similar premises as seen before. I'd be happy to see Daniel Craig reprise the character for another few films before another actor comes on board. Seeing some bad edits during the final showdown and that the Adele theme ""Skyfall"" isn't overly fitting and slightly depressing for the opening credits would be my only complaints. <br/><br/>Verdict: Daniel Craig's best outing since Casino Royal (2006) but his most comfortable performance as 007. <br/><br/>See this if you liked: Any Bond Movie, Bourne trilogy."

Backing him up is lovely Eve (Naomie Harris). The two agents chase him through streets by car, then James jumps on a motorcycle to follow through markets and over rooftops. Finally, Mr. Bond jumps on a train Patrice has boarded and the two fight it out on the train's rooftop. Ordered by M (Judi Dench) to take a shot, poor Eve ends up wounding James, who falls into the water. Patrice gets away and Bond is presumed dead and gone. But, not so. After a brief hiatus, Bond appears in London again, when the Secret Service building is set on fire. M is very glad to see him, because Patrice's boss has captured a disc with agents' names all over the world and M herself is getting scary messages. Traveling to Shanghai, Bond again wrestles with Patrice on a high rise and Patrice is thrown to his death. Nevertheless, James melts the heart of a beautiful underling Severine and they travel to meet the top evildoer, Silva (Javier Bardem). Silva, once an agent for Britain, makes clear his plans to continue killing. But, oh, Bond gets the upper hand and takes Silva prisoner to London, where he is sentenced to prison. But, is this really where Silva will go or does he have ingenious plans to break out of his chains? Unfortunately, the ex-agent does and its all out war between Silva and the Brits. How will it end? This film deserves ten stars for its superlative cast, plot, cinematography and every other element. Craig is so good as his own battle weary type of Bond while Bardem is one of the top villains in Bond history, being evil, mad, but somehow to be pitied. All of the others, including Dench, Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Ben Whishaw are also topnotch. As for the scenery, it is sumptuous while the direction by Sam Mendes is beyond terrific.

"blackwidowis7cool","10","2","5","2 July 2019"," Let the Sky Fall
","This is only the second Bond film that I have seen so far and it's my absolute favourite of the two!
At the start of the movie, James Bond (Daniel Craig) and Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) are trying to retrieve a stolen list that has the names and details of undercover agents. One thing leads to another, and Bond and the man who had stolen the list - Patrice - get into a fight on top of a moving train. Moneypenny is forced to take a shot at Patrice (even though there is a very high chance of hitting Bond instead) so that the list cannot escape. She shoots Bond instead and Patrice and the list escapes. Bond is presumed dead.
M (Judi Dench) prepares an eulogy for him and they hold a funeral. On the way home, MI6's headquarters blow up and M receives a taunting and cryptic message from the person responsible. Because of the failure to retrieve the list and due to the headquarters blowing up, M is being forced to retire, though she states she will after seeing this particular mission through to the end.
Bond is then revealed to still be alive and living in a small village by the seaside. He hears on the news about the attack on MI6's headquarters and returns to help. He undergoes tests to see if he's fit. He fails, but because they are desperate, M still allows him to return. They soon realize that it's a person from M's past coming back to haunt her and Bond needs to track down the list, the person after M, save his boss and the day. But can he succeed?
(Silliest question to ask about Bond, I know)
I really love the moral and psychological questions this movie raises about the espionage business. This movie has a very sombre, psychological feel to it and and it focuses on Bond as a person more; focuses more on plot than action, though there is plenty cool action scenes.
The acting is top notch - everyone does a stellar job of portraying their characters - especially Javier Bardem, who plays Skyfall's main villain Raoul Silva, a wronged agent and possibly M's son, which adds a creepy and dark layer to the story and if that's true, you sort of sympathize with him a little bit more. Silva is a psychotic, insane, creepy, and brilliant guy and Bardem does a very awesome and praiseworthy performance as Silva.
Bond's theme and the general music score throughout the movie is absolutely fantastic!! Especially the song ""Skyfall"" in the title sequence - I sooo love that song.
Of course, no Bond movie would be complete without an appearance of the famous Aston Martin.
And the last half - man! It is very well written (the whole movie, actually), very tense, action-filled, emotional.
Seriously, just watch the movie!"

","Doesn't get much better than this, perfectly executed. Proves that you can actually have it both ways, a heartwarming story and thrilling action.<br/><br/>What I liked most about this chapter was the fact that they went for a more vulnurable James Bond. And decided to focus on his past and few but meaningful relationships, not just gambling affiliations and one-night stands. Especially the way they explored Bond's relationship with M, which made this movie a beautiful send off to that character.<br/><br/>As always, Judi Dench is exceptional in this movie. Javier Bardem also stole most of his scenes. Maybe they could've added more layers to his character, to understand his perspective better, but all in all this might be the closest you get to perfection with a James Bond-movie."

"michaelmandery","10","2","5","3 June 2019"," Bonds Birthday Blockbuster
","In James Bonds 50th anniversary the creators take the series back to its roots while also making more than just another Bond movie. England's best spy finds himself hiding away in the tropics while suffering an apparent midlife crisis after being shot in the exciting pre-creititorial scenes. Sam Mendes work as director on this film played a monumental role in its success. Skyfall showcases all the usual elements of a Bond film, the chases, the girls, the arch villain but recharged with intelligence and a less superior, more exploring empathy.
Bond returns to MI6 in the time it needs him the most. Agent 007 fails all of his physical and mental exams, and on top of that he shoots his gun as straight as a monkey could. But while knowing all of this, his boss M still believes he is the right person for the job. Her government overseer seems to disagree.
The script was written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who have previous bond experience and should be experts by now. Many people have compared the story of this movie to that of The Dark Night. But between Purvis, Wade, and Mendes I believe they found a better balance of light and dark. They gave Bond a little more humility and personality that I think people can resonate with.
Then there is the villain (Javier Bardem). The character of Silva is great and filled the role of antagonist perfectly. Again to reference the The Dark Night, the character of Silva reminds me a lot of the Joker. His mannerisms and the way he talks almost mirrors the Joker, all the way down to the face deformation.
All in all I absolutely loved this movie. They took Bond right back to its original principles while also adding some great humanity aspects to to the terminator of James Bond. Mandes took on the hard task of continuing the legacy of Bond and still had the confidence to give it his own little twist and in my opinion it was all perfect."

","After 50 years of having the great 007 portrayed in film Skyfall was released as the 23rd edition to mark this grand occasion. Ever since Sean Connery played the great 007 in Dr No (1962) the series has some great and some okay films. Skyfall not only rebooted the series after a small break but will go down as one of the best James Bond films ever made. Daniel Craig cements himself as a great 007 in this film. <br/><br/>From start to finish Skyfall captivates and entertains. The unique start shows Bond being shot and injured. The story that follows is close to home for Bond as he goes to where he grew up, M also is at the centre of this story as the Bond villain looks to settle a score with her. Javier Bardem is an excellent villain and enhances the film. He will certainly be remembered as one of the better Bond villains with his elaborate plot to face M. Continuing as a film of firsts the Bond girl is killed quite early and we know Bond won't be sailing off into the sunset with her. <br/><br/>All the classic Bond elements were incorporated such as the iconic Aston Martin and some memorable scenes with Bond and M. Q is played by a new actor who surprisingly holds his own in this film. The end was beautifully directed and the Bond villains death and Ms death was dramatic and beautifully portrayed. This great film also included an award winning theme song by Adele. <br/><br/>Its fair to say Skyfall had all the right elements and drama to be celebrated as one of the best Bond films. I cannot think of a better film and way to pay homage and tribute to such an incredible and beloved film series."
"Seraphion","8","2","5","7 November 2015"," A great way of telling a Bond story
","The movie serves us a story that goes very personal to the James Bond character. You can see that the villain, although well played, still lacks the menacing character. In one sense the movie serves us a warning that in this interconnected world rises a new kind of threat, one that can be done from anywhere in the world with just a laptop and an internet connection. But still what allures people to watch this movie is really the more personal conflicts of the characters; both James Bond of having to return from his 'death', and having have to retreat to his childhood home, and also M of having to face the ghost from her past. One thing to add, the movie serves great nostalgic references to the older movies in the franchise. The acting overall still feels great. Daniel Craig's James Bond portrayal is for me the best so far in comparison to the other Bonds. Judi Dench did great in her farewell M role. Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe filled the Bond girl slots nicely. Ralph Fiennes seems underutilized here, but I think the next movie will extend his role more."

","James Bond, since Daniel Craig took over, is nothing like the films of old. Casino Royale and Quatum of Solace are contemporary outings, switching cheese and swatch with seriousness and sophistication. A serious overhaul was needed. Lo and behold, Skyfall, the peak of Craig's 007. Bond comes of out hiding after an attack on M (Dench) and the MI6. Other agents are being picked off, so it's up to Bond to look after M, and once again save the day. Skyfall's got Bond written all over it, except this time it's simplified, almost going back to the beginning. As Q (now Ben Wishaw) says 'what did you expect, an exploding pen?' Bond's hurt. His pride broken, beaten and scarred. He doesn't have the time to heal with Javier Bardem's former agent testing his loyalty to M and the MI5. We learn more about Bond than we've ever known. Skyfall's simple, gripping and effective, its personal touch stands out. 007 has changed, and change is for the good."

Still like Daniel Craig as Bond, but his pension for kicking A ends with an axe to the back of the villain? We have been trained to want more from our Bond Girls in both character and allure. We have also come to expect that Bond has his own plot and not need to steel meaty chunks from ""The Dark Knight"".

","Very disappointed. James Bond is a great franchise. Daniel Craig is a great Bond. He is so wasted in these last two Bond films. Casino Royale was great, he was great. He is a great actor, as proved in so many films. Can they not find anybody to write a screen play. Heck just have Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, Ralf Fiennes just sit and talk to each other for two hours. The entire last sequence at Skyfall was like they ran out of plot and had to end the movie. Why have Dench's M die, how stupid - she could have retired and passed the torch to a great actor Fiennes - that could have been a great scene. But no - these writers could not figure that out. Please use Craig, he displays all the Bond traits, tough, smart, humorous, can we not get him some lines?"
"rmcom9999","6","2","5","12 January 2013"," The Bigger they are, the harder they fall.
","Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and we all behold things subject to our own psyche, mood and life experience. My subjective view is such that Skyfall was a pastiche of the earlier Bond films, possibly slanted as a tribute on the 50th anniversary. Attractive enough but mostly a silly story. Silly is okay as entertainment, but you have to believe it in some way to be entertained. Daniel Craig as good an actor as he is, couldn't save this one and Javier Bardem went a good way to make the most of his character; but it went pear shaped as it moved along. Killing off the incredibly attractive Berenice Marlohe didn't help, they normally sacrifice a lesser role at that point, and keep the chosen attractive woman at Bond's side till the end, I would have been happy to watch her for a couple of hours and ignore the pitfalls of the story. I enjoyed the darker Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, which let Daniel Craig pull more serious expressions and grunt more and talk less, with quite possibly the involvement of Paul Haggis adding some gravitas. I'll be very careful about jumping at the chance to see the next one. I'd hoped the Daniel Craig lead reinvention, like the latest Batman trilogy and the possible influence of the excellent Bourne series, would be an on going stream; but I'm no longer hopeful. Skyfall may have broken the billion dollar box office mark, and award forums have their own shortcomings: but like most things. just because it's popular, doesn't make it good."

"SylvesterFox007","10","4","14","11 November 2012"," The Best Bond Film Since ""Goldfinger""
","The year 2012 marks the 50th Anniversary of ""Dr. No"", the movie that kicked off the James Bond film franchise. It was a relatively low-key spy thriller compared to what was to come. 40 years later, most fans would agree, the gadgets, stunts, and special effects of ""Die Another Day"" had become so over the top that it seemed like the series was starting to parody itself.<br/><br/>""Casino Royale"" ditched the clichés and started from scratch, introducing Daniel Craig as a young James Bond just licensed to kill. The movie took a fresh, character-based approach to the series. This approach is continued in Daniel Craig's third and best take on the character, ""Skyfall."" Just as Sean Connery and Roger Moore (arguably) hit their strides with their third Bond movies (""Goldfinger"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", respectively), Daniel Craig now seems to be settling comfortably into the role. <br/><br/>While Daniel Craig still gives Bond the rough-around-the-edges qualities that distinguish his take on the role, he picks the right moments to channel the actors that have played the role before him. He's still able to show angst in the movie's dramatic moments, he also has that wry half-smile while taking out enemies and that satisfied smirk while seducing beautiful women that Sean Connery had, and he's finally comfortable enough to toss out a few one-liners worthy of Roger Moore. Though his delivery is so wonderfully dry that you almost don't realize they're puns.<br/><br/>The movie starts with an opening sequences worthy of the tradition, an action-packed chase scene involving guns, Range Rovers, motorcycles, and speeding trains through Turkey. This climaxes in Bond's supposed death when his backup sniper accidentally hits him, knocking him off the tracks into the water below. After the main titles (one of the most bizarre credit sequences in Bond history, but also one of the most effective) it turns out Bond is taking advantage of being presumed dead to try and get out of the spy game. Until he learns someone is targeting the organization he worked for.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem's villain, a flamboyant bleach blonde, is probably the most memorable since the classic days of Auric Goldfinger and Dr. No. He's introduced with one of the best evil monologues ever, and every scene he's in after that is totally chilling. Berenice Lem Marlohe and Naomie Harris are this movie's Bond girls, and while Marlohe's Severine is one of the most stunning Bond girls in ages and Harris' Eve is one of Bond's savviest sidekicks, their roles are both inconsequential compared to the true female lead. That would be Judi Dench as M. While the relationship between Bond and his superior has been explored more in Daniel Craig's Bond movies than ever before, here it's pushed front and center, forming the movie's emotional core, driving most of the plot, and making M a major player rather than just a character to provide exposition, showcasing Dench's talents as an actress.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes manages to keep a personal, dramatic atmosphere through the entire movie, but still work in jaw-dropping action sequences. Unlike ""Quantum of Solace"", they're thankfully filmed in a steadier, more traditional manner. The movie's also very well paced: despite being one of the longest entries in the series, the action moves briskly and the story never drags. And Mendes and the rest of the ""Skyfall"" crew manage to avoid the clichés while still including Bond's trademarks. There's a new Q, in the form of the young Ben Whishaw. In a fresh new take on the character, when Bond seems disappointed by how practical the gadgets are, the young tech whiz responds, ""Expecting exploding pens? We don't really go in for that sort of thing anymore."" The gadgets bring to mind the earliest Bond movies, where it came as a surprise when Bond was able to use his equipment, unlike later movies, in which the situations that called for the gadgets were so specific you could make a checklist of them in Q's scene and then check them off as Bond used them. There are one or two other familiar characters that pop up as well, in ways that manage to feel both classic and fresh. And Ralph Fiennes brings charisma and gravitas to his role as M's new handler.<br/><br/>""Skyfall"" is definitely a Bond movie for modern times. It's the first time a character (Judi Dench, no less) drops an ""F-bomb"" and the first time a bad guy actually makes a pass at 007.<br/><br/>Like the 40th Anniversary, ""Skyfall"" is filled with references to what's come before. Unlike ""Die Another Day"", where the plot line seemed like a flimsy excuse to hang inside jokes on, in ""Skyfall"" the references are much more sly and subtle, and the story's actually sharp enough to support them, so long-time fans can smile while there's still plenty for newcomers to enjoy, even as the throwbacks go over their heads.<br/><br/>There are a few missteps. After all, what Bond movie's been perfect since the Connery days? After some awesome action scenes, the climax seems to be taking a page from a totally different play book, and some of the characters' motivations and actions don't hold up to scrutiny. But overall, the mix of drama, action, and humor make ""Skyfall"" one of the best Bond movies of the entire series. It skillfully ushers in what's sure to be another new beginning for the series, and, back in fine form, I'm excited that ""James Bond will return."""
"Staffenburgen","8","4","14","10 November 2012"," A Refined, Refreshing Film
","When I sat down a few hours ago to watch the latest Bond adaptation, I really had no idea what to expect. Casino Royale was a great film that redefined the franchise, while Quantum of Solace seemed to take a huge step backward. To be honest, while I was hoping for the best, I really was expecting the worst, especially since the previews really made it look like a carbon copy of the last one. <br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Skyfall opens very much like the previous two; we are thrust directly into the action. If you've ever watched a Bond movie, you've seen the first twenty minutes of Skyfall. Chase scene, explosions, shattered glass, yeah, you get it. <br/><br/>Here's the good news; the first twenty minutes are easily the film's worst moments. After that, we are quickly ushered into something much more refreshing. The story, while predictable at times, is quite engaging, and the film looks absolutely beautiful. There are some scenes of the Shanghai skyline that are incredible, and the prolonged sequences that follow make for a visually pleasing experience. <br/><br/>As for the acting, Daniel Craig is really strong here. In fact, there isn't a single piece out of place. Ralph Fiennes and Javier Bardem are both fantastic, and I also quite enjoyed the new Quartermaster. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a great film. Seriously, it's quite different from the other Bond movies and I can virtually guarantee you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>RATING: 7.5/10"
"white_dragon_and_pixie_d","3","4","14","8 November 2012"," A Sad return of one-liners. The Ending Falls Flat.
","The first half of the movie was fantastic. I would give that a 9 (I don't give 10s easily). Without giving away too many spoilers, there is a point in the movie however where you think the good guys finally got a leg up. I feel if I had left the theater at that moment in time, I would have been really happy with the film. As it is, at that point onward, the movie spirals into increasingly poor plot gimmicks, cheesy one liners and over the top (and unbelievable stunts) that plague this Bond in the same way they have plagued most Bond movies since the days of Timothy Dalton. The ""climactic"" ending, with the exception of some gratuitous explosions, was anything but. It felt very anti-climactic.<br/><br/>One of the things I enjoyed most about the last two Bond films, was that they took the story line a bit more seriously. The over exaggerated (and in my opinion cheesy) stunts were gone. But best of all, the sad one liners were gone too. I could actually make it through a Bond movie, and not end up rolling my eyes at some of the dialog. Sadly, both of these have made a bit of a return in this film.<br/><br/>Most of the stunts were very well done and are thoroughly enjoyable. But there are a couple that I think would have been better if they were made a bit more believable. And the painful one liners to me, do nothing more than pull me out of the emersion of the movie, and simply remind me that I am watching an actor portraying a character. The lines have never been that funny, and they aren't now either.<br/><br/>Almost as bad is the studio's attempt to satisfy fan boys, by putting Bond icons back into the movie in a half-hearted way. I think this movie will get more thumbs up and good reviews simply because bond's classic Aston Martin makes a return appearance.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan Bond films, you will likely enjoy this one too. If you are like me, and enjoyed Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace because they WERE NOT like the Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan Bond films, do yourself a favor and leave about 90 minutes into the film."

","Skyfall is a pure CLASSIC BOND movie. The First thing that came to my mind before watching the movie was ""What is Skyfall??"" But i was not disappointed as the question was answered in an intrigue style. There are lots of spoilers and mysteries. This is the first 007 movie to answer all the questions which we had been guessing all these years. This Movie requires a lot of patience and the casual movie goers, expecting lots of oomph and gadgets will be a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>On the verge of completing 50 years for the Bond films, Sam Mendes has done a marvellous job which has to be visualized with your own eyes. Daniel Craig's best performance upto date as we see a lot more than action scenes or the cool, composed international spy with the deadly,cold stare. Judi Dench aka M has given the best performance when compared to other actors in the movie. She has shown us exactly what M is capable of during the crisis faced by MI6 and the decisions taken in a very cold brutal manner. Equally worth mentioning is the Main Antagonist, Javier Bardem aka Raoul Silva who shows us a Cold War style espionage which baffles our mind. Not to forget that Ralph Fiennes has a great responsibility which we could probably guess.<br/><br/>The Film gives us a Fresh look into Bond's personal world, British Pride and a Stunning view of Scotland. Aston Martin DB5 - the sound of the engine revving made me wonder why don't we have such wonderful beasts?? The Bond Girls are a hit-miss affair.<br/><br/>The movie is a reminiscence of spy vs spy with most of the actions in the ""SHADOWS"" with a mixture of haunting silence and pure 007 gun barrel sequences. Threat of a cyber war and Resurrection of Bond in a old genre style is a treat to watch. This movie gives a wonderful basement for future 007 ventures.<br/><br/>If not for the slow pace at certain parts of the movie, I would have given it 10/10. I give 9/10."

","Skyfall has a number of good things going for it: Javier Bardem is a great actor and Ralph Fiennes, even with a really small role in this film, is wonderful as well. Naomi Harris I've loved from her role as Tia Dalm, even if in this film she also is just being set up, just like Ralph Fiennes. Daniel Craig does a good role, as well, but he has already proved himself in the previous film.<br/><br/>However, all this potential is practically wasted in a confused script that attempts to make a circular link between the old James Bond, with the cars and the gadgets and the queen and country stuff, with the new Bond, where computers and strategy is paramount compared to physical stuff. And they really try too much, they achieve little and make yet another ""fallible Bond"" film that pretty much bores people watching it in its two hours and a half.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the starting credits have a complex visual background, heavy in computer graphics and hints on the film. The rest of the movie attempts to catch up with that which, I am sorry to say, is the best part of the film. Oh, and that guy Patrice is the husband of Noomi Rapace."

The cinematography is fantastic (only for this it's worth to watch the film) and the story well beyond the most Bond movies in the last 30 years. Especially to give a little bit of an inside view into Bonds own history was a really great idea. The cast performance was absolutely outstanding. Besides the main Characters Judy Dench, Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem my favorite was Albert Finney – only with his presence he almost stole the show from everybody else. I didn't miss the gadgets but loved to see the DB5 in action again. What I enjoyed most were the many little reminiscences to 50 years Bond movie history and to setup the movie more like a drama rather then a thriller. And still there are plenty of thrilling moments as well as a couple of brilliant small and very funny dialogs in the film. Overall this movie holds the one promise where many recent mega-productions fail – to be top level movie entertainment (in all parts and aspects)."

This film is one of the most beautiful in the series and this year, this is the fantastic job done by Roger Deakins who created some stunning images using very bright colours, also some of the landscapes look so vast and connected to the story.<br/><br/>Out of the most recent bond films this is the best performance one because every actor is giving some of their best in the series. Daniel has sketched a legendary bond for in the history of actors who have played it. His part my be non-emotive but this was the best I've seen him be. Judi Dench has played M for so long even making this her seventh bond film playing the mostly wasted character until she gets more to do in this film. Her final scene as the character ends her time in the series I was very upset because bond will not be the same without female M. The villain in this film is played funny and devilish by Javier Bardem with his blonde locks. His entrance into the film is one of the best shots Deakins gave the film as he talks about rats while walking to Bond. At times Bardem's characterisation can go over the top but I found him just so enjoyable and watchable. The rest of the characters like new Q are just there to set up plot points and even though they can be fun at times they still are not given enough worthy material like the main three actors are.<br/><br/>Mendez took bond and added his own personal style while keeping it still loose and fun to watch. The performances given by Bardem and Dench are top class and the production value is so strong including the original music provided by Thomas Newman. For being 50 years old the character of Bond just lights up the screen and makes it fun to watch him transform.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: A- (MVP: Judi Dench)"
"drjones1","6","5","20","27 October 2012"," Better For Craigs Standard, But Still Lacking Bond-ness
","I went to see this film on opening night and had medium to a slightly expectation for this film after sparkling reviews from many critics. But having a dislike for Daniel Craig's James Bond he had a lot to prove in my eyes. To explain my position I loved Sean Connery in the role, disliked Roger Moore and was very satisfied with Pierce Brosnan's performance as the suave assassin. Daniel Craig on the other hand does not come across as a cold killer neither does he uphold the suave intelligent nature of a Brosnan or Connery. He is clumsy and spent most of the movie missing people when firing his gun. There are many features to Craig's appearance that suggest he should not have been given this part. He looks tired, old and gaunt, he is too stocky to play the elegance of Bond, he walks in a clumsy non killer fashion and his one liners are terrible (maybe the way they are written or more the way he delivers a line). Well this movie, Skyfall is without a doubt Craig's best outing as Bond, Mendes tried is utmost to recreate a Connery feel to this latest outing, the DB5, the (attempted) light hearted comedy, the old characters. But something was still missing and I think that's Craig himself, he isn't James Bond, he will NEVER be James Bond in my opinion he is a terrible choice and he is dragging a franchise of this quality in this day and age where it should never go. The Skyfall story was hollow and lacked what Bond villains always yearn for i.e. world domination. A personal vendetta is a totally new one on me!! This is NOT a Bourne film this is meant to be James Bond he is meant to be the world's top assassin, license to kill, sleep with any women. Craig is portrayed as useless and unfortunately how much he tries he simply is useless in this part. Looking at the possibility of a further two outings for Craig with the Walther PPK could be detrimental to those who are die hard Bond fans, like myself. I don't want the Bond name to be poisoned as some blithering idiot, who is too useless to hit anything. This isn't Johnny English!!! But back to Skyfall, I liked the use of the music which was almost banished from his other two films (WHY?!?!? I have to say about that effort from the last two directors), the introduction of original characters (who I won't name for people who haven't seen the film) and I liked the change of M, into what looks to be a far better more dominant replacement bring back the days of Bernard Lee, which were the glory days of Bond. Was unsure on Q but he could grow on you, an older wiser Q may have been a better for the film, the story lost itself after the Railway/Court scene, no real gadgets at all...again. Skyfall is a completely different Bond movie than usual, but I'm not sure if it's for the better. Watching Daniel Craig makes me wonder why he is guaranteed 5 Bond films and Brosnan only received 4. He even now still looks younger than Craig does. This film is better, feels a bit more Bond like but it's still not really there. I just think Craig can't pull this one off and it's a shame because he is trying to get there. And one other thing this is NOT the 'best Bond film ever' whoever says these things hasn't obviously witnessed THE real James Bond (Sean Connery)... silly comments!!"
"yellowgixxer750","9","5","20","26 October 2012"," Best Bond film ever?
","Shockingly, because I don't actually think Daniel Craig is right for the role, yes. This is the best Bond film ever made.<br/><br/>I should probably qualify that. I believe that Daniel Craig brings an intensity and a simple nastiness to the character of Bond that is absolutely spot on. He doesn't milk the one liners, though they are there in abundance. He doesn't play for laughs or camp it up. He makes it very plain that, basically, James Bond is a killer. A sophisticated and disciplined killer, but a killer nonetheless. And that's important. The trouble is that he's just too damn' conspicuous. If Daniel Craig walked into a room you'd notice and you'd remember. And that's no good at all - you want anonymity for that job.<br/><br/>Back to the film. The plot is excellent, the script perfect and the acting generally very good indeed, as you might expect. Special effects are nicely done and strike a good balance. Not once did I sit back and scoff ""Well that's nonsense"" or something along those lines. Nor did I ever have certain knowledge of what was coming next. In fact there were more surprises than usual.<br/><br/>I'll be going to see it again. Maybe more than once. Because it really was that good. Certainly in my top few films ever made, and way ahead in the Bond stakes..."
"ladybampton","9","5","20","26 October 2012"," Not for Bond fans!
","I have never been a James Bond fan but as I had some free time on the first day of release took the opportunity to see this film and decide for myself before any critics ruined it for me. So I took my open mind and my partner to the cinema and what a treat we had in store. From the first scene I was hooked into the story. Judi Dench was fabulous as M, showing both steel & vulnerability and Daniel Craig gave a stellar performance as the flawed hero. There was plenty of eye candy for me and action for us both and I was impressed with the pace of the story and the quality of the dialogue. My only minor complaint was the amount of product placement in the first 15 minutes made me feel like I was still watching the pre-film adverts but I would definitely say this is a film for any action film fans, not just James Bond fanatics!"

","If you like to see a middle-aged reformed alcoholic man running and dodging bullets, bombs, petrol explosions and erm Dynamite, while grimacing, (does Craig have any more in his repertoire?) this movie is for you. Not to mention the awful wig worn by the central 'bad guy' whose character was seemingly based on an old Donald Sutherland role. Obviously the same hairdresser who styled Judi Dench's hair was employed. The Oedipus undertones are quite disturbing and the token white black woman even more so. Even by the Bond movie standard this has to be the nadir of film making. I am glad I didn't see it at a Multiplex or I would be demanding my money back. The worst of British."
"steveandollie","2","4","15","18 November 2012"," James Bond? More like James' boast, more like.
","This afternoon, me and my fine friend Steven went into town to watch Madagascar 3. Sadly due to a mixup at the cinema we ended up having to watch that bloody Skyfall film. We tried complaining to the manager but he was more upset that we had drilled a hole in the side of the building so we could see a film rather than buy a ticket. It's a good thing he didn't find the toilet hole or we'd really be for it.<br/><br/>I've got no idea why people are getting so excited over all this Bond rubbish. Apparently they've made four hundred films with him in it so apparently it's some sort of big deal. Basically old crust features Daniel Craig plays James Bond, some spoilt little boy who gets to go on holiday all the time, and his Mum is some scraggy old bonebag who literally lets him get away with murder. He's always being naughty and bullying the weaker boys, and his Mum doesn't even bat an eyelid as he strangles them or shoots them in the face or feeds them to a crocodile. It's disgraceful, what that bully needs a good clout, I tell you if I was his Dad I would take off my belt and whip his bare bottom until it was shredded with gore. I also would take the opportunity to squeeze his butt-cheeks as although he is a nuisance, Daniel Craig is a dishy hunk.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Bond's relationship with his mother and how he learns to respect her. At the start of the film their relationship is pushed to breaking point when he has yet another of his ridiculous, destructive tantrums. He gets all upset because some boy steals one of his Megadrive games and chases him across India, causing as he ploughs his Landrover through crowds of people and smashes up a train with a digger. Finally brings the hammer of discipline down and has him shot in the heart. A bit extreme you might think, when she could have got him on the naughty step or my buttock-based punishment, but luckily he falls in a river which washes the bullet out or something because in the next scene he's fine and partying with a scorpion.<br/><br/>Despite having his guts torn up with lead he still refuses to show any respect to his Mum, choosing to sardonically call her ""M"" or ""Marm"", rather than ""Mummy-wummy"" or ""Lovely mother"" like you're supposed to. M is even worse, coldly acknowledging him as ""007"". The fact she has to add the double zero makes me shudder to think how many kids she's actually had. We know a lady like that in town, her womb keeps plopping out on the street, it's disgusting.<br/><br/>But anyway, back to the story. I should probably warn you that this review contains SPOILERS, but if you really want to spoil yourself, you should watch Mr Bean's Holiday. It's a much better film. So yeah, after Bond is finished with being dead this other boy called Saliva turns up who is supposed to be Bond's brother or something, and he's really upset with ""M"" because a long time ago she lost him at the shops and he got tortured by a bunch of bad sailors. So he goes off in a sulk and spends all his pocket money on guns and soldiers so he can shoot his old Mum's bum off. We've all been there. First he tries to kill her with a big bomb, then with some bullets, and finally a helicopter full of bullets. James does his best to stop him by setting a series of home alone style traps around his house, horribly murdering all of Saliva's gang and then kills him with his handy pocket sword. It looks like Bond has saved the day, but sadly it turns out M has cut herself anyway and all her blood falls out. Bond cradles her bony old bits in his hands, his veneer cracks and he finally cries for his Mummy. Probably because he knew the money would dry up and he wouldn't be able to go to Disneyland Paris this year.<br/><br/>A lot of people criticised this film as Bond is starting to look a little old and tired. I totally agree, Daniel Craig is 44, far too old to be playing a cheeky little boy. So inevitably M has to be even older! Luckily they've got saggy old 128 year old Judy Dense from the Calendar Girls. I was terribly worried that she would forget what film she was in and try to take her clothes off again, but fortunately she didn't. That's the sign of a good director.<br/><br/>My main problem with the Bond franchise is that it's so unrealistic. Ordinary people can't do the things 007 does like shoot big guns or drive fast cars or have a girlfriend or anything so they find it hard to relate to it. I'd much prefer it if he just did things us regular folks, like make some marmite toast or visit his Nan. This overblown orgy of sex and violence is just showing off, and frankly I got sick of him rubbing our noses in his luxurious lifestyle. If I wanted that I'd go look at the posh people shopping in fancy establishments in Lidl or Aldi.<br/><br/>I do have to admit the film did rub off on us a little bit, leaving us a little bit jealous. We tried to get a raise in our weekly allowance from Dad so we could be more like Bond but no matter how much we pleaded, shouted or begged he wouldn't give in. In the end we gave up and put him back in his grave.<br/><br/>And because of that we have to go to court for some reason. That's why we're giving this film 2/10."
"kiktam","9","4","15","9 November 2012"," Why this movie is important, and a phenomenal James Bond Movie
","Reading many of the reviews by other reviewers, began to make me confused as to what people have come to expect from a Bond movie. Speaking for myself, the baseline has always been the action. As I became older, I found myself watching the Bond movies in a new light, becoming equally interested in the story lines and the character development. However, previous Bond movies had always left me wanting something more in how Bond is portrayed. Previous Bond films, even when attempting to show the emotional side of Bond, have always left the viewer feeling as an outsider looking in. The viewer merely watched Bond and his actions and took them for what they were, there was never any deeper understanding as to what and who Bond truly was. For this reason, I began reading the Fleming novels, and that missing piece of the puzzle was found. Skyfall accomplished this as well. The James Bond portrayed in Skyfall is the closest example to Fleming's character in which he put tireless detail over 50 years ago. For the first time I saw a true man, not a superman or a super secret agent. Daniel Craig bridged this gap and brought the written James Bond into the cinema. He understands Bond. In addition, this movie carries everything that one expects from a Bond movie. The action scenes are absolutely impressive. The story is solid. If you are a Bond fan that needs a bad guy with a finger on the nuclear detonator, you may disagree. This is a simple enemy, motivated by a simple reason and looking to accomplish a simple goal. This movie is the complete package, with tasteful nostalgia that I found spectacularly used (unlike Die Another Day)."

The only reason they are saying that is because they are too ignorant to figure things out on their own.<br/><br/>If you want to enjoy a Bond movie where 007 is not some Super-Spy-World-Is-At-An-End heroic figure, but instead is brought into play because the villain needs to die - this one is for you.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the gritty edge to this one and a plot that stays the course, with the usual mix of a few fantastic chase/fight scenes and some good twists to keep you sharp.

"Horst_In_Translation","8","3","10","6 January 2016"," Bond back to greatness
","Until a couple months ago, ""Skyfall"" was the newest entry to the famous 007 franchise. Then ""Spectre"" came, also begins with an ""S"", also 7 letters. Obviously, Academy-Award winning director (""American Beauty"") Sam Mendes and the people in charge of this film tried all they could to replicate the success of ""Skyfall"", yet they came somewhat short. I am not saying ""Spectre"" is a bad film, not at all, it is a good film like ""Quantum of Solace"", but both are clearly inferior to ""Skyfall"". I always think that one crucial indicator about how good a Bond film is is the memorability of the places. And there are many great places in here. The finale at Skyfall is pretty badass, but the real ending at the small church is just as good and even more significant. Then there is the place with the Komodo dragons, the replacement location for MI:6, the locations where Bond fights Patrice (on top of the train and in front of the luminous jellyfish) or even in the very cold water, almost at the end, a nice reference back to the intro sequence very early. All of these are great shots and one reason why this film is seen the way it is.<br/><br/>Then there is the characters. The introduction of Moneypenny, the introduction of Fiennes' character and what he turns out in the end, the scenes with Dench's character (oldest Bond girl in history and one of the most memorable) etc. The character development is something that was totally missing in the newest Bond film in my opinion, even when it comes to Bond himself, who has to find his strength again. And then there is Silva, of course. Javier Bardem does not appear until halfway into the film. His actions are there for the entire first half, but we do not see him until 70 minutes in. And the only bad thing really is that he did not appear earlier. He lifts this film again to an entirely new level in my opinion. Bond villains are always a bit gimmicky and he is at least as much fun to watch as Le Chiffre in the equally great ""Casino Royale"". The trick is to make them gimmicky, but still make them seem realistic and that is something that worked really nicely here. I wish I could say the same about Waltz in the newest film. Oh well, back to Silva: He has so many memorable scenes and actions in here I cannot name them all. The trademark blonde hair with the Hispanic background, the homosexuality, the fake teeth and I could go on and on. He really deserved the Oscar nomination. Really sucks to see he did not get it. He was probably very close. I also quite liked the way the character was introduced when we finally got to see him. The static camera and Silva approaching us and Bond, this was very tense and very smart. One of the finest shots from the film. Oh yeah and as you may have expected around the 90-minute mark, MI:6 really has a problem with keeping their prisoners. So many manage to flee in these films. They need to work on that.<br/><br/>Some other people working on this film, however, were more successful than Bardem and I quite like that. They won a tied vote with ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in Sound Editing (well-deserved as ""Skyfall"" is also great from a technical perspective) and Adele won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her excellent theme song. This was already the second time I watched ""Skyfall"". First time I saw it in theaters right when it came out back in 2012. This is certainly a film that makes an even bigger impact when you see it on a really big screen, but it's just such a wonderful example of quality filmmaking that it is also worth seeing on a small one. Now, critics will say as usual that this is not the old Bond in the traditional style and sense of the films and they may be right. But I personally love the new approach to Bond just as much. There are also many clever references back to the old days, for example the one about exploding pens etc. So this film also brings a lot of humour, mostly via smart and witty funny comments, such as Dench's character saying she will not turn her back on the woman who questions her or Bond's comment near the end that he had to take a short swim. A truly delightful movie. It runs for almost 2.5 hours (considerably longer than the previous entry) and does not drag at all. It's tense, it's entertaining, it's well-written and well-acted. Everything you could ask for in a film and I highly recommend the watch."

I am so sad that Dench's character will no longer be a part of JB franchise(but she will always remain in the top spot in JB series forever). Vintage car Aston Martin shown and the music together provided a nostalgia. The movie shows how Q,M and gadgets enters JB's life,even though no one claims past three movies as prequels we sure can understand it.

"dreamtakers","7","3","10","14 November 2012"," Gripping and Entertaining!
","I've heard mixed reviews from people prior to watching Skyfall. Hence, I entered the cinema without setting any high expectations. Boy, was I blown away by the outcome! (I watched the film twice).<br/><br/>Skyfall carries a darker and sullen theme compared to the past Bond movies. Here, Bond is depicted as a vulnerable, struggling CIA agent. He isn't deemed as fit anymore after suffering a serious injury (that costs him 4 ribs and some not so vital organs), yet he stubbornly tries to regain his ""licensed-to-kill"" character and proves his ability to everyone else. Bond's process in doing so is fascinating to watch as we get to connect with him emotionally. In Skyfall, it isn't all about flashy go-go gadgets. Bond is simply armed with a simple Walters and a radio. No exploding pens or whatsoever. Even the Bond ladies are just a sprinkled few. The show's focus is going ""back in time"". A more intimate side of Bond that we've never seen before in the past films – His family, childhood, birthplace- is revealed. Then there's the James Bond car, a silver Aston Martin DB5. Oh so classic and adorable.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig's portrayal as James Bond was excellent. He comes across as fierce and gritty yet surprisingly witty at times. He brings a lot of depth to his character as he not only appears strong, but also has a fragile and more 'human' side to him. (It really got to me when he shed tears). Judi Dench was amazing. It's refreshing that her relationship with Bond is pivotal in this film. The main highlight in this movie would be Javier Bardem. His portrayal as the campy villain Silva is played with perfection. Silva is a slick, notorious, maniacal individual whose life goal is to seek vengeance against his former employer. He exuberates insanity, yet there is also a comical side of him which I deeply enjoy. Ben Whishaw as the new Q brings some hilarity into the movie. Who knew Q would be so technologically competent yet old-fashioned at the same time? Ralph Fiennes, best known as HP's Voldemort, is likable as the tough agency boss, Gareth Mallory. However, the movie is not entirely smooth-sailing. There are a few bits that are questionable; however, one can easily overlook them. The Bond girls are dispensable – Naomi Harris is decent. Her character has an easygoing and solid friendship going with Mr Bond but did not develop into something deeper. Berenice Marlohe is incredibly alluring but....she died way too soon.<br/><br/>Skyfall is the best Bond movie for me, hands down, and Daniel Craig is now officially my favorite Bond. The action scenes are terrific,the cinematography is stunning and the plot and characters are immensely engaging. If you are into high-tech Bond gadgets and perhaps more Bond girls scenes, this movie may not be your cup of tea."
"MovieNewsAndUpdates","7","3","10","11 November 2012"," Skyfall -Very Good!! As a Bond Film?? - Let me think
","Lets start of with the very important fact which according to me is the deciding factor why people loved this movie or rejected it outrightly, which is the story not being written by Ian Fleming and yes it becomes very evident when you watch this film. The film is not based on the novel creating that inability to differentiate between the Bond legacy and other espionage based series like Mission Impossible or Bourne series and that is where i am unable to find that soul of Bond( which for me is very crucial). The movie starts of huge and goes well humongous till the interval. However, it is after that when i felt the entire scale of presentation just dropped down to ""just another spy movie"" There are movie lovers, me and Bond fans who are appreciating the new presentation of Bond as more of a ruthless killer than a handsome guy with expensive gadgets, who in the recent episodes have neither of them. Everyone will certainly accept it (the box office opening of Skyfall and current IMDb rating have made it evident) To come to the finer aspects of film, this one also opens with a very promising chase scene like its previous two parts. However, my favorite yet remains from the first one, Casino Royale, because of more realistic feel because of free running. Yes, Daniel Craig justifies the role of James Bond and Judi Dench who probably has the most screen time in this part (if i am not wrong) delivers a great performance. Javier Bardem as Silva is really good considering his character design and appears scarily strong. The story has decent action and fair amount of twists. My favorite piece in the film is the first conversation between Bond and Silva. And an extra point for the locations chosen for the film.<br/><br/>So if i have to rate this movie as a stand alone spy film, i would give it a 9 on 10. But since its a part of Bond legacy and yet a part of it was promising i have rated it accordingly."

","SPOILER WARNING!! Ready realized now that Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace was the best Bond films, especially the Casino Royale. In Skyfall Bond is almost in retirement. The movie even starts well but loses interest and becomes sluggish in half an hour, too much politics involved in the British secret services. The Bond into Bourne mode of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace disappears ... Bond enters cure hangovers in poor shape mode. The Bond-Girl is only good for sex in the shower and to take the Bond villain's lair which is a desert island (nothing ever has been seen repeatedly in the Bond Sean Connery 60s) Adrenaline movie summarizes the initial chase and the capture of villain're equal to the Dark Knight's Christopher Nolan. This villain that although well played by Javier Bardem think it was needless to show your feminine side shall we say, a bit more even changed the decor of the house of Bond, or his wardrobe. A Bond villain has to want more than just a personal vendetta against the chief of the British secret service has to be really cold, calculating and capable of atrocities. In a good Bond movie he needs to be taken out of the comfort zone, his normal environment and be placed in another country or continent, to be put in extreme situations where he has to make tough decisions and use all his skills and training. Anyway I hope the next one is better."

Though the one- liners were sure to crack everyone up. But the lack of charisma that Craig is known for and a poor script (talking 'bout the climax sequences here) were some of the biggest flaws i the movies. Javier Bardeem should have got more screen time, he was definitely flawless. But the image of doing unexpected things that was created for the antagonist wasn't carried to the end which led to more disappointment. The last fifteen to twenty minutes or so didn't live up-to the expectation that was promised in the first half! And for the Bond fans the Aston Martin DB5 makes a comeback. ;)"

","Before I say anything, there are some minor spoilers here...<br/><br/>Right, Skyfall. Bond movies are rarely compared with other spy movies, like Bourne or Tinker Tailor. If we're honest, we compare them with other Bond movies - because Bond is the longest running movie franchise of all time and there's nothing else quite like it. Skyfall, thankfully, is one of Bond's finer moments. Fittingly for his fiftieth anniversary, this film felt like a celebration of the character. He wasn't upstaged by the cars, the women or the villain (though the villain was a cut above the rest...). This was a BOND movie in every way.<br/><br/>I was curious to see whether director Sam Mendes' claims that he had taken inspiration from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy were in any way noticeable. And I have to say in my opinion, there was a Nolan-esq feel in parts. Silva, for example, had a very subtle Joker-y nature which made him one of the best and most memorable Bond villains of recent... well, decades. Though the film was clearly a sequel, there were familiar elements that smacked more of a re-imagining for the 21st Century - namely the new Quartermaster and Miss Moneypenny.<br/><br/>The film itself isn't perfect. I'd heard not a bad word said about Skyfall before I saw it, but I have to admit up until two thirds of the way through the film, I couldn't help but wonder what all the fuss was about. Not that it was in any way awful. It just didn't WOW me like I'd expected.<br/><br/>That is until the final act. Bravely set entirely in Britain, the last third of the film was thoroughly entertaining with it's back-to-basics approach and tense build-up. It turned the film completely on it's head - from a mildly enjoyable Bond film to a deeply engrossing thriller. It also broke the mould and left us all psyched up for the next one - kind of like Batman Begins...<br/><br/>A fantastic return to form and one of the few must sees of 2012."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","7","3","10","27 October 2012"," Where you go I go, what you see I see
","After the abortion that was Quantum of Solace, Skyfall is the only Bond to retain the same actor after a four year long gap, and is the representation of the 50th anniversary of MGM's flagship franchise. Does Skyfall deliver, or does Adele let it crumble? It has a LOT (and I mean a helluva lot) to make up for, and I feel that critics fawned over it a bit too much, probably just ecstatic that it wasn't Quantum of Soulless. I enjoyed some of Skyfall, but overall I felt deflated and occasionally a bit bored. There's more subtext here than usual, but the plot is full of holes and it weighs down the action too much.<br/><br/>After a list of undercover agents is stolen (it is never explained how as the movie jumps in after the story has already started) Bond goes off in pursuit of the culprit and is accidentally gunned down by his colleague during a scrap aboard a train moving over a massive viaduct. M believes him dead and is due to be hauled over the coals for analogue incompetence in a digital age. But Bond knows he lives twice and guesses he'll die another day. He's broken and beaten-down, though he insists he's good enough for another shot at catching the baddie.<br/><br/>And so enters Javier Bardem as Silva, a charismatic ex-agent (it's never made clear if he was a double-oh) who lives for revenge. He IS a great villain and is wonderful to watch, bringing an unusual amount of sadness and empathy to the role. He wants to get back at M for selling him out some years previous, and as Bond does everything in his power to protect her they come across as siblings fighting for mother's attention and approval. It gives the film an emotional heart that Bond doesn't usually have.<br/><br/>I feel that this is undone by such ludicrous development and bad scripting as Silva goes about executing a years-in-development plan that relies on way too much contrivance. Where on Earth does Silva get his endless supply of goons? Does he put an ad in the paper? Wanted: Henchman for revenge plot. Must be willing to dress the part (no uniform provided) and die for me. Meets national minimum wage. You can have a gun if you want.<br/><br/>And, for that matter, where does he get his supplies, equipment, helicopters? For a man living as a ghost he sure is connected. Yes, I know I am pedantically picking apart an action movie plot, but Skyfall promotes itself as more serious and a return to form. The aforementioned complaints feel like leftover elements from the Bronson era, and I do feel like it is high time to fire Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. With this fresh start they should have brought in stronger writers, or perhaps just employ a single writer for consistency.<br/><br/>Bérénice Marlohe and Naomi Harris pop in as the Bond girls but neither are really given anything to do, the former having about 10 lines of dialogue. And with the franchise adapting to modern sensibilities it feels a bit corny having Bond jump into bed (or in this case shower) with a girl he met five minutes earlier. He's a bit too detached from them for their presence to have any impact on the plot.<br/><br/>There are many attempts to give this entry a better continuity with previous movies, and while I really like this, it feels a little (just a little) fanboy-ish. Am I the only one who thinks that the Aston Martin (in all of it's lovely gray-ishness) is an ugly-as-sin automobile? Or that the Walther PPK is a wimpy-as-hell gun? I've seen potato guns that look more intimidating. Also, the film explores Bond's roots and history more so then ever before, but the big revelation about M's past that has been teased in the pre-release hype is thoroughly non-existent. Judi Dench does get a lot more to do this time around and really does become the emotional core of the Oedipal fracas between Bond and Silva.<br/><br/>Roger Deakin shoots the entire film in Redcode RAW and it looks L-O-V-E-L-Y. Every scene has its own unique aesthetic and atmospheric production design. Really, really good work there. All done digitally, obviously, and while it's gorgeous for this 50th anniversary adventure, I hope it doesn't become standard practice. 35mm may be the past, but I hope it sticks around for the future.<br/><br/>David Arnold is gone. In his place is Thomas Newman, who unfortunately scores the film with no decent melodies and rarely even uses the Bond theme or even the melody from the title song. How I miss John Barry. There is a fare amount of globe-trotting, including Turkey, China, Macau, and the Scottish highlands. However, too much of this cuts back to mundane London. Stuart Baird (having seemingly abandoned his career as a director) cuts it altogether expertly, but he can't add excitement to scenes that have been written so flatly.<br/><br/>I've always felt that Bond movies are defined by the second unit and stunt co-ordination. With the action reserved for short bursts in Skyfall it allows Sam Mendes a chance to put his own stamp on the film. This is both good and bad. Turning a Bond in a character study is a bold chance to take, but they should have turned up the action more. I like gritty, realistic stunts and choreography, but Bond isn't really the franchise for it. There is a sweet spot in-between invisible cars and fist-fighting and I am not sure that Skyfall has found it.<br/><br/>It's not the darkest or angriest Bond adventure (that honor goes to Licence to Kill), but it sure is most atmospheric and downbeat. Let's hope that next time around they deliver more spectacle and excitement."
"p-stepien","6","3","10","29 October 2012"," Tying in the past
","After half a century of secret servicing, James Bond (the awkward, but unequivocally manly Daniel Craig) and MI6 comes against their greatest threat: one of their own with a personal vendetta against M (Judi Dench), the mother hen of the British undercover network. During a Turkish mission a disk with all data regarding Arab world based secret agents gets stolen by a specialist hired hand. During the ensuing chase M makes a gut call, which ends with Bond being shot and presumed dead. With the data lost and the best agent gone, M now has to confront public tirades questioning her competence and suggesting her resignation from office. The full extent of the threat caused by the data loss only becomes apparent, when a cyberterrorist hacks into the MI6 HQ causing a gas explosion, killing many and having M watch the debris. This occurrence however brings back James Bond, an undying patriot, who holed up in a seaside resort, syphoning whiskey, while daring scorpions, was enjoying his post mortem retirement. Meanwhile former agent Silva (Javier Bardem) construes his bloody vengeance with little regard to lives lost...<br/><br/>Honouring the 50 years of James Bond cinema frenzy comes an honest attempt at arguably the most cranially enjoying outing, which also does its utmost to homage the past Bond movies through witty commentary about the passing of time, introducing a modern era Q (Ben Whishaw) ridiculing shooting pens or simply knocking us back to memory lane by borrowing shots, scenes and gimmicks from past outings of the series. Within this happen questions about time, its relevance and a world best suited for the young, but not abandoned by the old, who search their own place in the new reality. Not entirely subtle in its approach, this ""No Country for Old Men"" counterargument falls rather flat, even at times bordering on hammy. Much further the enjoyment caused by the riveting attempt to close an era, complete a circle, which brings the first Bond instalments back into the frame and thus hitting home how great a legacy this series has left.<br/><br/>Led by a stellar cast with Dench and Bardem especially excelling, the latter delivering another memorable bad guy persona, but one so strikingly different than Anton Chigurh, one enticingly menacing, but simultaneously infantile.<br/><br/>Comparisons have been rife with the Nolan Batman series. And whereas ""Skyfall"" is vastly superior to the misguided gibberish of ""The Dark Knight Rises"", it fails to reach the level ""The Dark Knight"", but at the same time has a worrying tendency to follow too closely the latter's plot line. Just as the Joker allows himself to be captured to forward his grand plan, similarly such is the situation with Silva. The characters of Silva and Joker differ markedly, but unfortunately they overall actions, accompanying goons and certain plot solutions waste away ingenuity implanted elsewhere the Skyfall movie, making it overly repetitive. The plot itself makes little sense, becoming more crude glue interconnecting story lines, dramatic interaction (much more pronounced than in any other Bond movie), chase sequences and big blasts. As the underlying motive behind Silva becomes unhinged with the wanton destruction caused by his actions, the sensibility of his character dissipates, leaving viewers to focus on the drama and the action.<br/><br/>Hence despite enjoying the experience the excitement is short-lived, when grey cells reboot and start decoding the senseless story, filled with admittedly riveting sequences and drama."

","OK, no detailed plot dissection here. Yes of course there are holes, but sit back and drink it in.<br/><br/>It is a proper Bond movie, it has the visuals, it has the action and it does have the girls, but all in a post Casino Royale style.<br/><br/>Strong storyline and three dimensional characters. Javier Bardem's Silva is very close to being a 'classic' Bond Villain, if only the scriptwriters had thought a little bigger.<br/><br/>And there it is. For those of us brought up on Bond in the 60's and 70's, the current fashion of 'grittier, more realistic, Bourne-esque' films will never completely satisfy us.<br/><br/>Bond lost it's way really from the later Moore films ( though I personally think the two Dalton's are criminally underrated), but I still don't quite understand why the gadgets and volcano- dwelling villains with their eyes in World domination have been discarded.<br/><br/>Bardem's portrayal of Silva is excellent; twisted, super intelligent and ruthless, but seemingly all he wants is a spot of personal revenge. Fine, but being the instigator of World War 3 is surely a little more exciting?<br/><br/>Christopher Nolan made the perfect modern Bond movie with 'The Dark Knight Rises' and I for one would love to see him get a crack at a Bond sometime soon.<br/><br/>But I digress. Skyfall is streets ahead of Quantum of Solace, probably not as good as Casino Royale, but is a decent addition to the modern era franchise. Well worth seeing."
"can_erik","10","5","21","3 November 2012"," Back to Old Times
","This is my first review. I watched Skyfall in yesterday and here I go:<br/><br/>Bond has always been an amazing character for me and I like every movie since Tomorrow Never Dies. Thus, I can criticize Skyfall considering the movies starting from Tomorrow Never Dies.<br/><br/>As a Turkish, I was excited about the opening sequence because it takes place in İstanbul, Adana and Fethiye which are among the most beautiful cities in Turkey. After the movie Taken 2 that was incredibly bad about reflecting İstanbul, Skyfall makes me feel good. If you watch the press conference that was held in İstanbul on IMDb, you can see that Sam Mendes understand the ambiance in İstanbul and he knows what to reflect and how to reflect.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem's performance was outstanding. The whole movie changes after his first appearance. The only thing I should criticize is the prosthesis he uses. Actually, the visual effect that is used in the prosthesis scene. When you watch the close-up scene where Silva puts his prosthesis back you can see that the prosthesis disappears through his cheek. It could have done better.<br/><br/>In this movie you see the battle between the old and the new practices. M and Bond present the old generation and Silva (Bardem) presents the new internet-age. When it is the case, Bond and M go back to basics and make this movie a masterpiece. I agree with the general opinion that states Skyfall is one of the best Bond movies and Daniel Craig is one of the best Bond actors. Finally, we will miss Judi Dench, however, Ralph Fiennes will rock you in the upcoming 007 movies."

","Reviews are written to make people watch or not. In this case i m writing the review not in favor but i want everyone one to watch the movie and give there own opinion, cause what i saw in cinema, called ""Skyfall"" and what i see in the rating, hype, and reviews of ""Skyfall"" doesn't make sense to me at all.<br/><br/>I would have given it 6/10 if it would have released not as a bond franchise movie, some thing else like, ""From London with love"" or ""Tears for my guilty mother"" etc. But this is ""SkyFall"" the latest Bond movie, made with a budget of 200 million dollars. What we expect from a bond movie, from my prospective as a movie lover not as a critic is, fascinating(Originality, Glamour, Adrenaline).<br/><br/>Originality, Bond is a fictional character. 23 movies are made on it. The Skayfall team has destroyed its(Bond) originality and got themselves lost some where as well. Booby traps and lonely guy thing is for Bourne franchise, teaming up with the hand free on a mission is for Mission Impossible, no one likes u and u r still saving your country is for Die Hard.<br/><br/>Glamour & Adrenaline, as i said its a FICTIONAL character, u(director/writer) haven given a lot of freedom by the creator(Ian Fleming) than why u have taken all the bling bling stuff from Mr. Bond, one pistol and 1"" radio(i think i have covered all the items of the world's finest secret agent). Tubes, trains and an icy puddle that's we have got in 143 mins, i think this is not what Mr. Bond 007 is famous for. Couldn't understand ""Skyfall"" the movie vs ""Skyfall"" over rating & hype."
"juanxto","3","6","28","4 February 2013"," Not a Bond movie
","I was very excited with this new release of Bond's adventures as I had read a lot of very good critics in the internet about it. But after seeing the movie, I feel as if I had been taken to another kind of spies movie, not an actual Bond one.<br/><br/>First of all, there is a lack of all the well known ingredients a good Bond movie must have. I mean: no good car (old one instead), no amazing gadgets, no bond girl (I'm sorry, but I could not even feel a bit of sorry when she doesn't appear anymore as I had just met her 10 minutes ago), no evil villain who wants to control the World (just kind of an homosexual one who just wants to kill an old lady) and, of course, no James Bond at all (the guy looks old, tired and a step behind an enemy whose more remarkable power just seems to be computing).<br/><br/>To summarize, it's totally disappointing. It's a pity because I really liked the last two films (CR and QoS) as there was this kind of hidden organization which felt as a real threat for the world and I expected that plot would come to an end with this movie. Moreover, I enjoyed the new Bond, so though, professional and realistic compared to the older ones... A missed chance to have finished a Bond era with an spectacular end movie."
"Theo Robertson","9","10","55","2 November 2012"," Technical Aspects Means It's An Oscar Contender
","You know to expect with a Bond film - girls , gadgets , stunts and excitement in a story that is pure escapism . In other words they're enjoyable rubbish . The formula changed somewhat with the arrival of Daniel Craig in CASINO ROYALE where the story is much more character driven . QUANTUM OF SOLCACE was a slight step backwards but upon hearing Oscar winning director Sam Mendes was going to direct the latest film in the Bond franchise SKYFALL it was going to be the Bond film people either love or hate. After just seeing it I can say it's a film I absolutely loved <br/><br/>One should admire the courage of the producers in making a Bond film that while on the surface follows the formula of the franchise is a quantum leap away from what the audience is used to . Bond is now a vulnerable complex character who has self doubt and the characters around him exist in the real universe . Gareth Mallory is a former SAS soldier and a reference is made to his time in Northern Ireland . Q isn't a wizard who can conjure invisible cars out of thin air , he's a computer nerd and his armoury is limited to guns and tracking devices and much of the plot revolves around Bond's boss M . In other words this is the most realistic Bond movie <br/><br/>But it's the technical aspects that probably sets SKYFALL apart from the rest of the series . Roger Daeakins the cinematographer has been Oscar nominated eight times without success and he's made the most visually striking Bond movie . A sequence in Shanghai where Bond follows an assassin in to an office block where the action takes place in front of advertising screens has a hypnotic beauty rarely seen in cinema never mind a Bond movie . Likewise the editing which is handled by Stuart Baird is very impressive and is a million miles away from QUANTUM OF SOLACE which ruined that movie for a lot of people . I expect both Deakins and Baird to be at least Oscar nominated for their efforts with a few other nominations for the technical crew . This is the best Bond film from a technical viewpoint <br/><br/>Some things don't work work however . The plotting has upset a few people and as has been mentioned some of the storyline seems to be forgotten about like the abrupt disappearance of Bond after the the opening sequence . There's also few other irritating plot holes like this and it's never a good sign that a film has several screenwriters . One bone of contention is that much of the story takes place in mundane locations such as London and Scotland . One does wonder if it's a film that will appeal to a British audience rather than an American/international one ? One point that will spilt audiences is how low key the villain's aim is <br/><br/>If there's one disappointment for me it's Javier Bardem as the baddie . It;s often been said that good actors make for unimpressive Bond villains and Bardem does ironically chew up the scenery as Silva who seems to be the MI6 version of Hannibal Lector . There also seems to be a homosexual subtext to the character that remains unexplored . One also can't help noticing Kincaid , Bond's childhood gamekeeper, should have seen Brian Cox cast instead of Albert Finney <br/><br/>But all in all SKYFALL has been one of the most entertaining nights out at the cinema I've had in a long time . Some people will no doubt hate what the producers have done but I'm glad to see a character driven Bond film based in the real world . As I said it's a film of technical hypnotic almost poetic beauty and I expect it to pick up a few Oscar nominations. If Roger Deakins doesn't win an Oscar for this the next Bond film will need a plot involving a baddie letting off a nuclear device on Oscar night"

The disappointing, horrible, and cottage cheese-like James Bond movie that is Quantum of Solace was a terrible sequel to the fantastic Casino Royale. You would think after that disgrace of a movie Daniel Craig might be finished as playing the amazing spy right? WRONG. Skyfall has everything that a classic Bond movie needs while at the same time being like no other. This movie has swag. There are so many things going for this movie. This is the third Bond installment with Daniel Craig at the helm and this was also his best performance as Bond yet. Sean Connery ""was"" my favorite actor who played James Bond, but after seeing Skyfall I think Daniel Craig is the best. He's that good. Also Javier Bardem (No Country For Old Men) is this villain with a weird blonde wig and he is really good in this as well. The plot is hard to explain. After being injured in a mission, Bond must try to get back into the swing of things while an enemy from M's past comes back to haunt her. This puts 007 in a position where he needs to protect M and must try to defeat this villain whose always one step ahead. What is ""Skyfall""? That is a secret you will find out after seeing this great movie. This is the first Bond movie directed by an Oscar winning director, Sam Mendes (American Beauty). This is also the best ""shot"" Bond movie ever made. Cinematography- just ""wow"". If you paused it at any moment in the movie and took a screen-shot it would be a good picture.

","We must forgive a few plot unlikelihoods, inconsistencies and not very well explained developments for the sake of the greatness of the visual features and aspects of this movie. The action scenes are fabulous and terrific, the camera movements, the cut and the images framing are excellent and the special and miniature effects overwhelming. Last but not least we have the splendid performance of a luxurious cast composed beside Daniel Craig as James Bond, by such great performers like Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes, Javier Bardem and even the old veteran Albert Finney in a small part in the end. The story is about the theft by a terrorist group led by and ex-agent of MI6 of a computer drive with the identities of other agents and that must be retrieved by 007 at all costs since some of them are anonymously infiltrated in terrorist networks. The action is constant and takes place from Istanbul to the Scotttish Highlands passing through London, Shanghai and Macao. The chases are overpowering indeed. The movie opens with perhaps the most fantastic and fabulous chase I have ever seen on a movie including cars, motorcycles and even a train running in tunnels from time to time. And the plot has even (which is rare in this kind of movies) some moving personal sentimental aspects mainly in the last scenes."
"dbogosian-1","9","3","11","24 November 2012"," A real classic Bond film
","I say ""classic"" in two senses. First, because I believe all future Bond movies will be compared to this one; second, because this is the first Bond movie (to my knowledge) that doesn't rely on gimmicky sci-fi plot twists, or completely unbelievable gadgets or technological breakthroughs that allow the villain to control the world.<br/><br/>I also say ""real"" because nearly everything about this movie is very realistic and plausible. You don't ever feel like you are in a make-believe world. There are a few points at which the viewer's credulity is tested (mainly the computers), but for most of the movie, things look and feel completely plausible.<br/><br/>Skyfall has essentially redefined the genre while remaining true to the essential character of the brand. We still have the suave, polished Mr. Bond, but he's now aging, not quite as sure of himself (and thus very real). The villain, perhaps the creepiest ever, is simply a twisted wreck of a human, but still clearly human. All the stock features are there, including a phenomenal opening credits in the standard psychedelic mood but very creatively handled, and with a great song by a top current singer (Adele).<br/><br/>Casting is excellent, and Daniel Craig has already established himself as the best Bond of all time. Bardem in the villain's role is phenomenal, Dench is the best M ever, and while the youthful Q is a bit sophomoric, he does add a nice contrast to the now middle-aged Bond. The introduction of Ralph Fiennes is very good, he fits his role and the entire Bond milieu perfectly.<br/><br/>The plot is straightforward, the tension palpable, and the conclusion has some surprises. Bond is seen to be human and vulnerable, yet still an incredible killing machine. Absolute must see for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the Bond franchise."

So I was like what heck let's trust the IMDb netizens and check this movie out. I gotta say, I'm impressed. I think Sam Mendes did a superb job on it. It's pretty resembles the Bond I remember. Not just packed the show with actions and explosions but a lot of witty conversation, classy scenes, and the usual classic backdrop and Bond's music. And I thought the plot itself is great too. It digs inside MI6 and Bond's personal life as the movie goes and give us a better understanding of everything. On top of that, I love the work on the cinematography too. I can feel like a lot of effort was put into obtaining beautiful and classy scenery and background. I'm no expert on all this kind of stuff but that's just how I feel when I see the movie.

Sure, I can tell you about S-sssean Connery, I can hum the theme, I can recognize an Aston Martin and a shaken martini, but I actually haven't seen many of the films. Heck I was born recognizing Pierce Brosnan as the definitive James Bond look, playing Nightfire in junior school. To be honest, I've only seen Quantum of Solace and hated it. <br/><br/>Skyfall has made me a believer. For all its necessities: guns, cars, girls and chases, Skyfall is more. Skyfall is smart.<br/><br/>Skyfall tells a sharp, straightforward story that blends elements exquisitely, with a brilliantly flowing opening chase that transfers to scenes of dialogue and plot development, then back to action... the mix is smooth, with cause and effect, drama to action. There is also some comedy laced in, akin to Nolan's Batman series, clearly an influence on this film. Skyfall has many memorable scenes, my favourite being the hotel in Shanghai. The action is always creative, the fights mesmerizing. I'm sure I'll see- if not try- the iconic subway slide one of these nights.<br/><br/>The cinematography is brilliant, distractingly so. Clever and effective, you will be amazed at how the film is shot and how colour is used- I'll nod to Shanghai again.<br/><br/>The acting is really something for such a blockbuster. Craig brings a very human Bond, who surprises you more than once. Skyfall looks into the past of James Bond- how does someone become a secret agent? I haven't seen Casino Royale, but after the horrible Quantum he now looks incredibly comfortable in the role. The 'style check' train jump at the beginning and throwback ride show this.<br/><br/>Judi Dench sees lots of screen time in her 7th appearance as M, this time as a pivotal plot point, more than just mission control. She never lets her guard down, always with a look of bulldog ferocity. This cuts screen time from the Bond girls, but that's because, I have to give credit to IGN here, that M is the Bond girl of Skyfall.<br/><br/>After his incredible turn as Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men, it would'v e been easy to see Javier Bardem as a vengeance-seeking ex- agent. But that's not what happened, far from it. I think Bardem's Silva will catch everyone in the theatre off-guard, in at least one way. His introductory scene is incredible, his speech chilling. His character is unsettling, his appearance ghastly, but inside he's smart, and it's his mind that really holds his menace. He's a justified villain and a very worthy opponent. <br/><br/>Thematically, Skyfall smartly chooses to acknowledge technology. The film deals with the irrelevance of humans in conflict, and the prevalence of computers. The old in society being displaced by the young, the technologically- minded. The topic is interesting on its own, but in context it's brilliant. James Bond is a 50 year tradition, now forced to change with the world. Skyfall is the start of a new Bond era.<br/><br/>If nothing else, Skyfall is an engaging and satisfying film. But it's more than that, it speaks about our changing society, examines relationships usually forgotten in Bond films, and features incredible actors and technical work. So it's really more than a Bond film, it's a modern landmark. 8.5/10"

","""Skyfall"", directed by the Oscar–winning Sam Mendes, is the twenty third James Bond film. It's a series that celebrates fifty years of motion picture history, its origins stretch back to the early nineteen-fifties when former spy Ian Fleming penned the first of fourteen Bond novels, ""Casino Royale"". When it was revealed in 1961 that President John F. Kennedy was a huge fan of the novel ""From Russia with Love"", 007 became an international success that spawned in the following year the first in the phenomenally popular adaptations for the silver screen: ""Dr. No"".<br/><br/>""Skyfall"", in many ways, has more in common with these earlier films than the later ones: the Aston Martin DB5 is back (as used in ""Goldfinger"" [1964]) as well as the ice cool style of Bond himself.<br/><br/>As Bond, Daniel Craig is terrific: debonair, yet tough enough to be believable when he abandons a dying field agent. His performances in ""Casino Royale"" (2007) and ""Quantum of Solace"" (2009) are built upon to deliver a complex character and not a geriatric punster that Roger Moore was close to creating in his later outings. He brings depth and a steely emotionalism to the role.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem as the villain is perhaps the best in years, giving us a complex creation that has a goal so much more interesting than the resolutely generic world domination plans of so many Bond adversaries. The Oscar-winning actor is superb here, his intense performance destined to be regarded as a classic.<br/><br/>Judi Dench, another Oscar winner, gives her finest portrayal of ""M""; her prominence and well-written dialogue ensure that she is the real ""Bond-girl"".<br/><br/>Others, such as Ben Whishaw, Bérénice Marlohe and Ralph Fiennes are all excellent, making this the finest all-round acted James Bond film ever.<br/><br/>However, pride of place for kudos is the Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes who has brought to life a top-flight thriller first and foremost, never overplaying his action scenes. In that respect, one might wonder if Mendes is harking back to the ""New Hollywood"" movement of the seventies as well as older, classic Bonds. He is suitably aided by nine time Oscar nominee Roger Deakins doing the cinematography that really gives an assured feel to all of the film's locations, making you feel the cold, wet damp of Scotland, the grey November of London and the gaudy modern cities of Asia.<br/><br/>Why this James Bond film is so good is because Mendes has realised that this needs to be a good thriller in the first place, one that works on its own as well as a continuation of the diverse adventures of 007, licensed to kill."
"tyweasel","9","3","11","17 November 2012"," Great for a Bond lover, Good for everyone else
","In my opinion this is by far the best of the Daniel Craig Bond Films. Without spoiling the film, it gives some hints of back-story for Bond before he joined MI6. The film was shock full of references to old bond films, and I believe that that is what made it great. However, I loved it because I loved those older films. It is a good movie on its own, but to really enjoy this movie you should have seen Bond films to truly appreciate all the references. The themes of the movie were very different then most other bond films, but the villain was one of the best in the recent films. This is a must see for any Bond lover, but if you haven't watched the other films first you miss out. I gave it a 9/10 for a Bond lover and 7.5-8/10 for someone who hasn't seen the previous films."
"Eaglegrafix","8","3","11","17 November 2012"," Best of the Craig Bond Films
","Daniel Craig is without question in this reviewers opinion a great actor. The roles he has played as James Bond are not his greatest work and the reason can be the the stories and the Bond character are not demanding enough to pull the best out of Craig. Bond has had a formula that must be followed or he fails at being bond. His vodka martinis, his trysts with and treatment of ""girls"" or beautiful women requires little talent. In fact requires little less than to look, walk and talk in a suave and sexy way. But that's our James Bond so those who play Bond are judged not by their overall acting ability but by the way they play the role to our satisfaction. So we develop the fan clubs for Connery and Moore and even Brosnan for those that managed to play the role for at least three times.<br/><br/>Craig, in Skyfall does his most credible job as Bond and show his overall acting ability to a greater degree, making this film one where Bond is a bit deeper than most others. I can say that the Craig section of the Bond films did release us from the obligatory monster sets and monster king pin ""Dr Evil"" kind of villains. No kitty cats to pet and no sharks to feed and that is a relief because then the story has to rely on other things to entertain the audience.<br/><br/>Skyfall does take the audience to other spots in the world but the focus of the story is London and Great Britain. Is this good? Perhaps but London herself is no a very sexy city to use as a backdrop or even as a main stage. In spite of many great individual buildings with interesting architecture, it does not have that overall sense of intrigue or sexiness. Perhaps it is simply not different enough for most of us. But the story is an English story this time and the villain targets London for his nastiness.<br/><br/>The villain is the number one best villain as far as character is concerned. Javier Bardem, the super evil killer tank that could not be stopped in No Country for Old Men, the one that had ice cold freon running in his veins has has been out done by Bardem in the role of Silva. So totally ruthless without a drip of conscience for the evil he plans and carries out you are amazed at how much of a connection you make with him. Just as the quote from Goldfinger has become almost universally known James Bond asks ""Do you expect me to talk"" Goldfinger replies ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die."" The quote from Skyfall will be Bond:""(dodging an explosion) Was that for me?"" and Silva's reply with a laugh is: ""No, but that is"". If you've seen the film you know what the scene is. If not, you'll still be just as surprised.<br/><br/>Special Effects are not the star in this film as much as the often have been but the stunts still reign supreme. Bond can still do things and survive things that would kill the ordinary man in fit condition. But that is why we like him. He is virtually indestructible. In Skyfall however, his mortality is shown more than any other Bond film to date. This seems to make him even more of a hero. He suffers and yet does not fall, well that's not exactly accurate.<br/><br/>All said, Bond is more human, more sensitive and less a chauvinistic brute wrapped in suave dressing. He is more one of us and for that all the more amazing what he accomplishes without super powers, super gimmicks and super effects. It is a pleasant relief that after 50 years in the field, Bond can still carry the flag."
"onumbersix","8","3","11","17 November 2012"," I have reluctantly become a Bond fan
","I have never been a great fan of James Bond, our favourite movie psychopath for 50 years now. The one and only Bond movie that drew me to the theatre was Diamonds are forever, in 1971. I went not so much for Connery's Bond with his smug attitude, but his Bond girl, Jill St-John, who was my secret love at the time and even more so, when I found myself sitting in front of her on the Expo-Express at Expo 67, in Montréal. For sure over the years I saw bits and pieces of Bond movies on late night television, but that is pretty much the extent of my experience. So why did I go to the cinema this time? Well, because of Daniel Craig this actor who continues to impress, notably in the Millennium remake. Add to that, the almost unanimous reviews stating that it is a good Bond movie, maybe the best to date. So, it did not appear to me that I was going to sit through a bomb. Is it as good as they say? Affirmative. It's 2 and half hours of continuous action, of intelligent dialogue and nice kudos to the past 50 years of the series. The return of the classic DB5 is a good example. The Bond franchise was getting long in the tooth for at least a decade, if not more. Skyfall marks a sharp departure with the past and bodes well for the future."
"mrshev","7","3","11","15 November 2012"," Very good Bond film.
","(As everyone knows, it's a Bond film, so you do have to suspend a certain amount of disbelief - that should be an automatic tick-box on entry to the cinema.)<br/><br/>Skyfall starts like a typical Bond, right in the heart of the action: chase scene, pretty girl and a glamorous location. It's beautifully choreographed and shot and gets proceedings off to a great start. This scenes sets up the rest of the film and leads us towards the thrilling climax.<br/><br/>So, the bad:<br/><br/>The middle section of this film is far too plodding. The story is not strong enough to justify the time spent telling it and I would have liked to have seen some sharper editing here. At 143mins this is a long film.<br/><br/>There are some pretty large plot holes that left me scratching my head a bit and I find that a little strange that they were not thought through in a $200m production. There were also some large continuity and production errors that made me wince a bit.<br/><br/>But, the good:<br/><br/>The final section is, in my opinion, one of the best endings to any Bond. He shows resourcefulness, tenacity and expertise. The setting is wonderful and it fills in a tiny bit of Bond back history which is a new thing and actually handled rather well. <br/><br/>The cinematography is universally great in this film. Wonderful lighting and locations and almost painterly in places.<br/><br/>Judi Dench is wonderful. <br/><br/>A proper villain. He's bonkers and brilliant and just steals the scenes.<br/><br/>Rather good titles and title song by Adele. Brings back memories of Shirley Bassey.<br/><br/>Overall: I enjoyed it. It was a bit long and could have lost some pounds in the middle section (couldn't we all?) but I thought it was up there with Casino Royale as one of my favourite Bond movies. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond and Mendes obviously relished making this movie because of the care gone into it...which begs the question: why production errors and plot holes!?"
"harel619","9","3","11","14 November 2012"," Definitely in my top 5 Bond films for sure.
","I just saw Skyfall yesterday afternoon. Two hours and twenty-three minutes later I came out of the theatre in a very enjoyable mood and was nearly giddy, but reserved. It was the first time in several years that I've seen a good Bond movie (obviously I'm referring to Casino Royale as opposed to its sequel Quantum of Solace, the latter of which was below-average in my mind). It's not often that a Bond film starts off immediately with a lightning fast action sequence that has more than its fair share of tense moments culminating in a sudden, shocking climax before the intro (speaking of which, the intro sequence was good, but it could've been done a little better), but Skyfall does it so well. The last thing I'll say about this without spoiling anything is that it just shows viewers that sometimes 007's ""superhuman"" abilities fail him or don't materialize as originally intended.<br/><br/>Now onto the acting. Craig, as demonstrated in his first two films (more CR than QoS though) is a hard-nosed Bond who portrays the spy as one who still has something to prove and can still play a large role in being a spy. Craig acted very well in this movie, arguably his most significant experience surpassing what he did the first time he played the role. Javier Bardem played one of the best villainous roles in any Bond movie and was an equal to, if not superior than Craig was. The fact that his character's prime motive was a fresh one as opposed to the classic ""taking over the world"" mantra gave credence to his portrayal of a shrewd, confident and evenly-tempered psychopath (yes that's a bit of an oxymoron). Not very many love scenes in this movie and the Bond girls aren't seen very much, but perhaps that's because the ""real"" Bond girl is M. Judi Dench plays one of the largest roles of her character in the history of Bond films (if not the largest), and the film explores the intricate relationship between 007 and herself. She even gets in on the action a bit, as has previously happened in The World is Not Enough. Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney also had notable roles in the movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, I did mention that this would be in my top 5 Bond films. I'd place it at #2 on my list, as my favourite after yesterday is still Goldfinger. The last thing I'll mention in this review is that Goldfinger fans would be delighted with some key moments in this movie.<br/><br/>9/10 - A job very well-done."

","Skyfall is a film that signifies the end of the typical superman type bond movies.From all the 23 bond movies skyfall is a movie even a loyal classical bond movie fan would consider the best one.FOR me skyfall is the best not because of the cool action sequences or the cool cars but simple because of the story line.this is not a movie that bond simply get the girl and save the world from another weird disaster.This is a bond movie that even James bond breaks down under pressure.That even James bond have problems that a normal person have.In this movie the interpretation of James bond is more human. Sam Mendes is a master when it comes to creating masterpiece after watching skyfall it's obvious as to why Sam Mendes was selected to direct this movie.His interpretation of bond show the transcension of bond from past to present through out 50 years.After watching this movie it's obvious that this is not a stereotypical bond movie.With magnificent action sequences,drama and with a hint of comedy makes skyfall a well balanced movie.It's not a easy task to live up to 50 years of bond legacy but i think Sam Mendes has face the challenge magnificently.through his unique way of story telling i think he has honored the bond legacy. A main focus should be given to the acting of this movie.As usual Daniel Craig brings his gritty more emotional corrupted and brute force attitude to the bond character.Javier Bardem brings his Oscar winning performance to portray the bast bond villain in my book.overall skyfall is a amazing movie hopefully this unique interpretation of bond continues to future bond movies."
"DJRMewzique","8","3","11","11 November 2012"," No, the is NOT the best Bond film ever....However...
","No, this is NOT the ""best Bond movie ever."" However, yes...it is a great action film.<br/><br/>For his third installment, Daniel Craig returns to perfect form (in more ways than one) in the twenty-third film that brings certain elements back to Bond basics. Kick-starting with the as-expected excellent opening action sequence which sets up the tone of the rest of the film, don't go expecting a ""fun"" Bond, as this installment, although littered with humour and self-referential moments, is relatively dark and serious...and not necessarily as heroically-motivated as it is a story motivated by more of a personal crusade.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, this time around, Bond is not saving the world, necessarily, he's not really even saving a city. After MI6 is targeted by a terrorist, a resurrected Bond returns to go after the man responsible as it seems that, ultimately, what seems to be targeted is M herself. And thus, not the lightest of action films. But a seriously great ride, just the same.<br/><br/>That being said, Craig is still second-to-none as a Bond with wit, looks, stealth and vengeance in his eyes. The most human of all Bonds, even when he is not up to par on certain levels, there is no question the man is still made of a different cloth than you or me, and thus, even when pulling a stunt wounded, you do not question his ultimate ability to do so.<br/><br/>As the film's villain, Oscar-winning Javier Bardem, and a horrible blond wig, step up to the challenge. As the sexually ambiguous Silva, Bardem shows that he is certainly a go-to guy for such a position while not utilizing his brilliance as an actor to necessarily rise to occasion so much that Silva will ever be remembered as one of the greatest, most threatening or most dangerous villains Bond has encountered...contrary to what other people are mistakenly saying. Bardem is both exciting in some regards and slightly disappointing in others, but overall, remains entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Dame Judi Dench is superb, as always, as M...in trouble. But the introduction of Ralph Fiennes as a potential new adversary for those within the shaky walls of MI6 offers a hint of new blood being injected into the series along with the the One-Direction reject that plays Q, Ben Wishaw. Bond girls Naomie Harris and Bérénice Marlohe are both excellent.<br/><br/>So, while Daniel Craig proves for the third time that he is the greatest actor to ever step foot in the role of bond, no....""Skyfall"" is not the best Bond film ever and Adele's title track is definitely one of the worst. However, it does include one of the best, most surprising lines in the history of the series in ""What makes you think it's my first time?"" When you learn the context, you'll love it, too."
"SforSmile","8","3","11","11 November 2012"," Bardem saved Bond
","Skyfall is an uncommonly gloomy film with a dense and oppressing atmosphere almost macabre in the sense that the rickety claws of death are palpable throughout the entire plot. Symbols like skulls and tombs, an intro covered in blood, a devastated ghost town left for good, the rainy London swathed in dim shades of gray and blue, an old, abandoned mansion with hidden doors to dark, underground shafts; the cold Highlands of Scotland, a venomous scorpion and last but not least the villain's ugly, broken smile illustrate such an impression. And James Bond? After proving his own obituary wrong, Her Majesty's greatest agent returns from the dead to protect his agency from a powerful cyber terrorist named Silva and he is anything but fit for the job. The shimmering, mischievously smiling Bond as embodied by Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan is a thing of the past. The new Bond in ""Skyfall"" is less womanizer and more someone who has difficulties in hitting a target because of the injuries he suffered. He is suddenly vulnerable and his sense of humour was never dryer before, he really has to try hard to achieve his goals because he's getting old, the lightness of the previous Bonds is gone (for now). So it's not surprising that typical elements of the franchise like crazy action scenes as seen in ""Die Another Day"", odd gadgets like exploding cigarettes or completely freakish super villains living in a volcano crater are missing as well, even the occasionally sizzling erotic due to attractive Bond Girls (unfortunately) seems to lack space in the world of ""Skyfall"". The old trade marks exist only in nostalgic remembrance, as when Bond takes out an old Aston Martin DB5; the entire film appears to be a farewell to good old times when the Vodka martini was still shaken and not stirred. What's left is an exiting story of revenge, told in a straightforward, pure and slow-paced fashion and carried by the tragic figure of Silva who the great Javier Bardem plays with such impressing intensity and morbid elegance that it's a real joy seeing him on the big screen. Silva, who is more dead than alive, seeks nothing but revenge, he is smart and coldblooded; in appearance somewhere between ""The Joker"" and ""Jack Sparrow"", and, most of all, he has a history explaining his motivations, adding depth to his character which makes him a perfect antagonist to Bond. Closely connected to Silva's past is M (Judie Dench), Bond's boss, who, for the first time, had a major role in this film. She is a strong, principled women willing to make hard decisions that could cost people's lives; a good counterbalance to the often decorative Bond Girls who don't have much to say of real importance. M, 007 and Silva are the three main figures in a Shakespeare-like tragedy around which a plot revolves being too thin and unoriginal to be really noteworthy, a rather cheep frame of what's supposed to be an otherwise well drawn picture. However, the frame may not be so important after all. It's the dark atmosphere and a nuanced character drawing together with an amazingly thrilling villain that make ""Skyfall"" stand out from the previous films. James Bond, as we knew him, is dead...only to live on."
"Death_to_JarJarBinks","7","3","11","9 November 2012"," A Fun Film for a Thinking Mind
","I don'y want to write a review, but from what everyone else is saying on this god forbidden website, I have forced myself to do so. I think this is the best Bond film to date.<br/><br/>What makes this film work so well, though, is not the intricate plot (which does have some issues), but the thematics and direction. Sam Mendes is not necessarily the best (I consider American Beauty to be very overrated), but he really deals with the script in a professional and wonderful matter. And with the help of the great Roger Deakins, Mendes makes this the most visually pleasing Bond film to date; showing what makes or breaks these films is not the lead, but the men behind the camera. <br/><br/>Most importantly though, this is the most intelligent Bond film. Some serious themes are brought upon, such as redemption and the long battle of tradition vs. innovation. The redemption theme is rather obvious, but it is interestingly enough found within the three leads. Along with their blue eyes, M, Silva, and Bond, all are looking for redemption, but in different ways. This really develops the characters. The battle of old of new is also obvious, but I think more interesting. Not only does it provide a great way to include nostalgic Bond memorabilia, but it also has great commentary on spy films themselves. Spy films are so focused on technology, nowadays, that god awful CGI special effects take away from the film. Skyfall turns this on its head, showing that a spy film can be even better without all of the hustle and bustle of ""exploding pens"". <br/><br/>Skyfall is far more than a James Bond film, and action films as a whole. Not only is it entertaining and visually pleasing, but also provides more to eat on for those who like to look at film analytically. If you have a good grasp on literature or film, then you should definitely check Skyfall out for a fun, yet thoughtful, ride."
"JKlivin88","Null","3","11","8 November 2012"," Sorry MGM. This is 2012.
","Let's start with this. I'm a huge fan of both ""Casino Royale"" and Daniel Craig. In contrast with everyone before, he gave a personal touch in the James Bond series, being the first one to play the role on his own and not trying to mime Sean Connery. Good or bad touch, it's anybody's decision, but surely a new one.<br/><br/>Being very disappointed in Quantum of Solace, which was right after the incredible, and genius, Casino Royale, I was expecting that in the year 2012 Skyfall would turn the things around. It's 2012 after all, and James Bond has to keep up with it's time. It has to be worthy of it's age.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Skyfall hardly met that expectations. There are many good moments in the movie. But there are also big plot holes and some (covered, OK) clichés.<br/><br/>First of all: How on earth did Bond survive that fall in the beginning. A fall like that one would have killed anyone. Especially someone who already had been shot twice. Furthermore, scenario is, from a point on, unreasonably weak. The movie introduces us an amazing bad guy, Havier Bardem, who expresses sensible arguments, displays great confidence, seems extremely intelligent and capable of bringing the whole world on it's knees. And what is this guy's big plan? To kill ""M""? Sorry gentlemen, but this is 2012. This whole revenge thing, is very 90's. It fits to bad guys with machine guns and no mind at all, who get killed at the end of the movie by the good guy-after they give us a last, long fight together. It is unacceptable for a villain like Skyfall's Havier Bardem to have a plan like that. Just to kill M for revenge. I mean, come on guys. You can do better than this.<br/><br/>Moreover, Bond takes M to his old home and they wait there all alone for an army to come. And they make no attempt at all to bring any help at any point. This has no reason at all. It's 2012. You must have a way to call the cavalry.<br/><br/>Not to mention that all this talk about Bond's incapability and getting old thing was absolutely pointless and meaningless.<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie get's a 7.5/10. Not bad, but it should have been a lot better. For a movie worth 150 million, having a Daniel Craig at his best (actually, he was in all three movies at his best-only the scenario was differed), an amazing Havier Bardem, an addition of Ralph Fieness, and a great Judi Bench, should have a done a lot better. Sorry MGM. This is 2012."

","A quick note for the car lovers. Please note the car is spelt Aston Martin and not Astin or Austin-thank you.<br/><br/>The times and Bond may have moved on, but this was a really weak film. No wit, no humour, no charm, no fun and the action scenes don't conjure up much suspense or excitement. Why did spending $200 million the end result came out so lame andfairly boring. If there was a sanistised and political corrected film , this was it.<br/><br/>Two questions: 
1) Was it intentional to have such a p8ss poor orchestral score with no sense of anticipation,depth,suspense or meaning? Part of watching any Bond film IS to have these dramatic musical injections into a scene.<br/><br/>2) Was blowing up the DB5 really neccessary or was it to sybolically and finally kill off any connections with the 'old' style Bond. Regardless of how the films have developed over the years that iconic car should have remained. Ever since being a boy and watching Goldfinger at the Cinema that DB5 stood out as THE Bond car. They have all but killed off any future Bond film that comes out thereafter. Enough said."
"EthanBJones_03","9","2","6","31 May 2017"," When the Skyfallls.... this film DOESN'T crumble...
","'SKYFALL' was directed by Sam Mendes and stars Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Judi Dench. ​When a cyber terrorist steals a list of active MI6 agent names and bombs the MI6 offices, it's up to James Bond(Daniel Craig) to thwart this terrorists plan and stop him from releasing any more names to the public.<br/><br/>This movie is god damn awesome. This was Mendes' first crack at a Bond movie and is BY FAR one of the best Bond movies ever made. Forget that 'Quantum of Solace' trash; this is Bond in his alcoholic prime and by God is it amazing. Daniel Craig is still one of the best Bond's and really sells the depressing, broken aspect of his character. Skyfall is probably the best shot Bond movie and looks visually stunning in every single sense of the word. This is a very character driven story and I love how well it was written. That said, in typical Bond fashion(for me at least), all the scenes and set pieces don't feel connected despite the fact that they are. In spite of this minor hurdle, this movie is a blast from start to finish and contains all the great action to feed action junkies, but also supplies a heartfelt story for people who actually care about plot. I know it's 2017 and no one cares about PLOT(what a childish thing) but for those of us with more than one brain cell, the story is great and possibly the Best Bond plot but I can't say for sure.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is like that creepy priest you saw when you went to church that one time. He'll sometimes crack a joke(which you'll laugh at just to comfort him) but at the end of the day, he's just gonna try and get you alone in a church after dark. Regardless, Bardem provides a chilling performance and actually makes Bardem's motivations make sense. Silva was also a great Bond villain and proved to be a great foil for Bond and worked well in today's current computer/hacked based climate. Judi Dench provides a heartfelt performance as the wonderful M and makes M the heart and soul of the movie. Ben Winshaw was a great choice for Q and aligning Q with the current computer based climate was also a genius idea. That said, both Ralph Fiennes and Naomie Harris' roles in this movie were kind of pointless. Not to say that their performances were lacklustre but their actual character and purpose made no sense.<br/><br/>This is the most visually stunning Bond. Every shot is masterfully composed and lit. Every scene is masterfully edited and directed. Every frame of this movie provides atmosphere and makes this movie a true joy to behold. <br/><br/>This movie's action was outstanding and it brings back all the classic Bond-isms. Despite that, the Bond Girl was completely useless and the Bond car was virtually non-existent(aside from a mini segment). I'm not saying this takes away from the movie but if you're gonna include them, at least go all in and try to make them interesting. <br/><br/>Skyfall is probably the best Bond song. Say what you want about Adele or even this movie but you cannot die that song is incredible and the lyrics actually have meaning instead of just filler.<br/><br/>Skyfall is one of the best Bond films. It's beautifully shot, well acted, masterfully directed and deserves a spot on the Bond hall of fame. Javier Bardem is one of the best Bond Villains and Skyfall is one of the best Bond songs. All in all, this movie is well worth a watch for old and new fans alike and I'll rate this movie 9 out of 10 Creepy Priests."

","Having watched every James Bond film on the big silver screen since The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977.<br/><br/>It was almost surreal to see Skyfall being made by an Oscar winning director, go on to win Oscars and become one of the top grossing films of all time. The billion dollar Bond.<br/><br/>To think back in 1989, Licence to Kill could not compete with the likes of Batman, Indiana Jones or Lethal Weapon 2 in the US box office.<br/><br/>Bond is presumed dead after a mission goes wrong in Istanbul as he tries to retrieve a hard drive containing a list of top agents. M is under pressure especially as it seems she is being targeted by an anonymous cyber terrorist who turns out to be a rogue agent Silva (Javier Bardem) who was once M's most effective spy.<br/><br/>Skyfall celebrated 50 years of the Bond films in the cinemas. It also takes liberties with the messy timeline of the film series. Daniel Craig's novice spy from Casino Royale is now a disillusioned veteran, at one point told to call it a day.<br/><br/>The film re-introduces some familiar characters after being away for a few films, a younger more hi-tech Q and a new Miss Moneypenny. There is also a new M hovering in the background. The film also references earlier Bond movies as part of its golden anniversary celebrations.<br/><br/>Although the film contains international locations, breathtaking action, some sumptuous cinematography from Roger Deakins, it flags a bit in the middle when it needed an additional action sequence.<br/><br/>What director Sam Mendes does bring is some character moments and making effective use of Judi Dench as she recites some Tennyson.<br/><br/>Unusually for a Bond film, this must be the only occasion where the villain actually achieved all of his objectives!"
"browngr3","10","2","6","12 January 2017"," Another excellent Bond flick!
","As a Bond fanatic for over fifty years, this film was not a disappointment. Sam Mendes direction brought out the Bond character as he should be. Daniel Craig was superb as always and as he was in Casino Royale. <br/><br/>I was a Lois Maxwell fan in the early Bond films but Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny took the young lady out of the clerical atmosphere of MI6 into the depths of MI6 Field Ops. I loved her performance and she brought fun to the film with her delivery. Looking forward to seeing her in future Bond films with her as Moneypenny.<br/><br/>The film brought out Bond's past as a child which I thought was interesting and very well done. M's (Judi Dench) demise was a surprise but the story line was great. Javier Bardem performance as the antagonist was comparable to his performance in No Country for Old Men. He always plays a great bad guy. <br/><br/>Can't wait for the next Bond film."
"sophieahmed","9","2","6","27 December 2016"," Brilliant return to Bond's roots
","Totally disagree with the negative reviews. If you look for all the technical inconsistencies/unlikely elements of any film of this type, you will find plenty. Skyfall concentrates on the complex relationship between Bond and M and goes back to Bond's family roots in Scotland - there are plenty of action scenes also - but that for me is what makes it so interesting. The final sequence in Glencoe is spectacular but also very moving. Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are outstanding and there is strong support from a great cast including a very menacing Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Rory Kinnear plus a great theme song. Naomie Harris may not have the strongest storyline but she is a strong attractive Moneypenny and the femme fatale is extremely beautiful. I believe it is one of the best of the whole series."
"Tss5078","8","2","6","28 November 2016"," The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
","In a recent Ultimate Movie Review Twitter Poll, I asked you what your favorite James Bond movie starring Daniel Craig was and you chose Skyfall. For me this was a hard choice, because Daniel Craig seems as though he was born to play James Bond. All the films he's done have been fantastic, but I can see why Skyfall won. This film stands out for many reasons, most importantly it gives us a rare look into the childhood of James Bond and for the rarest of moments we see Bond scared and on the edge of possibly giving up, but you know how the story ends, he's James Bond. If you missed Skyfall, the film is like many other stories, where an old enemy reappears, but in this case, the enemy isn't looking for world domination, he's looking for revenge against his former employers, the British Government and in particular the Double 0 program. Bond films are often times so similar that we tend to rate them based on the villain and the song, well, the song doesn't get better than the gem produced by Adele, but what about Javier Bardem? He is an Academy Award winner and for good cause, this dude was one of the scarier Bond villains to come around in a long time. The others in the Craig Bond movies were some pretty bad guys, who had done some horrible things, but no one was what anyone would call truly scary, not like the villains used to be. Bardem had that special something though, that not only made him a bad guy, but that kind of bad guy that can make audiences cringe. The Bottom Line, Skyfall wasn't my pick, but it was a close second, as this was probably the most personal and emotional Bond film perhaps in the entire series. Daniel Craig is still very much at his best, Javier Bardem is a villain who will always rank in the top ten, and who better to sing a bond theme than Adele. Wheather or not you picked Skyfall, there is no question that it is one of those Bond films that won't ever be forgotten."
"grainstorms","9","2","6","13 June 2016"," A traditional folktale for the ages ...and for all ages
","The Bond movies transcend the Bond books, in the same way ""Casablanca"" transcended a so-so play that never made it to Broadway: ""They All Came to Rick's."" Where Ian Fleming ground out snobbish and often silly stories in imitation of a rather nasty and racist writer, ""Sapper"" McNeile, the Bond films have created their own magic. Not all the movies have been great, of course. But in a half- century, a surprisingly number of them have achieved greatness. One of them is ""Skyfall."" It takes the by-now familiar ideas and themes (""tropes"" in critic- talk) of beyond-the-pale arch-villain, technology bent to evil purposes, scenic tours of the world's most photogenic spots, scenic tours of the world's most photogenic women, noise and gadgetry, a preposterous plot/scheme/conspiracy, and a secret agent with the skill sets of Hercules, Horatio Hornblower, Sir Galahad, Michael Strogoff, Courier of the Czar (check him out) and Mr. Spock ... and conjures up a breathtaking world of action and entertainment -- a circus with a theme, or trope, if you will. But best of all, it uses an extremely able cast to tell an adult story. Yes, adult! By now the whole world knows that Judi Dench is one of the greatest actors living today. Here, she shows us why. This is not the ""M"" of 10-second tirades, or an exasperated school- marm. In ""Skyfall,"" ""M"" is a three-dimensional person. Dench's scenes will probably be studied in acting classes for some time to come. Daniel Craig finally comes to grips with the Bond character, and, in so doing, creates a believable James Bond who is really capable of the derring-do that's part of his job description, yet maintains a very touching humanity. He harks back to the proletarian roughneck of Sean Connery, a type today's British Intelligence and SAS are more likely to employ than aristocratic dilettantes (although the latter did prove their worth in leading charges against machine guns in World War I, armed with nothing but a swagger stick and a Webley Mk VI revolver.) All this could not have been made possible without cinematographer Roger Deakins and director Sam Mendes. They've made a Bond film that's watchable. That you must watch."

"AmyJenson1995","9","2","6","3 June 2015"," Where it all began
","After Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, here is the third movie with Daniel Craig starring as 007 James Bond. <br/><br/>To be honest, I had quite a mix feelings when I pushed the theater door and took a seat. Casino Royale was a masterpiece, a fresh breath, a movie I love to watch anytime. Quantum of Solace was less successful, less entertaining. So I didn't know what to expect of Skyfall but as soon as the movie starts and I saw that familiar shape, I felt myself as watching a Bond movie again.<br/><br/>This movie has the privilege to introduce two familiar characters, Moneypenny and Q. The first is now black but she is really sexy on her way and quite teasing which brings a lot of fun to the lines. She is also a field agent and knows how to handle a gun. That surprised me a lot and I kinda like the idea to be honest. Q on the other hand is odder. He is a geek, a kid and he is far less memorable than the original Q, Desmond Llewelyn. Q has the gift to bring humor within the movie but in Skyfall, all his jokes fall flat and he seems way too pretentious which will bring him to be played by the villain.<br/><br/>Ah let's talk about the villain. What a relief to find someone who could match James Bond. Someone who was his image of the past and decided to take his revenge on M who sold him out to his enemies. Someone who knows MI6 like no one else and uses this knowledge to bring in down. Javier Bardem is by far one of the greatest villain we could have seen in a Bond Movie. He gives chills in every of his scene and was very convincing in his role. He gave a lot of challenge to James Bond and it was a guilty pleasure to see both engaging a fight for survival.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig keeps being James Bond in his very skin. He is now experienced and enjoys a little bit of dark humor. But he is still as profound as in the other movies. It's also bringing a lot of good memories when he get back aboard the legendary DB7 from Goldfinger, THE James Bond car. That was delightful and depressing when we witness such a beautiful car being blown up at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>So to conclude, when I left the theater, I was happy and relieved. Now I can't wait to see Spectre."
"allyatherton","8","2","6","13 February 2015"," Best Bond film for a long time.
","I haven't been a great fan of Daniel Craig's Bond so far. He's a great actor and you can't blame him for any of the story lines but for me his first few films have been overcomplicated and unnecessarily pretentious.<br/><br/>This is Bond back to basics though. Lots of great action sequences and a decent (not over convoluted) story line for once. The plot is good although it has a few ropey moments but that didn't detract me from my enjoyment. Every bond film has to have a few ropey plot holes, it wouldn't be Bond without them.<br/><br/>I particularly liked the idea of Bond going back to his family home at the end of the film. It felt like we were learning a bit more about him and that's a great addition.<br/><br/>Overall this is the best Bond film for a long time."
"tjhien","8","2","6","3 October 2014"," Judy Dench's final development as M is the key to understanding the ""new turn"" in the Bond genre
","I really liked the movie! M's latest and final appearance in the Bond series contains an interesting character development, which is perhaps telling in regards to the ""new turn"" of the genre. Ultimately, M's preference for systematic reasoning over individual appreciation leads to her own demise. Of course, being under such pressures, cannot go without development. With her ""HQ position"", remote from direct and critical action, she represents the ""blind judgement call"". More precise, a decision made (for the sake of control), under poor sight on what is really going on in the heat of the action (despite all technology there is). From nothing more then a radio transmission, she overrides field agent Eve's concern and orders ""the shot"". In these moments she is hopelessly limited in her capabilities and falls back on the logic of calculation and paper balance making of ""gain and loss"". This is most apparent in the two ""top rats"" that fall under her direct responsibility: Agent Silva, exchanged for the sake of six other agents, and Bond, exchanged for the sake of a list containing the identity of numerous agents (as if she is exchanging chess pieces). Her actions lead to a brilliant agent (Silva) turning rogue and another brilliant agent (Bond) almost dead. As Bond reasons post hoc on her actions: ""You should have trusted me to finish the job.""<br/><br/>By now, a seemingly defiant M is actually reconsidering her actions thus far. Against systematic recommendation, she puts Bond back in the field. In a public speech she elaborates on how advanced organization and the development of technology has not made the world more transparent, but more opaque, stressing the importance of her organization - and the direct and critical action her agents are engaged with - within a larger system which has, by now, grown impatient of her existence. But eventually it takes a poem by Tennyson and an assassination attempt on her life, for her to fully realize her over-reliance on calculation and a system that was bound to fail in the face of reality. At this point, although pivotal in her character development, it is already too late and her fate is sealed: she is already on the run and will most likely die in the end for her ""sins"". This is best expressed in a moment of humor where Bond grows tired of M's complaining and tries to threaten M with pushing the button that would eject the front passenger seat along with M in it. She is hardly impressed by it, disregarding the fancy technology entirely and lashes out, denying her human frailty one last time: ""Go ahead, eject me, see if I care."" But, in my opinion, her individual transformation is probably best expressed in her symbolic and visually quite stunning voyage into ""the heart of the land"" (Scotland highlands), where she finally dies."
"mmanderson96","8","2","6","4 July 2014"," Best James Bond film by Daniel Craig
","Of the three James Bond movies that Daniel Craig has done, this one is by far the best. The plot is easy to follow, quick paced, and action packed. The cinematography is simply amazing, especially the large cityscape shots. Also, the selection of new actors for the film was extraordinarily well done. Although the movie does seem to drag on for just a bit too long, you'll walk away feeling like it was time well spent. Also, their is a bit of romance in the film as well, which may make it more entertaining for some people. The film is good because it gives a bit of the backstory to why Bond is as he is. A great film to watch on any occasion, whether it be a ""bros night"" or a ""date night""!"
"ehrlich-jonathan","8","2","6","14 March 2014"," a changing Bond - interesting and self reflexive
","A lot of people have been disappointed by the change of tone in the last few Bond films. They say, it is too far away from the original, classic tone of the Bond series. 007 is not the old fashioned agent anymore, who cares more about women and about the way the barkeeper fixes his Martini, than about his job. He has become a cold killer, an almost robot-like fighter. Physical limits don't seem to apply to him. The plot of Skyfall is pompous and - if you want to be fussy - pretty unrealistic. I tend to agree with all this. But then, this Bond film is much more than just an espionage thriller. It is a complex and self- reflexive movie. More of a a cinematic statement than just another action thriller. <br/><br/>The universe of Skyfall is a universe where the borders between good and bad are not always clear. It is a universe where the ""old"" Bond has to die and a ""new"" Bond has to undergo a process of self-discovery. It is a universe where even the MI 6 cannot do as it pleases anymore. It is a world where good cannot always win and where the happy ending is not necessarily happy. I is a world that changes, a world turned upside down. The action sequences are beautiful, the allusions to older Bond films are fun, Javier Bardem is probably the best Bond villain ever and the final showdown is the quintessence of all Bond movie showdowns.<br/><br/>So, yes. If you expect a classic Bond you will be completely disappointed. But if you want to go on an interesting and critical ride through Bond history you should not miss this movie. And maybe you will understand why Bond has to change."
"Geeky Randy","8","2","6","18 January 2014"," Geeky Randy's summary
","23rd Bond film is easily the strongest of the three Daniel Craig movies, with this installment abandoning all plans for the direct-sequel route that QUANTUM OF SOLACE took and going for the traditional episodic contribution. In this outing, we have Bond trying to track down former MI6 operative Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem, who's as good as always) whose mastermind attacks are all motivated by good-old-fashioned revenge. This film is notable for M (played by Dench) having a greatly increased role, and is the reboot's introduction to key recurring characters such as Q and Moneypenny. Also, the only Bond film with a title that was not somehow influenced by the title of one of Fleming's books. The scenic shots of Shanghai are tremendous, and the action sequences in the London Underground are perfectly nail-biting. This one knows how to pace itself without being too much nor too little.<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"
"hofman-ids","8","2","6","10 January 2014"," A refreshing Bond movie
","I think this James Bond movie is one of the better movies in the series. It looks like ""Quantum of Solace"" and ""Casino Royale"", but far less like the older films. This is probably because of Daniel Craig, the new James Bond actor. First of all I'd like to say that the whole movie is exciting, and the director also dares to take some risks according to the events. He actually lets people die of whom you'd never expect it. And a few small plot twists keep things diverse. Daniel Craig is different from the other James Bond actors. For example; I think he's less of a womanizer, but then again more of an action hero, whereas Sean Connery was better with the ladies. Daniel Craig has already let one of his lovers die in a past movie. Something else that makes this movie unique, is that 007 and MI6 are actually being threatened and in danger. Though in most of the other movies Bond only went to his targets, the enemy is now doing the same to him. On the other hand, I also think the film lacks some of the classic James Bond aspects. A lot of classic elements have been revised and recreated, which might make the film fresher and more open to new viewers, but might also disappoint a lot of die-hard fans. The Aston Martin for example, has been totally renewed. A good thing it's in the movie, right? Well, you could say that, but what does having an Aston Martin matter if it doesn't have the famous Aston Martin looks? This is something most people probably don't really mind. But what about the people that love the series for the Aston Martin? They could be disappointed. And then of course, the gadgets; the film contains a lot of new gadgets, but they all play a less important role than they used to (and there's less of them). You can say about that whatever you want, but it sure does make the whole complex more realistic. And last of all, Q is finally back! And no, not as John Cleese or as Desmond Llewelyn. But this time in a whole new jacket. He's finally been replaced by a new, young actor: Ben Whishaw. An actor not very famous, probably even unknown to most of you. However: Skyfall is a great edition in the series. With even better special effects than its predecessors, well performed acting by both the old, and the new actors. And not to forget: some badass ass-kicking."

","Not too hard to realize that for half a century, we have shared ups and downs, and survived crisis after crisis with Agent 007. This is the 23 James Bond installment and third starring Daniel Craig, as that beloved cool and captivating super spy. Say too much, say too little; SKYFALL has a different feel for some reason. Everyone can find their own reason for dissing and hissing at this one. Bond is vulnerable and yet dynamic and again the man you can depend on. M16 comes under attack and so does the credibility of M(Judi Dench), as she must relocate the agency. Her past creeps in to haunt her and this new dilemma has her putting her only hope in 007 to uncover its origins. Bond will have the aid of agency field agent Eve(Naomi Harris)to challenge a new Chairman of Intelligence(Ralph Fiennes)and follow a treacherous trail of a mysterious madman(Javier Bardem). Explosion after explosion is typical, but having M playing a more active role is not. Somehow of course, the old saying proves true...there IS a reason for everything. I really found the use of ""Boom Boom"" by The Animals fitting. And you can't ignore the wonderful theme by Adele, that I feel will be memorable for a long time.

"jbr98682002","8","2","6","23 June 2013"," one of the few Bonds I liked for its story more than the action
","I only skimmed through some of the reviews for this films, but I was shocked to see so many bad reviews. This is probably one of the few Bonds films - since Goldfinger - where I was interested enough in the story that I didn't get impatient waiting for the actions scenes. Admittedly, I used to only like Bond films for the action, and if you compare this to some of the more recent ones, it's not that action-heavy. It does have good action, but it also has a great story - not an overly confusing one, like some Bonds do. Unlike with some Bonds, the formulaic elements (the action scenes, confronting-the-villain scene, etc.)flowed smoothly, without feeling tacked on. Skyfall is great in ways that a lot of Bond films aren't."
"antagonist117","8","2","6","17 June 2013"," Yet another revisionist Bond, but this one appreciates the value of the past as well
","Despite its innovations, ""Skyfall"" is, in some ways, a welcome return to normalcy for the Bond franchise after an uneven period of experimentation. Daniel Craig's earlier films, understandably, sought to break away from the aspects of the Bond character that had grown stale, but at the same time they sacrificed some of the characteristics that make Bond stand out from other action spy heroes. In ""Skyfall"" Craig still broods and mopes a bit, but he is not so humorless as in his first two outings as 007; he has at last acquired Bond's requisite wit. ""Skyfall"" re-embraces essential elements of the franchise as much as it carries the quasi-serialized Bond universe into new territory. It offers a culmination of themes that the Bond films have been dealing with in one way or another since Judi Dench took over the role of M in ""GoldenEye"": Bond's vulnerability, his relationship with M, and the decline of British power in world affairs. A new and intriguing aspect of Bond that may prove to be Craig's most significant contribution to the character is his compassion. This Bond seems to want to help people and to heal them, and what is more noble than this in a government servant? ""Skyfall"" is not a perfect movie, dealing hamfistedly with the issue of sexual slavery in Asia for example, but it is the best Bond film in at least a generation."
"slokes","8","2","6","11 May 2013"," Getting Back To Work
","The James Bond franchise celebrated its 50th anniversary with this hard-charging re-examination of the character and the world he inhabits, served up with fierce action scenes, amazingly exotic locales, and the welcome re-introduction of humor.<br/><br/>As Bond himself (Daniel Craig) puts it, his hobby is ""resurrection,"" and as Craig invests himself more into the role, it seems like he is doing his job.<br/><br/>It's a strange movie in many ways. While other Bond films present us with an infallible hero, here we see him making a few mistakes. He fails the opening mission rather spectacularly, then goes to ground to perform some meaningless, unhappy sex and drinking games with scorpions to amuse jaded barflies. But MI6 is in even more serious trouble than usual, and as a battered M (Judi Dench) faces early retirement, an unshaven Bond returns to do what he can. Which we really sense this time may not be enough.<br/><br/>""You know we need you,"" says M, speaking for all of us.<br/><br/>""Well, I'm here,"" says Bond, looking none-too-happy about it.<br/><br/>It may be pointless to write a positive review in this forum; any nice words said about ""Skyfall"" tend to attract ""unhelpful"" votes like dead meat does flies. Maybe someone thinks enough negativity on IMDb will be enough to force Craig out and bring back Pierce Brosnan. Well, with all the millions of box office and new fans this Eon makeover has been getting, I can only echo one of Craig's many quips from this surprisingly amusing if dark film: ""Good luck with that!""<br/><br/>If there has been a traditional backlash against the new Bonds, it surprises me. Sure, ""Skyfall"" plays with our expectations, but it does so by grounding Bond in the same sensibility of fallibility and fragility that Ian Fleming introduced in the Bond books. His Bond didn't enjoy his work, and in the later novels began to fall apart until he was a battered shell of his old self by the penultimate novel, ""You Only Live Twice."" Double-O work takes a toll, and Craig isn't the cocky video game avatar we may be expecting. His doggedness isn't always a plus; it weighed down the last movie, ""Quantum Of Solace,"" rather heavily.<br/><br/>The screenwriters here, usual suspects Neil Purvis and Robert Wade along with new writer John Logan, still suffer from an inability to devise and develop a sensible plot. It starts terrifically, but the ending is seriously hobbled by an effort to give a major character a proper send-off, and there is also the magic maniac issue around our principal baddie, the renegade agent Silva (Javier Bardem), who just seems too held up by contrivance as the film enters its third, patchiest act.<br/><br/>But Bardem does a solid job with a difficult role, injecting his own humor and making the viewer question M's opportunism in quest of mission. The script does fine with sharp dialogue and character development, developing shadings and resonances you don't expect. A great example is the Bond Girl here, Bérénice Lim Marlohe, who plays up her character Severine's vulnerability in a way that surprises one used to just getting eye candy. Watching her try to bandy words with Bond at a bar, one sees in her eyes how shaky her situation is, another callback to Fleming. She wears her doom well.<br/><br/>As a film, ""Skyfall"" takes its time, a bit too much time in places, but manages to score as a series of invigorating setpieces in a way that give this film a rewatchability I find lacking in the other Craig Bonds, even the thematically stronger ""Casino Royale."" Director Sam Mendes makes his style points, but he's a fan and never forgets the mission here: Let the audience have some fun.<br/><br/>I had fun watching this, and think you will, too. It's a half-century milestone that suggests the series has more in the tank than even Craig's prior outings portended. He's had a great run, and it appears he won't be leaving with his dignity any time soon. Which is fine by me."
"Scarecrow-88","7","2","6","3 May 2013"," Skyfall
","For me, Skyfall is a marked improvement over the previous (badly titled) Quantum of Solace if just because of how involved M (Judi Dench) is in the overall plot. That and Javier Bardem is just superb as the villain (with more than a strong reason to harbor some real resentment and to be a bit on the loony side) who was once a MI6 agent and knows plenty of secrets that he can use (besides the genius mixed with the madness) to expose the British Secret Service (not only that he actually is responsible for blowing the agency building in London up!) as maybe not as soundly protected or impenetrable as their reputation suggests. <br/><br/>Because M is willing to sacrifice her agents if needed to protect her country and government from terrorism and attack, Bardem's former agent, Silva, was tortured and had actually bit into a cyanide pill that didn't kill him but poisoned and ""melted"" inside him his mouth (ouch); when he removed his teeth it adds weight to his seething bitterness and hate for M (and the agency he worked for several years). James Bond (Daniel Craig, fit but for a while looking a bit sickly once returned from near death when shot accidentally by a field agent ordered by M to ""take the shot"") is on the pursuit, at the beginning, after an assassin who confiscated a list of MI6 agents undercover, traveling through crowded traffic in Turkey. <br/><br/>The fight on top of the moving train (and how Craig uses a Cat to get from one motorcar to another) kicks off the movie nicely, but there's a lot of plot that stretches out the action scenes. M's character is on trial (literally) when she must appear before a tribunal of sorts to address the miscues and infiltration of her agency, with Silva actually freeing himself from a cell heavily guarded in an underground bunker of London, crashing a court, and firing away (a slight hesitation allows M to be rescued by her new boss, Mallory (played by Ralph Fiennes) in a fine moment for him, grabbing a gun and helping 007 fend off Silva and a couple of his men). <br/><br/>Silva seems to have cyber skills and advantages that even trick MI6's Q (Ben Whishaw) and cause plenty of headaches for the agency; when 007 is taken to an island with a city abandoned by hysterical citizens who believed they would perish, Silva has a building plentiful with computer technology that has raised such havoc around the world, such power at his fingertips (how Bardem describes this and a bit of homoerotic groping on 007 while Bond is bound in a chair are examples of the showy theatrics for which Silva embellishes his villainy) provided much opportunity for him to smack around the morale of a highly renowned British Intelligence Agency. This film sheds light on a new threat that cannot be so easily exposed and recognized when M addresses her judiciary committee and their questions on her agency's mistakes. <br/><br/>Regarding the action, there's a nifty fight in a Shanghai high rise (the eye candy night scenes of Shanghai's city lit is quite stunning as is Macau) between Bond and the assassin he battled on the train (how Bond grabs hold to the bottom rail of the elevator, following him up, is cool), Bond's pursuit of Silva after he escapes his cell (the explosion of a wall and how a subway train falls through the collapsed hole nearly smashing Bond is epic) is a real hair-raiser, and the final sequence at Bond's Scottish manor (Silva's men sure lay waste to the place!) has plenty of gunfire and things go kaboom! The Bond girls are perhaps not as memorable as in times past (but still hot)--Naomi Harris is Bond's field partner, responsible for shooting him when M demands she attempt to shoot the assassin (and her shave of Bond's face, not to mention, her last name will make Bond fans smile), while Bérénice Marlohe as Severine, a lady Bond meets while trying to gain introduction to Silva through her, has a steamy shower scene with 007 before her head is used to balance a shotglass of liquor (Silva is punishing her for her little tryst with Bond, purposely missing the glass he could probably have hit with ease)--but have their moments opposite Bond.<br/><br/>This is ultimately all about Bond and M contending with Silva who is hellbent on his revenge. There are plenty of inspired homages to the Bond brand such as his gun and car (good joke about an exploding pen when Q and Bond share a conversation about the young and old in the agency), and this movie comments on the vulnerability and age of Bond. This is certainly my favorite of the Craig Bond films. Dench is expertly used and her moments with Craig are a perfect swan song to her M character. Albert Finney, as an old family friend of Bond's, has a marvelous supporting part and helps combat Silva's barrage of bulletfire."
"nagyistvanandor","8","2","6","29 March 2013"," The sky might be falling, but Bond is raising.
","I most admit, I need it to watch this movie twice till it touched me. First time around I got really bored with it, and did not cared much, did not even finish it. Than many of my friends told me its great, and I heard M dies, how actually annoyed me in this movie, so I thought I give it another shoot, and it worth it, second time around it was much more enjoyable. <br/><br/>Few things I don't like it has it sequel/prequel confusion, like the joke about stuff we get use too in the 50 years of Bond movies, jet again the movie suppose to happen before all of those... but once You accept this its not bad. <br/><br/>I also think it was kinda a waste of potential to kill of the villain, he was interesting, challenging, his own skill sets, would have made a good reappearing villain... but oh well. <br/><br/>And yuh I kinda felt the shoot from a moving train, fall to a river was a bit overkill... but its bond... stuff like that happen. It would not even the first time Bond faked his dead. <br/><br/>Anyways... what I did like in the movie:<br/><br/>1) I kinda liked while it kept some of the unrealistic factors, like Bond can run faster than explosion and stuff (which lets just face it, its annoying, but now its so over used in action movies we would miss it if scenes like this would not make a appearance) Also it tried to be more realistic, no scenes like 20 thugs shooting on him from few meters, and none of them can hit him... <br/><br/>2)this is kinda links to the 1)... I loved how the New M, New Q, and Eve played a role as supportive team to Bond. It was still Bond how did the major part of the work, but this characters got his back, and aided his work. Which made him more realistic, than the one man army how can solve anything all by him self. <br/><br/>3) (the second time) I actually liked that he need it to be tested to accepted back to service. It shows that this agent's including Bond needs to verify there fitness and not just a natural born killing machines but they where highly trained to be able to handle there duty's. Plus its kinda linked to it, when he meets the girl in the bar, he puts together the picture from observing the girl, and spotting a tattoo on her. Which shows a side of Bond which I was missing from the few previous movies, the fact that his very intelligent, and have a huge knowledge about many things. His mind is as trained, as his body is. <br/><br/>4) the plot I loved that it was some what a simple goal which the villain was trying to reach and not ""take over the world/destroy the world"" and only James Bond can stop the end of the world from happening. I always enjoyed it when Bond faced more realistic simple task, like racing with time to get back a decoder, or stop a villain to take control over a field, or a stop a rubbery which could cripple the economy. Now and than a saving the world plot can come along based on Bond skills and job, but not in every single bond movie. <br/><br/>5) I also loved that we had a peek in Bond motives. The fact that he was a orphan raised to be a agent makes tones of sense. Not only in his extra skillfulness wise, but also explains why is he so uncorruptible, since his only true emotional bounds is towards the agents and his country. Extra point for hinting his Scottish, which I take as a reference to Connery, hows my all time fav Bond. <br/><br/>Overall this movie even if it toked twice to watch to come trough is a very fine work of 007 movie. It aims for more realism, beside not fully losing the magic of bond able to survive almost anything. It give more depth and role to M, Q and Moneypenny and got them involved in the plot which is good. I would love to see more hints, scenes about how Bond trains his body and mind. Plus more well written story's where the stake is not to save the word...<br/><br/>Plus... since this happen before Dr. No... dose that means Blofeld is still alive and kicking in a possible sequel? =D I would love too see him return in to James Bond movies, or if not him, someone similar to him. A reappearing character, how can challenge Bond to his limits, and also very skilled in skipping dead. Think that's one of the thing which Bond movies lack for a long time, a well developed, reappearing villain"
"David_Brown","10","2","6","24 March 2013"," Classic Bond
","Lets start out with the bad, I certainly did not like the gay undertone of the film. But except for that, you see a Bond you have not seen in decades, a Bond who is not perfect, who has to find his way into the World (The same with the UK in general), and sad to say, is easily disposed of. The remark about ""One rat left"", by Bond is a perfect metaphor for the fact, that Bond stands alone, in a World that needs him more than ever, but does not know it. The other think that is good, is you learn about where he grew up (He did not like it), including the names of his parents. The final piece is the return of Miss Moneypenny (Although quite different). The showdown at ""Shyfall"" (Bond's home), and spoilers the death of ""M"" were very well done as well. It does leave a lot of questions that can be posed? Is Blofwld and (Or SPECTRE) coming back? Could they actually see his son (He had one from Kissy in ""You Only Live Twice,""). Bond was not the best father, and this was dealt with in the novels not the films. Anyway it is classic Bond and a must see."
"vagherbie","5","2","6","17 February 2013"," Drama styled Bond introducing series to youngsters
","-minor spoiler-<br/><br/>I'm not the greatest Bond fun you can find but I have watched several films of the series so I think I can at least compare this one with some of them. It's not a bad film actually, there is a lot of breathtaking action scenes in various locations all over the world, nice looking women and a kind of plot that can stick you to the couch for as long as the movie lasts. But, it's not the kind of film you could watch again (like Casino Royal) because there is really nothing original in it. There are multiple problems.. The story reminds me of some films in the beginning of the Internet era where everything was somehow explained by the hacking abilities of some ultra-specialized guys who could do almost anything by coding and infringing into networks. In 2013 this is not an original concept as reality seems a lot more complicated than that (and therefore more interesting). I think, this is an effort of the producers to come out with a totally new series of Bond based on the way the world is today. That means good-buy electronic gadgets (everyone can have one), macho attitude (it's totally out of trend), extreme resistance to pain (no on bites for this any more) and hello to networked world, frankly attitude, and more realistic see-through character placement. It's a ""brave new world"" as Bond says after meeting next-gen Q in a museum... Don't be over-thrilled by the reviews, it's neither a bad nor a good film, probably it's the kind of average film, nice for a rainy evening with pizzas and colas, nothing more than that. Mendes really tried to make a film with vivid characters as he has done in his previous works although the ones in Bond series were always contradictory and actually confusing so it's like trying to solve a knotty that is tied up for 50 years. At least he didn't mess it all up. Maybe this film could be called ""Adapt Or Die"". At the end, Bond comes alive through this and if he gets himself a nice treatment from a psycho-analyst he may come back even stronger. In any other case the audience will probably find more amazing heroes to lean on."

","The review below is all you need.<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e21Q58Gtx-Q<br/><br/>I found that Skyfall is all too similar to the previous James Bond films. So I attempted to shorten up the plot in a quick 3 minute video. I still will always love Goldeneye, but yet, I'm biased because of the N64 game with the same name. But the story itself was fantastic as I feel this film does not create anything new. It just seems to rehash the old. I enjoy the villain, and Daniel Craig opposite him adds for intriguing interaction. I have been very impressed with the Bond genre over the years and have liked to see how it progresses from Sean Connery all the way to Daniel Craig. I have found that it is not the fault of the actors but more so falls on the story tellers who have yet to create a lot of action that we have grown to expect. However, films like Casino Royale have also proved that a different take on suspense can provide a nice counterpart for Bond. Since he is supposed to be very cunning and intelligent rather than just a well trained killer. The attempts were made on both ends but I do not know which one prevailed. But again, my video will help especially if you are a fan of pro wrestling and understand the history of sports entertainment and Bond."
"arnhei","4","2","6","23 December 2012"," Dark, well made, humorless.
","Well made, very entertaining, a good thriller, a good twist on the James Bond legend, but it's almost not a James Bond movie at all. Super action scenes, and it is good that it is not terribly gross or horrifying like many action films are now. It still has gross, bloody and horrifying scenes at times, I miss the times when I was a kid and could easily see all the James Bond movies, now it's almost too gross for a 12 yo, and impossible for a younger kid. Skyfall is lacking in humor, I'd like to see more of the coolness and the humor of the older type James Bond movies. This James Bond is getting very old and depressed and weary. Even the lovemaking scenes were painful, where's the sexiness? Also, I think it is horrible that M was turned into a man again, it was superb to have a female strong personality there. But, the scenes were well made, and kept me and my 13 yo son on the edge of our seats. The film was not all about just bombing and fires this time, it was a good story, keep up the good work there ;) On the other hand, how about less grossness, more humor, more kissing, less depression."

","I felt so mislead I am submitting my first IMDb review.<br/><br/>Although an entertaining action movie, this did not feel like a Bond Movie to me. As many others have mentioned it was missing most all of the ingredients except for the Actor playing Bond and action sequences the rest were either non existent or very limited. <br/><br/>Missing were the expected quantity and quality of Women, Gadgets, Cheesy One Liners, Fearsome Villain, Lead Henchman/woman, Final Rescue, Final Innuendo Scene and placement of the normally opening credit shot(Bond shooting at the barrel at the end.)<br/><br/>For an action movie it was an 8, but as a Bond film it left me very disappointed."
"CountZero313","7","2","6","18 December 2012"," Bond is back, for better or worse
","An ex-agent bent on revenge against M wreaks havoc on MI6, and only Bond can stop him.<br/><br/>It is difficult to talk about Skyfall in its own terms as it makes such overt intertextual reference to the preceding two films, and the franchise as a whole. Under siege from the slickness of the Bourne movies, the parody of Austin Powers, and the backstory angst of Batman, the 007 franchise decided to re-invent itself with Daniel Craig and Casino Royale. It all got muddled in Quantum, and Skyfall puts Mendes at the helm to set the ship straight. Casino Royale seemed to be at pains to mitigate, if not exactly justify, the misogynistic legacy of Connery, Moore and Brosnan. Bond had been done over in his early double-O career and love was his weak spot. Skyfall turns it all around once more, taking aim at a female M, and using Moneypenny to show women do not belong in the field, but behind desks as secretaries to M and 007. The Aston Martin returns to symbolise this reversion to the old patriarchal order. A woman is shot but Bond mourns the whisky spilled as collateral damage. A shaken not stirred dry martini might not have been worth a damn to the Casino Royale Bond, but his shaken drink is ""just perfect"" this time. Bond is getting on, his bones creak, and the Qs are getting younger and lippier. But the more the world changes, Skyfall seems to say, the more Bond will stay the same. We are even back to the villains wanting to talk him to death, rather than just shoot the bloody menace.<br/><br/>Not so much a new outing then, or even a re-boot, but a re-set of the franchise to traditional values - for better or worse.<br/><br/>Great use of locations, especially Istanbul and Scotland (Bond, the quintessential Englishman, apparently grew up in Scotland - no wonder he has issues. Though it does explain Connery's accent). The action sequences are top class, and Bardem cuts loose to great effect as the evil genius. The attempts at modernity falter, however: M is called to a parliamentary committee to account for three executed undercover agents, and lamely quotes Tennyson. Bond's backstory (turns out Batman and Bond both have loss anxiety) is touched upon only to be dismissed by a one-liner quip as Bond watches his childhood home go up in flames. The script strains to keep it all coherent and plausible, and suspension of disbelief is required in greater degrees at some points. Personally, I couldn't always mange it and so my enjoyment of Skyfall was patchy.<br/><br/>So Bond is back, and will be back again, baggage unloaded, and any nods to PC mores or gender politics have been jettisoned like an unwanted passenger in the Aston Martin. The traditionalists will be happy with this re-invention and threading through of New Lad culture tropes. For my part, I had grown fond of the vulnerable Casino Royale Bond. Skyfall works partly as an apology for that incarnation. A shame really. I'll miss him."
"stuartkpark","7","2","6","22 November 2012"," More Bourne than Bond
","Skyfall blurs the distinction between Bond and Bourne (and in fact any other gritty action film within recent years). Craig is not the cool, calm and sophisticated Bond we're used to he's more of a thug in a tux. This Bond isn't always in control and doesn't make everything look effortless, he is prone to mistakes and doesn't always make the best decision. Bond has been humanised, I'm still trying to decide if this is good, or not. This doesn't make Skyfall a bad film it just means it becomes more of the same, especially if future Bond films follow this same format.<br/><br/>Depending on your expectations Skyfall is fairly enjoyable. There are some good set pieces and a few nice nods for all seasoned Bond fans. The story had some good ideas, making the British Secret Service the target, meaning things are more personal.<br/><br/>Creating characters within an action film is a fine balance as it can slow the pace, most characters were dull, although Q came across very well for his few minutes of screen time. So did our bad guy, in fact he played a different enough bad guy from No Country For Old Men (great film) not to get typecast. Would have liked to see more of Bardem, but we did feel his pain, suffering, betrayal and reasons for his motivation.<br/><br/>The different Bond character does take some getting used to. That aside the film never gave us anything truly groundbreaking. The rooftop motorcycle chase is the next step on from the rooftop foot-chase we've seen before (Taken, Bourne, The International). The 'stand-off' we've also seen before. This is not the most memorable Bond film, although putting the lack of originality aside it had a nice even pace and was on the whole enjoyable.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers *** Rants *** Spoilers *** Rants *** Spoilers *** Rants *** No gadgets, Bond is all about gadgets. In fact the film made the point of saying there were no gadgets. The same thing happened in Dark Knight Rises, it was inexcusable in Batman and even more so in Bond. Yes we do want an exploding pen! Again this is another step away from Bond towards the standard action flick.<br/><br/>So at the start pre-Moneypenny shoots Bond. Once she had the clear shot why didn't she then shoot the bad guy? At least complete her mission. Sure she was in shock, but aren't they trained for this? I'm sat there thinking 'shoot him', then trying to find a reason why she didn't. Did I miss something? When investigating the bad guys computer don't plug it into the main MI6 network which has complete access to EVERYTHING. Yes this is one for the geeks, but surely common sense would prevail? Why is it that the characters in these high-powered highly-sensitive jobs are written to be so stupid? Or even when they are meant to be really clever, even taking a pill to make them awesomely intelligent (like Limitless - so, so bad) they turn out to make dumb decisions. Please give me a script where the intelligent guys are actually intelligent (Sherlock - BBC series). Anyway I digress...<br/><br/>So what happened to the drive? The whole point at the start was the retrieve the drive, so where is it? I was waiting for it to turn up at any second, again did I miss this? If travelling up to a derelict house in the middle of the Highlands to do battle, take some guns, explosives and general weaponry with you - even if you don't need it. The car does have a boot. Why wouldn't you? Why didn't Bond save the guy that got assassinated? Also, if the guy was sat in a room full of people wanting him dead why didn't they just kill him? Why send a guy into the building opposite to cut a hole in the glass to sniper him? It seemed to be a very elaborate plot point for Bond to find a casino chip which lead to Bond finding the bad guys hideout where the bad guy wanted to be captured. I guess the overly convoluted plot actually makes this a real Bond film after all!"
"brent_or","7","2","6","18 November 2012"," Uneven (6.5)
","My take on Skyfall is that while it has several truly iconic/beautiful cinematic moments, the plot is rather contrived in many places, and it feels somewhat uneven overall. So while it definitely is not bad, it is not all that great either.<br/><br/>Pros: The cast. Javier Bardem plays a very memorable, scene stealing villain, believably psychotic. I was pleasantly surprised to see Ben Winshaw (Bright Eyes) as Q. Some nice moments between Bond and M. The opening sequence is pretty good. The Shanghai building sequence and the nighttime Skyfall sequence are both wonderful cinematic stylizations, either of which could respectively house a great film. Adele is a nice choice to sing the theme song.<br/><br/>Cons: The theme song sequence is like a directing/editing identity crisis, rotating between beautiful, corny and so on. Several of the different settings feel like they came out of different films. Yes, I can make leaps, but it just seems that the whole is a bit noncohesive. And lastly, the plot at times feels like it goes the way it does not naturally, but just because it has to in order to set up whatever is coming next. Overall, I have seen worse, and I have seen better. Meh."
"riteshshergill","4","2","6","13 November 2012"," Not another Bond Movie
","Now skyfall is another movie altogether. No more vodka martinis, no more gadgets (there seems to be a particular inclination to move away from using those because there is an actual scene in the movie where Q – the new one; tells James Bond that Gadgets are kinda old fashioned; What! And using a finger print enabled gun is not!), no more scintillating bond girls. Its the end of the James Bond as we know it. The plot – jilted ex employee wants to take revenge, makes one helluva plan to infiltrate the Headquarters and achieves nothing. What kind of a stupid super villain is he? You would say its because he wants to kill himself and her with one bullet! Just kill the woman and then kill yourself, you are a super villain, grow a pair. James bond gets shot first in the right side, then on the left side by his own dear little bond girl, and of course he's alive after falling miles into a ravine, then down a waterfall and somehow is magically resurrected, ending up in the bed of some random woman, attending parties in shacks without a care in the world and drinking tequila, then bam he realizes he is James bond and gets back soon enough because you know his headquarters was attacked. And yeah the scar is only on his left side where the bond girl shot him, because you know she's a bond girl. And yeah he takes a fitness test and fails it but is still a badass and James Bond so bam, he's back on duty. The second bond girl exists for one shower scene only and then she takes James to Silva (the villain) who toys with James and then kills the second bond girl. Some bond girl she is. Yeah so Silva brilliantly infiltrates their headquarters and is foiled in his attempt to kill M by a bunch of screaming panicking people who get in his way. And Lord Voldermont. And James who just happens to reach there in time (by running the 100 metres dash) and bond girl 1 who shot James bond. What a rag tag bunch of people against the world's most capable assassin. So Silva botches it and runs away only to be put back on the scent of James and M by James bond and the new Q who I think is equal parts brilliant and stupid. So yeah Silva led by a trail of breadcrumbs arrives at Skyfall manor (where James was born but hates the place because you know its dark and gloomy and doesn't have Vodka martinis). So now here is Silva with a helicopter and a bunch of trained mercenaries, each of whom look as capable as James Bond himself, led by this fierce assassin and they are foiled by an old gamekeeper, an old woman who can't shoot straight and of course the one and only James Bond who proceeds to take down a helicopter with a stick of dynamite and 2 gas cylinders. I wasn't surprised at this point because Silva really is a shitty assassin as is established by this point in the movie. So they escape through a tunnel below the manor (because what manor does not have hidden tunnels) and blow up the manor because of course James doesn't like it and whatever James doesn't like must be obliterated by huge explosions. So somehow half of Silva's team is wiped out by now and he is beyond himself with rage when he sees M being led by the old gamekeeper to a nearby chapel, you know to pray because that's what you would do when you are in mortal danger. So what does he do.. like any other supervillian he starts walking casually towards the Chapel, because as far as he is concerned he has all the time in the world to kill M (and yeah beneath supervillians to hurry, the hero needs time to get in the way, old movie cliché). So yeah, Bond escapes through the same tunnel and comes up behind Silva who is taking his evening walk towards M. In trying to take a shortcut, he suddenly finds himself on thin ice surrounded by Silva and his goon. So instead of killing James Bond here, they have a nice little chat (something about how nice the weather is and a vodka martini would've been nice because its cold and maybe if they had ice skates, they could've ice skated and something about Ian Fleming rolling around in his grave and blah blah blah) and then Silva bids James adieu leaving him in the capable hands of his mercenary who instead of killing James, moves close to him so that he may quickly disarm him and take him for a swim (every cliché in the book) and of course he's carrying a flare gun because which mercenary doesn't carry one and yay James Bond successfully swims out of the lake thanks to the above-mentioned flare gun. In the meantime Silva is pressing cheeks with M because you know he has to find out what moisturiser she's using; Asking her to pull the trigger (and I swear you look at the Gamekeeper at this point you will see he is hoping that she does pull the trigger) and while everybody is hoping that M will pull the trigger Bond walks in and puts a knife in Silva's back. It is then that Silva realizes that maybe he should've killed Bond instead of trying to seduce him. So yeah Silva dies of a knife wound, M dies of boredom immediately after that; I think the Gamekeeper dies because he was laughing so hard at Silva's stupidity and James Bond dies of pneumonia. Last I heard they are now thinking of merging characters from all the similar movies to get the Expendables, McClane, the Transporter and Jackie Chan into the next Bond Movie. They are calling it 'Not another Bond Movie'"

","Skyfall, the third movie starring Daniel Craig as Bond, is a sequel made to be just as compelling as the older movies; but nevertheless Skyfall ignores the events of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace and takes place sometime later. The events of the last two movies are non-existent in this follow-up as there is no given detail of what had happened thereafter. Nevertheless, Skyfall manages to tell a new story in Bond's life and this sequel really explores the character both physically and emotionally, which wasn't really done a lot in the older movies. The well written script and action sequences are terrific, but towards the second half of the movie, story becomes very weak, but there is enough throwbacks and an explosive action-packed finale to get viewer's attention and the lust for another Bond sequel."
"barberoux-15943","6","1","2","31 May 2015"," Weakest of the three
","I thought Skyfall was the weakest of the three Bond films starring Daniel Craig. It was a sentimental mess with none of the hard edge of the previous films. The whole story of disappointment with M was childish. M wasn't being a nice mommy. Where is the professionalism of a double-o agent? SPOILERS ahead. I had three scenes that were a major problem to me. First when Eve was told to ""take the shot"" why didn't she fire again? If the hard drive was the most important item then the thing to do would be to shoot Bond and once he was out of the way to shoot Patrice and knock him off the train. Instead the scene was wrapped in this sentimental emotionalism. ""Oh no I shot James Bond!""Weak. The second was the escape of Silva from the glass cage. Okay I can accept some deus ex machina reason for his slipping away, just to keep the story going, but why weren't the underground passages and tube guarded or secured. This facility was supposed to be highly guarded and top secret and all Bond had to do was to lift a grate and voilà a ladder leading to the tube. They had to know the ladder and tunnel were there when they built the place or did the entire British secret service not think about looking under the grates. It was a HUGE security hole. Did they rent the place at the last minute from an ad in the newspaper? It is a wonder some wino living in the subway didn't wander up the ladder and fall asleep in the glass cage. Come on. Why not have Patrice blow a hole in a wall that led to the tube? The third problem was the ending. If Bond knew that people were coming to kill him and M then why not get some help. I assume Britain has an army, or Special Forces, or a police department that could have been utilized. If they were out of communication then how did Patrice find them? Couldn't that dork Q do something to help? Was this action over a weekend and no one was available? How could Silva commander a helicopter and troop of men and the British secret service had nothing. The whole scheme was so amateurish. Silva should have won since he seemed more capable than the whole British government. The whole end fight sequence seemed from a different movie that would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. Disappointing. Lots of action and big bangs but a weak script. I thought Javier Bardem was good as the bad guy, given the weak script. Naomie Harris is likable but the love interest part was not believable. Bérénice Marlohe was sufficiently babeish. Ralph Fiennes seems to be a good replacement for Judi Dench and the whole ending in M's office was fun."

Even a hardcore fan will concede that Bérénice Marlohe is deliberately stuffed in. Editing her out will change the movie by 1% in terms of plot; 99% in terms of glamor. Only the jitter-inducing, surprisingly funny, and succinctly 'different' Bardem, while plotting to kill Bond, salvages this Bond movie (how ironic)!<br/><br/>The remaining: The climax is dragged a bit, average action sequences with a rare brush of adrenaline-pumping brilliance notwithstanding, it's the spectacle that you'll see which'll inspire awe. Speaking of which, the other spontaneous cry to the director Mendes would be 'I can understand not handing an explosive pen to Bond to avoid clichés, but why for heaven's sake would he use an almost jammed & rusted weapon? Why a vintage car for a guy who's all about modernity?' Also Ralph Fiennes is so underused, you almost sense that there must be a huge compensation towards the end. At his role, Ian Fleming readers will cringe, Bond fans might feel satisfied while the others might not care that much (Sorry, that's all I can say without spoiling :-[ )<br/><br/>Overall: Technically, an excellent movie; hence excellent reviews. But, the plot is weak. Usually, we've seen that when an adapted story has a weak plot, there is a deliberate attempt to twist the original storyline. Hence, creating the illusion of difference which that twist rubs off on the movie.<br/><br/>Stars: Dench is convincing; Daniel Craig is awesome as our 'humanised' Bond; but it is Bardem who steals the show. Academy nomination? I wish!<br/><br/>Direction is full of energy. The interesting part is that it was a lesser risk for Mendes with Bond as he is not really a hero per se, but more of a 'star'. However, is the keenness to stamp your style on an age-old ageless star valid at the cost of slightly belying his personality? That you judge.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely not bad; but it leaves you with nothing much to remember about: Cause#1? Not enough adrenaline pumping action. Surprisingly low when you expect a stylized action Bond flick. Cause#2- Weak plot. No underlying purpose (unlike a ruthless young Bond wanting to rise in Casino Royale). There is an attempt to intellectualize the plot, but it comes at the cost of not providing details (not the Nolan-isque method of weaving a storyline capable of numerous subjective interpretations).<br/><br/>Finally, I believe Bond fans must see this. People wanting to see intense acting of Craig and Bardem must as well. Others, well, renting a DVD would be much, much better."

","Skyfall starts off with Bond on some mission to recover a stolen disk, but the scene starts off too fast. I would have liked to seen slower opening, showing Bond around the city. In the end, it's just a watered down opening scene filler intro.<br/><br/>The film's pacing is also strange. After Bond is shot, you see him drinking at a bar and then with a girl. I felt like his recovery scenes were edited and done to hastily. Let's see bond crawl himself out of the river, and sneak into a barn and collapse, only to be taken care of by a family. It would have given the rest of the film more weight.<br/><br/>Some how Silva hacks into M's office and makes an explosion. It makes no sense and is lame. Bond then shows up at M's house with his typical banter. I felt like Bond should have been more angry at M, but he does his typical ""whatever"" attitude. He then goes into this stupid conversation with that guy, all while the scene jumps to bond doing different exercises, but the conversation goes seamless like the waited to talk until the next exercise. It's just too edited.<br/><br/>The film jumps around some more some filler scenes, and Bond just happens to meet a woman whom wants to take him to Silva, whom Bond is looking for. I thought this very lazily done.<br/><br/>I didn't like the music either. The music is just so off. It's like it's beating you on the side of the head telling you to feel excited. The ending is filled with it. I would have rather there have been no music. The scenes are again edited to fast. We barely get to see them in Bond's old house before they get attacked.<br/><br/>Not showing the classic bond into in the beginning is just lame. Why not have some fun with the film. The bond music is also missed. It is a great theme that should of had some scenes crafted for it."

"johnstauffer","7","1","2","30 March 2013"," Skyfall is a different type Bond movie... Really!
","Skyfall has outdone the bond series in action, pain, photography, and attention to detail, and possibly length. The effort to film knock-down action in exotic places is monumental. It has presented a villain that is downright frightening and effectively built up so that the viewer will truly be afraid of what he will do next. HOWEVER, the film falls flat when compared as the same genre as the definitive first half-dozen Bond films: This one is thoroughly downbeat from start to finish, and except for a half-hearted 'where-have-you-been' from M near the end, it is completely devoid of humor. The early bond films have been characterized as spoofs and tongue-in-cheek. Skyfall can better be described as ""Is it Over Yet? Give Me a Drink!"""
"Eelco_1977","6","6","31","5 February 2013"," Certainly not my kind of Bond movie!
","I was never really fond of Daniel Craig as James Bond, but I wanted to give this one a shot, because of all the positive reactions I read and heard in my immediate surroundings.<br/><br/>I didn't really like Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. The main reason was Daniel Craig and the Bournish Identity feel of especially Quantum of Solace. Also the villains were very weak.<br/><br/>To me, a Bond movie doesn't need to be too realistic, but also not too unrealistic of course. Furthermore, humor is really really important in these type of movies.<br/><br/>Well, what can I say after seeing Skyfall...pfff just plain horrible! I really liked the opening sequence. That was just brilliantly filmed (easy to follow) and Adele's score was just magnificent. Judi Dench...well...just no comment in a positive way...she's just such a great actress! Chavier Bardem...great bad guy until we all find out what his plan really is. And that is to just kill M...very lame :(<br/><br/>Daniel Craig must be the most stiff and humorless and unattractive/elegant Bond there is. Amazing how his Bond gets the most beautiful women in bed. And these actresses can't act at all. Well, the one that becomes Moneypenny was OK...but the girl from Shanghai...jeez.<br/><br/>The biggest letdown of this Bond movie were the last 40 minutes or so. You let twenty something heavily armed men and a very heavily armed chopper come to your birth home in Scotland without backup...really?! And you construct, like The A-Team, trap devices to stop these men and the chopper. Than the whole place gets blown to bits, but you manage to get all out alive?! Well...M was shot once...not by the chopper, but one of the twenty men...pfff :( I know Bond movies are not supposed to be all realistic, but I found this to be so stupid for James Bond to do.<br/><br/>Even bigger than the biggest letdown, is that Daniel Craig is most likely gonna do two more Bond movies...dear heavens!<br/><br/>My favorite James Bond still is Sean Connery, followed by the very humorous Roger Moore and the elegant and humorous Pierce Brosnan in (especially) Goldeneye.<br/><br/>One thing they really should do better next time, is find a really really menacing villain. Mean, Chavier was great until we all found out what his big plan was. Where is the new Hugo Drax, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, 006 or Auric Goldfinger?!"
"ternerito40","4","4","18","6 February 2013"," What a ridiculous plot
","This is by far one of the worse 007 movies. The problem lies mostly with the script. The director was somewhat competent and had a good cast, a great photographer, obviously plenty of money... why pick Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan as writers will be always a mystery to me.<br/><br/>The only good bit of the movie is the opening credits, with Adele's song. The animation in the credits is also first class. Enjoy it while it lasts, it's all downhill from there. <br/><br/>The plot is so silly and ridiculous that is not worth spending a lot of time criticizing: try to watch the movie for yourself, and see if you can suspend your disbelieve for more than 5% of the time.<br/><br/>The plot: a bad guy got so angry and resentful with M, that he wants to kill her, so he takes any chance he got to shoot at her throughout the movie (there are several of these). Actually, he first had a chance to blow the whole Mi6 place up (which he succeeds in doing), but he makes sure she's not in it first... What?<br/><br/>About half way in the movie we learn that M is the target, so what happens? The whole British secret service has no better idea than our own James Bond: let's take M to an isolated house in the middle of nothing. Ah, let's make sure we let the bad guy know where we will be. Brilliant.<br/><br/>This movie will stimulate your intellect as much as the latest Batman movie (zero), but without the entertaining special effects. You are just left with astonished actors that can't help having a hard time keeping a straight face delivering the pathetic script they're asked to enact. <br/><br/>Bardem seemed to me to be the only one in the cast who, at times, could keep a straight face. Not a small accomplishment since, as the constantly-monologuing-bad-guy, he happens to have some of the stupidest lines in the movie.<br/><br/>Can someone please explain why they keep assigning the writing to people who clearly are not up to writing a coherent 12 grade essay? This is becoming a trend in most of this big budget movies, there must be a reason, I'd like to know it."

","It is the 1st time (since a long time) that the cinema was fully booked. It's not without a good reason though as the movie was worth every penny of its ticket. Although he is probably the ugliest of the series, Daniel's 007 incarnation is so believable, that might be the best of all the previous and hopefully he will remain at least another 10 years. This Bond adapted to his time, does a great physical performance, getting injured or having emotions other than those related to bed time. As a spy he uses his charms to accomplish his objectives, but he doesn't carry the girl as a plant all along the movie to keep a romantic attachment. It is very interesting to see this modern approach to women, who have more interesting roles when they have one. I never liked the female M, but she did a great performance. I really appreciated to see the roots of JB, as concerns his life story, but also the iconic references like the old car. Besides, the plot was quite original, as 007 was the hunted instead of the hunter. Finally it was well assembled to the traditional structure with M, Q, Monepenny. It was about time."

And for a second time in Bond history, James bond meets his match, and Javier Bardem is even more a greater villain to Bond than Sean Bean in Goldeneye. The story itself is unusual for a Bond movie, but it gives more than enough references to the good old James Bond, especially Sean Connery's era. And even further, it takes James Bond to his roots. And finally, at the end of the movie comes the biggest surprise which makes the reboot comes to a full circle. What a way to celebrate 50 years of Bond movie!

"jafar-iqbal","9","4","18","29 October 2012"," A blistering Bond masterpiece
","Fade to colour. It is a dark corridor, lit ever so slightly by lights coming through the window. There is only the shadowy outline of a figure at the end of the corridor. Slowly, he starts to pace forward, gun in his hand. He comes right up to the camera, light falling across his blue eyes. Those piercing blue eyes. Cue music. That music.<br/><br/>That's right, ladies and gentlemen. Bond is back. James Bond.<br/><br/>It's been exactly fifty years since James Bond first hit our screen in Dr No and even now, twenty-three movies later, the character creates the same amount of excitement and curiosity he did at the beginning. I'll freely admit that, while a casual fan of the movies, I was never a die-hard. I've only seen a few of them, and they were good. I'm aware of all the famous characters, the gadgets, the famous stories – I know it all, pretty much, just without seeing the films. But, importantly, I'd seen both of the first Daniel Craig movies. Loved them. A die-hard fan of them. And so watching movie number three was inevitable.<br/><br/>Skyfall is actually a refreshing change of pace from those first two movies. While they both followed the same narrative, this goes back to an old-school standalone Bond storyline. Bond is accidentally shot and presumably killed during an attempt to get back a stolen list of all NATO secret agents, thrusting MI6 into a cyber-terrorist plot. Bond does come back, obviously, to find and stop the man behind it.<br/><br/>I'll cut to the chase: this was unbelievably good. There were reservations about Sam Mendes directing it, because he'd never directed an action movie before, but he goes well above expectation. The action sequences, first up, are excellent. Frenetic, edge-of-your-seat sequences that, in true Mendes style, are shot beautifully.<br/><br/>But what Mendes brings to Skyfall is character development. These aren't just archetypal characters there to fulfil the Bond formula (with one exception that I'll get to). Everyone has a purpose, and we learn about them and invest in them emotionally. Bond's own journey in the movie is excellent, as is that of M (Judi Dench) and, most notably Javier Bardem as Silva. I'll go as far as to say that Bardem could, and rightfully should, be nominated for an Oscar. The guy is immense; it'll be hard for me to compare to other iconic Bond villains having not seen those films, but Silva is the perfect antagonist. He steals every scene he is in, with one-liners as well as simple tuts and sighs. Fantastic.<br/><br/>In truth, they're all great. Craig, Dench, Bardem, Ben Wishaw as Q, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes – Mendes has a cavalcade of top-notch actors and he makes good use of them. The only exception is Berenice Marlohe. As Severine, Marlohe is our Bond girl. And she is so underused and more or less irrelevant that I just didn't understand the need for her. Yes, they needed a Bond girl, so they had to have her. But I wish Mendes could have made better use of her. Ah well, no film can be perfect.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film that Mendes does so well is playing up the history and the stereotype of Bond without verging into satire. The iconic Bond car and gun are back, and there are numerous one-liners and wink-wink moments which only serve to enhance the story. This isn't the Bond that is nothing but serious and steely. This Bond incarnation from Craig has all the wit and charm people love from his predecessors.<br/><br/>I won't go into spoiler territory, but some very important things happen in this movie. Like in The Dark Knight Rises, you're kept guessing until the very end. After what a lot of people consider a disappointing Quantum Of Solace, this is a blistering return to form. Again, no film can be perfect, but this came so close. Must-watch cinema."
"Tweekums","10","3","12","21 March 2013"," Top quality Bond
","The extended pre-credit opening sequence sees Bond attempting to stop an unknown assailant escaping with a computer hard drive that contains details of undercover agents; the chase will take him over the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorbike and conclude with him wrestling with his target on the roof of a train while fellow agent Eve prepares to take a shot she just has to make sure she doesn't hit Bond. Surprisingly when the shot is taken it is Bond who falls, apparently dead, from the train! Shortly after the credits somebody tries to access the hard drive from inside MI-6; then an explosion rocks the building forcing the service to relocate to a secondary site in the tunnels under London. Once it becomes established that Bond is alive he returns and then sets about establishing who organised everything. His mission will take him first to Shanghai and then onto Macau before he eventually learns who he is up against; a former agent known as Silva; a man who feels betrayed by M and is determined to have his revenge.<br/><br/>This is what a modern Bond film is meant to be; there is dramatic action from start to finish, a solid plot, a delightfully over the top villain, a succession of impressive locations and no cliché gadgets. Daniel Craig continues to impress as Bond; doing a fine job portraying an agent who is more burnt out that in any previous film in the series. Judi Dench gets to do more than sit behind a desk and brings some humanity to the role of a woman whose job means that she must sometimes sacrifice those who work for her. Javier Bardem is a great villain; not the usual megalomaniac but somebody just as dangerous in his own psychotic way. The rest of the cast also perform well and I wouldn't be surprised if a few of those we first see in this film become series regulars. It made an interesting change to have things go so spectacularly wrong for Bond to such a degree that in the end it is the bad guy who is coming to him rather than the other way round even if that is part of a plan. Overall I'd say that this is right up there with the best Bond films and fans of the series should really enjoy it."

","This James Bond story was written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. In addition it was superbly directed by Sam Mendes. From the onset this new Bond film awakens the audiences with wall-to-wall action. When describing a superior movie as this one is, it's easy when recalling the heart-thumping, hair-raising introduction. Taken nearly from today's headlines. Bond is seen in dangerous high-flying mid-action when he travels from country to country confronting the enemies of the Crown. Upon returning home to England his secret organization of MI6 is attacked with a great loss of life. Bond and his boss 'M' (Judi Dench) come under great political criticism and nearly put out to pasture. However, that's when Bond (Daniel Craig) is at his best. He now seeks to learn who the shadowy mole is and vows vengeance. There is much drama in this movie as the audience follows Bond into the complex labyrinth of espionage where everyone is suspect. New Bond characters are added and several add to the mystique and intrigue like the new 'Q' (Ben Whishaw) and Eve.(Naomie Harris. In all, one can look forward to an explosive and entertaining movie. Easilly recommended. ****"
"Troy_Campbell","9","3","12","20 November 2012"," One of the best Bonds.
","Back in 2006 Martin Campbell's sensational Casino Royale re-imagined Britain's most famous spy as a flawed human that could make mistakes and feel real emotion. Gone were the gimmicky gadgets, onslaught of one-liners, self-referential acting and many more traditional 007 staples, this was a real-world Bond on show. Direct sequel Quantum of Solace took this too far and became excessively serious and sombre; its sense of fun had diminished to the point of non-existence. Enter acclaimed director Sam Mendes – not to mention world-renowned cinematographer Roger Deakins whose work here is second to none – and the franchise is not only back on track, but on a high. Skyfall is undoubtedly the most nostalgic (and humorous) Daniel Craig-era instalment, but it's also the most dramatically tense. Parts of Bond's back story are explored and he, along with Judi Dench's M, have their strongest emotional arc in a single movie to date. Between amusingly light-hearted encounters with the new-age Q (Ben Whishaw) and fellow field agent Eve (Naomie Harris), 007 must navigate through maternal surrogacy issues with M (Dench is thankfully given a larger and juicier role than in previous outings) in addition to dealing with the intensely vengeful Silva (Javier Bardem), who wields the power to bring down both MI6 and Bond's way of living. It's credit to Bardem that his villain is so obviously cut from the same over-the-top cloth of vintage Bond baddies (his introductory scene is both hilarious and menacing), yet retains a grounded stature that makes his life-threatening deeds instantly impactful and with severe consequences. There's more to chew on thematically for sure, but with a runtime of almost two and half hours the action and all-round excitement hasn't been skimped on. Look no further than the frenetic opening sequence that goes from a motorbike chase atop the Grand Bazaar to a fist fight on top of a moving train, with hardly a chance to breathe, which then segues into the typically awesome title design and Adele's beautifully old-fashioned title song. An underground escape by Silva and a courtroom shoot-out are other examples of heart-pounding action whilst a lusty casino-set meeting with reluctant henchwoman Severine (Berenice Marlohe) well and truly brings sexy back to the series. Simultaneously harking back to the good old days whilst energetically pushing towards the future, Skyfall can lay claim to being one of the best Bond flicks of all time."
"GoddessCeCe","10","3","12","19 November 2012"," Bond is back, better than ever! Skyfall is a cinematic joy, visually stunning.
","The way I love Skyfall, as well as all of the Daniel Craig Bond films, is unparalleled.<br/><br/>Until Daniel Craig took the helm of James Bond, I didn't have much appreciation for the Bond franchise. I had seen clips of the early movies but since most of them were before my time, I wasn't familiar with the history of the franchise. And then , sadly for me, my first foray into Bond was Pierce Brosnan. Those movies were everything I detest - phony, poorly acted, poorly written, Michael Bay type movies with no realism or story. And I hated them with intense passion. So when I heard about the reboot, I was less than excited.<br/><br/>Well, imagine my surprise when I saw Casino Royale in the theatres, and it went on to be one of my all-time favorite films (and I see a LOT of movies). It was beautiful, featuring exotic locales, brilliant acting and a script so good it moved me to tears. While I very much enjoyed Quantum of Solace, it lacked a little of CR's magic. Needless to say, by this point I had fallen in love with Craig's Bond, the character and the iconic role he portrayed.<br/><br/>So after 4 agonizing years, Skyfall lands in theatres. I am happy to say that it is a stunning masterpiece. Cinematically perfect, visually stunning, each segment of the film was more beautiful than the last. Director Mendes really brings sheer beauty to every shot, as if the screen is a canvas with paintings coming to life. He made colors pop and did dazzling work with lighting contrast in ways I've not seen. Each segment had a unique look to it, almost like mini movies throughout. Then of course there was the brilliant story (now a given), incredible acting and beautiful, haunting music. There were so many nods to past Bond incarnations which was such a delightful treat on the eve of the 50th Anniversary. Mr. Fleming would be most proud, I've no doubt.<br/><br/>Skyfall is everything I could want in not just a James Bond flick, but a film in general. Can't wait for 007 24!"

Intricate relations and complex situations distinguish this film from previous Bond movies. No traditional non-stop larger than life stunts on exotic places, no unnecessary cheesy sleazy encounters with ladies. Skyfall is certainly not a regular bond movie. Judi Dench's presence as 'M' is more charismatic than Bond himself.

","After watching Daniel Craig in ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace"" I used to frequently think he is so apt conceiving the image of Bond as a no nonsense yet captivating guy..now after watching ""Skyfall"" i am pretty sure that he is one of the best to portray Bond even in the league of Sean Connery I would say..<br/><br/>Now if you are a great fan of the ""Bond gadgets"" you would be a touch disappointed with Skyfall, just because there is nothing much of it..also the length of the movie is about 2.5 hours which is not normal for a James Bond movie. But all these ""faults"" (if you would call them) gives away to the extremely well crafted movie that is ""Skyfall"". The script is a winner all the way along with the performance of the lead actors. <br/><br/>Craig is just superb as Bond with is now-famous rugged looks and the dialog delivery and as always he excels in the action sequences which are choreographed superbly. When you say about performance you would not want to miss to mention about Javier Bardem who plays the Villain in the film and that of Judi Dench as ""M"". Bardem stands equal to Craig and is undoubtedly one of the best villains in the Bond movies. Judi Dench has an extended role in this compared to the previous ones and she does a fantastic job with it.<br/><br/>Bond girls were a let down though I have to say...Naomie Harris doesn't have any chemistry with Craig and is a let down with regard to her performance. It was fascinating to see the script focusing about Bond's childhood and showcasing the affection and respect Bond and ""M"" has towards each other.<br/><br/>Even though I felt the climax a bit dragging it was not at all a flaw considering the whole package was just awesome.."
"Richard-525-12823","10","3","12","10 November 2012"," Great movie to watch for classic fans
","Skyfall is like a throwback to the first Bond flick Dr. No. This movie is the best of the Daniel Craig Bond films so far, and that is very understandable as it seems to be part of the storyline. When M referred to 007 in Casino Royal as a rough tool she was correct and in this work he is a lot more refined and targeting.<br/><br/>This is not Pierce Brosnan's overly refined overloaded on gadgets bond this is Sean Connery's rough gritty hard edged bond and a homage to that work as I have never seen before. This is the James that I have missed a great deal. Don't get me wrong many of the other movies were good in their own way, but if you have watched them all recently you can see the bond is very different person through out.<br/><br/>I would say that Craig is the most like Mr. Connery that I have seen to date. If you like the classic bond I suspect you will love this movie because it takes so many parts out of it that it is amazing. The story line is very easy to follow if you have a mind to do so and the action is gripping. We did not even realize how long the movie was until we stepped out.... Well the wife realized she had to go to the washroom but refused to leave the movie for fear of missing a moment of this film.<br/><br/>Like all bond films believability has to go out the door when watching and I think the shocker for me was that M was the bond girl in this film. No he did not have sex with her, but that is not a requirement to be a bond girl at all. For those who do not get it I think you need to watch it again and pay attention to what was going on and why. Think of the Daniel Craig movie's as a prequel to Dr. No and then you might start seeing the pattern. It is not about just this one movie, but all of them stringed together very well."

But this still suffers from the traditional fallbacks of ""oh look, the bad guy has everything work out for him and go according to his plan even though there's no possible way he could have control over all of these aspects."" Just once I would like to see a bad guy who isn't an evil mastermind, he just really hates one thing and does the best with what he has to defeat it.<br/><br/>But yeah, you'll probably love this movie."

Naomi Harris was a bit disappointing for me because I expected more screen time for her but Javier Bardem as Sila in my opinion was the best antagonist ever since he is the only villain who really took it over the edge and brought MI6 down, forcing them to relocate elsewhere<br/><br/>All in all, an 8 out of 10 for me but still, it won't up there in my top 5 movie of the year list"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","12","3 November 2012"," Best Bond ever, but still better to come, hopefully
","007 motion pictures hitherto are best described as ""flicks"", granted that a few of them have been enormously entertaining flicks. ""Skyfall"", finally, is one that deserved be dignified with the term ""film"". <br/><br/>The first 45 minutes of this 143 minute film sets the stage and tone and warrants a detail description. The opening scene is palpable with not only tension that comes with a thriller, but also a sense of horror, mainly because of the Gothic gloom the camera delivers. Bond (Daniel Craig) goes into a dark apartment and discovers of a bleeding agent. The audience's attention is turned immediately to a moral dilemma as an electronically-transmitted voice sternly orders Bond to ignore his dying colleague and go after the enemy. The voice we soon find out is that of M (Judi Dench) monitoring his action from MI6 Headquarters in London. When Bond emerges from darkness into broad daylight and gets picked up in a jeep by agent Eve (Naomie Harris), we soon find out that they are in Istanbul.<br/><br/>The ensuing 15 minutes of their chasing the enemy gunman brings 007 fans back into the familiar territory of the customary opening sequence. What happens during this exhilarating and ingenious sequence is best described in what Eve says to M (through electronic transmission of course) ""It's rather hard to explain, ma'am"". The sequence ends with M, while fully aware that Eve does not have a clear shot with Bond and the enemy holding each other in a gridlock atop a speeding train, orders her to take one anyway (another moral dilemma), ending in Bond plunging a few hundred feet into roaring waters. <br/><br/>What's it all about, anyway? MI6 is after a stolen disk that contains secret identities of all their agents around the world. Now this is not exactly the most novel plot, but it does not have to be. ""Skyfall"" does not offer convoluted plot twists which, frequent moviegoers will agree, have become dime-a-dozen. ""Skyfall"" offer everything else, and all in excellence.<br/><br/>With Bond dead (temporary, as anyone who has seen the trailer knows, and that probably comprises over 90% of the audience), the focus switches to M. The villain, whoever he may be, is going ferociously after M, first cracking into her security system, the blowing up her headquarters. It's only a matter to time when he cracks the code that protects the list of names he has stolen and all hell will break loose. M gets a new boss, none other than recently retired Voldemont, now in his new identity of Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), who fires her at their very first meeting, with two months' notice. Then comes the best known scene in the trailer when Bond appears in a dark corner of M's room, triggering the following exchange – M: Where the hell have you been; Bond: Enjoying death.<br/><br/>This is the real beginning: Bond's mission to go after the villain. There is just one more, simple, twist: the roles of hunter and prey are later reversed. That's all on the story. Enjoy. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig is acquired taste, commanding a wide spectrum of audience reaction from love to hate. Nothing more needs to be said. You can't talk about 007 without mentioning Bond girls. Interestingly the most important woman here is Judi Dench who can almost be billed as female lead. As support, her performance is Oscar-worthy. The two Bond girls are imbalanced. Naomie Harris first got my attention in ""28 days later"" (2004) with an impressive performance in that excellent Brit sci-fi. Her performance in ""Skyfall"" is solid and I think we'll see more of her in future 007 franchises. The new French bond girl is hardly anything more than stage prop, utterly forgettable.<br/><br/>The new Q is Ben Wiltshire who comes with an impressive resume including ""Perfume: the story of a murderer"", ""Brideshead revisited"" and ""Bright star"". He is a vital element in bringing a good balance to this new 007 franchise (Bond #24 and #25 are coming) between old and new, portraying a delightful IT wiz-kid. Albert Finney has a small role that is a little bit of Michael Cane in the new Batman franchise. Most impressive is campy, blond villain in Javier Barden, whose performance has already been compared by many to Joker in ""The dark knight"" and there is no priase higher than that. The only question is whether it will fetch him his second Oscar, and that is quite possible. <br/><br/>A particular strength in ""Skyfall"" is the spoken words. The abundance of sparkling dialogue is best represented by an exchange between 007 and Q in their first encounter. The most memorable moment is when M, in a parliamentary inquiry questioning the value of MI6, quotes some of the most loved lines in English poetry, the closing of Tennyson's ""Ulysses"". This also aptly reflects the spirit and sentiment going forward with the Bond franchise. While on this, I'm most happy with the lineup of the new M, Q and Moneypenny. Hope they'll all come back as, no doubt, planned.<br/><br/>The final praise should go to the titular set piece. ""Skyfall"" is an old house in a desolate countryside in Scotland where James Bond lived as a kid. This finale accomplished the impossible: lifting an already superb film yet another notch."
"Gordon-11","Null","3","12","1 November 2012"," A great James Bond film
","This film is about James Bond having to crack down on an invisible enemy who is terrorising the MI6 through hacking.<br/><br/>Right from the introductory scene, before the opening credits, there is already much action. No expense is spared, and no action is over the top. In just a space of a few minutes, they must have wrecked ten cars while rummaging through the heart of Istanbul. Its intensity gets the adrenaline pumping quickly. In the opening credits, Adele's song is haunting and atmospheric, building up the tension and anticipation of what is to come.<br/><br/>Learning from the mistake of the ultra fast paced ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Skyfall"" is a normal paced thriller that keeps on moving but does not lose you. It keeps you on edge throughout, but not too attention-deficit that makes you lost in the myriad of subplots. The character portrayals are great, much detail is put on making characters real. The story is thrilling and engaging, 2.5 hours breezed past without me noticing how long it was. It is noteworthy that Bond has moved with the times, as he does not rely on gadgets anymore, but on information technology. There is even a reference on how gadgets are so last century! I enjoyed ""Skyfall"" a lot, and I am already looking forward to the next Bond film."

","As title says Sam Mendes is a brilliant director he showed that in other movies and in this movie.Movie starts in the middle of the action, even then i noticed something is different, action scenes where watchable and there is no shaky camera that has been introduced in Quantum of solace by Marc Forster who betrayed trust of Bond by destroying him in cold blood. Maybe you don't need to no much about that,maybe right now all you need to know it's that that failure of Quantum of solace has not been for nothing because of that he now have new Bond movie ""Skyfall"" in my opinion Best movie ever.<br/><br/>Skyfall hand to hand combat looks fantastic,visual are great,acting is great especially Javier Bardem with his fantastic performance as Silva and i am free to say that Silva to this movie like Joker to Dark Knight. I like that they brought some old stuff i wont spoil it for ya, but you will have a big smile on your face if you are a true Bond fan.<br/><br/>Over all movie is brilliant and story is fantastic.So you have recommendation for me to see this movie.A brilliant, brilliant MASTERPIECE! 10/10!"
"jameslinton-75252","8","2","7","4 May 2016"," I was beginning to lose hope
","Finally! A James Bond film that isn't boring, predictable rubbish. I never thought I would make it to this stage. I really enjoyed Skyfall. I felt that Daniel Craig was far more convincing as Bond, he wasn't tripping over his shoelaces as he was in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. Also I really liked all of the action sequences. They weren't overdone and they were executed well. For example, I loved the shootout at Skyfall House. But Javier Bardem as antagonist Raoul Silva was by far the best part of the film. He was terrifying and Silva had such a tragic back story.<br/><br/>Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/MYvXI7"
"room102","5","2","7","10 October 2015"," Okay
","The first third of the movie felt like one of the best Bonds I've seen in years, mainly thanks to a wonderful crew (great cinematography by Roger Deakins, great score by Thomas Newman, solid direction and good stunt work). Good acting by the cast.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie felt waaaaay too long. The last third, especially, didn't feel like a Bond movie at all (like RedLetterMedia put it, it felt more like ""Home Alone""). There is no traditional main villain with a grand plan to take over the world.<br/><br/>I like Bardam, he's a good actor and although he did his best with the material he was given, and - like other said - his character felt a bit like the Joker, he wasn't intimidating like other Bond villains.<br/><br/>There are some nods to old Bond movies here and there.<br/><br/>Ben Whishaw is a good actor and I tend to like him as the new Q. Ralph Fiennes' talent is wasted. As for Judi Dench, I never really liked her as M but why did they replace her?<br/><br/>All in all, it's a okay movie. Too long and non-typical Bond, but worth watching, especially for the first third of the movie."
"LadyMysteria","10","2","7","17 March 2015"," Knocked it out of the park!!
","After the disappointing film that was Quantum of Solace, I have to say that Skyfall blew it out of the park for me. Everything about it was just amazing, the locations, the acting, the action scenes, the soundtrack, the story. It really made up for the unfortunate reception that Quantum of Solace was. I loved that we really got to see Bond in a state that I don't think we've ever seen him in before. He had to play Silva at his own game in order to beat him. <br/><br/>And that's why I think that Silva is such a great Bond villain. Because he's worked for M16 before, he knows them. How they work, and that always put him one step ahead, which made him different. Some of the previous villains felt they were one step ahead with Silva he already was. His plan had worked that even though it looked like Bond and M had won and the game was over in fact it had only just begun. That's genius. M was walking into her own grave effectively and that was all down to Silva. Kudos to the writers because it's one of the most brilliant films I've watched in a while. They've taken the franchise to whole new level and I really can't wait to see Spectre. <br/><br/>The only problem I have with it, is how Silva died. I feel like a stab in the back wasn't exactly a great villain death, but then they did the same with Le Chiffre and Dominic Greene so I suppose it doesn't really matter. It just would have been nice if M had killed him or something like that. <br/><br/>I have to give exceptional praise to Javier Bardem for playing Silva so wonderfully. Amazing actor. His scenes were great!! The cast were amazing as well!! Perhaps I'm being biased because I'm a massive Bond fan and have been ever since I was a kid, but even so they deserve a lot of credit. Great film!!"
"priscilla-ramos","8","2","7","18 January 2014"," Skyfall Review
","This is the twenty-third movie of James Bond, an agent who works for the British Security Intelligence Agency, most known as MI6. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie he, James Bond, was in a mission to recover a hard disc, that contained a secret list of infiltrated British agents; he was shoot by his partner during his fight against the mercenary and everybody though he was dead.<br/><br/>After MI6 suffered a terrorist attack, which showed the weakness of the British Security Intelligence, James Bond decided to come back to discover who did that.<br/><br/>After his resurrection, James had to do physic and mental tests to come back to MI6. M (Judi Dench), his boos, left him go back to the field; she said he was ready for this.<br/><br/>He went to Shanghai in order to find out who bought the list, again he fought with the mercenary but this time the mercenary died. In his equipments, James found a clue, a casino chip. This casino chip brought James to Macau, there he met a girl called Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) who helped him to find the terrorist. They went to the terrorist's island where she died and MI6 caught Silva (Javier Bardem).<br/><br/>When he got in MI6 prison everybody discover that he was an ex agent. Q (Ben Whishaw) tried to have more information looking in Silva's computer. Silva had already planned to be caught by MI6; he infected the MI6 system and escaped from there.<br/><br/>James found out that Silva wanted to kill M. By this information he started to hunt Silva.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best of Daniel Craig's acting. There was too much violence in the previous movies, which doesn't match with 007's style. In this movie Daniel showed a very thoughtful James Bond. And there's also a cast changing; M is not Judi Dench anymore, now M is Ralph Fiennes, Gareth Mallory in the movie. Mallory is the president of the Security and Intellicenge Committee. Eve Moneypenny and Q were finally introduced."
"alindsay-al","8","2","7","16 January 2014"," Great continuation of best modern day action films
","It is true I have never been a huge fan of James Bond but I really enjoyed Casino Royale and believe Quantum of Solace wasn't as bad as many critics believed. So now, I have finally seen Skyfall I have to admit I enjoyed this Bond film but not as much as I did Casino Royale, this Bond film really stays to its true roots but this one has more narrative to it and a much larger role to Judi Dench's character of 'M' and slightly less of Daniel Craig. This was a nice change for me because my main turn-off from the previous Bond's is the lack of narrative and most of them being the same but the new Daniel Craig Bonds has changed my opinion on future Bonds. However, that strength could also be seen as a big weakness as there are points in this film where it seems boring for a Bond film with too much of the film without Bond involved. Also, the film in my opinion is too long for a bond film. However, the positives out way the negatives with such things as the locations which are fantastically shown off, the style of these new bonds is alive with references to the past bonds in there which appeases the older generation and Javier Bardem playing the villain which was a highlight to add to the story. Overall a solid addition to the Bond franchise."
"donuthaters12","9","2","7","2 December 2013"," Exceptional Execution And A Step In A New Direction
","Let me just get this out of the way and say that I am not the most immersed fan of the Bond films, and I only properly watched Craig's interpretation of Bond. Though I am aware about the principles of the Bond films like girls, gadgets, etc. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace felt like they were trying to steer away from the principles that fueled the pre-Craig bond films. Skyfall in the other hand embraces it and spraying something new in there making it feeling fresh and unique.<br/><br/>The film was written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & John Logan. Since both Purvis and Wade have experience and knowledge of the history of Bond, they may be responsible for the genius reference moments in the film, like Q and the Aston Martin DB5. Logan on the other hand was a surprise for me as he has never written a Bond film before and isn't a frequent collaborator with Mendes. Nevertheless Logan has done well here. He has brought that imagination of thrilling and intense action sequences here that haves us hooked all the way through. The film is able to explore the argument of the traditional and contemporary approach, even more so at the end of the film, which I thought was a nice touch. The emotional drive in the film is carried not by Bond but rather by M, as the film showcases the regrets and sacrifice that M has made and the torment and suffering that others and herself it has caused. The film also surprised me by touching on Bond's past, showing us his roots and home.<br/><br/>When I heard Sam Mendes was directing this film, I knew that this was going to be handled much better and the film will feel significant and requires to be viewed over and over again. I was a bit worried on how he would handle the action element of the film as I don't really see him as the most onerous when it comes to those particular moments but he really outdid himself here with action sequences that shine and is memorable. It is the intimate moments where I appreciate Mendes' craft because he has proved it with his previous films like Away We Go and American Beauty. Mendes really understood Skyfall's characters, displaying their vulnerabilities and strengths allowing us to engross on the story and the relationships that is being explored. Mendes has accomplished in creating the most stylish Bond film yet, at least for now. The film is definitely a first step into a new phase of Bond that will define the subsequent Bond films.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins has worked with the best directors of this century and he frequently collaborates with them. Deakins has worked on every film by Mendes after Road To Perdition, except of course Away We Go. Deakins is definitely one of the crucial fraction in making this film feel and look beautiful. The highlights are the scenes that takes place in Macau and Shanghai, this is where the image makes an impression with popping colors and employing a modern style of photography. The action sequences are handled very well as Deakins and Mendes allows the stunt men or actors to show off their skills within that one shot allowing for a much more smoother experience. As the start of the film, the image feels more natural and then heads towards a more colorful approach in the scenes in Asia. The end takes a monotone palette stripping the image down with the beauty that accommodates the first three quarters of the film, correlating with the themes that Mendes was trying to project (particularly the traditional vs contemporary aspect).<br/><br/>Thomas Newman who have worked with all of Mendes' films, aside from Away We Go. Newman a lot of the times doesn't make scores that people will end up taking notice while watching the film, though there are a few exceptions like American Beauty and WALL-E, but he does have the ability to suck us in and allow us to feel the emotions that Mendes wants us to feel in selected occasions. Newman's score for Skyfall projects that and avoids the feeling of being campy even if it doesn't deviate too far from the modern day action scores. His score just works seamlessly with the traditional Bond theme that is scattered throughout which adds on to the immersion.<br/><br/>Craig comes back for his third attempt of playing James Bond and he has done a wonderful job, as expected. There may be a bit of a step back for Craig here as the emotional driven scenes are not handled by him but rather by Judi Dench as M. Dench was able to embody a character who has a lot of regrets in her life and the audience can see how fractured her soul is with people fallen under her command. Bardem was a great villain in this film, making himself very memorable and tries to outshine any actor in the scene with him. Fiennes is an actor that always brings his best in whatever role he is in and he has done so here but he was limited here in screen time. The bond girls, Naomie Harris and Bérénice Marlohe, were fantastic here. I love seeing women who can carry their own or at least bring something unique and fresh to a formula that has been recycled over and over again. Harris was a standout in balancing sexy and toughness while Marlohe on the other hand brings out the lustful desires of the audience while not being there just for a good time with Bond.<br/><br/>Skyfall is definitely a milestone for the Bond series and it sets up for a new phase in the series. If you enjoy a new twist in the same formula, beautiful photography and brilliant direction then give this one a try. I hope Mendes' 24th Bond film will just be as good as this, maybe even better."

","Skyfall ..... Somebody told me it's not all that great ... Fr tat person ----> Bond Fan always overlooks the Flaws.... Well that doesn't mean I'm going to give a biased opinion ... But i think Skyfall is a transitional phase for the Bond Series. It changes the course of Series. Let me start From the beginning...."" Let the sky fall, when it crumbles, We will stand tall And face it all together "" Adele has done wonders with Opening song, fascinating. Oh !how can we forget the Director, 'Sam Mendes' .... He showed the vision to make the Bond realistic, emotional, vulnerable. The Oscar winning director, according to me has made the way fr Skyfall to get into Oscars. The Plot gives us betrayal, revenge, Destruction, Pace and Edge on the seat .... The movie goes beyond just another mission ... It goes into the past and reveals more of Bond's back story and traumatized childhood. Daniel Craig gave Justice to the character so did Judi Dench as 'M'. Ralph Fiennes is noticeable even in his short role. I hope he carries the Legacy of such important role. Now the villain, Silva (Javier Bardem)..... He portrays the complexity of psychopath with such ease, ""HATS OFF"" ! What a dialogue delivery and cold blooded killer eyes, Quite Memorable...... The locations are spectacular, picturesque. The Art Direction and background score r satisfactory. Cinematography is stunning whether it is skyscrapers of modern Shanghai or the bleak, ancient moorland of Scotland. The movie never loses the pace neither the grip on the plot. Rest assured ... movie gives ample of stunts and thrills, Beautiful Women and the Hope to return with the BANG !!!"

","Don't get overexcited. Yes I know Daniel Craig has done a couple of other movies. But first of all, the waiting time between two Bond movies was a very long one this time around (around 5 years) and the waiting time for the real Bond was even longer. You could also write a summary line that goes: Will the real Bond please stand up? Apart from current or a bit older catch phrases from music or TV (wrestling), let's get back to what is essential. Just like the movie does. I understand that some people did not like what the movie did. But to celebrate the 50th birthday of Bond there could not have been a better movie (ok there always can be a better movie, but it's a pretty good one right here). I'm not going to reveal any plot points or other significant things that will be more than a treat for Bond lovers. There are so many gems in this one, but without forgetting to make it about a really good story.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig must have finally arrived ... at least for most of the fans. Hopefully you can finally enjoy a Bond movie too, even if you didn't until now."

","I love James Bond movies! Some of my favorites: FRWL, GF,TB, OHMSS, TSWLM, FYEO, TLD, LTK, GE, TWINE, CR!<br/><br/>Sean Connery is the man. George Lazenby was pretty good, a bit more romantic. Great final scene in OHMSS. Roger Moore, over-the-top, action-packed, fun stunts....he could be cold and serious here and there. Dalton, serious, dark, brutal, yet still some fun. Brosnan, a hybrid of previous actors but I liked him. His acting got better as the movies progressed. Too bad the scripts weren't all that great! <br/><br/>Daniel Craig! I was surprised with their choice but man was Casino Royale so good. His acting was fantastic: funny, charming, dangerous, vulnerable, sarcastic, cold, cool. The action, the romance, the script, the score, the direction = great! Quantum of Solace? Not as good but I still liked it. The story and villain aren't as interesting but there is a ton of action, nice score, great locations (Italy), Felix returns, M is great as always, the return of Tanner, strong and gorgeous Camille, Fields, opera scene, some really nice moments in here (between Bond and Mathis, and Bond and Vesper's boyfriend). <br/><br/>Skyfall: Love that song. Reminds me of the Shirley Bassey songs. The score was pretty good, Istanbul and Shanghai scenes being favorites. I liked how Newman incorporated Adele's song briefly during James' entrance in to the casino. We even hear the Bond theme here! <br/><br/>Mendes as director? A pleasant surprise as Skyfall is a winner. Great acting- Javier Bardem, Daniel Craig, Judi Dench! Javier was a fantastic villain, scary, funny, creepy, flamboyant, sympathetic, dangerous. When he took out his dentures....woah. Wish he had a fight scene with Craig! The others were great too. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Ralph Fiennes, Eve Moneypenny = wonderful, Severine was a tragic character. The cinematography was stellar! Nice job Roger Deakins. <br/><br/>The story was way more simple this time around compared to Quantum. It allowed for a slower pace and more insight into Bond's character. His interactions with Dench make for great cinema. She will be missed! The opening Istanbul sequence was one of my favorite Pre-title sequences. And the action is coherent! I also loved the Shanghai and Macau sequences. They felt very BOND. Good idea to mix it up by having the baddies invade Bond's lair. OH! And great cinematography by Roger Deakins. WOW. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig's performance is so good! He is still the Bond from Casino and Quantum yet manages to bring some Connery and Moore, maybe a little Brosnan into the mix. A layered performance. Best Bond ever???? <br/><br/>This movie combines old and new in an exciting way. There are tons of references throughout, even some Roger Moore-like moments in here (Komodo dragon fight). It was great to see the DB5 again along with a new underground headquarters and that groovy office at the end.<br/><br/>There are a few things though like a striking similarity between this and The Dark Knight, the fact that Silva and Bond never fight, some plot holes (every movie has them). <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is fantastic. If you dig James Bond, you will dig this."
"kassolson","8","2","7","17 April 2013"," The Best Bond?
","Though I found Silva's plan working-out like it did in London with the train and shooting-up scene at M's hearing as complete nonsense- totally unrealistic that such planning could come together like it did...And their going to Skyfall as unarmed as they did, though Bond assumed the guns would still be there...And why drive the bike into the side of the bridge, instead of just jumping?...<br/><br/>This may be what Roger Moore said- the best of all Bond films? Musically, the background which ran thru the movie was maybe the best. And those scenes with the Aston Martin- awesome. In fact, except for the criticisms already mentioned, I would say this was a totally awesome Bond film. I would, however, argue that Casino Royale was better, and this latest Bond was no better than Thunderball or Goldfinger, which put it in the upper-echelon, but maybe not the best."
"raphaklopper","9","2","7","15 April 2013"," Best James Bond movie??? I don't now, but probably.
","50 years, 24 films (some classics, some fun, some horrible), and finally on his 50th birthday, James Bond deliver's, in what many say is his best movie of all time, and there is much to prove it. After the weak movie that was ""Quantun of Solace"", the 007 has been absent for 4 years, many thought it would last forever, but finally in 2012 thanks to Sam Mendes, James Bond had his respect long lost, back and big.<br/><br/>""Skyfall"" is the 007 movie that we deserve, it gave us a true spectacle that has long not been seen. Joint elements of the old classic James Bond films, we see a bit of ""Dr. No"", ""Goldfinger"", ""The man with the golden pistol"", ""Goldneye"", ""Casino Royale"".<br/><br/>We see a James Bond more mature and realistic, but at the same time with the classic elements of old movies (the little tools and the jokes are mild examples). Daniel Craig is better than ever was, proving to be one of the best actors of James Bond; Javier Barden is a very clever and cruel villain, one of the best (if not the best) James Bond villains ever had. But I must mention that I see in ""Skyfall"" a lot of elements from ""The Dark Knight"", the villain is an example, all the movements of the hero were planned by the villain, and the main threat is part of a much larger plan (and even some scenes, but I will not spoil anything).<br/><br/>""Skyfall"" proves that James Bond is immortal and has much more to deliver, Sam Mendes saved the franchise and I hope he direct's the many others that are yet to come."
"A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor","9","2","7","21 March 2013"," 007 returns with a thrilling anniversary film (SPOILERS)
","When ""GoldenEye"" was released in theatres in 1995, it was praised as having supposedly rejuvenated the Bond franchise with its bold new style. In fact, the film plays very much as a big homage to the older films and really changes nothing of the tried and tested formula. Fast-forward seven years to 2002 when ""Die Another Day"" is unleashed upon fans of the series. Intended to be a celebration film that evokes the past films within a goofy science fiction-inspired plot, the film actually ends up being more of an insult to the series. It is within this context that ""Skyfall"" arrives on the fiftieth anniversary of the film series. ""Skyfall"" is not so much a celebration film but a tribute film and in that regard is far more successful than either ""GoldenEye"" or ""Die Another Day"" in commemorating the character and the series as a whole.<br/><br/>The film begins with a crackling pre-title sequence that features James Bond (Daniel Craig) and fellow agent Eve (Naomi Harris) on a mission in Turkey to retrieve a hard drive containing the names of every undercover British agent around the globe. Unfortunately, the mission goes awry and Bond is accidentally shot by Eve and presumed dead. Months later, MI6 comes under attack and Bond returns to Britain, vulnerable and in less than stellar form. His search for the still missing hard drive and the terrorist behind the attacks brings him on a collision course with a madman from M's (Judi Dench) past.<br/><br/>The film is very much about the past and present, not only of the series itself but of the characters (principally Bond and M) as well. There are references to past Bond films, but they are not overwhelming like in ""Die Another Day"". More importantly, they don't detract from the narrative, which is set in the modern day word of computers and technological wizardry. Bond is a lone warrior, using supposedly old-fashioned methods to fight terrorism and initially represents everything that the new Chief of the Committee of Intelligence Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) deems archaic.<br/><br/>There are countless contrasts between traditional and modern and the film attempts to reconcile the past with the present to inform the future of the series. The references to how long Bond has been operating are perhaps too self-conscious (not to mention puzzling considering the series recently went through a reboot; then again, continuity was never a strong point in the series), but go a long way establishing the overall message of the film. Beloved characters such as Q (Ben Wishaw) and Moneypenny finally return and their appearances more than anything demonstrates how new blood is needed in this new modernity. In the end, it works; the last scene especially is an absolute treat to long-term Bond fans, bridging old and new. After 50 years, the series has truly come full circle and is still relevant.<br/><br/>The film is obviously theme and symbolism heavy, but it works just as well as a Bond film. It is also a very British film that portrays the empire in a troubling and intriguing way. The first half is classy while the second half is absolutely brilliant. While it has an unconventional narrative structure compared to most films in the series, the elements are all assembled: there is a casino scene that is sure to go down as one of the best in the series; fight choreography suits Craig's more hard-edged Bond and is well done; the film's cinematography is stunningly beautiful and varied and Roger Deakins manages to make even the most mundane scenes engaging to look at; Adele supplies a surprisingly haunting and beautiful song that perfectly compliments Daniel Kleinman's gorgeous title sequence; Sam Mendes' direction hits all the right notes and the film never really drags; finally, Thomas Newman's score, while not reaching the level of John Barry's contribution to the series, is serviceable and makes great use of the James Bond Theme after it was slightly underused in Craig's previous two entries. The action cues are respectable even though I felt the absence of David Arnold's bombastic scores.<br/><br/>The cast itself is quite good. Fiennes, Harris, Wishaw, and Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner are a joy to watch all fit quite nicely into the plot. Bardem as the villain is a cross between Christopher Walken's Max Zorin, Sean Bean's traitorous agent 006, and Heath Ledger's Joker. He has little screen time (perhaps too little) but creates a memorable and strangely sympathetic character. Judi Dench has an unusually integral connection to the plot and is once again good, even though she has gotten a bit too much screen time in the role of M. Last but not least, Daniel Craig has finally convinced me that he is James Bond. The film very much depends on how well Craig can portray Bond's emotional inner turmoil and he rises to the occasion with a top five (perhaps even top three) Bond performance. This Bond is dangerous, charming, enigmatic, confident, and yet also so very realistic and fallible. Whether he is toasting his would-be killers or adjusting cuff links after a dangerous stunt, Craig has endeared himself to me as a fantastic 007 after two films in which he grasped the essence of the character without necessarily always conveying it. The character is a symbol of conflicted righteousness and Craig plays the part flawlessly.<br/><br/>While the problems I have with the film are small, they are nevertheless still present. The story is incredibly ambitious for an overall small-scale plot and that causes there to be some minor unexplained plot holes that never completely pan out. Silva's plan also operates on a plot that in hindsight is too coincidental and creates inconsistencies. Finally, the lack of any real location shooting in some scenes (Macau, Shanghai) is slightly disconcerting considering the history of locations in the series. Overall though, Skyfall is a welcome addition to the series that is supremely entertaining and consistently exciting to watch. 8.5/10"

","Skyfall - a bond movie that explores the psyche of bond further, with a villain whom we can see as a definite nemesis to bond. Characters being introduced to the re booted franchise and the movie finishing in the confines of the offices of Universal Exports which viewers have almost forgotten as the front for most of bonds operations. <br/><br/>More than a bond flick it is more about M. Her stewardship of MI 6, belief on her best man. M's past which keeps asking her to ""think on her sins"" and the relationship between M and bond which has often been referred to as that of a parent and an erring child.<br/><br/>Sticking to canon the movie does start with a chase which starts on foot gets a 4 wheel drive car followed by a bike chase on the roof tops of Istanbul's grand bazaar before culminating on a trains roof top but not before Bond gets shot and an obituary duly written. <br/><br/>An un named villain comes out of the shadows with a vendetta against M. After an unsuccessful bid on bombing MI6 and compromising the identity of NATO agents when the going gets tough and M is faced with an inquiry enters a resurrected bond who is living a silent life on some island. Its here we see the not often seen human side of Bond. His rigors and tests to get back onto the field. After a face off with Mallory the chief of intelligence bond travels to Shanghai. <br/><br/>After a stakeout, chase, fight sequence with an image of a beautiful yet deadly jellyfish acting as a silhouette to the action, a visit to a casino and an interesting conversation happens with the Bond girl of this movie which delves not just on bond getting the girl but also touching on fears and death. we see bonds (read M's nemesis) emerge and the movie takes a new momentum. <br/><br/>In the ruins of an abandoned island bond faces Silva who has his vendetta against M and MI6. Bond using the gadgets given by Q branch summons the cavalry and apprehends the guy. Fans are used to cutting edge gadgetry in bond movies but here its just a simple radio that he uses. <br/><br/>The scene then shifts to London where the past that is haunting M is revealed. Silva was an MI6 operative who went beyond his brief hacking the Chinese and M was forced to hand him over to the Chinese during the hand over of Hong Kong in return for 6 of her agents. Silva bears the imprisonment and after years of planning begins his revenge on M and MI6 which goes beyond the obvious. <br/><br/>As M heads out to face the board of inquiry Silva escapes leading bond through the London's underground tube. Through rush hour traffic, surviving a bomb Bond with help from a young Q realizes silva's plan and reaches the inquiry venue. <br/><br/>At the inquiry M speaks on the relevance of human intelligence. How technology is overshadowing our lives and how agents putting lives on the line no longer matters finishes by quoting Ullysses by Tennyson. Silva enters and tries to take out M. Bond intervenes at the nick of the moment and goes a step ahead of everyone and takes M with him saying ""we are going back in time, where we have the advantage"" <br/><br/>They reach skyfall the house where James bond was born and grew up not just from being a child but to the detached man that he is. There bond is left with just a few rounds in his walther ppk, a hunting rifle and a few sticks of dynamite. The wait for the arrival of Silva puts M and Bond into a conversation where he remarks that the obituary was appalling. The final showdown takes place hurting M fatally but bond manages to take silva out not with a gun or bullets but with a hunting knife. <br/><br/>The movie speaks loads of the human and fallible side of this hero which shows him as a child who faced tragedy at an early age making him the man he is, the agent who improvises and stands firm on his determination to protect M and the never say die attitude that the character actually stood for before getting lost in the gadgets of Q branch and the dropping necklines of his various Bond girls. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig looks jagged and fight worn but this perfectly fits the mood of the movie and shows Bond not just as the super spy but as the human that he is. If Casino Royale showed how bond was betrayed by Vesper this movie shows his more human side. <br/><br/>The quotes from Tennyson do keep ringing after the movie and shows how things may change and hurt yet being unyielding Bond moves on. If this movie were to be a trilogy it has very clearly set the ground for further movies and re introduced bond to the present generation. The sad part was to see Judi Dench leave the franchise but guess it had to happen, the franchise however gets Money penny back into the story. To sum it up yes the Sky did fall onto bond in this story but our man did make it through."

","Believe it or not, the only other James Bond film I have ever seen is Casino Royale. Yes people, feel bad for me if you must. But what's obvious about this series is that one doesn't have to be familiar with most of them, or even perhaps any at all. I saw Royale around 5 years ago and haven't since, but was still to fully enjoy Skyfall. Who knew Sam Mendes could direct a franchise action film like this, but he does so masterfully. On a technical level it's pretty brilliant, with a wonderful score from Newman and unsurprisingly fantastic and crisp cinematography from the God Roger Deakins. Bardem is the stand-out here. He clearly has a lot of fun with the role and it shows, and in a very strong year for Supporting Actor contenders, he might even be in the Top 5 for me."
"KieronJT","8","2","7","4 January 2013"," Best bond film ever
","In Skyfall we come across a very imperfect Bond, something we have been used to since Casino Royale & Quantum of Solace. Skyfall however does not carry on from its predecessors in terms of story or character building and really stands alone as an entry in the whole series.<br/><br/>Even though the initial plan was to form a trilogy, with the Quantum organisation being the gel that helped connect all the three films, we now find Bond on the trail of a former operative who wants to bring down Mi6. An operative who makes a somewhat homoerotic entrance to say the least.<br/><br/>Comparisons have been made between Skyfall and Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, which is apparent in the way the character of Bond and the themes normally associated with a Bond film are deconstructed and built back up again. This completely works in Skyfall as we see Bond essentially labelled as being over the hill and encouraged to step aside for a younger, better version to take his place.<br/><br/>Where Skyfall really works for me is how it works as an intelligent blockbuster, there is no action for action's sake. The story builds up to moments where the action makes sense and you feel as if it is continuing to move the story along. Of course there's nothing wrong with a silly blockbuster to pass a few hours away, but that wouldn't have been right here. Bond needed stripping down and going back to basics.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this version of Bond, at the moment I would say it stands as my favourite James Bond film. Any future sequel has a tough act to follow but the ground work has been laid for something special to happen."
"james-pallant-390-839663","9","2","7","19 December 2012"," A must see for any Bond Fan old-timer
","Having been an avid Bond fan my entire life, I had been eager to see this new release. I was very impressed indeed. I had been disappointed by Quantum of Solace but this film is far superior to that. Packed full of action that, I have to admit did feel a little cliché at times but very enjoyable nonetheless. There were quite a few scenes in London which made it feel very British and classic Bond - in fact there were a number of classic Bond references which made me smile, so watch out for that :) A twisting storyline kept be guessing what was coming but the best aspect of this film was the development of the characters - I feel like this film shows Bond and M in different lights which was very refreshing. Quite a few funny lines, classic Bond charm and wit. Overall I really enjoyed it a great deal, recommended highly to all."
"zetes","7","2","7","16 December 2012"," Good action flick, but hardly a masterpiece
","I'm not a Bond fan, but I did like Casino Royale quite a bit (the less said about Quantum of Solace, the better). Skyfall got reviews like you wouldn't believe, far surpassing anything in this series before, so I was excited to see it. It is, I must say, pretty good, though the praise seems a tad ridiculous. It's good for a Bond flick. It's nothing special beyond that. In fact, I think I liked Casino Royale better (neither is a film I'd ever bother rewatching). Skyfall is very entertaining, but there's nothing here putting it above the average blockbuster. The story is thin and rather silly, all kinds of clichés are hit upon and there are plenty of completely unbelievable stunts. Laughable moments include Bond using a terrible CGI Komodo dragon as a step-stool and characters desperately trying to escape the bad guys flipping around a flashlight in the darkness like a homing beacon. Javier Bardem gives another good baddie performance, though he comes off as kind of a Batman villain here - he's able to convince hundreds of faceless henchmen to die for his very personal cause for, I don't know, money, I guess. I hope their families got paid, anyway. I seem pretty negative, but it's only because I think it's overrated, not bad. One thing I absolutely loved was the look. Filmed by Roger Deakins, it is one of the most beautiful blockbusters I can think of."
"Rat_27","4","2","7","17 November 2012"," Walk. Take your base.
","I say that because I considered the last movie a complete strike, and the first one a tip foul. If you don't understand baseball references, that won't make any sense to you. Oh well. I would have been more impressed if this was Craig's first Bond outing, and this was the actual reboot of the franchise. I was at least amused, if not satisfied with his use of gadgets, cars and women. Yes, Bond is supposed to use women, and if you don't like that, watch something/someone else. The idea of him being softer, kinder and/or gentler is just plain wrong. Go for Jason Bourne, or Jack Bauer (interesting that they all have the same initials, no?) if you want the non-womanizer operative type.<br/><br/>The cinematography is OK. Not as good as The Spy Who Loved Me, or For Your Eyes Only. But the shots of Macau are fairly breathtaking. The acting is good, but I will have to say that the gay scene should have been cut, and whoever suggested it should be beaten severely about the head and neck area. The plot is interesting, as it does not contain a global threat like in Moonraker or The Spy Who Loved Me. There were times that I really didn't care if the antagonist won or not.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate this movie as watchable, and now important to the franchise as it contains introductions to characters of note. However, it mildly deviates from the time-honoured Bond blueprint. This could be more easily overlooked, if not for the last two movies. But this movie will be more important in the long run than Quantum and Casino Roale.<br/><br/>I was starting to get irritated with the amount of attention that has been paid to ""M"" recently, ever since the position was filled by a woman. It also seemed to coincide with the neutering of James Bond. I truly hope that we are done with that chapter.<br/><br/>Good effort, but significant room for improvement."
"ghost_dog86","7","2","7","15 November 2012"," 007 Rises
","I don't want to add to the ""Quantum of Solace"" dog pile that seems to be forming by every other critic writing a ""Skyfall"" review, but what I will say is, next to Quantum, ""Skyfall"" should be considered as the Bond franchise getting back on track; with the help of an Academy Award winning director. With Daniel Craig (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo)reprising his role as the best James Bond ever and Judi Dench (Notes on a Scandal) reprising her role as M, ""Skyfall"" (in a curious turn of events) sees Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Revolutionary Road) taking the helm, directing the darkest and most beautifully shot film of the series. Known for his intimate dramas, Mendes' rendition focuses less on getting the ""bad guy"" or on Bond girls (I am aware that Bond has multiple affairs in this film, but none of them are very prominent) and more on the internal struggles of an aging Bond. And along with the new era 007 stable of script writers, but this time excluding Paul Haggis (Crash, Million Dollar Baby) which is one of the missteps this film, ""Skyfall"" should be seen as an overall success...even if it leaves some audiences checking their watches.<br/><br/>The Plot: After a direct terrorist attack on the M16 building, Bond attempts to find out who is behind it all. But when he discovers that the perpetrator (played brilliantly by Javier Bardem) may have a direct link to M herself, his loyalty to her is truly tested. There is also a subplot, that only Mendes could get away with, dealing with British intelligence who are seen as unnecessary dinosaurs and Bond who has lost a step or two after a friendly-fire gunshot wound leaves him questioning his life as a Double O agent (I am not ruining anything that is not in the trailer or in an IMDb synopsis already). And if you think this subplot sounds a little too dramatic to be in a Bond film, then you may cringe when I inform you that this introspective storyline runs a majority of the show during the large gaps in action in the first hour or so. Suffice to say, the film does get much better after it's rather slow beginnings, culminating in arguably the best/most visually stunning final half hour yet.<br/><br/>Side Note: Even though ""Skyfall"" as a whole gets better as it progresses, I can soundly say that this is not the Bond film that will convert anybody who was not a Bond fan or British already. I am sorry to say, that due to some pitfalls this movie runs into along the way, some audiences may even find themselves becoming a bit bored.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Skyfall"" does pay homage to past (or future) films, it does contain the corny one-liners that are expected from a James Bond adventure (only this time they are even drier and more alienatingly British than in the past two Bond films) and Bond is still a womanizing, Captain save awell you know the rest. But there is an issue, which plagues ""Skyfall"" throughout. The disjointedness of many prominent scenes will undoubtedly cause confusion amidst Bond lover and novice alike. In fact, there is a major scene involving Bond, which happens within the first ten minutes (if you've seen it, then you know what I'm talking about) that is never explained, and really left me scratching my head as to what the point of that particular plot twist was (I wish I could say more, but I don't want to be accused of spoiling anything). Aside from this very distracting plot hole (one you could drive a truck through) there are other moments, when Bond ventures off on a mission and it takes two to three minutes into each scene to figure out why he is where he is, what the mission is and who the characters he interacts with are. These major lapses in story structure should be attributed to the lackluster script put forth by the normally witty Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan; a script that will mistakenly be interpreted as quite sharp because of its redeeming finale. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem: Playing not only one of the most scene stealing villains since Heath Ledger's Joker, as well as reviving what we know to be the classic Bond villain; when Bardem's character Silva is introduced around the second act, his uniquely flamboyant brand of villainy brings this movie back to life (no pun intended). I can't say this loud enough: Javier Bardem is the best part of this movie, and if anything, his flawless and award worthy performance is one of the only reasons I am recommending ""Skyfall"".<br/><br/>Final Thought: I am not claiming to be a Bond expert, or to have an intimate knowledge of Ian Fleming's characters, but as a member of the movie going public I would say that ""Skyfall"" contains one of the best Bond anthems of any Bond movie (""Skyfall"" sung by Adele) the best villain of any Bond movie and the bravest/most visually interesting direction (mostly visible in the final half hour) of any Bond film to date. But is this the best Bond film ever? No. ""Goldfinger"" is better, ""From Russia with Love"" is better and ""Casino Royale"" is one of the best. As an overall film, ""Skyfall"" is good but not great...especially not as great as many of my fellow critics, blinded by Mendes' past work, are making it out to be. <br/><br/>Follow me on Twitter @moviesmarkus"

"tonylothes","8","2","7","11 November 2012"," A little old Bond.... A little new Bond.
","James Bond has always been a sort of cut out character, I mean after twenty some odd films of which I've only see a fraction I feel like I know him just like the long lost uncle that only comes to town for thanksgiving once every five years or so. When a bar tender ask James what he would like to drink or an extremely active girl ask him whats under his coat. I've got an idea of what he is going to say. People probably identify with Bond in there own way make up stories of how he could live so many years and still look so young or get shot at so many times and still remain free of holes, all fans reinitialize and that part of what makes the character so great we want to be him for all of the reason we say are unrealistic. That is what makes James Bond....James Bond.<br/><br/>This film to me is a very good mixing of what has been done before and work as well as dazzling a little bit of a fresh tone to make it new and exciting. The film has a very good easy to follow story, without spoiling anything for you it's very easy to follow and for the most part is vary straight forward which makes it very easy to identify with the characters it gives you time to think about emotion of the character who in the past while good, where sometimes just there to get from one action scene to the next. The character are a bit more developed and the motive of the main characters is very clear. Visually the movie is quite stunning the vibrate colors and lust mix of landscapes and warm indoor quarters really set the tone for the movie and amerce you in the story. Often the story is told through visuals and colors as well which is kind of rare to see in a Bond picture. The acting is excellent everyone puts there piece of the puzzle together so well you lose yourself and believe the people you are watching are truly those characters.<br/><br/>In all Skyfall mixes the old with the new in such a way that it is a sure fire can't miss for any Bond fan and a lurking delight for those just in the mood for a good movie with a great story good acting and grand visuals."
"wapper300","8","2","7","10 November 2012"," Too much in exchange for very little.
","As a Bond film enthusiast I feel that this film has left out much of the 'Bond' quality and furthermore substituting its content with TOO much thriller/action.This film falls out of the suave bond category and into the more mission impossible-dark knight row. Bardem's performance would certainly do well in the batman trilogy,but it was too much for a Bond film,but nevertheless it was well fitted into its' genre.Regardless,many Bond questions are left hindering around?Where is the large excitement of the classic Bond-on-bond girl thrill?Where's the large impact of the Bond girl? Where was the thrill of the gadgets that's been going on for 50 years?What's with the huge story line deviating from the central figure that is Bond?The presence of the Bond spirit is sensed too little in this film.<br/><br/>Now,the entire movie is not a flop.The acting exceeds itself;perhaps one of the best Craig and Bardem performances to date; although not in line with what Bond really is. They somehow managed to form a perfect alloy of past and present,reviving the old Aston Martin to give it a flow of class and bringing forth youth with Q.I think the problem with this bond is that it categorizes itself amongst the viewers.Those who enjoy real old school,like me,would rather have something more classy,like Gold Finger or Casino Royale,leaving all the action for mission impossible or bourne.For those who like the heat then this is all yours."

","Hi guys, I am not a Bond fan. But I wanted to see this movie last Saturday because some scenes were shot in Istanbul which I came across during my visit in April 2012. Generally, it is a nice action movie that maintains the level of excitement about all the time. However, there are some instants in the movie that really can drive you crazy. Here are some that I can remember: 1. M. really did screw, everybody is against her, the enemy gets inside the MI6 and she stills keeps saying ""don't worry I'll fix this"" and nobody is authorized to dismiss her. This is stupid. Bond also hates her, because he could have died after the shooting on the train. However, he offers his obedience to that stupid unsuccessful MI6 leader like a child. 2. There are some instants that both Silva and Bond get the chance to kill each other several times but they prefer to postpone their chances till the end of the movie. For example, in the underground Bond chases him climbing the ladders but he prefers chatting with him ""bla bla bla"" instead of killing him. However in the end of the movie he throws a knife at the back instead of chatting him. Maybe he is a coward. 3. Silva the baddie keeps killing people relentlessly until the last scene where he shows remorse against both the old hunter and M.. Come on guys! What was that? He misses the hunter, unbelievable! He should have put at least two bullets in their heads and Bond should have died in a couple of seconds after he fell into the frozen lake. That would be more realistic.<br/><br/>If you ignore those silly mistakes the movie is great:))"
"Amadeus75","7","2","7","3 November 2012"," Shaken but just not the right recipe and ingredients
","With a bond movie, one can never go into the hall wanting more of the same yet also hoping for something unique and spectacular in each edition. Skyfall is an attempt to stir up something different as a genre within Bond series but for me it fails to leave any sort of indelible imprint. Right from the opening trademark action sequence, you are left hoping fervently that as the script turns the corner something more gripping, more slick, more intense, laden with twists and turns would emerge. Sadly nothing of that sort happens and it ploughs through all the usual windings . Bond going missing, checking in again, crossing paths with a mysterious exotic woman. There is a heavy role for M and it is a strong performance by the Dame as contours of a tumultuous relationship between M and Bond is set out. Daniel Craig grows older and grows into the Bond role with ease and a more humane persona is presented to the audience. Someone who is still fit yet shown with his foibles. He is no more just suave but someone who is also weary, resigned and yet a soldier and patriot. In the end, there is no standout moment, there is no pulse racing sequence, no smouldering exchanges with a strong lady character, nothing by way of a script that makes you think even a fraction. It does have some soul by way of certain relationships, by way of a rather uncharacteristic villain and Javier Bardem is superb and very assured. A word about the Bond women. Berenice Marlohe is beautiful in a not so usual way and hence I feel that she has just been marginalised and there could have been a lot more for her in this movie. Naomie Harris is a bit of a stereotype and again exchanges involving her can just about make you smile feebly. Just as the opening, the climax is very staid ""bad guys lay siege and chase the good ones outnumbered and holed up behind the lines"" and as movies closes, we are plain and simple assured of another Bond sequel and just as I started the movie and was hoping for something spectacular to emerge at every bend, I simple longed for something more and better as the credits rolled on..Maybe next time - Bond Loyalist."

","In the first shot, a man, out of focus and mostly hidden in the darkness, walks into the frame at the end of a long hallway, and the soundtrack blasts the first two, but only the first two, notes of the instantly recognizable James Bond theme song- which always makes me giggle, because I know that I'm in for a long, great ride with this film.<br/><br/>In the film's pretitle sequence, Bond is badly injured, and falls from a great height, and is then presumed dead by the British government, mirroring the ending of Ian Fleming's novel, You Only Live Twice.<br/><br/>Even after M. had nearly had Bond killed due to her rash orders, he still feels loyal to her, as news of a cyber attack in London brings him out of several months'worth of semi-retirement in Turkey, where he is met with a frigid response by M. upon his return.<br/><br/>After being re-briefed and brought back into active duty (in a sequence echoing the beginning of Fleming's final novel, The Man With The Golden Gun) Bond follows a trail of breadcrumbs and learns of the nutjob's plot to disgrace and kill M., in retaliation for something she did in her past. After several innocent people are killed in the crossfire, Bond basically kidnaps M., and takes her ""to somewhere we'll have the advantage. Where it's just us and him."", ""back in time,"" to Skyfall.<br/><br/>Skyfall. A grotesque looking structure. A two story rock house, turned black from decades of mould and mildew, enveloped in a thick fog in the Scottish Highlands, in the middle of a five square mile open field. Where Bond was born and raised. He hasn't been there in decades, not since his parents (Andrew and Monique Delacroix Bond) died, and are buried there. The open area is the perfect location, where no one can approach unnoticed, they have to come out into plain view, and no other innocent people can be injured or killed in the crossfire.<br/><br/>After an elaborate, yet somehow smaller scale, and almost intimate, climactic battle at Bond's childhood home, M. dies of injuries sustained in the end. Bond's presence did little to affect the outcome, yet the plot centres around him, Ian Fleming's antihero. <br/><br/>I never liked Judy Dench as M., but her death is very moving, very sad. The filmmakers managed to elicit sympathy from me about a character's death that I did not like. Furthermore, Bond was moved to tears over her death, where as M. seemed merely annoyed by Bond's possible death at the start of the film.<br/><br/>A small cast of main characters gives this film a more intimate vibe, as does the villain's plot of revenge, rather than world domination. Also memorable in that the villain has no gimmicky henchmen in his employ.<br/><br/>After destroying Skyfall, his childhood home, and subsequently killing the villain, Bond finally appears happy. Bond had to kill the past in order to be happy in the present.<br/><br/>Fans of Ian Fleming's literary character will recognise many references to the ending of Fleming's You Only Live Twice, and the beginning of The Man With The Golden Gun, revealing more about Bond's past than all of the previous films in this series, like his parents' (Andrew and Monique De La Croix) death when Bond was a child; he was then raised by his aunt, Charmain.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, my family died when I was the same age as Bond. I also have my childhood home, which I have not been to in years. The very thought of returning there, even to that area, greatly depresses me. Bond's parents are buried at the church on Skyfall, my dog (who I loved more than my family) is buried on the property. To further the coincidence, my backyard even faces a large church. <br/><br/>I saw this film in cinemas more than 40 or 45 times, and I never grew tired of it, nor do I even notice the two and a half hours long runtime. Best Bond film ever, and my favourite movie of all time."
"tendobear","10","3","13","29 November 2012"," Bloody Brilliant!
","Loved it, loved it, loved it! I had my doubts after watching the debacle that was Quantum of Solace, but I absolutely loved Skyfall. I think Skyfall is possibly my favourite of the Bond movies so far. I know purists out there are going to lynch me for not choosing one of the Connery-era films, but the fact is I didn't grow up watching Connery, I grew up with Roger Moore as Bond, so I never got to know the classic Bond. What I like most about the Daniel Craig Bond movies is that they are a lot more realistic, unlike the Moore and Brosnan ones. The crises in the Craig-era movies can actually happen in our reality (some might actually be happening right now) which makes it scary. I think the choice of director really made a difference here; Mendes has that good balance of visual flair, attention to character and story, and keeping the action tight and intense (a la Bourne). While Solace director Marc Foster is more suited to the smaller, intimate, agenda-driven dramas. Craig is on usual good form, I like Craig as Bond because we can relate to him; he puts on a tough demeanour, but his eyes betray his vulnerability. Judy Dench does a great job as M; I'm glad she gets more to do in Skyfall than just bark orders at Bond and covering his arse. Another sigh of relief is how subdued the women are in Skyfall. Usually the women take up too much screen time and are there just for eye-candy, although as a guy I love that, but it's very distracting! Javier Bardem is on creepy mode that makes his Chigurh character in No Country for Old Men seem tame by comparison; here's a guy who's actually a threat with brains and brawn to match. Ultimately, it's bloody brilliant!"

"khfan250","9","3","13","12 November 2012"," The Best, and Only, James Bond Movie I've Ever Seen!
","You read correctly, folks: This is the first James Bond movie that I've seen, at least all the way through. I guess that's not technically true; I guess I have seen one or two on television, but to be one hundred percent honest, they were pretty forgettable. However, if every Bond movie was like ""Skyfall"", then I'd go out and buy the entire collection. <br/><br/>Honestly, I had no intention of seeing this movie. I saw the trailers, which looked pretty cool and also had the fortune of having Javier Bardem in them, but they didn't really impress me to such a degree that I'd actually go ahead and see the movie. But, as it turns out, I received an invitation from a friend to go and see it. And I came out of the theater satisfied.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes said in an interview that ""The Dark Knight"" was a huge influence on this new installment in the Bond franchise and it really does show. This movie has deep emotional layers to it, alway staying a step ahead of its audience without entirely alienating them. The camera angles are very unique and really add something to the film.<br/><br/>The nice thing about James Bond is that he's a staple of pop culture to such a degree that I already knew the character before I entered the theater. He's very suave and elegant, but also very hardcore and awesome. And Daniel Craig plays the part very well.<br/><br/>Since I mentioned him when talking about the trailer, you could probably guess that I am a Javier Bardem fan. And he plays a villain that is so intimidating and so confident in how awesome he is, that he literally blows all other villains out of the water. There's a scene in a jail cell between him and M (played masterfully by Judi Dench) where he is so scary that it might as well have been Hannibal Lecter standing in that cell.<br/><br/>Final verdict: I have no complaints about this film. Yeah, there's definitely some stuff to nitpick, but seeing as I'm not that type of person, Skyfall, to me, is a modern day masterpiece. The only reason it gets a 9 instead of a 10 is because I only score movies a 10 if it's one of my favorite movies. Still, if you're a fan of James Bond, I don't know how I could give this a proper recommendation since I haven't seen the other movies. But if you're looking for a great action movie that's a little deeper then you have been lead to believe, Skyfall is the film for you. It's one of the best movies of the year."
"jackmatlock15","10","3","13","10 November 2012"," You'll laugh, you'll scream, you'll cheer and you'll cry; ""Skyfall"" has it all.
","Even after 50 years, James Bond still has it.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig reprises the iconic role as the world's favorite super-spy in ""Skyfall"", the 23rd 007 film overall and 3rd to star Craig. The plot follows a decrepit Bond as he has to track down a villainous cyberterrorist, who is targeting MI6.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, this film gets rolling. The opening teaser is arguably the best in the series, with Bond and MI6 operative Eve (Naomie Harris) chasing an assassin (Ola Rapace) through Istanbul by car, motorcycle, and train. Battling the assassin on top of a train, Bond is accidentally shot by Eve, and presumed dead. After M (Judi Dench) finds that MI6 is under attack, the need for Bond is greater than ever.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes directs his action sequences surprisingly well. Mendes has a great way of making every shot, even if it is a boring, long shot of nothing, beautiful and engaging. Part of this goes to cinematographer Roger Deakins, for every single shot if sharp, clear, and beautiful. Bravo to these guys. Great job.<br/><br/>Of course, Daniel Craig kills it as Bond. He just seems to be getting better and better as 007. Javier Bardem is a true monster as the devilish villain Silva, who is rather frightening and disturbingly diabolical. The ""Bond girls"", Naomie Harris and Berenice Lim Marlohe, are both good, but are rather underused. I understand why they weren't in the movie for a very long period of time, but I can't help but ask for a little bit more screen time for the Bond girls! Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw are both standouts in there supporting roles, with the latter making Q relevant again. Oh, and not to forget Judi Dench, giving her best performance as M since ""GoldenEye."" She's awesome.<br/><br/>The story, albeit very linear, is actually refreshingly simple after the headache-inducing complexity of ""Quantum of Solace"". The script does have its imperfections at times, including a third act that has been heavily criticized. I, personally, loved the third act. Yes, it is a bit flimsy, but the action and intensity overshadow the logic. (NOTE: All you die-hard Bond fans out there, be looking for all the subtle references to other adventures in this. Its full of easter eggs)<br/><br/>THE VERDICT ""Skyfall"" is a memorable and action-packed film. It is most definitely the best film of 2012 since ""TDKR"". Filled with snappy dialogue, a great story, and a lead performance that you're likely not to forget, ""Skyfall"" is the best Bond ever."

","I saw ""Skyfall"" today WITHOUT reading a single review....very unusual for me. I usually read all of the reviews including other users who have also seen the movie. First of all, it is SOOOOOO much better than the last Bond film.......by a very large margin! The plot is a little hard to swallow but the action was fast and furious. The new ""Q"" Ben Whishaw is not only very handsome but quite intelligent. Javier Bardem was a creepy, sick and twisted villain. The locations were per usual Bond films all over the world with standout action sequences. All in all, critics are wrong!

"HelenMary","6","3","13","8 November 2012"," missing the tongue in cheek humour, silly gadgets and kitch cheesiness
","This was a great 50 year Anniversary Bond film. I'm a fan of Daniel Craig as Bond; he's cold, detached and looks rather beat up most of the time (not pristine) just like the Bond in the books. Him and Judi Dench are great together, with Dame Judi as the irrepressible M. This film sees a new Q who's quite a nice addition but he didn't have the gadgets and gizmos - the silliness - we come to expect from previous Qs. The stunts in this are awesome; the stunt bikers need a whole heap of awards and the scene on the train roof was brilliant and some of the fight scenes were worthy of a Bourne movie, however, something is missing from the modern Bonds that I miss and I think it's the tongue in cheek humour. Craig's Bond is probably nearer to the books and a real-life Spook/Ghoul but the kitch cheesy one-liners and the over the top innuendo of Bond's conquests is lost. Yes, the films are slicker, faster, darker and smoother but I can't give the film the high marks that it perhaps deserves. I also find all the product placement really annoying; Bond has always been a big business and a franchise but I think it's gone too far.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem was the star of this show, he was really creepy, mad and unrecognizable in the guise of crazy-freaky blonde bad-guy! Berenice Marlohe was stunning. Scotland views were beautiful and we learn a little about Bond's back-story and I love that Craig as Bond is broken and more than a little messed up rather than pristine like Roger Moore! The story was sadly lacking, not much suspense (courtesy of in depth trailers) and whilst I don't usually notice them I saw a lot of continuity errors and silly mistakes. Annoying.<br/><br/>For a Bond film, it's great, fabulous entertainment and I'd recommend it. As a film generally, I'm giving it 6/10"

I think this is the first film where I found myself glad I ""wasn't"" him.<br/><br/>I personally didn't care for Javier Bardem as the villain.

"andrew-huggett","9","3","13","6 November 2012"," Best Bond since 'The Spy Who Loved Me'
","A much, much better Bond than the previous entry 'Quantum of Solace' which in my view was truly awful. The cinematography and editing of this film is ten times better, the humour is back and there's a splendid villain. The storyline is fairly original for Bond and very gripping — even though the running time makes this one of the lengthier entries in the series. All the locations are well used to advantage and there's not too many of them (a problem with some earlier Bond's – too many exotic locations can start to make the films look like travelogues). I particularly liked the Scottish location at the end of the film and the way darkness fell. The soundtrack is much better than the last few films and I was pleased they played the James Bond Theme properly when we see the DB5. There are some strange continuity issues between this film, the rebooted Casino Royale and the original series surrounding the DB5 - but these are entirely forgivable and enjoyable. My only criticism is that I wish the makers would put the gun barrel sequence back at the start of the film and not at the end (it should appear immediately after the MGM lion). One of the most exciting, heart-pounding cinema experiences was to settle down, see the curtains pull back, hear the Bond theme and see the gun-barrel move across the screen. You then KNEW you were about to be treated to a larger than life, escapist film experience. The main titles — over the theme song performed by Adele — are well done (matching the style of the classic Maurice Binder graphics) and hinting in a slightly surreal way what is to follow in the main film. In my view this film nearly equals From Russia With Love, Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me as being the best Bond to date and that in some ways the gritty characterisation of Bond as played here by Daniel Craig - better matches Fleming's own portrayal of Bond. Sit back and enjoy - Bond is Back in Action Again!"
"sanddragon939","10","4","20","2 November 2012"," A Golden Bond for the Golden Jubilee!!!
","Fifty years ago, Sean Connery first walked onto screen as the suave and sophisticated secret agent, James Bond, 007-looking dapper in his tuxedos, swilling down his vodka martinis 'shaken not stirred', bedding a bevy of alluring women and dispatching England's enemies with cold dispassion. In the decades since, 007 has taken on spies and counter- spies, crime lords, nefarious international organizations, and megalomaniacs who seek to destroy the world! But the 50th anniversary outing, 'Skyfall', isn't about any of that. Well, actually, it DOES touch upon those iconic elements, and many others, but above all, it is an insightful piece of self-introspection by the franchise about its lead character and his relevance in contemporary society.<br/><br/>'Redundancy' and 'resurrection' are the twin themes that drive the narrative of this film, as Bond, M, and the very concept of intelligence agencies are all deconstructed and deemed to be redundant. 'Skyfall' is thus the story of their resurrection, as they rise from the ashes to meet the seemingly insurmountable challenges that face them and persevere. Their antagonist, Silva, too has had a 'resurrection' of his own, albeit of a darker variety...<br/><br/>Another underlying theme which the movie keeps returning to is the adage that often, the 'old ways are best'...a fitting meta-textual reference to the age-old traditions of the Bond franchise, many of which are revived for this installment. The conflict between old and new is best reflected in the banter between veteran field agent Bond and tech-whiz 'Q'...and much as the two learn to work together through the course of the film, the old and new seamlessly merge together in this film in the broader context of the franchise.<br/><br/>Beyond the themes and sub-texts, the film boasts of some stunning locales-the scenes in Macau are virtually scenic pornography!-mind- blowing action sequences, and some good old fashioned dry humor. And of course, the brilliant performances by Javier Bardem (who's Silva owes as much inspiration to Heath Ledger's Joker as it does to classic Fleming- esque bad guys), Judi Dench (as masterfully imposing as ever in the character of M), Ben Whitshaw (a younger avatar of the beloved character Q), Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, and last but not the least, Daniel Craig. Craig has really come into his own as Bond now...no longer is the 'new' Bond...he IS Bond, pure and simple; ready to save the day for a few more thrilling cinematic escapades...<br/><br/>Ultimately, 'Skyfall' is everything the 50th anniversary of any film franchise should be (not that there are any others that can boast of this distinction thus far!) Willing to respect the old while welcoming the new, it has brought the series full circle, figuratively AND even literally (as shall be evident to anyone who watches it)...reminding us not only of who Bond is, but why he has endured for five decades and will hopefully endure for several more to come!"

","This film's got it all, a story, fighting, drama, great and unbelievable actors..! Only a little short on the bedroom action. The link is being made between the more 'hollywoodish' action movies, that Bond's had become, and the old, real Bond. A new start for proper British spying and action. With hardly any technological progress and even a little decay, 007 is back! The cast couldn't have been better, Daniel Craig, but also the new 'bad guy' Javier Bardem play their parts beautifully. But in my opinion a movie does not only rely on its main characters, but even more on the actors in more modest roles. In this movie I'd like to point out the almost perfect acting of Judy Dench, Ralph Fiennes (yes, Voldemort) and Albert Finney! After all a true true Bond, and as i see it: a new beginning!

"paultreloar75","9","4","20","26 October 2012"," Explosive pens?
","This is brilliant. No other way to describe Sam Mendes archetypal and utterly brilliant Bond vision. His skills as a dramatist come to the fore, so that the action moves along at a frenetic pace, but never rushed. The homage to what's gone before is handled so well, he makes you smile and reminisce and enjoy a feature that does everything you want it to very well.<br/><br/>The action sequences are riveting, the story is thin (but this is Bond), some of the acting isn't all that. But these are minor details in a most absorbing Bond tale. Adele's theme tune sets the scene very well after a pretty good chase through Istanbul, London has never looked sexier, let alone the far East.<br/><br/>It's Bond-by-numbers essentially, but that's a damned good thing in this case. As well as the Bond reverence, Mendes has messed about with some recent classics, so you should spot Raiders of the Losr Ark, Silence of the Lambs, the 39 Steps, and Apocalypse Now at least.<br/><br/>This is everything you want a Bond movie to be. Great stuff."

"naughtyjimmy","10","4","21","6 November 2012"," This is exactly how 21st century Bond/action movies should be made.
","**SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD** <br/><br/>I don't often write movie reviews. But today, I feel compelled to.<br/><br/>I was dismayed by the previous installment, Quantum of Solace, which was an obvious copycat of the Jason Bourne flicks. It was painful to watch with its shaky camera-work, stroboscopic editing and incomprehensible storyline (I had the feeling the producers decided the plot was something accessory). Actually, the same thing can be said of most action thrillers churned out by Hollywood nowadays: just one action scene after the other, without any plot, let alone any depth whatsoever; they're just disposable products for the average moviegoer more interested in eating his pop-corn or answering his cellphone during the screening than in following a storyline worthy of the name. Typical of the dumbing down of today's society.<br/><br/>In stark contrast, Skyfall is the Bond movie I had been waiting for for ages. It stays true to the Bond mythos while daringly breaking new ground never seen before in Bond flicks. A more realistic plot drawing its roots in today's headlines. For the first time, a Bond flick has noticeable political thriller overtones. Settings remarkable for their lack of glamor, at least in the second half. A woman in her 70s as both ""the Bond girl"" and a motherly figure to Bond. Smarter dialog with more depth, nevertheless with the odd typical Bond one-liner. Clever editing and beautiful photography, perhaps the most beautiful in the Bond series. Memorable performances, especially from Daniel Craig, Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes. Perhaps for the first time in the Bond franchise (with the notable exception of Timothy Dalton), the characters are fully-fleshed and NOT mere cardboard cutouts. I really hope we'll see in the next movie more of Fiennes' no-nonsense character, deft at playing power games in the corridors of high government (an ambiguous character reminiscent of the bad guys of Ken Loach's ""Hidden Agenda""). The relationship between Bond and M is also delved into with brilliance.<br/><br/>As a longtime Bond fan who's always considered Timothy Dalton's rendering of Bond as the most hard-edged and closest to Ian Fleming's depiction of 007, I consider Skyfall to be the most mature, the most adult-oriented, the most beautifully crafted Bond movie. But just like Timothy Dalton's Bond didn't appeal to mainstream audiences, I fear Skyfall is too serious and too smart for the average moviegoer. I am concerned the producers might decide for the next installment to go back to the campy/light-hearted tone of the Roger Moore/Pierce Brosnan eras that was more crowd-pleasing.<br/><br/>The infallible superman Bond with no physical nor psychological flaws whatsoever is something of the past. Many people will disagree with me, but Skyfall should be the mold for the Bond movies of the future."
"em_dem60","10","4","21","2 November 2012"," Masterpiece
","Being a teenage girl, I've always thought Bond was pretty good- I remember watching 'Goldfinger' on TV at about the age of five or six- however over the years I never really paid attention to it all- I always liked it, but I wasn't fanatic about it. I saw 'Casino Royale' on DVD, but I have never seen Quantum of Solace. I have also seen Dr No, but none of the other films.<br/><br/>My mum booked IMAX tickets for me, her, my dad and my boyfriend- I went to see it today, and absolutely LOVED it. Daniel Craig is absolutely fantastic and his performance in this movie is outstanding- everything from the many excellent stunts and action scenes to the more quiet moments such as when he was talking with M (who by the way, was brilliant, but of course, it's Judi Dench, so obviously she was brilliant).<br/><br/>The opening credit scene was obviously fantastic- already in love with the song before I went to see it.<br/><br/>The cinematography was beautiful- the locations were absolutely stunning, especially Scotland (whether they actually shot it there or not I don't know).<br/><br/>And of course, not only the trademark gun was back, but the trademark car was back- I quite like cars but I am not a petrol head like my father, but even I grinned like the Cheshire Cat when the garage door opened to reveal this beauty of a vehicle.<br/><br/>So overall, the film was AMAZING. If you're thinking of going to see it, go. You will most certainly not be disappointed. Nicely handled 007!"
"Jeeves_14","8","3","14","8 November 2012"," Skyfall in IMAX
","Skyfall in IMAX was a blast. You should all know, however, that this movie was not originally shot with IMAX cameras, it was converted after the fact. The result was still amazing though. While not as crystal clear as movies actually shot on IMAX, we still get to see 26% more of the original captured footage. The IMAX experience of Skyfall was definitely worth it, with the huge picture and extremely loud and immersive surround sound. From all the reviews out there already, I was expecting this Bond to go a little deeper emotionally, psychologically, and historically into Bond and M's back-stories. You do get a little new material as far as the characters are concerned though. Instead, we get a really good action movie. I appreciated that Skyfall had a slower, more in-control pace unlike Quantum of Solace which, while enjoyable, was just action scene after action scene. The action in Skyfall ranges from fast and chaotic to slow and jazzy like an old school spy movie. I did notice that there was a serious lack of shaky camera movement. For several of the fights you can actually tell who is hitting who and what kind of moves they are doing. It was refreshing. The cinematography was beautiful and took advantage of all the filming locations. The surround sound was exciting. And the music had its own touch while throwing in deliciously generous bouts of the original Bond music. There are several nods to older Bond movies that were fun to discover and at the same time the movie fits in perfect with Craig's other two outings as 007 with his same character continuing to grow and learn. The main bad guy wasn't too scary in my opinion. His quirks almost make you like him. He is definitely evil, but I was never really afraid of him. He did an amazing job and was a different take, so that was nice. Last but not least, how is this movie content/parental concern-wise? It deserved the PG-13 rating it received. Going into Skyfall I was a bit nervous about all the sex scenes and opening music sequence that Bond movies always have. The sex scenes were basically what you see in the trailers with just a few more seconds of footage. The opening musical credit sequence also was not that bad, you definitely don't see as much as in other Bond movies. There were a few outlines of obviously naked women, but they were brief and not that detailed. As Far as violence is concerned, it was PG-13 spy violence with lots of gunshots and punching and explosions etc. Nothing too graphic here. (No naked torture scenes like in Casino Royale). And there was one ""F-word"" which was actually not that clearly uttered. Other than that, the rest of the swearing was far below normal PG-13 par. Thanks for reading, now go enjoy another awesome Bond movie!"
"Howlin Wolf","10","3","14","7 November 2012"," What do you do when the sky falls?
","If some would take issue with it being described as one of the best Bond films of its generation (although I think that this is correct) then I submit instead that perhaps it IS the most relevant.<br/><br/>Issues of fealty, the necessity of our security services, and the changing face of global terrorism are all themes that are explored. Our hero is forced to confront the fact that he is expendable, and to acknowledge his place as a cog that's part of a much larger machine... The villain takes entirely the opposite perspective, which makes for an interesting ideological clash.<br/><br/>Indeed, no-one is invaluable, and 'M' questioning her conduct leads to a much more prominent role for Judi Dench, and meatier interaction between her and her agent, which is no bad thing.<br/><br/>However, the cost of this is that Bardem's villain is woefully underused... Bardem is such a good actor that it almost doesn't matter, and I get that the laser focus of his mission makes extrapolation unnecessary... but he gets so much build-up, courtesy of his associates... Then, when he finally appears, although he's not exactly a pussycat, he is a little one-dimensional; an insane, Lecter-like baddie - more horror-film shocking, than a ruthless megalomaniac.<br/><br/>There has been a recent sea-change from over the top action to something approaching character-study, though... and I applaud that. Bond may no longer be lovelorn, as he was previously in QOS, but he's still an existential loner, and it suits the icy reserves of Daniel Craig quite well... Bond was faced with proving he's a man for his times, and the verdict is: 'Cometh the hour, cometh the man!' If you want to prove you're still up to the job, you have to go back to basics... and it's 'mission accomplished', as far as this film is concerned."

"bob the moo","Null","4","22","10 November 2012"," A little more serious than it warrants at times but generally engaging Bond thanks to the talents of those involved (SPOILERS)
","When I saw the previous Bond film (Quantum of Solace) I did quite like the more serious edge to it, but remember feeling like the bits between the action were still only the bits between the action and that none of it really amounted to much. With Skyfall this direction has been taken further and we end up with a film that is surprisingly light on action and heavy on thematic content. Neither of these things work quite as well as I would have hoped but generally it makes for a much more serious Bond film with some interesting things going on.<br/><br/>I say it doesn't totally work though because, in my view it doesn't; there is an odd lack of impact with the action sequences and there is an odd lack of satisfaction from the film as a whole – even as I enjoyed it I was surprised by how infrequently it thrilled me as a film. Opening with a punchy action sequence that leads into a visually strong title sequence, the film then slows down a little to focus on M as much as on anyone else. Her decisions, her mistakes and the consequences of both are key to the film and it was a theme I liked a great deal; there is a lot around this in dialogue and also in the characters (with the most obvious being the motivation of the villain). While the damage done to him by M is key to the plot, the damage done to Bond is also a constant through the plot, with the two men very close in some aspects. There is a lot of meat here although it must be said that, while serious, the film doesn't totally make the most of it and I would have liked more dialogue sequences like the couple delivered in the first meeting between Bond and Silva, and between Silva and M. At times the film doesn't make the most of it and as a result it seems serious and slow for the sake of it, rather than it really being rewarding as such.<br/><br/>In combination with this serious air, the action seemed pared down in terms of bravado and fun; I liked the serious air that has come to the films with Craig's tenure but I would have liked a bit more of the type of action we saw in the opening sequence. There is still plenty to enjoy but some of the action lacks spark and I can understand those who see the conclusion of the film to be a bit of a weak affair in terms of payoff (although personally I liked it). It doesn't help that some of the writing is poor when it comes to events – the ability of Silva to have planned for everything (for example, the exact chamber where Bond would catch up to him in the underground) is generally just ignored while other leaps (Bond's survival, recovery and return doesn't get any context at all) are just written off as the cost of doing business; in Moore's Bond perhaps these would be less important, but in this more serious film such convenience stands out.<br/><br/>The film still works though and in a bit part it is down to the talents of those involved. Although more could have been done with it, Craig, Dench and Bardem all make the most of the themes. Craig is best when struggling and he makes for an engaging Bond. Dench seems to appreciate the material to be more than just a supporting character and she does very well, but it is Bardem for me who really makes the film. His performance delivers on the serious content while also providing a cold yet camp menace throughout and he is able to bring the mental damage and rage through frequently. He is a great character and, while the serious tone occasionally makes the others seem a bit stiff, he is never affected by this. Harris is not as well used as I would have liked and doesn't fit that well, but Marlohe is enjoyably tragic. Fiennes is a good addition too. This acting talent is reflected technically too; I'm not totally sold on Mendes as the director here, but Deakins as cinematography is a great move because the film looks great from start to finish whether it is the dull atmosphere of a small Scottish church, or the neon confusion of a fight in a Shanghai tower block; I don't know who edited but this is also strong and makes the most of the visuals.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a strong Bond film though. It steps further from the gadgets and silliness of the franchise than any other film and it mostly makes it work thanks to the abilities of those involved. Some of the writing isn't as good as the tone of the film suggests and some of the action is less exciting than it should have been, but it still works. Not the crowd-pleasing Bond that many will be looking for, but a stronger and more interesting film for it."
"filipemanuelneto","9","2","8","5 April 2016"," A work of art, in the fifty years of the Bond franchise
","Directed by Sam Mendes and produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, it has script by Robert Wade, Neal Purvis and John Logan. This is the twenty-third film in the franchise and the third in the new era of James Bond, embodied by the participation of Daniel Craig as 007. It inherits the central cast of the previous films, which joins Ralph Fiennes, in the role of Gareth Mallory, Naomie Harris, in the role of Eve Moneypenny, Bérénice Marlohe in the role of bond- girl Severine and Albert Finney in the role of Kincade. This film marks the end of Judi Dench in the role of M (although she appeared on video in the movie ""Spectre""), and the resurgence of the character Q through the talent of Ben Whishaw. The role of the villain was handed to Javier Bardem.<br/><br/>In this film, James Bond will protect the MI6, threatened by a huge leak that compromised the lives of several agents in the field, but he quickly finds that the responsible is pursuing directly M, and that they have scores to settle related to her past.<br/><br/>This is one of the most impressive Bond films since the sixties. Rotated and released during the celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the franchise, it couldn't avoid the good memories, some of which have an important role in the plot, as happened to the ""old"" Aston Martin DB5 that Bond used in several films since ""Goldfinger"". Daniel Craig was excellent, giving life to a mature agent, unable to field missions under normal conditions, despite his perseverance and willpower. And if Judi Dench showed, in other films, that she is a tough and demanding boss, she showed now as she was also careful with her agents and her work. It's interesting and moving to see the way that she and Bond gradually collaborated, despite his arrogance and her criticism. Ben Whishaw surprised in the role of Q, giving his character a breath of fresh air and a much more realistic approach, appropriate to the age of technology. The villain, however, exceeded expectations. Bardem surpassed himself, and all he had shown in previous works. He could truly give life to his spiteful, vindictive and almost effeminate character. From here, the sky is the limit for this actor and the doors are open for any project he chooses. Interestingly, this is one of the few Bond movies where bond-girls lose their usual relevance, but it wasn't negative. By seeing the movie we will not miss them. The opening sequence is, in my opinion, very impressive and one of the best in all the franchise. It's accompanied by the song ""Skyfall"", composed and sung by Adele, one of the best British singers of today. With this song, she got an Oscar and one of her biggest hits to date."
"aweidensall","10","2","8","26 March 2016"," Bond is back and better than ever!!
","I've been reading a lot of the reviews on here and I am astonished over how many people bashed Skyfall. Saying things like it's the worst Bond movie ever. Really people??!! Let's get real here. If you want to talk about worst Bond movies ever watch all the Roger Moore Bond movies. Skyfall blew me away when I went to see it. I've always been a Bond fan. I loved Casino Royale! Daniel Craig encompasses everything that Bond is and stands for. Quantum of Solace sucked. Skyfall is by far the best Bond movie yet. It's a much darker Bond film. A lot of people have issues with that. If you want lighthearted and camp watch Roger Moore. I really enjoyed this movie. For the first time you get a glimpse into Bond's past. I really liked that. You have a great villain that isn't to over the top like so many Bond villains before him who want world domination. Javier Bardem was amazing and very creepy as Silva. He played a villain that you can sympathize with and totally understand why he's doing what he's doing. He's definitely the best Bond villain yet. It was nice to see Moneypenny and Q introduced. Another thing I loved about this movie was the opening title song by Adele. WOW!!! Such a beautiful and powerful song. It's easily my all time favorite Bond song. Skyfall was such a breath of fresh air. I don't understand why so many people hated it. It's an intelligent Bond movie with a great story and is more grounded in reality that what we are used to. It is a darker Bond for sure but I prefer it that way. That's how Ian Fleming wrote him. If you want to watch a good Bond movie ignore all the naysayers and check it out. The name is Bond... James Bond"
"pyrocitor","10","2","8","20 March 2016"," ""Resurrection"" is the new mid-life crisis
","No one would ever expect James Bond to age gracefully - or even age at all. Nearly 20 years after Judi Dench's M first hissed his ""sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War"" epitaph, and ten since his 40th anniversary proved so gaudily juvenile it prompted a franchise reboot, 007 is still endeavouring to validate his own continued existence. Enter Sam Mendes, one of the industry's most venerated working filmmakers, to help lend Bond's 50th some dignity and he kills Bond off before the opening credits. Goldfinger would be so proud. <br/><br/>That Bond returns, reinvigorated by the soulful strains of Adele's outstanding theme, is no surprise. But how he returns, brushing aside phoenix metaphors with Craig's trademark disdainful grimace, is truly extraordinary. Peerlessly mature, emotional, thrilling, Skyfall sets a new precedent for the consummate Bond film, excelling on every possible front, and exceeding the sum of its component parts, thanks to Mendes' careful mediation of a cat's cradle of seething emotional turmoil. Pulse-pounding chases, blistering fist fights and shootouts, casual sex and pithy wit aside, Skyfall is a film about legacy, reconciling the open wounds of the past, and challenging the myth of the valourized super-agent amidst bureaucratic accountability - a long, hard look at what 007 the 21st century needs, or if we even need him at all. Spoiler alert: we do, and Mendes' astounding work here is enough to leave even the most stubborn holdouts leaving with the Bond riff blaring in their heads.<br/><br/>The plot of Bond hunting for a cyberterrorist gunning for MI6 might appear initially safe territory, but we swiftly learn that nothing is as it seems. In the hands of Mendes, all of the normal 'safe' Bond archetypes are destabilized: M is this episode's 'Bond girl', familiar names and titles are masked by unfamiliar faces, and arch-fiend Silva is too sympathetic to be reduced to the usual cartoon stereotype. In short: nothing and no one is safe, and it makes for far more fresh, vibrant viewing than the usual 007 routine. It's also easily the most aesthetically gorgeous 007 ever, as Roger Deakins makes the panoramas of Shanghai, Macao, and the Scottish highlands burst into life with breathtaking light shows and sumptuous splashes of colour (the ""jellyfish"" framed silhouette fight is pure, undiluted cinematic pleasure). Similarly, Thomas Newman's score blends everyone's favourite thematic 007 leitmotifs with a dazzlingly rich array of background textures, driving the film with furious momentum while also colouring it with a reflectively melancholy undercurrent. And if all that isn't groundbreaking enough for you: Bond even hints at a gay experience. This truly is the 21st century. <br/><br/>That said, the dramatic purist Mendes also proves to have a wicked sense of fun, and pairs the rich emotional storytelling (yes really) with some of the most inventively batty 007 thrills yet. While some of the earlier moments of subterfuge tow the line of being a touch too leisurely, we're still spoiled with the creatively bombastic thrills of Bond driving a backhoe through a train, leaping off a komodo dragon, blowing up the better half of the London underground, and even getting to bomb around in his old Aston Martin DB5 in the film's sole, and utterly gleeful, piece of fan service. It's not absolutely flawless: Silva's master plan leans somewhat too heavily on The Dark Knight - slightly too convoluted not to strain credibility, even for 007 - while the climactic pyrotechnics-fest, though electrifyingly breathless, is somewhat harder to take seriously once the words ""Home Alone"" are uttered (oops). Still - this is utterly top-notch entertainment, and, paired with the far higher emotional stakes than the average Bond, it's unsurprising to find yourself relaxing from the edge of your seat far more often than expected. <br/><br/>Still, Mendes is very much an actor's director, and it's in the film's performances he contributes his most invaluable work. Already firmly established, Craig effortlessly wears Bond like a tailor-cut tuxedo here, his tawny listlessness and debonair muscularity the subtle tells for his carefully buried inner fraying. Physically and emotionally battered, with ""why not stay dead"" forebodingly echoing, Craig manifests vulnerability through a disarming 'don't give a sh*t' jocularity, perfectly making Bond's wit his own without resorting to the arched eyebrow of Moore and Brosnan. Squaring off against him, Javier Bardem's Silva is a unexpected pleasure of a threat. Cheeky, playful, sickening, raw, and dangerous, Bardem's massive charisma is ferociously commanding, as he blends the best bits of GoldenEye's warped agent trope and the megalomaniacs of the 60s with a performance as dazzlingly flamboyant as his hair, and an unforgettably chilling walk-on opening monologue. If there's a more compelling 007 arch-nemesis out there, we've yet to encounter them. <br/><br/>The wonderful Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, and Ralph Fiennes all lend endearingly lovable support as the new MI6 family, each triumphantly owning their beats of sardonic humour. Bérénice Marlohe exemplifies the 'Bond girl' blend of silkily seductive, dazzlingly gorgeous, but with a winning dash of fervent, haunted pathos, in a too-short appearance, while Albert Finney is hilariously gruff in a cameo one can't help but speculate was originally intended for another crusty Scot with 007 ties. Still, the real star is the show is Judi Dench - fittingly, in her 007th time reprising her character. Dench has always been class incarnate, but this time, beneath the icy repartee we get a sense at the truly human resolve fuelling her unflinching dedication to country and getting the bloody job done. It's a genuine pleasure to spend so much time with such an incomparable performer here. <br/><br/>Stylish, confident, emotional, and phenomenally fun, Skyfall proudly rears its head as a toss-up for the best Bond film yet. Better yet: in Mendes' masterful grip, the populist blockbuster of the 007 mythology is elevated and perfected with immaculate, artful precision. Here's to another 50, Mr. Bond. Many happy returns.<br/><br/>-9.5/10"
"himanshumahadik","Null","2","8","17 July 2013"," Skyfall – The Resurrection!
","The Eon Productions $150 million, 23rd entry Skyfall, the much awaited 007 bond film is thrilling, gripping & entertaining.<br/><br/>Adele's theme song ""This is the end-Hold your breath and count to ten- Feel the earth move and then-Hear my heart burst again"" sets it up with its catchy tone & the quite 1960s pace. The chase begins in the Istanbul's Grand Bazaar & is captivating indeed & well worth of a bond chase. The ""TAKE THE BLOODY SHOT"" is a one of its kind justifiable of the film's perfect tenacity! Bond falling from the train is a one we'll remember for a life time !And then, the cyber threats starts all over- unstoppable, unmatched, unthinkable & our Bond has to report to ""M(ommy)"" for THE RESURRECTION !<br/><br/>Three months ago, the boss lady M (Judi Dench) has lost the drive containing the identity of every agent embedded in terrorist organization across the globe& then the boss lady M has to ""Think of her Sins"" & then the Resurrection starts–> ""007 reporting for duty"".<br/><br/>From London we travel all the way to Shanghai then to Macau. The traditional Chinese eve festival is wonderful to watch. The real kingpins: director-cinematographers Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins deserve more than a pat on their backs for producing such thrilling longish sequences that the first half seems to be a flyer & I realized it even more when the interval lights came on that none of us wanted a break- it's that gripping. The reflecting neon light shot where bond goes to chase the assassin in the darkness on top floor is worth a mention. The ""MI6 HQ blowing away is deafening! & the movie reassures that the Bond game is for the grown-ups & not young computer hacker freak who poses as Bond's new quarter master who tries instructing Bond only to find his own site hacked by the invincible,irresistible,indigenous cold blooded villain Javier Bardem -Silva. Silva's two rat's story is truly fascinating depicting of what lies ahead & what was all that going all till that point of the movie. His ""..Mo(o)mmy was very bad"" takes an applaud !<br/><br/>But let me tell you, there are fewer of the fancy gadgets, the funky cars, the gorgeous woman (except the sultry shower moment which the director tries to steal) but there is the tuxedo, the martini & ah off course how can we forget the Bond's fav Aston Martin DB5 !<br/><br/>The end, takes us to the olden days ""Welcome to Scotland"" kinds set up in an old mansion where it all started & as Silva says ""It should have been here & it should have been this way"". Silva's entry in the end in a helicopter with a loud speaker atop is another witty inclusion. The end does seem a bit stretchy n slowno bond girls n no fancy gadgets takes away the Bond theme – which is a bit questionable and asking ourselves to differentiate it between a Bond and a Spy thriller- Do u feel so ?<br/><br/>And last, but not the least full marks to Daniel Craig as he seems mature-macho, razor -sharp and savvy as ever & completes a respectable hat trick & we wonder how many more will he make- one? Two?? Remains to be seen. Nevertheless, Skyfall achieves a true Resurrection – A perfect fitting for the 50 years celebration of The Bond- James Bond ..as I sign off to wait for yet another thriller..yes our Amir's Talaash<br/><br/>Rating = PG 13.<br/><br/>Running time=143 minutes.<br/><br/>My Rating=7/10."
"samlillianthal1","9","2","8","9 July 2013"," When 007 fails at an important mission, agents are exposed. The one behind this Silva who will finally get what he wants unless 007 can stop him.
","Bond is back again played by Craig. Whenever he's on screen I think he's the best 007. This guy has the looks, the style, the power, the intensity, and a little humor. It feels Craig has less pressure on him to be this new bond after Brosnan, that being said, Craig was more comfortable in this role. Judi Dench returns as M and does great as always. They really make M a big character that you're supposed to care for and I did care for her. Her part in the story was nice to see adding depth to M's character. Bond and M's chemistry is always been a gift that I like to see in these recent Bond movies and it is brought to another level! Naomie Harris is also pretty good for this important supporting character. There was a new Q too that I didn't mind either (the original Q is always the best though.) Silva is the Bond villain who is played by Javier Bardem. This guy is pure AWESOMENESS. At some times bizarre and funny that makes him different than other bad guys. This guy makes this movie complete, a mediocre villain would have not satisfied me. This guy is much more than a cyber terrorist genius, he gets development as well. Other cyber villains in other movies like Live Free or Die Hard, had this bland, laughable villain. This character is unique with how you learn about him and the powerful things he has to say. Did I mention he's awesome? The writing in this had a touch of humor and grit behind it as well. Some enjoyable parts were when Bond would say a one liner right after a stunt or just in general. It just makes you more envious of this protagonist and makes you think if you could say that right after jumping off a boat onto another boat. The new character Eve (Naomie Harris) had a refreshing back and forth with Bond. It just defines how their relationship is and how it unravels..... Silva's dialogue was so memorable and he also had some one liners that might've one upped Bond's. When Bond says a one liner to Silva, Silva comes back with another one. Like I said, Silva's words stay with me for this whole movie. If he's trying to make the audience sympathise towards him or he made something into a joke that shouldn't be one. Whenever Silva opens his mouth, he steals the scene in an instant. The story here is kind of like what we've seen but another part of it is more original. I don't think it's the greatest bond story but it's alright and new for the 007 franchise. It goes a little into Bond's past that you don't get to see that makes it more the worth while. Sam Mendes directs this with classics like American Beauty. The action scenes were cool but only a couple stood out. I'm a sucker for long action scenes because most of them start and they're fast paced but end quickly. More kids will really not like it as much as others because there's not too much action. Most stunts and action were real which I appreciate because it makes it better and shows the hard work they put into this film. In Bond films, you need some global locations and there are some outstanding places here! One is Shanghai that shows attractive views of Shanghai that will take your breath away. Mendes can really introduce a character well because how he introduced Silva was amazing. Just how a symbolic monologue is made in this one shot of him walking towards the camera. The Adele song is so catchy and makes me admire what Adele has done in the past. You need a good Bond song and you get it. The pacing is a little slower than other Bond movies. The slowest part is towards the end but then gives you the action packed ending you needed. This movie brings the style of Bond with the action, romance, settings, and characters. Silva would definitely be in the villain of the year spot for 2012. The acting is just perfect and every character grabs your attention. For the Bond geeks, there are some references to the past Bond movies to celebrate 50 years. The 23rd 007 film ends off so well that Bond deserves a vodka martini, shaken, not stirred."

"morgie55","8","2","8","10 April 2013"," One of the Better Daniel Craig Outings!!
","Daniel Craig is a different kind of Bond, and I think he was getting some mixed reviews because viewers were comparing him to other Bonds rather than this film.<br/><br/>This film is continuing the origins of Bond, why he thinks the way he does – he's a tougher, more somber Bond who at the beginning of the film with an exciting chase scene through Istanbul, gets shot off a train – and survives! (Hey, it's Hollywood, that's fine.) I liked this film. The action was fun but not over the top. The scenery was very nice – the Shanghai boat scene was lavish. The moody shadow & light show as an assassin gets his rifle loaded up and takes aim. (But why did Bond let the guy take a shot and kill his target? That's never explained).<br/><br/>The Bond girls were tragic, intensely interesting and Bond's empathy for them was palpable.<br/><br/>Enjoyed the back & forth with Moneypenny, as she shaves him closely. Later they discuss how it's easier to get dressed with an ""extra pair of hands."" Cute.<br/><br/>Yay, we get a ""shaken not stirred"" scene at a Shanghai bar, as Bond is watched closely by a gang of toughs about to kill him. We get a view of the Connery sports car, the Ashton Martin.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The film made fun of itself at several points, but true Bond fans would get the Easter eggs, and new viewers would be fascinated with the ""origin story"" of our favorite MI6 spy, out in the Scottish Highlands (""Skyfall""). ""M"" is basically our co-star. Bond is serious, has a lot of depth, and Daniel Craig plays him well. Good film.<br/><br/>Cast: Daniel Craig - James Bond Judi Dench - M Javier Bardem - Silva Ralph Fiennes - Gareth Mallory Naomie Harris - Eve Bérénice Marlohe - Severine Albert Finney - Kincade"

There are some of the older 007 action scenes and similar gimicks with updates thanks to the younger Quartermaster. Eve plays well with grit and feminism including a surprise revelation at the end. It's touching as well with the final scenes in the mansion and the old Caretaker. Adele's award for best song is well deserved. The title sequence is awesome with old and new graphics in a very mesmerizing vein.

"element061090","7","2","8","2 December 2012"," Not The Best Bond Outing For Craig
","First thing's first...this is NOT a Casino Royale quality film. Plain and simple. Now that we have that out of the way, lets get on with the review. We see our beloved hero a few years after the events of Casino and Quantum, and he is obviously out of his element. Sure, its Craig back in the role, but its almost a different breed of 007. It starts off with the pedal to the floor, a huge opening sequence that leaves the audience wanting more. Whether it loves up to the watery mouths, that's up to the viewer. Story: The story is rather flat, and that is coming from a guy who never really says that. One scene, Bond is in this part of the world. The next, a completely different part, leaving me, at least, wondering, ""Um, did I miss something?"" Now don't mistake this as a negative review, because it surely is not. James Bond was kicking ass throughout, just as much of a bad ass that one would expect of Craig as 007 at this point. There were those spectacular action sequences that you just find yourself smiling at, whether you know it or not. Without giving much away, this is a rather generic plot. Bond returns, terrorist at large who happens to be MI6's most wanted, and insert twist and turn from there. It's a good story, but does it blow you away? Not by a long shot. Acting: Daniel Craig IS James Bond at this point, like it or not, ""Blonde-Bond haters."" He just flat out rocks as our secret agent hero. Every time he's on the screen, you can't help but want more and more of him, heterosexually. His performance as Bond NOT being recognized by the Academy is a BLASPHEMOUS ERROR by the Academy, especially after his THIRD Bond film. Judi Dench as the mother-like ""M"" is always as elegant and brooding, and in this installment there is no difference. She is just great. Ralph Fiennes (sp?) is the new guy this time around in MI6 and lives up to the expectations. He's just a master of the acting craft at this point, like it or not. Then, there's Javier Bardem as the menacing and, at times, overly awkward Silva, who is a bad guy but who has heart, as well. He's scary, funny, and dramatic all at once. Easily one of the best Bond villains of all time. Final Verdict: Sure, this didn't live up to Casino Royale, which was easily one of my favorite Bonds. Should you see it? Yes. Is it something to rush out and see? If you are a true, die-hard Bond fanatic then of course. If you wanna have a good time at the theater, then again, go see it. Just go in with an open mind, and let yourself be the judge. 7/10. Hopefully the next one is huge, much like I expected this ""action movie"" to be."
"mark-179-360743","4","2","8","13 November 2012"," Soooooooooooooo bad...
","The plot is pathetic, the movie plods and is tremendously dull, the action sequences are fine - but they feel more muted than past movies. The main thing is that ""old"" Bonds, a'la Brosnan for example, were larger than life Bonds who you could enjoy watching. The Cruciferous Mrs seems to think that by making Bond gritty and real he somehow stays relevant and new. The only problem is, he doesn't - this Bond is dull, boring, unsexy - the antithesis of 50 years of great Bond flicks. No new characters of note, the new Q has all the presence of a rollmop herring. And the first thing he does in his new job is hook up the enemies computer directly to the MI6 mainframe? Give me strength. The evil gay villain dude randomly gets caught at exactly the place and time he's put enough explosive to allow a tube train to bust through a ceiling? Cue raised eyebrows... (Yes, yes - smartasses out there, we know he probably had them absolutely everywhere so he could blow anywhere up, should he need to - what, I have to infer things to make the plot even half way believable? - incredulous eyebrows, again...) Oh, and Bond at the end of the movie in the frozen lake - ever heard of hypothermia? Yet just wanders to the chapel and throws a hunting knife in the villains back? Sorry - but a REAL, gritty Bond like they are trying to create unfortunately appears to be immune to the laws of physics - so he is both dull as hell and unbelievable. And we know already he is a physical wreck... AND... the villain actually wins - given he wanted to kill himself and M. AND the reason for the movie, the list, is never even discussed again - I'm thinking that ubergayvillaindude given his permanent 2 steps ahead of Bond modus operandi would probably have made a contingency to guarantee the remaining spies were still outed (If he didn't then frankly he was probably just too gay for a bond movie...). AND... you actually feel that the villain has a right to be aggrieved by M and thus you have no emotional connection to the plot; actually looking forward to M getting killed. AND... as another poster wrote, why not just get a blank sim card and call in for backup when you know the bad dudes are on the Skyfall estate? The way Bond runs this is completely effing retarded. Mendes brings all the tension of a slap in the face with a wet fish to what is clearly and simply the worst Bond ever made. Bond movies used to be fun, and I think Daniel Craig is actually generally good as Bond, but make no bones about it - this movie is crap; its markedly less fun than George Lazenby's risible effort.<br/><br/>Oh, and the amount of continuity errors which are so bad you can see them on the first viewing is excruciating to watch. You may first see the bond-girls fag in the casino, but you can probably pick out about 10 before pretty easily. Poor, poor film making - so dull and so non-Bond - saved by a few nice action sequences. It would be so-so as a straight to DVD..."
"punisheroverlode","6","2","8","11 November 2012"," An admirable attempt to make an aging series modern and relevant again, though not a successful one...
","I should preface this review by saying I'm a relative newcomer to the Bond series. My first encounter with Bond was with Pierce Brosnan's final portrayal of the character in Die Another Day, which I saw in cinemas with my parents back in 2003. I've seen most, but never all, of The World Is Not Enough and snippets of the Roger Moore and Sean Connery movies on late-night television.<br/><br/>If I had to pick a movie that defined Bond to me however, it would be Casino Royale. As impressionable as I was back when I saw Die Another Day, I always felt Pierce Brosnan was a little too perfect. Daniel Craig, though, had the right amount of grit and darkness to balance Bond's charisma.<br/><br/>So how does this relate to Skyfall? Well, in the 50 years of the franchise's history, I've only been around for 18 of them and to date I've only seen 4 of the films in their entirety. I'm familiar enough with the series that names like ""Dr. No"", ""Q"", ""Moneypenny"", or, um, ""Pussy Galore"" and ""Octopussy"" don't completely fly over my head but not enough to associate them with anything deeper than superficial pop culture recognition.<br/><br/>In other words, that Skyfall marks the 50th anniversary of Ian Fleming's character and is the 23rd installment in the series, simply doesn't strike me as all that, for lack of better word. Curious situation to be in, then, when Skyfall is, quite explicitly, a celebration of Bond's history.<br/><br/>The movie certainly isn't shy about referring back to its history; nod-wink lines like ""You know the rules of the game. You've been playing it long enough,"" or ""The old ways are the best"" are generously spread throughout the movie. If that doesn't quite spell things out, consider quips like ""What did you expect, an exploding pen?"" which are too specific for me not to assume it's a reference to, despite not knowing what to or the brief cameo of the Aston Martin DB5. Skyfall is a film heavy with nostalgia, which becomes a problem when the subjects it tackles are contemporary.<br/><br/>Early on in the film, James Bond is accidentally shot in the field and deemed killed. 6 months later, after seeing a news report on a bombing in MI6 headquarters, he returns to England, ready for duty. One wonders what Bond did in that half-year's time (besides shagging attractive locals and drowning himself in booze) and what went on his head, but whatever it was, it left his skills rusty. Bond returns to England as a husk of his old self. He fails his psych evaluation, his physical evaluation, and his marksmanship test yet M lets him back into the field.<br/><br/>M and 007's relationship is what drives the emotional heart of Skyfall and I feel it's where the movie succeeds. Theirs is a relationship that doesn't less about what is spoken, but what isn't. Neither character is about to wear their heart out on their sleeve. Skyfall fortunately, does a good job of capturing this dynamic.<br/><br/>What it has trouble with however is telling a convincing story about Bond's death and rebirth. It's not long after Bond's resurrection that he's back to kicking ass, walking into a lion's den and not only emerging unscathed, but capturing said lion as well. It's quite a transformation, and not a terribly believable one, when throughout most of the movie we are supposed to believe that Bond is a man on the ledge, that he's getting old, that he's no longer the agent that he used to be. That divorce between what other characters say Bond is like and how Bond actually behaves undermines any sense that he is any of those things. For the most part, Bond carries on like he's in his prime – singlehandedly dispatching groups of faceless thugs, plowing through women like it was the last days of Rome, and dishing out one-liners like nobody's business.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a success though when it comes to telling the story of Bond's adversary. The previous two movies, for all their merits, lacked memorable villains. Not the case when you have Javier Bardem on board. Cyberterrorist Silva is simultaneously captivating and disturbing. It's the perfectly coiffed hair dyed bleach blond, the gaudy clothing, the eloquent and accented speech, the little physical and verbal quirks, and a creeping sense that he's not all quite there mentally. Any more eccentric and Silva becomes a caricature but Bardem wisely doesn't overdo and nails his performance. This is a Bond villain that will be remembered for a long time to come.<br/><br/>The action set-pieces are merely okay this time around. The opening chase in Istanbul gets the excitement going but the final shootout in Bond's childhood home is disappointing - all gunplay and explosions but no real sense of danger. If there is an action scene that's sure to be memorable, it would be 007's brawl with French assassin Patrice in a high-rise building in Shanghai, with images of neon-blue jellyfish and other sea creatures flowing past on the building windows.<br/><br/>Bond also gets to visit some pretty cool places when he's not killing people as well. The traditional Shanghai-styled, floating casino Macau, complete with lanterns and wooden boat ferries, is quite a sight to behold.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that Skyfall is the best-looking Bond film in the Daniel Craig series, but sadly it's not the best story. 007's character development doesn't hold up well, there never really feels like there's that much at stake, and it struggles to reconcile its desires to both honor some of its more over-the-top traditions and become gritty, relevant, and realistic in the way that Dark Knight was. Still, Skyfall does boast some impressive action and visuals, has produced the most memorable villain the franchise has seen in a while, and leaves us with some exciting storytelling possibilities in the future."
"dfranzen70","6","2","8","11 November 2012"," Satisfying; too many unanswered questions
","Skyfall, James Bond's 23rd screen adventure, caveats aside, is fun to watch both on a visceral level and on an intellectual level, but it leaves one with one too many unanswered questions or unexplained incidents to be counted among the best in the series. It's quickly paced, perhaps too quickly so, but the action scenes are memorable, as are the usual locales and women. Daniel Craig continues to solidify his hold on the iconic British spy.<br/><br/>A hard drive containing the secret identities of all of MI6's secret agents has fallen into the wrong hands. You may ask why there would be one drive that contained all of that info, but that's neither here nor there for the purposes of this movie. Bond's mission is to track down the drive and exterminate the thief, but the thief has much bigger plans in mind - and they involve, of all people, M (Judi Dench). M's past has everything to do with this plot, and its central theme is one of trust.<br/><br/>Now, let me get one plot point out of the way, because it's occurred in several preceding Bond films - James dies. Or maybe he doesn't, who knows. The man has come back from the dead about a dozen times, it seems. It's what happens afterward that may make you scratch your head, an entire sequence of scenes that don't seem to make a lot of sense, based on what we've come to learn about Bond over the past 50 years. The way Bond deals with certain events just doesn't seem in character.<br/><br/>Bond has some help. On an initial mission gone bad, he is accompanied by Eve (Naomie Harris), who can drive and shoot and is otherwise a capable agent. Then there's a new, young Q (Ben Whishaw), who is naturally a computer whiz - a necessity in a movie in which the ages of both M and Bond are contrasted with the rapidly changing outside world. They're relics, you see. <br/><br/>The bad guy here is played by a blond-bewigged Javier Bardem. He has control of the list, and he's releasing the identities of all agents, five at a time, for no apparent reason. Okay, there's a reason, it's apparent, but it's mundane. When it's explained to you, you might have trouble buying it as a logical explanation. You see, here's one thing we know about our double-O agents: they sign up for their missions knowing they could die and that their lives are not more important than the mission and certainly not more important than the country itself. So if there's an issue of trust in this movie, it's that I had trouble trusting the movie to be on the up-and-up. It's one of those times when a movie makes a rule for itself and then breaks it just to further a plot.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the movie is not entertaining, because it really is. The action scenes are, as typical, well shot; there's car chases, train chases, fights, and even a chase on the London Tube. There are locales as diverse as Macau, Shanghai, London, and Scotland (the country, not the Yard). There are few bon mots and plenty of gunplay. In some sequences, it's as if we're watching an old Western. The cinematography is definitely up to par.<br/><br/>I believe that while Craig's Bond takes a step forward in development, Dench's M takes a step backward. There's a difference between being stubbornly British and being unrealistically foolish, so I found M to be a little less believable than I had in previous films. Dench does her best in a role that's much more physical here than it had been in the past, too. Bardem makes a terrible villain, and I mean that in the good way. He's diabolical, insane, and yet creepily believable.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is like many other Bond films - likable, not too dark, not too deep, filled with action and gorgeous women and settings. It is by no means a bad film, or even a mediocre film. It's a good film. I was just baffled by some of the plot developments, and I felt there was too much time spent on extra, dispensable characters. It was also no surprise to me that, when a particular actor showed up, he would be very, very much involved in not only the end of the movie but also movies to come, and that's a shame (the knowledge, not the fact)."

","First I need to tell you that my favorite bond was Pierce Brosnan, I did not the like Daniel Craig Jason Bourne and Rambo image , that much ,in the James Bond movies. But this movie is kind of different from his last 2 . I believe it's a kind of much needed Reboot of the bond movies, not just in the appearance (I mean actors) but also the images we had about the characters in the movie. For example the past about the bond which is told briefly which creates a much needed background for the character , harsh reality of spy world ,main reason behind the bad guy of the movie and other real problems which intelligence agencies could face, not in that sense which makes it a boring documentary nor like a CIA FBI drama movies. it is just ""a new bond movie genre"".<br/><br/>If you are going to this movie expecting ""exploding pens"" , invisible cars with missiles and other previous bond accessory don't go to watch this movie buy a DVD of Austin Powers. but if you are a bond fan and want to see a good movie its a must watch , it is like a first part of coming bond movies and ending of the old bond."

In my opinion the Bond 'franchise' it's saturated. A new good reboot of the James Bond universe must be done. Innovate the opening credits, the main theme, Bond's personality, everything should be transformed in a new look, because honestly, the 007 features are not bringing anything new...<br/><br/>Cristopher Nolan expressed interest in directing a 007 film, so I say, let the guy make something!

"johnwgg","6","2","8","30 October 2012"," Bond gone bland..
","Without giving away the plot; The opening sequence is tame. The supporting actress should have stayed on Blue Peter. All the Bond clichés are as predictable as panto. Who ever had the bright idea of putting a poor version of Richard Ayoade from the IT crowd in as Q should actually be shot. The one liners are very droll and again predictable. The story line is shallow and yet again, predictable. The writers (Pervis, Wade & Logan) were trying to make up for it with grandiose bold sensationalism the like of which would not be unfamiliar in the Murdock Empire. It is as if you gave Jeremy Clarkson a plasterers trowel and expected him to copy Cezanne. This incarnation of Bond has lost his suave sophicatedness and we're left with a punch and Dame Judy show.<br/><br/>The good parts. Dame Judy is, as she is always, masterful. Daniel Craig is still the best bond in my eyes and he plays the part of a broken burnt out yet thoroughly committed, doggedly determined and loyal servant to the Crown admirably. Berenice Marlohe is a Bond girl through and through top marks 10 out of 10. She's as good as any Femke Jansen or Ursula Andress and that's saying something. However her character was sparingly used. I would have like to see her play a more central role. I think we missed out.<br/><br/>However, in short, if was on TV on a lazy Sunday afternoon and the remote was out of reach I'd watch it again, otherwise, don't bother."
"TheSquiss","8","2","8","28 October 2012"," Craig is raw, harsh, brutal and hurting.
","The rumours built anticipation, the trailer thrilled, the theme song disappointed. The expectation is that Skyfall will be the highest grossing Bond film of all time and Daniel Craig may be the first Bond to garner an Oscar nomination. But could the film possibly stand up to the hype? <br/><br/>I grew up in the Roger Moore years and thought he was the bee's knees. As a more discerning cineaste I respected the killer in Timothy Dalton's eyes, though he suffered for the weak films he was dropped into. After the cheesy romantic Brosnan period, Bond was reborn and I cheered very loudly, much to the chagrin of the next door neighbours, when I read that Daniel Craig was to utter those immortal five words.<br/><br/>Craig is raw, harsh, brutal and hurting. Know this: James Bond is a killer. It's what he does. Craig's 007 will slot a bullet between your eyes for Queen and country and, outwardly, he won't waste a nanosecond considering the emotional consequences. Because that is his job. No, you wouldn't mess with him and, yes, he is the best 007 yet.<br/><br/>But despite the proclamations, Skyfall is not the best Bond film; that accolade, for me, belongs to Casino Royale. Director Sam Mendes hasn't broken Bond, not by a long way, but he has dented it and if they don't repair those dings pretty sharpish, they will rust and cause irreparable damage. Mendes must take the responsibility as he is the top dog on set but the damage has been caused by screenwriter Messrs. Purvis, Wade and Logan. Mendes stated he wanted to inject humour into Bond and from the first twenty minutes or so it was written beautifully. The smiles came from crisp, disposable comments that flowed in conversations, but as Skyfall unfolds scenes are ended with self-conscious, cheesy quips and exchanges and almost blatant winks at the camera. We haven't stepped back to the Moore years but we have certainly suffered a horrible slip to the edge of the Brosnan era Bond.<br/><br/>Barbara Broccoli, if you're reading this, please, for the love of all things Bond, stop now, retrace your steps and take Bond back where he belongs; to the dark, reality of espionage and terror that excites us but makes us wee our pants just a little bit in fear. That is who Bond should be.<br/><br/>But Skyfall is an extremely good film. Its 143-minute running time sprints past with enough variation in the pace for us to catch our breath and keep up without allowing the heart rate to settle into a relaxed rhythm. Craig is on blistering form, momentary scripted bombs aside, and not once do we believe he is anything but serious or anything less than capable, even when the story suggests otherwise.<br/><br/>Skyfall rattles along from the fresh MGM opening sting to the final crescendos, both visually and aurally, as the last of the credits fade. Mendes et al are clearly aware this is Bond's 50th anniversary and there are numerous references to bygone Bonds though, mercifully, no painful cameos from the men who played him. Most are subtle enough to be enjoyable but one jars; it cuts against the naturalistic grain of the film and all but contradicts an exchange between Bond and the excellent new Q (Ben Wishaw):<br/><br/>Bond: A gun and a radio? Q: What? You were expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go in for that any more.<br/><br/>But in the final act we are thrown a series of references and sequences from that bygone era. What was Mendes playing at?<br/><br/>The cast is impeccable. Javier Bardem as Silva is not just a 'bad guy' but a genuine, hope you never meet him anywhere, villain. He is beautifully restrained when first we meet him and our chuckles emerge when the character plays with us, not when we laugh at the funny man. And as he slowly unhinges himself from reality we understand the palpable fear that Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) fails to disguise in her shaking hand.<br/><br/>As ever, the relationship with Craig's Bond and Judi Dench's M is absolutely compelling. The two actors have a rare chemistry that doesn't require a sex scene to make it noticeable. At times she is mother to his petulant teenager but there is a mutual respect, an admiration that veers towards a familial love. And, in M's case, a genuine fear of what she has created.<br/><br/>Naomie Harris is a joy to watch. Though she's produced some startlingly good work (28 Days Later, White Teeth) only in Skyfall has she finally stepped into limelight. Perhaps, if we are very fortunate, she will break the 'Bond girl' curse and have a career that continues to ascend rather than evaporate post-event. Next year's Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom is a very hopeful start. <br/><br/>Equally, both Wishaw and Ralph Fiennes, as government man Gareth Mallory, stand tall as characters that command our attention with solid, determined performances. Wishaw's Q is quirkily engaging but there is clearly far more to him than the cuddly, buffoonery of Desmond Llewelyn and, hopefully, he'll have a more positive impact than the pantomime fool played by John Cleese. Fiennes, meanwhile, sets Mallory up as a hateful man within the fold but his evolution through Skyfall is gently handled to great effect.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a very definite statement of intent. Some of that intent concerns me but mostly it is the reason I'll return for a second viewing this week. <br/><br/>No, Skyfall is not the best Bond film ever. But it is remarkably good, it will leave you reeling and it is imperative you don't ask and don't let anyone tell you anything about it. <br/><br/>See it now and then keep your mouth firmly closed.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"
"markgorman","8","2","8","29 October 2012"," Yes. Best Bond of them all. In so many ways.
","To begin with I must state that I am NOT a Bond fan. But I have an open mind and of all the Bond movies I've seen in my time (many) I have to say that I thought Daniel Craig's Casino Royale was probably my favourite. I chose not to see Quantum of Solace; a movie with a name as ridiculous as that had to be hiding something and it seems my gut feel was right given its poor reviews. But Skyfall seemed different. Certainly the advance reviews have been excellent and so I turned up on opening weekend willing to e impressed.<br/><br/>I was.<br/><br/>This is, by some margin, the finest Bond film I've ever seen. Although it has its faults (it's a little too long) it scores points in nearly every department; the acting is universally excellent, The plot and script suitably overblown but flecked with humour and humanity throughout. Outrageous chases and set pieces (the rooftop motorbike chase just about winning price for most audacious chase scene I've ever seen).<br/><br/>But it's what lies at the soul of this film (and it really does have a soul) is the cast. In particular we see the cloth lifted on what motivates Bond, his back story and in particular his upbringing. It's this that starts to flesh out his (and more unexpectedly Javier Bardem's) relationship with M who although as feisty as ever actually develops into quite a sympathetic and interesting subplot.<br/><br/>The film is excellently directed (by Sam Mendes!) with a theme (yes a Bond movie with a ""theme"") about age and the battle between tradition and modernity running through it like a stick of rock (occasionally clunkily so). This allows the production team to have great fun with old Bond gadgetry (and music) alongside the very latest in technology - an obfuscated living data network being at its centrepiece which allows a new and ridiculously young looking (he's actually 32) Q to be introduced in the shape of Ben Wishaw (Perfume).<br/><br/>But its Daniel Craig's complete mastery of Bond as a character that is setting the movie industry into overdrive and not surprisingly. In the movie, in tune with the theme of age and ageing, he's almost not fit for purpose having ""taken one for the team"" possibly once too often. He's on the verge of breakdown at the movie's outset and takes the requisite, and to be expected, barrage of beatings as it unfolds, emerging at its denouement just about in one piece and ready for action with whatever lies in store in the next instalment. It's an interesting dimension and works well with Judi Dench's excellent central performance as M.<br/><br/>Craig is the complete Bond. Rugged, handsome, athletic, suave but with more steel than any since Connory and, to my mind, he's a better actor than Mishter Cool himself.<br/><br/>As the face of not one but two major film franchises (The Girl with...) he's solid gold and, for my money, worth every penny of it.<br/><br/>I also like Adele's theme music."
"garygibbons","8","2","8","28 October 2012"," Now Pay Attention 007!
","Since watching the movie I have read with eager anticipation the reviews for Skyfall both here & in the press. I must agree with the consensus in stating this is a very good Bond movie & a worthy addition to the series, but NOT the best in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>The plot is simple with the basis of the story linked to a theft of a list of fields agents, both CIA & MI5 (shades of Mission Impossible & the NOC list) perpetrated by a cyber villain (Goldeneye) who has a shady history with M. Our villain, both camp & sinister, seeks revenge for a previous wrongdoing by M. Javier Bardem relishes his role & delivers a truly memorable Bond baddie. We like our Bond baddies to look the part and have an almost 'cartoon like' quality about them. Raoul Silva, Bardem, has a sinister yet sympathetic quality which reminds me of the Joker in the Batman series.<br/><br/>We see Bond face the demons of his own past whilst rescuing M from hers, the great Judy Dench on form as usual. The movie is just over two hours long but certainly didn't seem it as Sam Mendes carries us through this highly enjoyable action thriller effortlessly. The cinematography is fantastic with sumptuous sets & beautiful location shots.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig has found his Bond and delivers a very assured performance and even delivers a few well timed one liners along the way. He still has the hard edge we have seen in the previous outings but this time allowed some humour to creep in. The scene with Bond & M in the DB5 will bring a smile to all cinema-goers faces. <br/><br/>Berenice Marlohe is gorgeous as Severine but unfortunately has as much screen time as Teri Hatcher did....if you know what I mean? Naomie Harris as Eve (surname withheld) has an awkward relationship with Bond but why that is is addressed at the end of the movie. Ben Wishaw, the new Q, was another risk which in my eyes pays off well. Q being a genius geek of a lad may ruffle the feathers of die hard Bond fans but watch the movie & see how well it works.<br/><br/>So why isn't it the 'best' Bond in my opinion. That lies in the third act, the final main scene. Although tense, action packed and emotional it wasn't a Bond ending in my eyes. I'm all for the big sets and bigger explosions with Bond at the centre of it all. Don't get me wrong it was a very good ending but more Hitchcock than Bond more Batman than Bond.<br/><br/>I also still have one more question.....""what happened to the list of agents that started the movie off?"". <br/><br/>I enjoyed Casino Royale the more I watched it so an 8/10 from a first viewing is high praise indeed for Skyfall. Perhaps when I've seen it another two or three times that rating may increase!<br/><br/>And finally.....I like Adele's theme and I think Thomas Newman is a superb composer. Can we have David Arnold back however? He more than anyone is as close to the wonderful John Barry as we've got!"
"MartinHafer","7","3","15","21 March 2013"," If you love lots of stunts and action, you'll like this one.
","""Skyfall"" is a good film and it made a buttload of money. Whether or not you love it will depend on how much you love stunts, explosions and chases. If you adore them and can't get enough of them, then this film is for you! It's more like ""Die Hard"" in many ways than a traditional James Bond film. As for me, I don't particularly love stunts and really like more plot and dialog--so it wasn't a film that I fell in love with...but it wasn't boring.<br/><br/>I could review the plot or talk at length about this film, but really don't feel a need. At this point, there are over 1200 reviews for the movie!! But I will mention one problem I found with the film--dumb lapses. In other words, instead of working out logical errors (such as how the MI-6 computer system was so easily compromised as well as why Bond ALONE took on the baddies at the end with no help whatsoever from the British military--even though this took place in Scotland!) the film was too concerned with explosions. As for me, it's a decent film but nothing more."
"saddygoops","4","3","15","6 February 2013"," Not what it used to be.............
","I being a huge fan of the Bond series was not satisfied by the new addition, 'SKYFALL'. It was nothing special but lacked a lot from the usual bond movies. Bond movies are supposed to have a casual (NSA) feel to them, with a lot of action, cool gadgets, glamour and punch lines. This movie lacked seriously in the last three categories.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem was under used, his character vaguely reminded of ""The Joker"" but never reached that caliber. For a 2 1/2 hr film it certainly failed to built up characters and often went on to question about Bond's Past and his potential or the lack of it. By bringing in the personal touch it started to resemble the Bourne or the M.I. series.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert: Things got a little too personal, instead of it being about saving the world the story was about two agents (one from the past and one current) fighting about M's affection and loyalty to her agents.<br/><br/>Anyway, being partial to bond movies i would still rate it worthy of 6.5 stars and a must one-time see, for all the lovers of this genre."
"blacklist-1","10","4","24","2 November 2012"," The Best Bond Movie Ever?
","Usually my review titles refer to how I feel about the movie. With the case of a Bond movie I would normally use phrases such as ""Bond is Back!"" or ""The Best Bond Movie in Years!"" etc. However this time I have decided against it and chosen to indulge in a perspective of a highly debatable nature. Is, on the 50th anniversary of James Bond, Skyfall the best Bond movie ever conceived? A lot of fans of 007 would say yes, that it far surpasses all the previous ones including the true classics, Goldfinger being one example, whilst others would surmise it is one of the best. Me personally I would argue the former for several reasons. For a start the plot is refreshingly different from all the others, which would normally consist of some plot for world domination, but this time it is much more personal with revenge against MI6, more specifically M, with instead of Bond pursuing the villain, it's the other way round. Taking the foundation of the Bond formula for a narrative and twisting it on its head offers the audience the notion that the Bond franchise can still deliver surprises and make the process feel refreshed and offers a whole new consistent level of interesting. The last two Bond movies with Daniel Craig Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace tried that, but on the individualistic level of the core of Bond's character by making him more humanistic and vulnerable, with more prone to serious injury both physically (when he is poisoned by Le Chiffre) and mentally when he loses Vesper who he was in love with. They also moved away from Bond's reliance on gadgets as well. The whole new spin on the tone of the franchise with Bond's quippy one liners and glitzy gadgets was both a triumph and failure. But Skyfall successfully blends the two beautifully with the return of Q and Moneypenny (played by new actors of course) and a certain old car. <br/><br/>Secondly Skyfall manages to skilfully combine the old suaveness, British patriotism that drives Bond to do his duty with his quippy one liners, whilst maintaining his more humanistic characteristics as we learn more than any other Bond movie combined about his childhood. This makes his character more compelling and attractive than ever with the Bond mystique about his world irresistible to immerse oneself in. In particular the relationship he has with M is keenly felt in this film as though she is the mother Bond never had. This is elevated by the brilliant performances Dame Judi Dench and Daniel Craig deliver with an assemblage of a top-supporting cast that turn in all exquisitely proportioned performances no matter their length of screen time. Craig's acting as Bond in Skyfall solidifies him as the potential to be one of the best Bonds in the 50 years franchise, whilst Dench delivers what can only be described as another first class performance in her prosperous acting career. Both do not deserve to be overlooked come this Oscar season. Javier Bardem as villain Silva is sensational as he is funny, weird and horrific all at the same time. Though his screen time is limited, every nuance, word and sentence carried weight and he shows himself to be a true adversary worthy for Bond. There are also great supporting performances from Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney, Ben Winshaw (terrific as the new Q) and Naomie Harris as Eve. <br/><br/>What also helps with the excellent performances is the exquisitely written screenplay by Purvis, Wade and London, which is high on topicality (cyber-terrorism, which gives Bond a much needed update), wit and intelligence. This includes some great character development for Bond and a couple of ingenious twists, which I didn't see coming. Cinematographer Roger Deakins does a wonderful job with capturing the feel with the locations of London, Shanghai and Scotland. Credit must also go to music composer Thomas Newman who's score throughout is perfectly atmospheric as he cleverly plays on the old Bond music themes, whilst adding some nice new ones of his own. Director Sam Mendes directs with an ease and confidence as though he has done an action movie before (he hasn't, but he should after this and direct the next Bond movie!). He gives us some heart-stopping stunts and brilliantly staged action sequences that are some of the very best I've seen in any action movie. There are far more acting scenes than usual in a Bond movie, but it doesn't makes the two hour, twenty minute run time seem dragged out. If anything it makes other action adventures feel amateurish by comparison. <br/><br/>In the end Mendes and cast and crew have collated together to bring us the best Bond movie since it's inception 50 years ago. Obviously not everyone will think this. By all means do go and see it and make up your own mind. But mostly every Bond/action fan will enjoy something from this movie. There is no doubt in my mind this should receive Oscars. It would be criminal if it didn't. And thanks to a marvellous undertaking by everyone involved in this film, the Bond franchise is assured to continue for years to come. The best Bond and one of the best action adventures I've ever seen. I loved every minute of it. Happy 50th anniversary Bond!"

No. The film is already made and no one contacted them to direct so there.<br/><br/>Those who want to see the film will see it no matter what.Would you trust someone you have never met or have known ? Of course not so why would anyone think anyone would trust a review here ( including mine) from someone they don't know. Everyone has different tastes. Some love sushi and some would not even consider taking a bite. Does that make sushi good or bad ? Of course not. The sushi could give a rat's butt what you think of it. The same with the film. So I am going to tell you what you already know. See the film if you want to. If not then don't. Don't listen to anyone's reviews here. It is all about ego. They feel their ego needs the attention so they come here and give a bad rap on the film and tell you how it should be while they clock in at Walmart or Burger King. Why aren't they making great films ? There is plenty of action and it has a high rating by the paid critics.I would rather read their reviews as opposed to the ones who aren't being paid a penny. Make up your own mind. So a person comes on here and wants to tell everyone how bad the movie was and so what. Who cares what you think. You are under the delusion that people care what you think. No one does but maybe your mom does. So like I said with every film you will have likes and dislikes.<br/><br/>Funny how the one reviewer trashed the Bond film but loved The Scooby Doo movie."

","James Bond turns 50 this year & he hits the half century mark with style, as Sam Mendes delivers a memorable film in 'Skyfall'. The film delivers captivating entertainment & rock-solid performances by its terrific cast. <br/><br/>'Skyfall' Synopsis: Bond's loyalty to M is tested as her past comes back to haunt her. As MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.<br/><br/>'Skyfall' is a movie event, as everything in here is BIG. The Production Value is Magnificent, The Script is Captivating & often Dark, Mendes's Direction is Masterful & The Action-Sequences offer clarity. A Special Mention for the OUTSTANDING Art Design. <br/><br/>'Skyfall' also offers rock-solid performances. Craig as Bond, appears real & tough. But the film's greatest performance is delivered by the Legendary Javier Bardem. Bardem plays the utterly loathsome villain with brilliance. He creates an unforgettable, despicable bad-guy & owns the film. Ralph Fiennes is a joy to watch, as always. Judi Dench is perfect as M. The Great Albert Finney stuns once again.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Skyfall' is worth your time & money."
"alemko-gluhak","10","3","16","1 November 2012"," One of the best!
","This one is a must-watch for all movie fans, not only Bond's. This Bond's character is the closest to the one in Ian Fleming's books. After a great Casino Royale, a very bad Quantum of Solace, Bond is back in this perfect movie. All the scenes are innovative, dynamic, unpredictable, colourful and fun. The pacing of the movie is near perfect, as from time to time there are periods where no action is going on on the screen, and when there is, the action is smooth and brilliantly done. In this movie we once again see the fragile side of Bond, but like always, he is unbeatable. For the first time viewers can't figure out what the title of the movie means. That draws people even more in the movie. In some parts the movie is gloomy, even spooky, which is not typical for Bond movies. Landscapes are breathtaking, the music is also brilliant and matches perfectly with what's going on on the screen. All characters are perfectly casted, especially Q as a younger guy (which suits better in this rebooted version of Bond) and the villain (who is indeed one of the best villains we've ever seen). There are much more laughs in this movie than in the last two (especially thanks to the villain, brilliantly performed by Javier Bardem), many dialogues are witty and funny, and the atmosphere of the whole thing is amazing.<br/><br/>Go to the nearest cinema and watch it as soon as possible. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>I surely didn't, and I plan to go see it again soon."

","As soon as i had seen the first teaser of SKyfall, I knew that another of Craig's Bonds could not possibly disappoint.. And I was right.<br/><br/>After a long wait of four years due to delays in production and MGM's financial problems, Bond has returned and once again things are personal. Sam Mendes' film has gotten almost everything right including the plot, characters and set pieces.<br/><br/>The film opens with Bond and new field agent Eve Moneypenny(Naomie Harris) attempting to recover a hard drive with all the under MI6 agents' names from a French mercenary. The opening sequence instantly captures our attention and has to be the best opening since Brosnan's famous bungee jump in Goldeneye. A bike chase on the rooftops of Istanbul ensues and leads to a well executed fist fight on top of a train. After a miscalculated shot from Moneypenny and a poor decision form M(Judi Dench), Bond is thrown off the train and Adele's ""Skyfall"" title song begins with Bond's future unknown.<br/><br/>The rest of the plot revolves around Javier Bardem's Raoul Silva trying to kill M out of revenge. Silva is more of a classic Bond villain even though he is not out for world domination or have a volcano that opens up but he does have his own little deserted island. Silva is probably the most memorable villain in recent Bond movies. Bardem deserves recognition and does justice to the part, especially his introduction with a chilling anecdote in which he compares himself and Bond to rats.<br/><br/>There is some excellent banter between Q(Ben Wishaw) and Bond in which Wishaw provides a great spin on the role. Ralph Fiennes could have been given a larger role but that will soon occur in the next Bond movies. Berenice Marlohe provides a forgettable Bond girl as she quickly dies within three scenes although her death scene is memorable.<br/><br/>The only flaws that can be found within the film are small script issues such as M losing a hard drive with undercover agents' names. CLearly Judi Dench's M is not wise in matters of security as MI6 has been blown up and then she was kidnapped(The World Is Not Enough), enemy spies have infiltrated MI6(QOS) and now a missing hard drive. It also does not seem credible that Bond and M would go 'Home Alone' on Silva when in the finale and that they would be best friends and go on a road trip together.<br/><br/>To conclude, this is a film for Bond fans due to the many references to past films but as action film it is probably one of the best this year.<br/><br/>Just waiting for Bond 24"

","And believe me, I do not say such words lightly. For fifty years, Bond has graced the screen, fighting his way through all sorts of situations involving a wide array of terrorists, assassins, criminals, explosions, weapons, exploding pens, hand to hand combat scenes, cars, and of course, beautiful women. After all this, can Bond still entertain us the same way? Hell yes he can and he proves it with ""Skyfall"", a brilliant film that manages to include all the action and suspense that we are used to from bond while at the same time, adding a little bit of heart to the mix between Bond (the ever amazing Daniel Craig) and M (the great Judi Dench).<br/><br/>The film wastes no time in getting started when Bond is forced into a high speed chase across Istanbul and is caught in the cross hairs and mistaken for dead after M is forced to make a split-second decision. But fortunately for her and for England, Bond doesn't stay dead for long because M's past is about to come back to haunt her in the form of Silva (Javier Bardem), an ex-spy and computer genius who can wreck a nation's economy (or worse) with just a the click of a mouse. Bardem plays the part with such evil zeal that I'm going to come out and say that Silva is probably one of the best Bond villains since Ernst Blofeld (aka Dr. Evil) himself. With his twisted laugh, smile, and feelings of anguish towards M , his character is one that you are likely to never forget. Its a race against time, across such diverse places like Shanghai, London, and Bond's homeland, Scotland, to save M and put a stop to Silva once and for all. The filmmakers are able to make good use of the shooting locations they are in, whether its the skyline and highways of Shanghai or the moors and hills of Scotland to really create an epic feeling for the movie, which is appropriate to mark the fifty years of Bond. Then, as with all Bond films, there are the women. On the one hand, we have the beautiful Naomie Harris who plays Eve, a fellow agent at MI6 who must decide if she wants to continue working in the field (an excellent surprise awaits us at the end) and then there is the stunning Berenice Marlohe, who plays the mysterious Severine, a woman forced to work for Silva. Both of these women do a stand up job in their performances and sex appeal. In addition, you have great supporting actors in the form of Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney, both of whom add a certain charm which makes the movie all the more better. <br/><br/>I can't praise this movie enough; if you love James Bond as much as I do, you have to see this movie because not only does it move Bond ever further into the twenty-first century, it also gives us a little insight into Bond's origins, something that no other Bond movie has ever done. Further more, this film proves that Bond has still got it and no matter how much our world changes, he always will. Long Live Bond!!!!!"

","I have read most of the previous reviews of ""Skyfall"", and it makes one realize just how wide are our preferences where Movies are concerned. I felt this is the best Bond movie in a long time, being full of fast-moving (at times impossible) action, and was pleased to see the wonderful Judi Dench as ""M"" having a much bigger role than usual, and Daniel Craig doing a great job as Bond, though I do think he is starting to show his age and that will be of concern to the producers. The settings like Shanghai were absolutely wonderful, as was the strong finale in beautiful Scotland. Plaudits go to Xavier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes and the newcomer who played ""Q"".

","For me, this was the greatest Bond movie ever. The best previous one being Casino Royale.<br/><br/>It was also the saddest and most thought provoking.<br/><br/>There is a constant thread of a passing. It starts with Adele's opening-credit song, and is apparent throughout the film, such as when Bond sits in the National Gallery and looks at Turner's painting of the Temeraire that represents the passing of an age. Are older characters being replaced with younger ones. Will Bond retire, or perhaps be retired?<br/><br/>I'm not going to review it... you absolutely must watch it for yourself."

","This is Bond as he's never been seen before. I had to see Skyfall twice to be sure that I liked the way that the movie sets up Bond for the present and the future.<br/><br/>Ian Fleming always wrote Bond as an agent who gets out there and gets the job done by any means possible, with no gadgets just brawn and a dogged determination to complete orders. The trio of writers behind this story have done a fantastic job of stripping back Bond to his base elements and showing him as Mr Fleming once did in his novels, as was done with the first Bond movie to feature Daniel Craig.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a very good story married to some excellent direction. There are a couple of tacky moments that I would prefer not to have included but they do not deter from the overall experience.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the next installment."

","In this, the 23rd James Bond film, and the third to star the grimy yet regal Daniel Craig as the most truly British bond we've seen, skilfully dramatic director Sam Mendes, who's perhaps best known for the quirkily captivating American Beauty (1999) achieves an impressive balancing act of the old and the new, in various aspects of this refreshingly exciting Bond outing.<br/><br/>Veteran 007 screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, as well as newcomer John Logan (Hugo, The Aviator) are fully aware of the contemporary setting of the film. Whilst we're still treated to improbably heightened action sequences, energetic mission briefs, witty, confident one-liners and even a few, but not many, fancy gadgets, the reality that these are fading, old-fashioned ministerial and cinematic methods is well is always at the forefront of every scene. The theatrically psychopathic, but not terribly cartoonish villain merciless attacks the weak spots of Bond's inevitable middle age, M's senility and guilt-ridden blunders, and the unfeeling upheavals of the digital age, with his fierce cunning and his alarming technical abilities. M is here at her most vulnerable, but also her most fiercely determined, in a movie that gives her an uncommonly generous amount of screen time. The magnificent Judi Dench continues to show what a good sport she is, and invests the role with terrific gusto. The spectacularly ruthless actions of the dastardly Silva (an even more invested Javier Bardem, channeling some of the chills of Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men) are make viewing that's all the more intense as both the big-budget orchestrations and the characterisations contribute to the excitement.<br/><br/>Two MI agents who are more well-adapted to the digital revolution are also a nice addition: the unapologetically youthful computer whiz now holding the position of Q (Ben Wishaw), and the enigmatic realist, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Feinnes, cheerfully sporting his usual tongue-in- cheek comedic flair). <br/><br/>In most long-running franchises, new characters moulded in the latest cinematic style are not appreciated. The prevailing rule imposed by fans is that all new additions must be modelled on characterisations of the period of the series' beginning. However, three breaches of this rule, also counting Silva, have served the writers very well indeed, and all the adherences are at best forgettable, as with Silva's henchmen, and at worst tiresomely predictable. The latter category consisting of one of those dreadfully boring, but perhaps obligatory, femme fatales. As the wimpy Sévérine, French actress Bérénice Marlohe gives a performance as grindingly overblown as the sickeningly ridiculous costume that Jany Temine has designed for her. The writers sleepily go through the motions of making her snobby, then flirtatious, then cocky, then clumsy, then vulnerable, then broken, then needy, then helpless and finally, perhaps, dead – I honestly paid no attention to her fate. She certainly wasn't missed when she vanished without a word. Miss Eve Moneypenny, played by Naomie Harris is a far better creation, propelled by the efforts of a much more winsome and convincing actress. <br/><br/>It is truly a wonder how Logan and Mendes, usually masters of measured complexity, have coughed up such a pedestrian characterisation right in the middle of this ripper action flick. Only half an hour ago, they made the ingenious placement of an animated credits sequence of the sort that normally closes a film, but here sufficiently gives the impression we need that a long passage of time has swept by our characters, without forcing the audience to share that boredom. The that it is played over by a song that the beautiful Adele wrote and performed especially for the film makes it all the more enjoyable a diversion.<br/><br/>It all amounts to a very enjoyable two hours of entertainment, despite that one little lapse."
"MovieCriticDave","9","2","9","10 December 2012"," A brilliant, relevant 21st century Bond
","Hollywood, amid an apparent wave of creative bankruptcy, is replete in this early 21st century with ""franchise reboots,"" from Batman, to Star Trek, and James Bond. To temper traditionalist views of how these franchises ""should"" play out against the expectation of contemporary audiences is a virtually unsolveable puzzle, and to be sure more than a few have tried their hand at the venerable 007 franchise with varying degrees of success.<br/><br/>""Skyfall,"" featuring Daniel Craig in his third installment as Bond, offers a fantastically edgy and flawed James Bond, almost nothing like the superficial, perpetually save, always-groomed Roger Moore Bond of the 80's, or the just-blow-up-everything-in-sight version offered in the Pierce Brosnan incarnations. Craig, under the hand of director Sam Mendes, has finally his a fabulous stride of its own that is more reimagination than pure reboot, in a film that pays almost surgically deliberate homage to its predecessor yet carving out a uniquely contemporary Bond that is like none before him. <br/><br/>""Skyfall"" producers seemed to have crafted this Bond with a deliberate purpose - to wash away from Bond the presumed Americanized predispositions about what Bond must be, and turned him back into a thoroughly British character, and the result is a fabulously entertaining two-hour 007 spy adventure that somehow reverently knits the iconic past with a grittier, edgier future.<br/><br/>This entry into the Bond lore starts with as eye-popping an opening montage as has been in any prior film, with motorcycle chases atop rows of apartments leading to a rail chase and of, ahem, earth-moving proportions. Yet the prologue is not merely throwaway - it is the foundation on which the rest of ""Skyfall"" expands. <br/><br/>Reinforcing the notion that Bond is more reimagination than reboot is the plain recognition of Bond's age and history within MI6. He struggles to seem physically and personally relevant as a story about contemporary enemies unfolds around him. This Bond is cognizant of his age and the new, non-cold-war political realities around him, and in that way is reinvented in a contemporary context without putting the 007 ""timeline"" at point-zero. <br/><br/>Is ""Skyfall"" perfect? No, but it comes tantalizingly close. Some plot devices are a bit tired, but the fatigue can be excused in light of a broader story in which Bond experiences authentic loss, recognizes to a lesser extent his own mortality, and reflects in a way no prior Bond film has posited the elements of his youth that have made him this transcendent British spy character. To create intriguing depth not before seen in a franchise character like James Bond is no small task, but it ""Skyfall"" does it with great aplomb.<br/><br/>Sure, ""Skyfall"" offers its own variety of explosive action and intrigue, but it also manages to accomplish what so many recent Bond incarnations have failed to do - to maintain the notion that the story at hand is a spy thriller of the Bond genetic source material. Where Timothy Dalton's Bond's seemed very much the ""duck out of water,"" and Pierce Brosnan's Bond teetered on the pointless, Craig's version has a character substance and enduring quality possessed of neither of his predecessors. And its precisely that quality that should keep the Bond franchise alive for some time to come. <br/><br/>Top marks, 007."

","A hard drive containing the names of undercover agents embedded in terrorist organizations is now up for sale and you suffered a near fatal injury trying to stop it. What would it take to send you back into the fray? Money, love, fear?<br/><br/>James Bond (played by Daniel Craig for the third time) and fellow MI6 agent Eve (played by Naomie Harris) have tracked a thief carrying a stolen hard drive with confidential information to a train. After an exhausting chase and an epic amount of destruction, Bond and the thief are locked in a physical struggle. With the thief in her sights, Eve (Harris), on orders from M (played by Judi Dench for the seventh time) takes the shot, misses, and sends 007 plummeting to the water below while the hard drive and the thief are lost. M (Dench) is summoned before a government committee where one member, Gareth Mallory (played by Ralph Fiennes), encourages her to retire. While en route to MI6 headquarters, their servers are breached and, while M watches helplessly in traffic, their offices are destroyed killing several agents. Bond, having taken his fall from the tracks as an opportunity to retire, learns of the attack while watching television in a bar. His return to government service is typically atypical. He breaks into M's home, reports for duty, and asks how he can be of service. Before returning to duty, Bond must submit to both a physical and a psychological exam. Despite failing both, a desperate M puts Bond back in the field, for lack of a better idea. <br/><br/>This being a Bond movie, there is, of course, a great deal more to the story. The moment we are introduced to the true villain, Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem) marks the Bond series' return to cinematic greatness. Bardem is truly terrifying and every time you think you've figured out his master plan, he shocks you. The introduction of Ben Whishaw as 007's liaison to Q branch breathes new life into an element of the franchise that I assumed had simply been abandoned with the departure of Pierce Brosnan and the death of the much-beloved Desmond Llewelyn. I understand that many Bond fans saw Quantum of Solace as a failure. Putting aside the fact that I was not one of them, this is easily the best Bond film since Craig assumed the role of lead actor, in my opinion. No fan of the franchise should miss seeing Skyfall in theaters. It is brilliant."
"Ryan_MYeah","10","2","9","2 December 2012"," 007 is still as sleek, suave, and thrilling as ever. I guess you really can teach an old dog new tricks.
","Sometimes, a movie title can bear an ironic metaphor. Indeed, longtime James Bond fans could find little solace amidst the disappointment of Quantum of Solace, the lackluster follow up to Martin Campbell's Casino Royale, the thrilling 2006 reboot to the 007 franchise. Amends had to be made, and with Sam Mendes (Of American Beauty and Road to Perdition fame) in the director's chair, the hype behind Bond's 23rd venture in 50 years was justified. The result, Skyfall, an exhilarating, intense, and even emotional movie that should please longtime devotees, and even win the franchise some new fans.<br/><br/>After a failed mission to retrieve a hard drive containing the identities and placements of MI6 agents in criminal organizations around the world (complete with a motorcycle chase that would justify Gary Powell and his stunt team claiming the SAG stunt ensemble award on its own), Bond (Daniel Craig), believed to be dead for months, reemerges to uncover the identity of whoever stole the hard drive. The years have finally caught up with Bond, as he proves to be less invincible and more psychologically damaged than in previous incarnations.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, he's still cleared for duty by his superior M (Judi Dench). This makes for one of the movie's fascinating emotional elements. Despite the questionable methods between the two, we get to see a warm, almost maternal bond between them. The trail eventually leads Bond to Silva (Javier Bardem), a troubled ex-agent who seeks revenge for M's past sins. Bardem is fan-freakin'-tastic in the role, and everything a great Bond villain should be: Intimidating, intelligent, vengeful, conniving, and at times, even hilarious. You can tell that Bardem is having a blast in the role, and he makes for one of the best Bond villains, especially since it's more intimate than an evil corporation, less on a global scale, and more on a personal scale.<br/><br/>Moving on from that, Skyfall makes for both a great update, and a pleasant throwback to the old Bond staples. It ties evenly into the thematic context of Bond's character, often humorously referred to with ""old dog, new tricks."" For both new and old fans, you get the best of both worlds. It makes a great effort at looking into Bond's psychological state, and you also get the exhilarating action he's known for. The pacing is usually very kind to this development, although the third act does get a little tiresome.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the movie is flawless. Mendes brings together a veteran team of craftspeople that all do everything the job requires of them, and then some. Roger Deakins, who provides beautifully composed and stunning digital photography, is worthy of another Oscar he's not going to receive. The sound design, and the overall mix, is certainly top notch stuff. Dennis Gassner nails the tone of each scene with his detailed production design. Chris Corbould's practical effects are great, and the stunt work, again, is great. Early on, we also get a listen to Adele's beautifully melancholy title track, which deserves consideration as one of the year's best original songs, set to Daniel Kleinman's fabulous opening titles.<br/><br/>Overall, Skyfall is a smashing good action thriller that should entertain both the initiated and uninitiated viewers of 007. A much needed face lift that takes the series into new stylistic directions, but still stays true to the essence of what made James Bond a household name over the years. ""Old dog, new tricks""? That sounds about right.<br/><br/>***** / *****"
"BlairMcLovin","8","2","9","28 November 2012"," Skyfall Review
","First off, loved it.<br/><br/>Skyfall's story is a marked improvement on Quantum of Solace's sloppy pacing. The dialogue scenes are a joy to watch play out with such a great cast and successfully integrate well-worn bond tropes with scenes that carry some emotional weight. The action scenes are stunning to watch in the varied locales on display and have been plotted and storyboarded with precision keeping them visually comprehensible and maintaining that sense of realism that is missing when action is shot through close ups and shaky cam.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty great across the board with Craig giving another turn as a damaged (although somewhat funner) Bond and new additions Whishaw, Fiennes and Harris all seem right at home within the 007 universe. Judi Dench is a particular joy to watch this time round with her character given significantly more weight than in previous films. But most impressively Javier Bardem delivers one of the most memorable bond villains ever in my opinion, and the long continuous shot in which he first appears was a fantastic character introduction.<br/><br/>Previous Mendes collaborators Thomas Newman and Roger Deakins also benefit the film greatly with Newman providing an electronic score that ups the tension and cool of the scenes where present. Deakins comes as perhaps the films greatest asset providing beautiful cinematography from scene to scene, always finding visually captivating compositions to present the inspired location choices. A particular sequence set in a Shanghai skyscraper is a masterwork with changing neon lighting influencing the scene's feel from frame to frame, as well as being stunning to look at.<br/><br/>Without getting into spoilers, I can see how some people would have problems with the films third act where much of the story's momentum comes to a halt. Also Albert Finney's character was clearly intended for another storied Scottish actor and that absence is more than noticeable. But whatever damage the finale does to the film is minimal compared to everything that has come before.<br/><br/>After the disappointing Quantum of Solace, Skyfall comes as an impressive return to form for the 007 franchise and manages to become one of the best action films of recent years."
"apajari711","9","2","9","26 November 2012"," The Best Bond Yet!!!
","Although this movie came out so recently, I have to say that THIS MOVIE IS BY FAR THE BEST BOND FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. And I've seen almost all of them. When I first saw Daniel Craig as Bond, I honestly didn't like him. That's not because I hated him as an actor, but the story was just all kinds of bad for me. All he did in Casino Royale was play poker, and he didn't have the suaveness of the other Bonds. I understand that's how it was supposed to be because it was a reboot and an origin story, but it wasn't my cup of tea. I saw Quantum of Solace, but I don't really remember it, so it must not have been important. But this movie combined all of the things that made Bond such a great series. It combined the old school with the new. It had all of that nostalgic stuff I was used to, plus a darker more realistic tone, and I love it for doing that. Javier Bardem was essentially the Joker of the Bond universe. He's a great actor and this is one of his best performances. This movie is like The Dark Knight of the Bond series. ""Bond...James Bond..."""

","The movie was enjoyable. The music was good and suited the scenes. Action was smooth and didn't hog too much screen time. Visually the locations in the movie were interesting, varying and beautiful. Craig continues to perform well and fits the character perfectly. Same goes for the other characters. The villain stayed within logic and wasn't evil just for the sake of being evil. The plot is OK even though you can pretty much guess how it'll play out right from the start. The makers of this movie knew what the audience expects from a Bond movie and deliberately made jokes of those things, which for me was very refreshing. As with movies involving high-tech in the plot, there was hacking and such computer stuff in it which was a ""bit"" overplayed and animated compared to how it is in real life, but I accept this for the sake of making it visual for the movie viewer."

","I enjoyed this latest installment in the Bond series. I saw all of the Bond films during their first releases. In the 50th anniversary year of the franchise, Skyfall makes playful references to Bond films past and also establishes some roles for future episodes. This mission is of a more personal nature and takes place in today's world, where politics are related to terrorism and terrorism's greatest weapon is most likely a computer.<br/><br/>The story knowingly uses the blond villain convention, something that might seem cartoon-like. But Daniel Craig's Bond is anything but the infallible superhero. He is world weary and cynical. Perhaps he is more the hero because he must overcome his limitations. The entire cast is great."
"RainDogJr","9","2","9","25 November 2012"," There's a storm coming, Mr. Bond
","SKYFALL is the most memorable James Bond film from the Daniel Craig era. I watched other two films on the big screen too; I liked them a lot, but haven't revisit them ever since. I can't recall much about 'em. SKYFALL, on the other hand, is a movie so precise and, for a way to say it, minimalist in terms of plot issues that I will not have any problem to remember it in a near future. <br/><br/>All of that precision only helps in order to have a 143 minutes picture that feels like an hour- and-a-half one. Nothing feels out of place and it's like if Sam Mendes and the team of writers watched Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT RISES and said something like ""We don't wanna do that with our Bond movie. We don't want plot twists or subplots. We just want a good and simple action picture"". <br/><br/>I'm bringing Nolan's Batman to this commentary not just because the actual possibility that Nolan himself directs the next or a future Bond movie. It's because I thought SKYFALL feels at time like that version of Batman – a dark one, with a sort-of hopeless world. Coincidentally, SKYFALL opens with Bond going into exile, after apparently getting killed while doing a little mission. <br/><br/>Bond is having a terrific time, with women and lots of drinks, while London, specifically M and the MI6, are going through hard times, with terrorism and death threats for the agents and M herself. There's a scene in which M tells a speech about the dark times they are living that especially feels out of a Batman movie from Nolan. Hell, there's a ""storm is coming"" dialog too! <br/><br/>Javier Bardem? Well, everyone is talking about the new enemy of Bond. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't recall much talking about the enemies from CASINO ROYALE and QUANTUM OF SOLACE. SKYFALL has indeed a good villain. You're actually waiting for him, waiting to see by yourself why Bardem's character Silva has been ranked as one of Bond's best ever enemies. He's like the monster in any good old monster movie – I mean, you're waiting to see him but he won't show up for some time. <br/><br/>If anything, I will be eager to see the villain in the possible Bond movie of Nolan. Fact is that he (Nolan) perfectly knows how to create a memorable one and while I don't think Bardem will get an Oscar nomination (like Heath Ledger did with his Joker), he raised the bar pretty high. His hardcore fans, or any BIUTIFUL fan, may not agree with me, but for my money this is his third best and most memorable role ever, only behind his villain Anton Chigurh from NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (Joel Coen, 2007) and his hilarious one from PERDITA DURANGO (Alex de la Iglesia, 1997). <br/><br/>Sam Mendes was only interested in creating a classic hero vs. villain movie. It's an obvious remark, as the last part of the film is literally that, but that's what I liked the most about SKYFALL. Think in Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION, that beautiful part with Bruce Willis choosing which weapon he will use to save that Marsellus Wallace character. He ends, as you can remember dear reader, picking up a classic katana, over a chainsaw. <br/><br/>SKYFALL is a bit like that – Mendes and the writers could have had any kind of crazy location for the most important part of the film (the climax with the big, final confrontation between Craig and Bardem). The crew actually flew from London to Turkey and Shanghai, and they could have easily come up with something there. Instead, we have a setting as minimalist as just a house in the middle of nowhere in Scotland (although they filmed that part in England). Hell, we have old-fashioned shotguns as Bond's weapon! <br/><br/>There's a reason to all of that Scotland thing for sure, a very nice one really, but what I'm just sayin' is that SKYFALL, with all the fancy and great cars and weapons, is still a movie that focuses more in elements like a good rivalry between its two main characters (Bond and Silva of course). And when it comes to showing some fancy cars and stuff, well, the results are bloody fun! Terrific stuff and, by the way, Adele's main theme is great – it's funny as I don't really like her music, and I love (almost) everything Chris Cornell and Jack White, but her song is way better! <br/><br/>*Watched it on 20 November, 2012"

","I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the action sequences (especially the opening one) were fantastic. My favorite part of the whole movie was Javier Bardem as Silva. I thought this movie did a great job making this villain memorable and gave him a distinct personality that will stick. All of Bond's coworkers were also great. My only complaint with this movie was the Skyfall ranch scene and (without spoiling anything) I just thought it was a stretch given the circumstances they were in. Daniel Craig as Bond is good as can be expected at this point. The movie did a really good job giving us a rememberable Bond film with a personality that I think stands it up against all of the other movies."

","** minor spoilers ** We enjoyed this 007 action flick.. the opening chase sequence was quite stunning. And chases continue unabated. We finally meet our super-villain, Mallory, played by Javier Bardem. I gather he was a former MI6 station chief, who was jumped by the opps and 'interrogated', resulting in deep physical and emotional pain and a burning desire to get even with the 'M' character, Head of MI6 (and Bond's boss). Mallory feels she betrayed him (not sure if that's what really happened, but Mallory has strong opinions on the matter). Mallory also has an island with a super-network of PC's and enough programming & hacking skills to set up a wave of explosions and mayhem to shake MI6 to its very foundations. Bardem is excellent, especially during his scenes with Daniel Craig (James Bond). I don't think I can give away any plot points or real spoilers - what I have related so far drives the action, but this is NOT a plot-driven Bond flick. So, buckle up and enjoy."
"EUyeshima","8","2","9","24 November 2012"," A Surprising Bond Girl at the Center of Craig's Most Accomplished Turn as 007
","The now half-century-old James Bond franchise is still the epitome of spy-versus-spy action cool having survived the Cold War all the way through the new millennium, and Daniel Craig continues to carry the mythic mantle with steely resolve in his third entry in the series. Directed by top-level filmmaker Sam Mendes (""American Beauty""), this 2012 movie manages to be both a cheeky throwback to the character's legacy and a state-of-the-art Bourne-inspired terrorist thriller. It opens in classic style with a breathless chase through the streets of Istanbul and literally on the rooftops of the old city's Grand Bazaar with Bond and MI6 operative Eve hot on the trail of a target carrying a hard drive containing the identities of every British Secret Service agent. A shot is fired, mandated by M back in MI6's London headquarters, and knocks Bond into a river. This leads beautifully to the macabre Saul Bass-inspired title sequence underscored by Adele's sonorous vocals.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, MI6 is under siege and goes underground when Bond finally resurfaces rattled by his near-death experience. Given a Walther PPK and tracking device by a new post-adolescent Q, Bond travels to Shanghai to confront the elusive target again in an exciting mano-a-mano fight. He is led by a sexy enigmatic woman named Severine to Silva, an ex-MI6 agent-turned-cyber-terrorist hell bent on revenge against M for sacrificing him on an espionage mission during the Hong Kong hand-off. As Silva starts killing off the agents identified on the disc, he arrives in London with the intent of publicly executing M, so Bond escapes with her to his childhood manor in the Scottish Highlands which gives the film its name. The story up to this point is genuinely thrilling, but by the time we get to the climax at Skyfall, the movie loses steam and most essentially, creative invention. It becomes an over-the-top conflagration in more ways than one leading to an inevitably fatalistic encounter in a chapel.<br/><br/>What also struck me about this movie was the scarcity of Bond girls - only two, neither of whom figures in the climax - but then it dawned on me that Mendes and screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan have really set up M as the ultimate Bond girl. Judi Dench has far more screen time in this film than in her other appearances, and she allows us a glimpse behind the starchy Machiavellian mother figure she has played so adroitly. As Silva, Javier Bardem sports another bad haircut (and a dye job this time) to play a Bond villain that balances precariously between menacing and campy. His fey manner and come-on scene with Bond are amusing enough, but the disjointed nature of his role comes from the fact that his vengeance is directed far more at M, not Bond. Eurasian French actress Bérénice Marlowe is stunning as Severine but only has one critical scene that allows her to show any dimension, while Naomie Harris (""28 Days Later"") lends comely grit to Eve even if mainly on the sidelines.<br/><br/>In an extended cameo that seems to beg for the return of Sean Connery (who would have been too distracting had he been cast), an almost unrecognizable Albert Finney plays Kincade, the resourceful gameskeeper of the Skyfall estate, in avuncular fashion. Ralph Fiennes shows up as an intelligence officer with the authority to determine the future of MI6, but it's clear his character is being set up for the next entry in the series. Joining Connery on the pantheon of 007s, Craig is really making his interpretation of Bond uniquely his own as the super-agent goes through what amounts to a mid-life crisis. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, who has provided expert lens work to previous Mendes projects like ""Revolutionary Road"", captures the richness of the exotic locales - Shanghai, Macao, Istanbul, a deserted island in ruins, and even the Scottish highlands - with fluid dexterity. The film runs long at 143 minutes, especially since the last half-hour does not keep up the momentum built up to that point. The more important takeaway, however, is that the film is successful in whetting one's appetite for the 24th installment in the series."

","It has been done. Finally, a Bond film has broken out of the bonds (no pun intended) of its franchise to breathe fresh air. Skyfall does away with the clichés and stigmas of its predecessors, and receives high marks as a serious, original action film; a makeover fitting for Bond's 50th anniversary.<br/><br/>Skyfall has once again stepped up the action, and does so throughout the entire film. Surprisingly however, it achieved this not though the franchises usually over the top nature, but as a result of its mesmerizing style. Every scene is lit with eye-popping precision. The cinematography was stimulating, especially in the scenes shot in the high rises of Shanghai, where neon lights swam and pulsated across the windows. The action also benefited from the heart pumping soundtrack that was at home with Bond's tempo and flair.<br/><br/>But what shocked me the most about Skyfall was its quality writing. True, the Bond franchise has had its fair share of well written films; however, the recent lackluster installments featured jumbled and often confusing plots. Skyfall dispels those memories with a simple, but engaging story that crafts a dire and unpredictable circumstance. Before the film started, I made a pledge to try to predict the plot twists, and was pleasantly surprised that my guesses were off on every attempt. Nearly every aspect of the story was improved. For one of the first times, we are treated to an interesting villain, a role that in the past was filled with cheesy, un-intimidating, and boring megalomaniacs. With all the characters I felt an unprecedented level of characterization, which caused me to actually care about their fates. In Skyfall we get to see another side of Bond, a side that more effectively emphasizes his complicated and unstable nature.<br/><br/>Skyfall felt like a true action film, crafted with extreme care and thought. It avoided the many shortcomings of its predecessors, providing a breath of fresh air to what was a stagnant franchise. Skyfall accomplished everything a Bond film needed to be and then some. Admittedly I have never been a fan of the franchise, but Skyfall made me a convert."
"dromasca","7","2","9","24 November 2012"," 21st century Bond
","The century is the 21st according to one of the popular counting methods and 'Bond, James Bond' is still spoken from the screen by a man dressed in a tuxedo with a glass of a selected cocktail in hand. Yet, very many things are new in the last few films in the series (now at #23 if I am not mistaken) and the traditional casino scenes, the exotic locations, the gadgets and even the fabulous Bond girls, without being completely pushed to the back seats are secondary in the recently released 'Skyfall'. It's a new world, a world where the good guys in the service of Her Majesty are no longer fighting the bad guys on the other side of the Iron Curtain, as there is no longer any such Curtain. Not only the enemy is no longer clearly defined by politics or nationality, but he can actually be one of 'us'. Bond himself is no longer an infallible gentlemen feeling no pain and encountering no failure, he actually fails, and falls, and is wounded - physically and psychologically. Daniel Craig is a completely different type of actor than the first (big) names who took the role, he is not only better, but also has a much more distinct human dimension. No longer a super-hero. Hardly a hero.<br/><br/>Is the new James Bond better? I would say yes, but not much better. Certainly, the realistic touch brought by director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Revolutionary Road) is an interesting turn. For the first time maybe in a film in the James Bond series we are watching a Bond and an 'M' which are not only flesh and blood, but also complex human beings, with doubts and dilemmas that we can understand and resonate with. The question however for me is to what extent these human dimensions work in the context of a mega-action series whose rules are not only set from start but also known by almost anybody who chooses to come and see the film. This is a film I liked, but now, two or three hours after I watched it I can say that I liked it because of the same good all reasons that I liked all good James Bond films - for the fabulous action scenes (and there are a few memorable ones in the film), for the variations on the old familiar characters (and I loved the new 'Q') and for the balance between tradition and innovation. It is not for the psychological deepness of the characters that I (and many other fans) go to see a Bond film. The problem is not that the characters are not deep and real, but that these aspects of the film are too overloaded, and if the film seems to be a bit too long it is just because of these.<br/><br/>Some of the acting is very much to the point. Judi Dench gives a great performance (possibly her last one in the series) which puts in shadow all other characters in what is probably the first Bond film without a real Bond girl to receive consistent screen time. Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, and Naomi Harris mark the new generation that will probably take further familiar characters in the next 21st century installments, while Javier Bardem adds his name to the illustrious series of Bond villains. Times are achangin' and so are slowly the Bond films. For good? We still are too see, but there are signs it's the right direction. If we are to look back 50 years after, it's only Her Majesty who did not really change since the series started!"

","This film had much to live up the. the hype was similar to that of the awful Quantum Of Solace which frankly made no sense at all. Daniel Craig is back as the bad and gritty Bond sans gadgets. No car cameos for the sole purpose of product placement, like that of the weak as water Z3 of Goldeneye, or the split second Z8 from The World is not Enough, are gone. The action start right from the outset with that much lauded bike chase across the rooftops of Istanbul. We meet the new Q. This installment explains that Q stands for Quartermaster for those of us who haven't read the books. A computer hard drive is stolen with a list of agents on it. It's not a new theme by any means but this movie has rebooted the series for those of us who hated the Quantum of Solace. Bond recovers from serious injuries to return to MI6 to help get the hard drive back. Q gives Bond a Walther PPK with high-tech personal coding and a tracking device but no other goodies. In a way it gives us a Bond from the 60's who got by on guile alone. The score cleverly works in some familiar tunes from Bond movies gone by but the star of the Skyfall has to be the DB5 which is exchanged when 007 feels the M's XJ stands out too much in a crowd. <br/><br/>The scenery is stunning both in Asia and Scotland as well as the usual spots in London.<br/><br/>A slightly deranged ex-agent (Silva) escapes custody to rampage against the machine he claims created him.

"nickmesafilms","10","2","9","20 November 2012"," Skyfall (2012) - Bond! James Bond!
","""Skyfall"" is the 23rd annual James Bond film, the third one to star Daniel Craig as Bond, and the film that marks the 50th anniversary of Bond. Raging fans of the Bond franchise have been anticipating the hell out of this movie, making it one of the most insanely-hyped films of 2012 since ""The Dark Knight Rises"". After an entire 50 years of different actors playing Bond, from Sean Connery to Roger Moore, from Timothy Dalton to Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig has created the most iconic and most memorable Bond, since the one and only Sean Connery's portrayal of the character, which was a little better. But, after the last two films portraying Bond, ""Casino Royale"", which is the Bond film that everyone loves the most, and ""Quantum of Solace"", which hardly anybody liked, Daniel Craig has given us, once again, a serious and fresher version of this beloved character in ""Skyfall"", which I'm happy to report, is probably the best Bond that we have had in such a long time. At a pace of 143 minutes, ""Skyfall"" is the longest and the best paced film of the entire franchise. While never having it's dull moments, ""Skyfall"" kept me on the edge of my seat from the opening shot to the ending credits. Director Sam Mendes perfectly directs ""Skyfall"" with so much precision, and with the help of Roger Deakins, the cinematographer of ""Shawshank Redemption"" fame, he and Deakins make the most gorgeous-looking Bond films I've ever seen. Deakins is a masterful cinematographer using the right amount of shadows, lighting, and framing, that perfectly sucks you into the world of Bond. The first 12 minutes of ""Skyfall"" is purely something to enjoy, while Bond is racing through the streets of Turkey, in this expertly filmed, perfectly choreographed, and amazingly entertaining scene that starts ""Skyfall"" with a bang! Which then leads to a beautifully jaw-dropping opening title sequence with Adele's hit song ""Skyfall"", hence the name of the movie, plays in the background, perfectly matching the feel and tone of the Bond style. The action is incredibly well-choreographed, the cinematography is glowing, the directing is superb, and not to mention, this cast knocks it right out of the park. It's a complete cliché for me to say that Daniel Craig is always terrific in the role of James Bond, perfectly delivering a serious style to the character that we haven't seen before, since Timothy Dalton's turn playing James Bond in ""Licence to Kill"". Judi Dench is always great to watch on screen as M, and Ben Whishaw is just terrific playing Bond's quartermaster, the return of a character considered so beloved in the Bond franchise. Although Ralph Fiennes felt unnecessary for the film until the final scene of the film, I still thought that he provided good work as well. Berenice Lim Marlohe and Naomie Harris, although both gorgeous and delivering decent performances, they're sadly given less screen time and/or character development, as if the movie just wanted to get rid of these characters to keep the movie going. But, the stand-out performance is Javier Bardem, playing one of the most enjoyable Bond villains ever put on film. He's the type of villain that you seem to understand why is he or she doing all these villainous acts in the first place. Although he is still one of the wackiest and villainous Bond ""bad guys"", I honestly felt that some of his actions in the film felt way too similar to the actions portrayed by Heath Ledger as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight"". But although Bardem is still terrific in the role, it felt like he was copying Ledger at times. Yeah, there are some moments of dis-belief that I couldn't get past, but in the end, this is a Bond movie, not a war drama. But, for it's few minor issues, ""Skyfall"" is a well-made, expertly directed, beautifully photographed and choreographed, and damn entertaining ride. ""Skyfall"" is one of the best Bond movies of our time, and it's one of the best movies of the year. ""Skyfall"", in my review, ""classic Bond entertainment at it's finest""."

"Joxerlives","8","2","9","18 November 2012"," By far Craig's best Bond so far
","I was never a big fan of Daniel Craig's previous 2 outings as Bond. He seemed rather soulless in many ways compared to his predecessors although he probably ties with Timothy Dalton as closest to what Fleming had in mind (and I'm certainly not fond of the Bond in the books whom you would probably cross the road to avoid if you met him in real life). The tone of the previous 2 films was also something I wasn't too fond off, I'm not sure I want to sit around on a bank holiday watching Bond having his testicles beaten and why they felt it necessary to include the rape scene in 'Quantum of Solace' is beyond me?<br/><br/>But Skyfall makes up for that in a great many ways. Genuinely exciting and with some thrilling action sequences, Daniel Craig really seems to have found his stride in the role (much as Connery and Moore didn't produce their best Bond film until their third outing). What's more we very much have a more emotional and human Bond in this version, bitter at M for her treatment of him, disillusioned with the service but still faithful to it, a decent cynic (an allegory for Britain's place in the world?). Very much more set in the real world, M battling against parliamentary oversight and ethical questions as to the morality of the double-Os, (shades of the War on Terror?) being held to account for a fiasco that is in no way her fault and finding herself the scapegoat for press, public and parliament. We finally explore Bond's past, finding him an orphan with M cast very much as a mother figure to him as the villain points out. With her death and the introduction of a new male M, Q and Moneypenny we have almost a complete reboot of the series. <br/><br/>Good stuff? Love Moneypenny, didn't guess the twist until the rooftop sequence where she talks about taking a backroom job. Wonderful train sequence, right up there with Roger Moore in 'Octopussy' and the bike chase is terrific. M's death comes as a complete shock, really was the last thing you expected. I kept expecting one of the supporting players to be revealed as a traitor but they never were. Love the very human and fallible Bond who is genuinely out of shape and can't shoot straight, too often in films we have heroes who are supposed to have gone to pot yet perform feats that would be beyond the ability of an Olympian. The Bad? The death of the villain's girlfriend was depressingly predictable and the sadism of it distasteful. The whole thigh-stroking scene was a bit out there (especially given the homophobia of Fleming's books), I wondered if we were watching Torchwood or something? The idea of luring the villain to a final showdown wasn't bad but couldn't Mallory have dispatched a helicopter full of SAS to help them out? One cliché I find truly distasteful is that evil=deformed, human nature maybe but I'd rather have a deformed hero than a villain. All told great stuff and I look forwards to Craig's next 2."
"Laakbaar","8","2","9","18 November 2012"," Solid Bond movie
","I saw this as a fairly enjoyable movie with a good deal of spectacular action, particularly at the start in Turkey. It's a solid Bond film, worth about 7.5. I liked the fact that the movie changed direction several times. Hang on for the ride.<br/><br/>No, it's not a perfect movie. It's a little too long. This film is rather overloaded with shootouts, martial arts fights and chase scenes.<br/><br/>Although I suppose the ending worked, and was well played by Dench and Craig, I found the last quarter of the movie to be contrived. Was it really necessary for Siliva to go to London? To bring M to Skyfall? After a while you have to wonder whether saving M is worth all those lives.<br/><br/>There were a few aspects of the Silva character that I didn't quite get. Where did he get all these resources? That knowledge of computers? And what was Silva's hold over his henchmen? How was he able to hold his own against Bond? <br/><br/>The Komodo scene with groan-worthy. That's a return to the camp Bond of Roger Moore's day.<br/><br/>After more than 110,000 votes on IMDb, this movie garners the high rating of 8.1. It also does well on other movie sites. This is turning out to be one of the most popular Bond movies of all time -- like it or not.<br/><br/>And yet most reviews that give this movie a high score are getting an unusually high number of thumbs down. I'm not sure what this indicates, but there seems to be a small number of disgruntled movie reviewers who are gnashing their teeth at the popularity of this movie and trying to show their displeasure in any way they can. I'm sure they are not even reading the reviews they are thumbing down. Many of them have reviewed only one film on IMDb.<br/><br/>This movie still has the basic elements of a Bond movie. Besides, part of the pleasure of this franchise is to see what the directors and actors have done with the concept.<br/><br/>And what they've done with it is to bring it firmly within the current mainstream fad for shootouts, martial arts fights and chase scenes. Many movies are like this now. In this world of blurred genres, it's difficult to tell a superhero movie from a superspy movie. All our movie heroes seem to be invulnerable now. Is this the inevitable by-product of the video-game age? It's hard to see where this will end. Maybe they should make everyone human again.<br/><br/>At the very least we all should be deeply grateful that Pierce Brosnan is no longer playing Bond. I certainly hope this disgruntled minority is not pining away for the return of Brosnan.<br/><br/>Anyway, those are a few of the good points and quibbles. It's a big movie (a long movie) and worth going to see. You know you'll have to: it's a Bond movie."

The opening of the movie is amazing which is typical of any Bond movie and the villain was really good too, grounded in reality but still a hint of the cartooniness that works so well with Bond villains. Still not a huge fan of Daniel Craig as James Bond (I guess I am more of a traditional fan when it comes to how I like my James Bonds) but it's a good movie, if you like the more recent Bond movies you'll be very happy, it is probably the best Bond movie of the new bunch with Daniel Craig so definitely worth a look.

"cattjones","9","2","9","15 November 2012"," And Bond Keeps Rolling Along
","I have to say that it has been a while since I've seen a Bond film and this is the first one that I have seen with Daniel Craig in the lead role. I don't remember a 007 film being this long, but I have to say that the adventures of Bond are sure to continue. I just hope that they won't start doing them in pairs, like what they did with the Twilight film (part 1 and part 2). From the trailer, you could tell that James Bond comes back from his supposed demise and has to regenerate himself to protect his fearless leader. The one thing that the film does not explain is exactly how he survived the fall off that bridge. They may have shown it after they ran the credits at the end. I have found that more and more films are doing that, which I hate. Especially since this film was so dog gone long. I think that Daniel Craig did a decent job portraying 007, but I was not used to seeing the super spy so down-trodden. Hopefully he will be more charismatic in the next one (if he is still cast). Dame Judi Dench was a formidable ""M"" and was hardened and definitely goal oriented to the task at hand. Javier Bardem was very convincing as the crazy and totally ""out there"" villain Silva. He was as nutty and demented as Heath Ledger's Joker. He did a brilliant job making you hate him but at the same time, you wanted to know what the heck he was going to do next. The one thing that I did miss in this film was the abundance of gadgets that are usually introduced, but the film definitely worked without them. It turns out that Ben Whishaw's ""Q"" was almost too smart for his own britches, but I like the fact that he was a young character. I hope that they bring back Naomie Harris who played Eve in the next film. I think that she and Daniel had great chemistry on screen. This film did hold true to everything that is the amazing ""Bond"". Although this is yet another butt blister film, it is worth paying the price of a ticket to see it on the big screen. I have to say that the only thing that was missing while viewing this film was a dry martini (shaken, not stirred). I give this film a glaring green light."
"kgprophet","7","2","9","15 November 2012"," A Good Blend of Bond, Bourne, & Batman
","This film looks like it took four years to make. Give the franchise a rest and let the story brew for a while, and in this case add some depth, and you've rebooted the franchise successfully. There was a hint of what the future of Bond would be like with the Daniel Craig incarnation. My original impression of Craig in ""Casino Rolyale"" was that he came off more like a goon, a lowbrow hit-man, than a suave jet-setting playboy. More intellectual in discourse, more real world consequences. There were missteps in what new Bond would be like in tone. How much ""Bourne"", which is shaky cam chase scenes in exotic cities, and how much tradition, which is the ""shaken not stirred"" kabuki. In ""Casino Royale"" a distinction had to be made. Either Bond was a wise-cracking super spy, or a malleable thoughtful government agent who can't just act like a machine. Perhaps they tried to be both, but found the gravitas too heavy (CR - the bond girl is crying in the shower, Skyfall - the bond girl is an exotic dancer in the shower.) On the other hand, if the bad guy is too over-the-top, you get into goofy territory. So it took a couple tries, but this well contemplated new approach finds Bond as a damaged human being, while capable of putting on the superhero cape. This is ""Batman Begins"" for the Bond franchise. Complete with dark and moody sets and lighting. MI6, for example, is now headquartered in it's own bat cave. Bond has a chance to revisit his childhood, his own tragic backstory of losing his parents as a child and left with a big mansion, such as Batman.<br/><br/>All this serious ""Bourne meets Dark Knight"" is a good way to mix up the now cliché scenes that are supposed to be obligatory, but in the 50th year, certainly needs a change of guard.<br/><br/>So spoilers coming up.<br/><br/>M is replaced, Q is now a well cast younger man who is a hacker, and a new Moneypenny.<br/><br/>...Spoilers finished.<br/><br/>This re-energising the franchise helps Craig the most, where he is allowed to go unshaven, and be more like a real guy instead of a superhuman (at least for a little while). The bad guy this time is probably one of the best in the franchise, again because there is depth to his character. His reasons for causing mayhem are well grounded, and Javier Bardem injects some of the most disturbing quirks. The action is a little light this time around, but the motivation behind the action scenes are setup and executed very well. The ""Bourne"" style sequences are far better than ""Bourne Legacy"", and are easy to follow. It is Bond's childhood home that we spend a good deal of time in the third act, learning about many things, and meet Albert Finney's character. The inevitable showdown gets drawn out, clocking in at 2 hours and 23 minutes, and isn't quite as spectacular as the filmmakers think it is. They still seem obligated to fulfill one of the trademark clichés (blowing things up real good). The music I found to be mostly as punchy as the ""Bourne"" soundtracks, hitting the right spots when necessary. As observed by other critics, there is a great uptick in the cinematography, as this is one of the best looking Bond films in memory. The direction is also crisp, making it easy for Stuart Baird to piece together a slick paced thriller.<br/><br/>I declare the re-imagining to be a success, and the movie acts very well as an origin reboot film, and successfully blending Bond, Bourne, and Batman."
"xyntium12","8","2","9","13 November 2012"," Skyfall: Different, Refreshing, and Surprising, Just a little lack
","This new James Bond Film in Daniel Craig tenure is somewhat different. The plot is the thing that can be said excellent, of course very much different. This movie has been matched with the current global issue dealing with more modern threat. The villain played by Javier Bardem can be said very good. He gives the villain character some differences from other villains That's for the plot. For the actors and the actress, the principal casts (James Bond, Eve, Q, Tanner, M, and Gareth Malory) have their parts almost equal. That's the first time ever in Bond Franchise that the Principal Cast do so. If you're a Bond Fans, you can refresh your mind about the previous Bond Film by watching Skyfall, since there are some direct references to the previous films, maybe for marking the 50th anniversary. This movie is also very surprising, that's why I urge you to watch if you haven't watched it yet.<br/><br/>Somehow, this film is lack of what the series always have in the previous film. Among the principal casts, Berenice Marlohe as Severine is the weak part. She should have been given a more central role, even though she's in the opposite side of Bond. It's unorthodox, since any Bond Girls in the Franchise are given more central role, no matter of where they stand. The Bond Girls is the integrated part of the series, lacking their parts just seems like A tea without a sugar.<br/><br/>For conclusion, this new film is a boost from the previous one, very different, Refreshing, and surprising, just lack what this film should have more.<br/><br/>My Rating 8/10"
"judywalker2","7","2","9","12 November 2012"," Ian Fleming might be happy but overall a bore
","I have been waiting all weekend to see Skyfall. I know most people either love or hate Daniel Craig as James Bond but I like him a lot. He is more hard edged and I think that's what the film makers intended. This movie come on the celebration of 50th years of Bond and I think the film makers wanted to come up with the real Bond the one Ian Fleming imagined..but ultimately Bond and the film are a lore. I know now if it has to do with the modern era of technology or what we expect more from our spies and Bond has always given us more, but not this time. They should have know that they we're going to get away with this kind of cerebral, soapy story after the failure of ""Tinker, Tailor,Soldier Spy."" Audiences want to keep somethings about their flawed heroes a secret. What did I like about Skyfall? The opening was great and Daniel Craig inhabits his character as does Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes didn't do a bad job either. Javier Bardem tore up the scream and really had me liking his bad guy character until they ruin him in the end. What I didn't like? The story was okay but the lack of gadgets hurt and the new Q was boring. I know they believed that all of the high tech computer play would suffice but it just didn't. Now the thing I hated most was the lack of realism with the final battle, too ridiculous even for a Bond movie. Bond movies always have the international calvary riding in to help showing us that England is not alone in the battle against evil, I miss that. Lastly there was no Bond girl, the dumb Naoemi Harris and the beautiful, yet meaningless Berenice Marlohe could have been written out and no one would have noticed. A Bond girl has beautiful, charm, a story of her own and she lingers past the credits but these two are totally forgettable. Too bad I really wanted to like this movie a lot. I wanted it to be a 9 or 10. I gave it a 7 for Craig, Dench and Bardem. It might make a lot of money in the first week but it will take a big and final drop quickly. You know a movie should make you feel something so that you are talking about it afterward, the audience should be chattering while leaving the theater. Well when we left Bond there was only silence."
"haosstoposto","7","2","9","12 November 2012"," Solid Bond but nothing special
","Movie begins with a very good chase in Istanbul which is shot in beautifully exciting manner. The motorcycle chase on the city's rooftops is something new and the classical shooting scene on the train is made fresh with an excavator and massive destruction. But from this moment the movie slows down and I believe the director wanted to make the story more personal for Bond this way. We see Bond gets shot by his partner Moneypenny, his resurrection, his physical and psychological tests in MI6 which he fails. All that hints (or should hint) to an agent whose best days are behind him, something that could have been used to create more drama or conflict. But then his boss M"" intervenes and puts him back into active service, and that was it. He is back in the game and kicks bad guys a..ess with ease. The only time we see his physical weakness is when he tries to shoot a glass on top of someones head. His hand trembles and he misses. But after that he singlehandedly kills 5 or 6 henchmen. His antagonist in this movie is a disillusioned ex MI6 agent who has been betrayed by M"" to the Chinese, tortured for months and failed to kill himself with poison which left him partially disfigured. The problem with this character is that he is considered as an epitome of evil by some of his associates (like beautiful Severine who trembles when she thinks of betraying him), but his brutality is never shown on screen, nor does he look intimidating (remember Zorin in A View to a Kill"", his gaze is that of a madman, chillingly played by Christopher Walken). His potential as a worlds best computer hacker is never used for anything grand like it is the case with other Bonds enemies. OK, he did blow up a MI6 headquarters and managed to expel inhabitants of some unnamed island by computer trick (which also doesn't make sense, the government would probably send someone on-site to see what actually happened, but never mind). He only wants to take vengeance on M"" and to that end he let himself be captured and brought to London. After his escape he goes with his henchmen to the M's public inquiry and then we have some boring gunfight. M escapes with Bond to Scottland with a plan to lure their enemy to Bond family estate (named Skyfall, if you wondered about the movie title), where they will make their stand. I have no idea what is so great about this plan, because M as a chief of MI6 can probably ask for some police help. Or some Special forces. Or some Army tanks and helicopters. But whatever. They go to Scottland and manage to defend them self with two hunting rifles, one pistol and a knife against two dozen mercenaries and a helicopter. In the end bad guy bites the dust, M dies of her injuries and Bond returns to be the best MI6 agent there is. As for Bond girls, we have charming Moneypenny and stunning Severine. Severine quickly and pointlessly dies in the middle of the movie and Moneypenny ends being a secretary of new MI6 director, which is debasement for a field agent and a sharpshooter but maybe thats is how MI6 works. All in all a Bond movie which is on par with Quantum of solace"". OK, maybe a little bit better."
"mohan59","6","2","9","11 November 2012"," Interesting, but...
","First things first. This is nowhere near as dreary as Quantum of Solace. That was one film which after watching gave me the feeling: ""Did I just watch a Bond movie or a star-studded documentary on water preservation?"" At the same time, Skyfall is not Casino Royale either. Craig's debut Bond vehicle had the right mix of decadence, delicatessen, and deviousness on either side of the fence. Comparing films is not necessarily a good thing, but then, Bond flicks are prime targets for such a study and I would have to say this could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>To start with, the story fits in with the premise of Bond returning to his past to confront those pesky ghosts. Likewise M. In a story closely resembling Mission Impossible (1996), Bond must prevent a list of all field agents and their aliases from falling into the wrong hands. Although the list is lost, Bond nearly succeeds, but for an apparent failed shot from Eve (Naomie Harris), he plummets into the white waters below and is presumed killed on duty. Cut to a daring attack on MI6 HQ and Bond gets all teary-eyed about dear ol' England and reports for work, with a stinking breath and bloodshot eyes for good measure. His evaluation tests prove negative, but M (Dame Judi Dench, in a far cry from the imposing matriarch of the secret service) overrules them and reinstates Bond into active field work, much to the chagrin of Interior Security Chairman George Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). Packed off to Shanghai to resume his tete-a-tete with the assassin who stole the list, Bond fails again, but this time, is thrown a lifeline by a mysterious woman called Severine (Berenice Marlohe). She leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former MI6 agent who was once loyal to M only to be sacrificed by her on a doomed mission and has now sworn vengeance on ""Mommy"" (as he calls M). Bond captures Silva but loses Severine along the way. A sneering Silva taunts M in captivity (similar to how Joker delighted himself in provoking Dent, Batman, and Gordon in The Dark Knight). Through a combination of computer wizardry and clever disguises, Silva escapes from the cage and bombs an underground rail line, throwing Bond and his pursuers off-track (literally). Meanwhile, as Silva has released few names from the list and those agents facing public executions due to blown covers, M is summoned to a court hearing where she faces tough questions. Bond has determined that Silva is on an all-out assault to get M and she barely escapes. Bond takes her to his childhood home called Skyfall in Scotland and proceeds to guard themselves along with the house-keeper Kincaid (Albert Finney). The first line of attackers arrive and Bond & Co deal with them successfully, albeit with M getting shot. Silva arrives in a helicopter and proceeds to decimate the house with heavy firepower. Bond increases the stakes by lighting cylinders in response to Silva torching his beloved Aston Martin and finally kills him with a knife, but is left downcast as M succumbs to her injuries. Eve reveals that she is actually Moneypenny as Mallory takes over M's job.<br/><br/>The story is not entirely original, borrowing elements from spy flicks. Bond's motivation which seemed to be under scrutiny in QoS (one of the few saving graces of that film) is taken for granted here, in a manner that is almost off-hand. The background score is jarring at times, and Adele's rendition of ""Skyfall"" is not bad but not great either. The fights are great but not memorable. Shanghai has been shot beautifully, though! As for acting, Bardem is the top-dog. His chuckling demeanor, his rat monologue, his macabre face as he removes his false teeth, all serve to paint him as a coldly vengeful former agent. Craig is great as well, but seems to be strangely subdued in some scenes. I got a great kick out of seeing Fiennes and I am really curious to know how the next instalment will pan out, given the prickly relationship M and Bond share. The two ladies are neither Black Widow nor Vesper Lynd but somewhere in between, which is all the more confusing. Ben Whishaw adds charm to a tiny role, but seriously, where are the gadgets, man? All said and done, this film raises more questions than answers. And those questions are more to do with the film itself, than anything else!"
"seantran1992","7","2","9","11 November 2012"," Good Bond movie but not great.
","There is only ONE thing that killed this movie for me. First of all, we all know movies like this...""The good guy eventually triumphs over the bad guy."" But it is good storytelling that makes you forget that. So we all knew Javier Bardem's character Silva was going be defeated. But that is not the point. The point is how he died so easily. The whole movie built on how intelligent and sinister he was, and just like that he gets a knife in the back and dies. There is no final fight scene between Bond and Silva? Silva being this former MI6 agent, a favorite of M at one point, does not go toe to toe with Bond? That killed this movie for me. Overall, I do like this movie but it's not one those movies I would watch again. On the other hand, the other characters and the action/chase scenes were absolutely fantastic!! That is what saved this movie. 7.5/10"
"johnnymacbest","9","2","9","11 November 2012"," Bond is back and better than ever.
","After Quantum of Solace became somewhat of a mix bag and disappointed many fans of the series into becoming reluctant to invest in a new film in the series, I can say that the series is back in track with the newest and best Bond film ever made this year. Gone are the disjointed plot points and character interactions of the previous film; in it's place is a character-driven and intelligently written script with terrific performances from Craig, Dench, Naomi Harris and more. What makes this film better than Quantom and much more different is the emotional and vulnerable aspect of the character. Bond not only shows that he's tough-as-nails secret agent, but also a world-weary human being and ""Skyfall"" captures that aspect beautifully along with the stunning cinematography and action scenes.<br/><br/>I have no faults with this film; however my only caveat is that it took so damn long to be released. With all the legal and financial woes settled and back in the swing of things, Agent 007 is back and better than ever in a film that feels fresh and exciting the same way as he was reintroduced back into movie theaters in 2006's stellar Casino Royale."
"agmoldham","6","2","9","10 November 2012"," Definitely one of the better Bond movies
","This is Daniel Craig's third Bond movie. The first of these was very good and the second a bit disappointing. The good news is that the third is very good again.<br/><br/>As ever the opening sequence is thrilling and sets up the movie. There's an interesting twist on the titles sequence which is pretty good. The plot of the movie revolves around the loss of a list of identities of all the British spies around the world. Bond must discover who has this list and then recover it before it endangers the lives of all the spies. Obviously the why they have it is also very important and this becomes the crux of the film. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig was very good throughout and in particular in the early part of the film where he shows some of Bond's flaws. As ever Judy Dench was good in support and there also several other good supporting roles. The best part of the movie is that it leaves you wanting more and I'm certainly looking forward to the next episode."
"action-man101","9","2","9","9 November 2012"," One of the Best
","Excellent. One of the best Bond films of the entire series. It captures the dark brooding brilliance of Casino Royale and marries it with the panache, humour and style of the Connery-era Bonds. Stunning pre-credit action sequence which is probably the best of all the 23 Bonds. Craig is better than ever as 007 and has truly made the role of Bond his own. Fans of the early Bond films will love certain homages which aren't forced but flow naturally into the story. Bardem is the best villain of the entire 23-film series, Judi Dench is brilliant as always as is Ben Wishaw as the new Q. Casino Royale is still my favourite but Skyfall is a close second, with Goldfinger third. The final 15 mins is just 007 heaven! ENJOY!"

","Finally got a chance to watch the latest Bond Movie. This is definitely a better Bond movie after the Debacle of ""Quantum of Solace"". However it seems they have not spend much time on the story-line and the plot for Skyfall. If you are expecting the brilliance of ""Casino Royale"" from ""Skyfall"" then you would be as disappointed as I am. <br/><br/>The opening sequence is good and sets a good tone. However, somewhere in the middle I lost the interest. The movie is a tad too long... better editing would have helped. I found the plot rather uninteresting and meaningless; and you can easily find a lot of loop-holes in the story.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is good, Judi Dench looked out of sorts and Javier Bardem is almost wasted. Bardem's character deserved a bit more screen space. The action sequences have been shot well and the production value is excellent. A good one time watch!"
"gus-calderon","5","2","9","6 November 2012"," Why insisting in making an emotional James Bond?
","Once again they tried to have a more ""human"" James Bond with feelings and all the crap... James Bond is not like that, he likes women, he kill bad guys, he does incredible things, he uses super high tech weapons, he always use the best brand new cars and he never shows emotions. In this film they tried to evoke the Sean Connery era with an emotional 007 with a very dumb story. At least he still likes women, tough he leaves open the idea that he might have tried other than women. All of that would be OK in a different movie, but it is James Bond. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the theater was crowded and most of the people seamed to be very happy with the movie, it has a high rating at the IMDb, so I guess there must be something about this movie that people just loved it. I am sorry, but I couldn't find it.<br/><br/>I usually never notice the goofs, but this movie has a lot of them. It is a shame, it looks like such an expensive movie with one of the current best directors and a wonderful cast, was not enough, they missed a good story and a good script."
"risfriend","7","2","9","4 November 2012"," Not a true bond movie, just okay
","This movie doesn't seem to be made with the Bond character in mind. Diverted theme. The only thing seemingly common with Bond saga is the naming of characters and MI6 is British. A bit of 'almost realistic' gadgets are thrown in, don't expect anything fancy, nothing Bond-like. Hell you don't even get some good length of Bond music. Pierce Brosnan was the last known icon for Bond fans. The slick skills of Bond are not there at all. Well, that said, there are a few good action scenes, which save the movie somewhat. If you are looking for more, skip this one. This is just a thriller movie, can't say its not a good thriller, but imprinting Bond's name on the package is false presentation. Lastly, for the next attempt, we need an actor who actually exudes character of Bond, at least the directors so far haven't made Daniel Craig come along like one."
"frank-kimmel-69","6","2","9","3 November 2012"," Skyfall....fitting title
","First of all the movie in its own right is a fairly good one. The trouble i have with this one is the direction it went...BACKWARDS. Producers went with ""out with the new and in with the old"" and dug up the old bond formula.<br/><br/>That really saddens me, because we already had 20+ bond movies with that formula end really could use the new direction the previous 2 bond-movies went.<br/><br/>In all Fairness this movie is good to watch, your interest level during the movie screening will not drop but as the old bond formula is used it becomes fairly predictable.<br/><br/>Just my 2 cents."
"kristopherm3","6","2","9","3 November 2012"," Take all seriousness and gritty realism Casino Royale brought to the franchise and throw it out of the window, and you get Skyfall!
","What's good about this film:<br/><br/>Great Directing, Great Cinematography, Great Cast, Great Theme.<br/><br/>What's bad about this film:<br/><br/>Terrible writing with forced-jokes that takes out every inch of seriousness and realism established in Casino Royale. What made the humour so good in Casino Royale was that is was unexpected and minor, but when it came it was fantastic. Skyfall's first 45 minutes is almost entirely comedy and when a serious point in the film occurs, the comedy takes away all emotion from the scene.<br/><br/>Feels like recession Bond (most of the film takes place indoors with extremely limited exotic locations).<br/><br/>The gritty tone of Casino Royale is lost entirely in this film and feels more like one of the Pierce Brosnan/Roger Moore Bond movies.<br/><br/>Bond's 50th anniversary made this film overly nostalgic and re-introduces Q, which from my point of view, was a bad idea and makes the film sillier. The reason Bond was reeboted was because it was becoming very formulaic and a parody of itself, sadly being the 50th anniversary the writers felt the need to re-introduce this awful material to make the film a 'classic' Bond.<br/><br/>Because of the 50th anniversary the Aston Martin DB5 is present, which seems like a good idea, right? Yes but it was executed VERY badly, the DB5 has been given the gadgets from Goldfinger like built in machine guns, this doesn't make ANY sense in the Daniel Craig films as Q doesn't supply cars with guns and it feels like a forced nod to the previous movies."
"nikhil_taneja","7","2","9","1 November 2012"," The Very Best and the Very Worst of Bond
","'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to inform you that Skyfall is Daniel Craig's best Bond film yet and amongst the top three of the entire franchise. Sam Mendes, you bloody genius, you!'<br/><br/>So that was the opening sentence of the review I had expected to write after watching Skyfall, the twenty-third film in the James Bond franchise and the third starring the very intense Craig, given that the badass trailer had very literally left me delirious for days at end and the phenomenal hype had me convinced that I was in for the motion picture experience of a lifetime. And then, as is usually the case, I saw the movie.<br/><br/>Before I make my case about the specific failings of the movie, which has a plot that puts Judi Dench's M and the MI6 directly in the line of danger, as Bond battles his body and the demons from his past to save the day, let's start with some reassurance that Skyfall, for the most part, is well worth a trip to the theaters.<br/><br/>This is Craig's most accessible Bond movie to date; the most popcorn Bond, if you will. It's also his funniest Bond, with deadpan humour in huge dollops, at the most unexpected places.<br/><br/>Director Mendes pulls out all stops to give us one of the most visually intoxicating Bond films too; the cinematography by veteran Roger Deakins is a class apart, and certain sequences — including the dazzling opening credits and a fight sequence filmed almost only in shadows – give the movie a tone that's fiercely original and still, fiercely Bond. The acting, from all quarters, is a delight: Craig and Dench have ""played this game long enough"", and Ralph Fiennes and the talented young Ben Whishaw (who was also fantastic in the recent Cloud Atlas) ably demonstrate that they aren't merely there to be cogs in the wheel, but that they truly belong.<br/><br/>And to cite an analogy that'll perhaps be used freely in the days to come, Javier Bardem is the Joker to Bond's Dark Knight, even though Skyfall is the franchise's 'James Bond Rises'. Bardem, who makes one of the best-written entries in Bond history, is deliciously wicked, and constructs a frighteningly real villain with an uncomfortable, sinister presence that looms large over every scene he's a part of. In an alternate universe, Bardem would be the common villain to the Bond franchise, with a new Bond to foil him in every movie.<br/><br/>This is where you should stop reading if you are only looking to be entertained by Bond's latest, and aren't necessarily interested in Skyfall, the movie.<br/><br/>To be very honest, let me clarify that it's hard to point out exactly why the movie, which possibly has the best first act in action movies this side of the 2000s, goes wrong. It has all the quintessential Bond ingredients, and each of them spectacularly well-done at that, be it breath-taking beauties (both women and cars), dizzying action, crackling dialogue, an unconventional but remarkable choice of director, a terrifying and terrific villain, and a man's man in Bond, ""an old dog who has learnt new tricks."" But then again, if these were enough to make for a great movie, Agent Vinod would have been the greatest one ever made.<br/><br/>The movie's biggest problem is the disjointed script that takes an exciting new turn every fifteen minutes, but by the end, ends up confused about where it was heading to in the first place. Take the premise itself: MI6 is under attack and the identities of several secret service agents are now in the wrong hands. But somewhere mid-way, these agents are all but forgotten as the plot shifts gears to a cat-and-mouse game for your typical action movie staple of vengeance.<br/><br/>The movie is also filled with clichés. Here are some of the formulae that you'd expect Bond to avoid, but Skyfall revels in:<br/><br/>1. When the bad guy is caught early in the movie, you know he wanted to be caught. 2. When the bad guy pulls a gun on the good guy early in the movie, he is not going to pull the trigger. 3. When the bad guy pulls a gun on the good guy at the end of the movie, he is going to give a speech. 4. When the specific quality of a particular weapon is spoken of and dismissed, you know that's the quality that will save the day in the end.<br/><br/>Then there's the problem of the Bond girl who serves as much purpose in the movie as that 'Smoking causes cancer' ads serve at the beginning of it – she doesn't. Bardem's splendid villain is given a shockingly ill- etched out characterisation too, and his job through the movie is waiting it out for the good guy to thwart his bad moves. There's also the bit about Bond's backstory, which seems trite and forced and would've made no difference to the movie had it been left out.<br/><br/>Truth is, all would have been forgiven had the grand finale been as devastating as was promised. Instead, we get an ode (?) to – without giving it away, a famous children's film - that seems in scale and impetus, a significant departure from the tone of the movie, as well as the franchise itself. Good or bad, it just doesn't feel like Bond.<br/><br/>My complaint with Skyfall is that somewhere in between the entertainment, the CGI, the stunts and the twists, there was a great movie to be found. But it fell through the cracks into the abyss and only a James Bond can locate it now. This is a Bond that's both same and different to the earlier editions, and that's possibly the reason the movie ends up being, at once, both the very best of Bond and the very worst of Bond.<br/><br/><ul><li>Nikhil Taneja (www.twitter.com/tanejamainhoon)</li></ul><br/><br/>For more reviews: http://www.firstpost.com/author/nikhil"
"melvyn-jones1","7","2","9","1 November 2012"," Good, but where's the excitement ?
","Watched ""Skyfall"" last night and have to say that I left the cinema feeling a little disappointed. Maybe it was because of all the hype but it definitely didn't live up to my (maybe over-inflated) expectations. YES it was a good film but it just didn't seem like a good BOND film. As a previous reviewer has mentioned the most exciting part of the movie was the opening sequence but even then the fist fight on top of the train seemed a little tame and lack-lustre. Through the entire rest of the film I found myself waiting for some major action scene to unfold only for it to never materialise and the closest we came were the, all to brief, scenes at the villains hideout and then again a quick ""gun-fight"" at M's hearing. Where was the brutal hand to hand combat reminiscent of previous Bond outings like the encounter with Robert Shaw in ""From Russia with Love"", The elevator fight in ""Diamonds are Forever"" or even the encounter in Bonds hotel room in ""OHMSS"". I realise he is supposed to be under par in this movie but it seemed like Bond was completely over matched by anyone he encountered and as much as it pains me (as a Brit) to say it you just get the feeling that Jason Bourne could kick James's arse with one hand tied behind his back (I say this purely for reference purposes and comparison rather than as a big Bourne fan). In fact it felt from this film the only chance 007 would stand is if he shot Bourne whilst he wasn't looking !! I absolutely love the fact that the films are being given a slightly darker more character driven spin but this shouldn't be at the expense of the BIG action set pieces which is what a lot of Bond fans crave, myself included. It seems that in the excitement stakes (alright, good old fashioned scraps)the films are being left behind even by some TV series and this can't be good. If Bond is to be taken more seriously - A GOOD THING (the thought of Moonraker and Octopussy are enough to haunt anyones dreams) - then the villains should also mature. I'm afraid I found Silva more irritating than menacing. A match up with the type of character played by Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men"" would be something I think a lot of people would pay good money to see. I did enjoy ""Skyfall"" but feel it could have been so much better. The grin on my face when I saw the DB5 and again upon seeing M's office restored to ""the good ol' days"" was probably truly sickening and I eagerly await the next outing of 007, but feel that I must lower my expectation of the excitement factor. For real, heart thumping excitement, I guess I'll just have to re-watch the fight with the Uruk Hai at the end of Fellowship of the Ring or even some of the earlier Bonds, dodgy editing et al. Shame there aren't any OFFICIAL Bond forums (or am I just not looking hard enough) ?"

","The fact that I'm still considering this film, I suppose suggests that it has had some modicum of effect on me, the problem is that it's still bothering me.<br/><br/>There are considerable problems with skyfall, primarily a clunky plot that doesn't in any stage of the movie express the severity of the threat posed by a wonderfully camp Javier Bardem. Despite being evenly paced and benefitting from some wonderful cinematography, the was no cranking up of the tension in similar movies such as the Bourne series.<br/><br/>What I cringed the most at though, was the pointless use of world locations to express the global nature of a spy's daily grind, the crude bombardment of product placement, and a frankly pointless and odd cameo by the film's love interest.<br/><br/>Craig plays bond in a detached, cold manner, which is understandable given the nature of the work, but it means that I had little care as to whether he perished or not. His detached attitude to women is looking in every movie of this re-booted franchise that passes, grotesquely out of date.<br/><br/>Bardems and Denchs performances are wonderfully measured, and there was enough to tantalize for the next installment, I also enjoyed the references to previous bond movies, and it expressed the confidence in the brand to poke fun at itself."

","No! No! No! No! No! No! Mendes has taken the hard, gritty reboot from Casino Royale and gone full circle back to the light-hearted humour of the old Bond.<br/><br/>OK, so first let's say it is a HUGE improvement on Quantum of Solace – none of that Paul Greengrass/Bourne-esque jumpy camera cuts (or whatever the technical jargon is). Also, to make Mr Silver as quite openly gay was a brave move – was it to bring the pink pound in I wonder?<br/><br/>Then let's overlook the ""eh?"" moments:  Bond is shot and falls hundreds of feet into a river and somehow survives? (eh?)  Then somehow he finds his way to some sun-kissed location without M knowing his was alive - obviously must've had a huge wad of cash handy nearby because a credit card would've revealed his identity. And that cash lasted his pain killers and drinking and then enough to get him home again (eh?)  Or how Bond can fall into a lake in the moors in Scotland, which is so cold that he can run on top of it and yet he can survive an underwater fight and still make his way to kill Silver without contracting hypothermia (eh?)  Then there's the way Mr Silver got himself out of his cell and killed 2 guards by . . . well all we saw was him stretching so god knows how he did it (eh?) <br/><br/>Maybe we can ignore the clichés  car chase where cars crash into loads and loads of barrows and stalls etc and yet NO-ONE is seen getting injured or killed.  Bond shoots his shirt cuffs after getting off the digger on to the train. Like Brosnan adjusting his tie under water in World is Not Enough <br/><br/>Then let's say nothing about the nods to other films or themes:  the Roger Moore alligator run  the Mission Impossible NOC list<br/><br/>Perhaps we can let slide the inconsistent background to Bond's youth – in Casino Royale, Vesper says ""you didn't come from money and your school friends never let you forget it and you were at the school by the grace of someone else's charity hence the chip on your shoulder"". Well looking at Skyfall he DID come from money (they had a gamekeeper for chrissakes), albeit maybe it went when his parents died, but then why the chip on his shoulder? At least they kept the orphan aspect consistent.<br/><br/>Finally, let's take for granted the fact that if all Silver needed was to be imprisoned and his laptop captured, then all he had to do was walk up to M after the bombing and say it was him. We didn't need Bond to go to Shanghai, kill an assassin, have a stupid fight in a casino, shag a girl and ultimately get her killed.<br/><br/>All of that I can just about stomach (just about), but the ONE thing I cannot abide is the humour! There are lives at stake, both his and other's and yet he can openly make quips? No! Mendes just pandered to ignorant press comment lamenting the lack of humour since the reboot.<br/><br/>So, I am afraid I don't give it 10 stars or even 7. I give it 5 just for Craig and the action. <br/><br/>Oh and the last problem was the length of it, never better illustrated by the way Silver lumbered slowly and exhaustedly to the chapel. That was how I felt about the film up to that point. It was too long."

","Enthralling, exciting, griping and back to its best are perhaps just a few words you can expect to be seeing associated with this 'griter' Bond.<br/><br/>The acting from Daniel Craig was excellent and Judi Dench, who typically was just as good. We are also introduced to the new Bond team. Re-introducing Moneypenny and Q, as well as the replacement of M, in the face of Ralph Fiennes. Who can only be seen as an excellent replacement as the new M. The film has a gripping storyline, relating to the modern age and how people are becoming increasingly more reliant on technology. The villain, although slightly eccentric, can be seen as a classic Bond villain, seemingly always one step ahead of MI6, which makes it even more slightly odd that he got baited towards the end. The homage's to past Bonds throughout was a nice touch to celebrate their 50th year.<br/><br/>The reboot of Bond with Daniel Craig is exactly what the Bond franchise has needed to catch up with modern day film. We want to see a beautifully constructed film, something masterfully thought up with no plot holes, cinematics that really capture the imagination and perfect music. It is hard to say that this, and probably the best, instalment of Bond does not give all of that and more. The scene that really had me edging of my seat, like an impatient child, was the shooting of the shot of brandy on Severine's head. The look, the feel, the camera angles all made that scene just feel beautiful, in every sense of the word. It's not just that scene, every scene is carried out in a similar manner, all building up to the something bigger and better.<br/><br/>Although Piers Bronsan looked like the perfect Bond, the films, I always felt, were just too comical, they played more on the impossible, the charm and swagger of Bond. It wasn't working, Bond was fading, much like the Batman's in the 90's. It needed to be changed. And changed it was. Excluding a small blip in the 'rushed' Quantum of Solance we have been graced with a new style of Bond, in which Daniel Craig nails perfectly, replacing Bond's original charm, with his Bond's ruthlessness and mettle.<br/><br/>Like all films there are slight niggles that annoy all film fans, the fact that some of the stuff that happens is just implausible, shouldn't irritate me, but it does. The opening fight scene is a wonderfully constructed fight scene; engaging, action packed and, at a push, plausible. The drop from the train into the river on the other hand is not. Something in which they don't explain how he survived. My other small niggle, was the second fight scene with the guy from the train, in Shanghai. The build up was incredibly tense, the small pauses really built it up, so when it finally came to the fight scene, I was overly disappointed that the fight scene looked too choreographed.<br/><br/>I should stop myself from being overly picky and delegate myself away from the negatives and concentrate on what a great accomplishment this film truly is.<br/><br/>What should I expect though? This is what has drawn in millions of fans over an incredible movie lifespan of 50 years. There is no movie franchise out there that could come close to producing so many good films, not even if Christopher Nolan took to the of helm of Batman for another 3 films.<br/><br/>The film paves the way for more and new exciting prospects in the Bond franchise, which is hard to say that it will not prosper for another 50 years. Let us just hope we do not have to wait another 4 years for our next Bond instalment."
"Quinoa1984","10","3","17","14 November 2012"," unambigously a pleasurable movie-going experience
","007 is after a hard-drive. In the opening a chase, one of those breathless ones that populate a lot of Bond films, ensues, but it being Bond he has to get a little flashy (but just a little) when it comes to a train: on top of it, with a bulldozer on it, and then a fight with the baddie right there. After a botched 'Take a shot!' order from M, Naomie Harris' agent sends Bond off the train and into... death(?) Or just a little vacation from Mum ('M', Judi Dench believable as ever, even more conviction as she gets older), who has to deal with this drive still missing, this explosive MacGuffin that calls to question what MI6 is actually *doing* in the first place? Are there 'shadows' anymore? Or are there just freaks with revenge plots that take years and meticulous planning to shape? But Bond is Bond (and word is Bond), so he returns. But will it all be the same? <br/><br/>A real ""MOVIE"" in big capital letters (much like The Avengers and The Cabin in the Woods earlier this year). A meaty thriller that takes itself seriously, but it never takes itself SO seriously that it becomes a film, which may be the key difference between this and the Dark Knight (which is what Mendes claims was the inspiration... or was it what he wanted to critique in a way? Skyfall acts as tribute to Bond, its own cohesive unit as a 007 entry, AND film-analysis of what makes Bond work compared to other blockbusters). Does it always make sense for 007 to make a quip after something tragic like a death of someone close to him? But, hey, it's another glass of scotch that shan't go to waste as well.<br/><br/>It's a solid plot, the visual pleasures via Roger Deakins where every shot, every unit in an action set piece, get even MORE gorgeous on repeat viewings (the entire Shangahi-tower sequence is so breathtaking because it''s about how we watch it, it calls attention to itself carefully but deliberately with many mirrored images, like a neon-lit fun-house ala Orson Welles, but with silhouettes and a thrilling Thomas Newman back-beat). <br/><br/>And while Javier Bardem slithers with gay joy here (both the gayness of a 1950's happy-go-lucky kid with a bunch of ""radio"" toys, and a vengeful man who may have been decent once but it's long gone in innuendo and grandiosity made flesh), Craig is also keenly subtle when he wants/needs to be, and it adds to him being such a bad motherf****r (look, seriously, it's right on that gun that only he can shoot). Not to mention Ben Whishaw earning his marks as the new 'Q' as a 'kid with spots', and Harris being Earthy, sensual, but can also hold her own when the action comes down. If anyone is given more humdrum work to do it's, oddly enough, Ralph Fiennes. That's alright - Skyfall needs one guy waiting in the wings to fully join the franchise. <br/><br/>Bond is resurrected once more, and his hobby is spine-tingling, and at the same time about what it's about: you love Bond, it's a treat, you're a newcomer, it's good storytelling about a story that isn't new but not tired, and for those who couldn't care less about Bond... well, at least watch the opening titles and every nano-second with Bardem. Please. Do it for Mom."

","As always most reviewers go to strong in either direction. To summarize, this movie has strong performances from the main actors, but a weak plot. It has good directing of action scenes and environment, but is a bit awkward in pacing. All and all solid, but flawed.<br/><br/>Acting
Daniel Craig makes a great bond, he always has. He is witty with a very powerful presence, but can also display some of the conflict and weakness in his character. Javier Bardem is an excellent, tormented and evil villain. The rest of the lineup with M, Q and moneypenny do their jobs exemplary.<br/><br/>Plot
WHY, SCREENWRITERS, WHY?! Let's first let bond survive an impossible situation with no explanation. Then make an evil genius strategist plan everything in the slightest detail to be captured and be able to hack MI6 in a genius move FOR NO REASON. Why did he not just travel to London and walk into Ms hearing? To look her in the eye first? Feels like there is a less risky way of doing it. Why didn't the screenplay have M go underground after the bombing, so that he needed to hack MI6 to find her location, or something. A wasted opportunity. I'm not mentioning the smaller stuff here, like how they have all their agents on one list, having no woman we care about and bonds family home with the title of the movie for no real reason other than that bond probably wanted it destroyed or something.<br/><br/>Ultimately, half the production deserves awards and the other half needs to be replaced."

","In the opening scene, Bond is chasing an enemy over the roofs of train cars until he is seemingly killed by friendly fire. When there is a bomb going off in the MI6 headquarters, M can only rely on 007, the agent presumed dead, to find out who is responsible for the bombing. The villain Silva (Javier Bardem) is captured quickly and easily, but his plans really just begin with his escape in London. Bond and M have to prepare for battle in Bond's homeland in Scotland, outnumbered and almost without weapons...<br/><br/>At 143 minutes, the movie is definitely too long, moving slowly especially in the first hour. The episode of Bond traveling to Macao, just to cash in chips, kick a few baddies and obtain a suitcase, seems unnecessary and should have been cut completely. This movie's strength is not in exotic locations this time - 'Skyfall' is the only Bond in which the majority of scenes are set in the UK: first London, later Scotland. This is what makes it special, also the relationship between Bond and M is developed further, and we learn more about Bond's past. The battle in the old dark house is well staged. Bond faces the most psychopathic villain ever, a creepy guy with a distorted face (a victim of poisoning) and a death wish. Sometimes I found Bardem's performance bordering on the ridiculous, but I guess it's a matter of taste. All in all, an interesting and unusual contribution to the series, not simply following the well trodden path."

There's plenty of other scripts out there.<br/><br/>This Emo Bond and his ridiculous blond villain with his lame mama issues plot and his hipster Q who hates gadgets and his henpecking M and his home alone Scottish hideaway, enough.

","This was the first Bond film I saw in the theaters. I had low expectations after the first two films with Daniel Craig. However, when I watched this, I couldn't have been more blown away. This ended up being not only an instant Bond classic, but for my money, the most thrilling and engrossing James Bond movie to date.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is much better and more comfortable in the role of Bond this time around. He really feels like the spy that Ian Fleming envisioned.<br/><br/>The story and drama of the film is very gripping and realistic. It engages you the entire time, unlike ""Casino Royale,"" which was too boring to keep your attention, and ""Quantum of Solace,"" which didn't have much of a story at all. One thing I really loved was getting to see the place where Bond spent his childhood.<br/><br/>The action scenes are both larger-than-life and pulse-pounding. The pre-credit sequence where Bond rides a motorcycle, silver cars, a bulldozer, the caboose of the train, and then seemingly dies was one for the ages. I admit, I really thought that they had killed off Bond. There are also many other excellent chase scenes and fight scenes.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is outstanding as Silva, a villain that is entertaining and uncomfortably creepy at the same time. This seems to be a type of character that Bardem plays often, and he knocked this one out of the ballpark.<br/><br/>There are also many wonderful additions to the cast. We get Ralph Fiennes as the new M and Naomie Harris as Moneypenny. I especially loved Ben Whishaw as Q. He is a younger Q and I loved this new take on the character.<br/><br/>Of course, we also have Judi Dench in her last outing as M. The scene at the end where she passes away really tugged my emotional strings.<br/><br/>Adele once again shows us that she is one of the most talented artists of her generation with the atmospheric, haunting title song. The locations, particularly Shanghai, also have an epic quality to them.<br/><br/>I can't praise this film enough. This, in my humble opinion, is the best Bond film ever made, which really says something. It is a more realistic type of Bond, but unlike the first two films in this reboot series, it didn't sacrifice the fun. A nice touch is that although undeniably slick and modern, it still has the feel of a lot of the classic Bond films. A must-see.<br/><br/>RATING: A+"
"cliffordwilliams1955","10","2","10","3 July 2015"," Great Bond movie
","I have seen all of the Bond films and I thought this one was great. The film was focused more on MI6, M, Bond, a former top agent and the inner turmoil of MI6, M and Bond. I think the film also focused more on the personal side of the characters. No explosions, chase scenes, shootouts and all that other stuff was needed. This time the mission was personal to MI6, M, and Bond. Javier Badem played a fantastic Silva. We also got to look into Bond's past. Quite illuminating. The film also did a great job of transitioning from the old M to a new M. It was easier by having her die, instead of forcing her to retire. An African-American Moneypenny was also a great move."

Daniel Craig again turns in a fantastic portrayal of 007 who returns against all odds to take on a demon from the past. But whose past is it? That's never quite clear, but what is clear is that Javier Bardem is a fantastic bad guy. Your reaction to the word 'rat' will forever change after you see this movie, and the opening scene where bad guy introduces himself to Bond. Classic Bond.<br/><br/>The usual Bond-like actions take place, like long exciting chase scenes, beautiful panoramas, and of course, beautiful women. You do feel sorry for many things in this movie, but all good things must eventually come to an end. The new Q is great, a bit of a twit, but, well, you'd expect nothing less in a Bond film. <br/><br/>I had my doubts about Daniel Craig, having been such a big fan of Pierce Brosnan as Bond, but I have to say that he's been terrific. A real physical force, with less debonair style, but more in-your-face toughness than we've seen in a long time from Bond. I like it, and I hope he's able to make a few more films before he ages out, and the next Bond is born.<br/><br/>Skyfall...Skyfall...Bond: done. Cool, just cool.

However, what he finds tests his loyalty to M as her past comes back to haunt her.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: After all the hype, 'Skyfall 'certainly lives up to expectations. Starting off with a brilliant pre-credits chase on the top of a train you get the sense this this is going to be a hell of a Bond film. <br/><br/>With Bond presumed dead, M's job is under threat and to make matters worse, M16 has just been blown up. But when James turns up again he is almost instantly sent away to find out who did it. What he finds, though is Javier Bardem's Silva, a former agent of M16, who was left to die. From here we have some more great action sequences, London Underground chases and a thrilling finale in Scotland. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, the script is full of witty one-liners and a few hilarious jokes. The acting is also the best out of any previous franchise entry. Daniel Craig is cool and suave, Javier Bardem is menacing but at the same time has an irresistible charm and Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as ever. Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris slip into their roles nicely and Berenice Marlohe is very Bond-girly is the few scenes she has. Special mention also goes to Albert Finney for a brilliant turn as Kincade, Bond's old groundsman, and Rory Kinear, whose character, Tanner, has a much bigger role than in his previous films. <br/><br/>However, the real star of the film is Judi Dench. The emotion she shows in her scenes is one of just an old and confused lady, struggling in this modern world, someone who just can't get a grip on life, no matter how hard she tries. Sam Mendes, who is more used to directing dramas, takes the action into his stride, making the most thrilling film this year!"

The breathtaking skylines are superb.<br/><br/>The action starts right from the get go and it is both an exhilarating and heady ride. I've been a fan of Bond since day one and have loved them all, some more than others of course. But this one takes us back to the earlier style of Sean Connery where it was more intellectual and exotic and less flash and dash. Craig uses his usual physical stamina, strength and skills to accent the character's raw power and persona rather than an arsenal of high tech gadgetry.<br/><br/>Barbara Broccoli is doing a fine job of carrying on the tradition of Bond.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","10","9 December 2012"," A familiar 007 like you've never seen him before
","James Bond has been going strong for 50 years on the big screen, but it has taken until this most recent incarnation starring Daniel Craig for anyone in control of this enduring franchise to realize that giving Bond a soul could be a good thing. Frankly, ""Skyfall"" gets personal — and it's about time. <br/><br/>""Skyfall"" maintains the serious tone set since ""Casino Royale,"" though it's not as grim or humorless as ""Quantum of Solace."" With much of the film taking place in London and the U.K., suddenly MI6 has become this tangible thing rather than some elusive, top-secret government organization that has no bearing on the plot of the movie other than giving Bond a mission. M (Judi Dench) is a real person now, not just a talking head barking orders at Bond and reprimanding him with delightful sarcasm (though she still does that).<br/><br/>Bond has also entered the era of cyber-crime. The launch point for the story is that M has lost a drive containing a list of NATO agents located within terrorist cells, not to mention that MI6 is being targeted by a cyber-terrorist who has also already managed to infiltrate headquarters. Suddenly the world of Bond feels as though it exists in our world, and Bond himself is no longer just the poster boy for tuxedos and acceptable misogyny.<br/><br/>In the opening action sequence in Istanbul, Bond takes a bullet and is presumed dead, leading to a born-again story line that strips him to his weakest form and forces him to really think about why he's an agent. In a sense, ""Skyfall"" is a bit of a reboot after things didn't go so well in ""Solace,"" examining the core of the Bond character.<br/><br/>After the opening and Adele's strong theme song, ""Skyfall"" doesn't get that interesting until Javier Bardem enters the picture. The sequence in Shanghai serves the film's global appeal and teases us with the supremely lovely Berenice Marlohe, but it's Bardem who really steals the film.<br/><br/>Considering his Oscar-winning turn in ""No Country For Old Men"" it will come as no surprise to anyone that Bardem makes a good Bond villain, but Raoul Silva is more effectively written than the majority of the franchise's baddies. In essence, he's a Bond-friendly take on The Joker. Bardem gives the role enough of a wacky edge to make the part eerily effective. Plus, when it comes to Bond movies, the bigger the villain, the bigger the stakes, and they're pretty high in ""Skyfall.""<br/><br/>The most distinctive factor differentiating ""Skyfall"" from the rest of the Bond canon is how it explores Bond's relationship with M. Both characters come under a lot of fire in this film and in every way you can imagine, and the script uses this to create a new dynamic between these two mainstays of the Craig-era Bond movies.<br/><br/>Visually, Sam Mendes does the job Marc Forster could not with ""Quantum of Solace"": bring his dramatic and visual pedigree into the world of the blockbuster action movie. Mendes has a smoother and more seamless style when it comes to the action scenes. Veteran D.P. Roger Deakins certainly brings a whole other level of aesthetic that the series just hasn't seen before as well. When we do get more sprawling scenic shots, they're worth the lag time.<br/><br/>Bond movies have been much more explosive than ""Skyfall,"" but it has no equal in as far as the level of depth. ""Casino Royale"" took Bond to a more emotional place, and as such it appealed to a wider audience, but it was not necessarily a deeper place. The psychological approach to the character is so refreshing and exciting for the future of Bond, at least while Craig is still involved. He is lucky to be given material much richer than ever handed to Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan or (especially) Roger Moore, but to his credit he just nails the complexity of this new-age Bond.<br/><br/>Funny then, that in taking Bond down such a new path, ""Skyfall"" ultimately arrives at a familiar and comfortable destination. How the film does so many new things while staying true to the tone of Ian Fleming's great character and the film formula it inspired is by far its greatest achievement.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","After the lukewarm reception that Quantum of Solace received in 2008, the direction of where the James Bond films would go next was uncertain. That uncertainty was worsened when MGM found itself going into bankruptcy, delaying another film by years. The series though would rebound and a new Bond film was to be out in time for the series' fiftieth anniversary. Would this anniversary film, and twenty-third entry, be able to bring the series back on track? <br/><br/>The Craig era of Bond has been about developing Bond as a character and this film goes far in that direction. Taking cues from latter Ian Fleming Bond novels, Skyfall does exactly that. Craig's Bond in particular seems well suited to this as we see a Bond who, after being left for dead after a mission, eventually finds that he must return to MI6 and rediscover who he is again. The film also sees some humor come into the character as well and Craig for the most part handles it well. If Casino Royale was Craig's debut as Bond, then this is the film where he slides into the role of experienced agent.<br/><br/>The film's two female leads are quite interesting. Naomie Harris as Eve is an interesting, if flawed character though the character due to her lack of chemistry with Craig and being perhaps just a bit old for the whole ""junior agent"" idea to be believable. The other is Bérénice Marlohe as Sévérine who fits much more into the traditional role of the Bond female lead yet is also given some interesting space to develop as well. While neither is perfect, both are memorable and serve the film well.<br/><br/>Last but not least is Javier Bardem as the villainous Raoul Silva. From the moment the character is introduced in what seems to be a long single take, it's clear this is a villain quite different from what we've encountered before in Bond. While he does arguably have echoes of a couple of previous Bond villains as well as the Joker from The Dark Knight, Silva is more than just another madman. He's a compelling figure and a villain that, for the first time in a while, rightfully fights with Bond for your attention whenever he's on screen. There's also a feeling of discomfort that exudes from the character as well, especially in his first and last scenes. The result is perhaps the most compelling Bond villain in some time.<br/><br/>The film also features a strong supporting cast. Returning yet again is Judi Dench as M, getting her largest time in the role here. The film makes good use of her talents and takes the character away from being a stuck behind the desk bureaucrat and makes her a vital part of the film. There are also fine performances from Ralph Fiennes as Mallory, Ben Whishaw's excellent debut as Q, Rory Kinnear as Tanner and an excellent appearance by Albert Finney as Kincade. The result is one of the strongest casts yet put together for a Bond film.<br/><br/>The film also heralds some impressive action sequences. From the opening sequence in Istanbul, the film takes its viewers on a journey around the world from fights in Shanghai to a chase below and on the London streets to a final climatic battle that seems reminiscent of the finales of the classic Bond films of the 1960s yet also incredibly different from them at the same time. The sequences are all well done and are perhaps the most impressive yet seen in the Craig era.<br/><br/>For all of its impressive action sequences, Skyfall feels like that it is as much a drama as it is an action film. Skyfall explores questions of age and legacy, perhaps appropriately for a film series celebrating its fiftieth birthday. These range from questions about Bond's fitness to be a double-o to M's own suitability as head of MI6 to the secrets of both of their pasts which come into play as the film goes on. While the middle part of the film in London echoes The Dark Knight quite heavily (and indeed uses the nearly identical ""he wanted us to catch him"" line as well), the film works well at bringing together both the action scenes and the dramatic scenes to create a coherent story (and a great improvement over its immediate predecessor). Add on some nice references to the series' own legacy (including the much welcomed return of a character missing from the Craig era as well as icon of the series dating back to almost its beginning) and the result is fantastic all around.<br/><br/>So how does Skyfall stand up as both the fiftieth birthday film and as a Bond film in general? It celebrates the legacy of the series by using the plot to ask its relevance in the modern world and ultimately saying that Bond (and the series by default) does indeed. As a Bond film it pushes the boundaries of mixing action with the dramatic in a way not really seen in the series before now. On both counts then, Skyfall succeeds and does so fantastically."

","Sam Mendez may seem like a surprising choice to direct the latest installment in the Bond franchise but having him at the helm is nothing short of inspired. American Beauty, Road To Perdition, Jarhead and Away We Go showcased Sam Mendez's talent for great filmmaking and beautiful direction. He brings his talents behind the camera to create one of the best Bond films we've seen.<br/><br/>It's hard to know where to start complimenting a flick like this. Skyfall is a film that benefits from having everything work perfectly in sync. Mendez's clear and masterful direction ensures that every scene is wonderfully handled. There's none of that MTV styled, quick-cut, hand-held film techniques on display here. Cinematographer Roger Deakins (A Beautiful Mind, Jarhead, No Country For Old Men) does a great job as usual and gives us some great looking scenes. The silhouetted fight against the lights of a skyscraper in Macau is a highlight. Thomas Newman's (American Beauty, The Green Mile, Wall-E) eclectic score deserves a mention too. There isn't a huge reliance on the classic bond theme and the music perfectly supports the unfolding story.<br/><br/>Simply put, the plot is awesome. It's a multi-layered screenplay that deals with Bond's relationship with M and even looks at his childhood. Skyfall explores way more than your usual Bond flick whilst delivering all that you would expect from one. Mind you, the whole thing isn't perfect. The ""Bond chicks"" may be less gratuitously handled here but they are nevertheless severely underused and underwritten.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig has emerged as one of the best Bonds since Sean Connery. He delivers another great performance, giving Bond the perfect amount of emotional depth and internal turmoil to juxtapose his suaveness and physical prowess. If Craig is one of the best Bonds then Javier Bardem gives us one of the best Bond villains ever. He received an Academy Award for his terrifying performance in No Country For Old Men and now he's given us another memorable bad guy with Silva. He isn't just an evil guy bent on world domination, Silva has a more emotional reason for his malice that makes him all the more terrifying.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a robust, energetic blockbuster that will please even those who aren't Bond aficionados. There's plenty of nods to Bond films of the past and a strong determination to ""refresh"" the 50 year old franchise. It may be a little long for some tastes but who can really complain about there being too much of a good thing?"
"TOMNEL","9","2","10","25 November 2012"," More than anything else, this film is just pleasant to the senses!
","It's doesn't seem like the highest praise to say the best part of a movie is the music or the look over anything else, but here it works quite well. This is a great looking movie with good music, and a drive to all the scenes that make it exhilarating. The plot is what moves the film along, and a sub-plot about an attempted assassination of M (Judi Dench) adds what some consider an emotional depth to the film, but what this movie is really about is James Bond fighting villains and going through beautiful locations, and that's works perfectly fine here!<br/><br/>James Bond (Daniel Craig) is seemingly back from the dead after a misstep on M's part, and now has to stop a computer hacking madman (and former agent), Silva (Javier Bardem), from using his skills to wreak havoc and enact revenge on M. <br/><br/>There is a sweetness to the scenes between M and Bond, almost playing like a subdued mother/son relationship at times. It's nice that Bond is on a mission here that is somewhat personal to him, so that it feels like it's not just another job. But the character development and interplay isn't what this is about...it's about the action.<br/><br/>The action here is great. The fight scenes are well filmed, and cinematographer Roger Deakin takes full advantage of all the locations and awesome sets. The movie from beginning to end looks great! Turn off the sound, ignore the plot, and still this would entertain and thrill on a purely visual level. Add the music, and it's even better. Thomas Newman provides a fun score, using the typical Bond motifs and themes, while also adding it's own unique character. The ladies are sexy (especially Berenice Marlohe), and James Bond is cool. The guy has very few lines relative to how much screen time he has, but instead opts out in huge amounts of dialogue in favor of walking around like he's the coolest guy on Earth. And this is what works best about the film. Bond is awesome, and the places he goes are awesome, and of course, he also has a nice strong villain here in Mr. Bardem. The guy just has a menacing look!<br/><br/>The cinematography, locations, music, action scenes and overall look of the film make this a very solid Bond film. It has a plot about a computer hacker, and M being threatened, and the plot is pretty good for a Bond film, but it's the whole visual experience that make this one to watch. There's never a dull moment, and even if there was, your eyes would be popping out of their head looking at the well filmed sets. It's thoroughly entertaining, and has enough pathos to make us care how the story turns out.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 145 mins. PG-13 for violence and brief sexuality."
"jfgibson73","7","2","10","23 November 2012"," Above Average
","Skyfall was the first Bond movie I have seen in a LONG time. The main draw of the series is that men want to be him, and I don't really end up doing that. But this episode was fun to watch anyway. First, because of the quality of the visuals. The title sequence and the scenes in Scotland looked great. Second, I appreciated how they took every opportunity to do things differently from how they would have been handled in an older Bond movie. Q doesn't have any gadgets, the villain isn't trying to take over the world, Bond isn't invincible, and the female lead plays a much different role. Javier Bardeem's villain is different enough from other bad guys to make him interesting, although he can't really compete with Anton Chigrgh. The scene when he takes out his dentures was very memorable. The story is that he was an ex-agent who was sold up the river by M, and he has spent his life building an empire to plan his moment of revenge. He's a computer expert, so he can hack anything and cause any trouble he wants. He gets captured so he can get access to M, and Bond fights him off to end the second act of the movie and set up the final sequence. Then came the part I really admired: Bond, M, and an elderly gamekeeper rig an old Scottish mansion to hold off a gang of villains. They are coming to kill M. I thought the relatively small stakes was much more interesting to watch than the usual save-the-world action sequence. The movie felt overlong, so that by the end, it had lost some tension. But overall, it was entertaining, one that I would be willing to watch again some day."
"jamesmartin944","8","2","10","19 November 2012"," Re-boot finally finished now let's get on with it.
","I thoroughly enjoyed Craig's third instalment and was relieved by its excellent photography and depth of plot and character. It seemed to have a layered construction which will enable the viewer to enjoy for the second and third viewing as traditional Bond themes were complimented by humour, stylish action and some less obvious choices of location and character behaviour. The casting of Q (Ben Whishaw), for example, was difficult for even Bond to accept due to his young age and appearance. This lead to an interesting exchange as Bond was supplied with gadgets and the narrative set the new Q up as someone surprisingly clever and powerful.<br/><br/>Of the two Bond girls, one had an interesting back story linked with the villain, and the other a struggling MI6 agent torn between the field and desk work. Further interest came from Ralph Fiennes' character, Mallory, whose credibility as someone who could be in charge of Bond increased throughout the movie, again, due to increasing depth of character and telling of back story.<br/><br/>The action begins with the opening set piece that sets up the plot. In essence the central character of the movie is M (Judi Dench) and it is in this opening sequence where she makes a judgement call that prevents Bond from completing his mission and sends him off the radar for several months. During this period he drinks heavily and gets enough out of shape to fail the MI6 ""return to active service"" tests when he is finally compelled to return to London due to MI6 coming under terrorist attack.<br/><br/>It is a slow build through the first hour of the movie as Bond sets about his mission building up to the point where he both encounters the villain and his skills return with Bourne like efficiency. We see Istanbul, Shanghai then a return to Britain for the last hour where the plot unfolds, action continues and also where the movie begins to strongly reference Bond of old - particularly towards the end where, at the point of integrating the Aston Martin DB5, we are taken back to basics in the twist of a dark ending rich in back story.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem's sinister take on the Bond villain, Silva, goes much further than simply wearing a strange hair style and being associated with No Country For Old Men. His behaviour is equally strange as his large masculine presence including deep voice is made, somehow, far more intimidating by a camp demeanour. His opening monologue is clever both in terms of the narrative content, his acting and the nature of how it was shot. This monologue introduces him as part of M's past and his reasons for villainous behaviour being due to mistakes that she has made. He is a reflection of what Bond could have been, or could even become, if mistakes are made and an agent is left out in the field to fend for themselves - potentially becoming subject to the most horrendous ordeals.<br/><br/>We get a real sense of the action taking place both in the field and at MI6 headquarters where M and Q feed orders and information into ear pieces resulting in a nice tension build to the action. There is not an awful lot that occurs in this movie that we haven't seen in other movies before, and I am slightly tired of the ""Bond begins"" vibe where we are still waiting for Bond to become Bond. Quantum of Solace really hampered the momentum of Craig's refreshing take on the franchise, that began with Casino Royale, and I feel it has took to long to get to where we are. Having said that, Skyfall is easily good enough to set Craig up for at least one more where he can put the production politics behind him and go out with a bang."
"EmmaDinkins","8","2","10","16 November 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: A more profound Bond.
","Although the opening scene blast with two notes from the Bond song caused me to laugh, this story is no laughing matter. James Bond (Daniel Craig) bursts onto the scene in his full testosterone driven swagger, making everyone believe that he is the epitome of masculinity and is absolutely unstoppable. In this film there was a consistent theme of opposition throughout the story, youth versus experience, good versus bad, old versus new, lies versus truth and, technology versus conventional. I was very satisfied with the conventional stunts and was glad to see some actual calamities rather than the now standard CGI and/or green screen, this film did a good job of making the stunts look effortless, but I know they were not. I cringed at the sight of some of the nice automobiles that were demolished for the sake of art and whenever I see on screen images of Singapore especially at night I am in awe, and just want to get the next flight out and see this phenomenal city. Up until now my favorite 007 had been Pierce Brosnan, he was the Bond that I best recognized, but what Mr. Craig has proved here in this and the prior Bond films in which he starred is that he has the acting chops to make this role his own. This time around we are introduced to some new pivotal players in the Bond chronicles and a new Bond nemesis, Silva (Javier Bardem) who is revealed from the trailer, fortunately the trailer does not give away all the good stuff that this film is choked full of. The unique structure of Mr. Bardem's face makes him a credible sociopath, but I'm glad to have seen his softer side in Eat Pray Love, otherwise I would just shudder every time I see him on screen. The special effects used when he reveals himself were nothing less than astonishing, frightening but truly astonishing. The other NKOTB introduced in this latest Bond installment who I hope to see more of in the future, that stood out the most were Eve (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw). It was nice refreshing having a youthful rather than Methuselah type Q. This film had drama, seduction, action and adventure, all the things that have made be grow to love this character and these stories. I anxiously await the next Bond episode, and I give Skyfall a green light."
"oceeprime","9","2","10","12 November 2012"," Skyfall Soars!
","Prior to this film being released, I felt that Casino Royale was Daniel Craig's best performance as the titular hero. Boy, was I wrong! This new film puts all of the past films to shame. The filmmakers knew they had to come up with a good film after the average Quantum of Solace. Films that have a personal issue for any character to deal with always makes the film more interesting to watch. Such is the case here. I was also glad to see that the filmmakers wanted to ground this film in reality, despite some new character additions. The acting was well done by everyone in the cast. My big hope is that from here on out, the Bond films will continue down the path that this film has carved. Daniel Craig is the model for every other future Bond actor."
"gregfried8","8","2","10","12 November 2012"," Skyfall (2012)
","In his debut turn directing a James Bond film, Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) found a way to combine intimate character moments with grand-scale action to construct the type of spy film that made 007 a global icon for 50 years. Daniel Craig returns as Bond, finding a level of comfort in the role we haven't seen in his last two efforts. Less brooding and hell- bent on revenge, Craig brings an effortless swagger previously unseen. Skyfall effectively reminds us why we fell in love with 007, and propels the franchise into a bold new chapter.<br/><br/>Skyfall opens with an absolutely gripping chase sequence through the streets of Istanbul, as 007 and a fellow field agent (Naomie Harris) pursue an unknown thug who possesses a hard drive containing the identities of undercover MI6 agents embedded around the globe. The mission goes haywire: Bond is presumably shot dead, and the assailant escapes with the precious information intact. During his time spent off the grid, Bond enjoys a lazy sabbatical consisting of not much more than sex and booze, only to be spurred back to action by an attack on MI6 headquarters.<br/><br/>While there hasn't been much continuity when it comes to the personal relationships of 007 throughout the years, his love and loyalty to England is never questioned. Nor has his alliance to MI6 chief M (Judi Dench), who personally needs him now more than ever before. Like Bond, M struggles to remain relevant in the ever-changing world of espionage. This need to adapt or die unites the two. Their initially icy relationship tenderizes over the course of the film, and reaches a level of platonic intimacy rarely seen over the storied history of the franchise.<br/><br/>In addition to a battleground that is becoming more opaque and difficult to define by the day, M must also survive the vengeful wrath of Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem). A former MI6 agent, Silva holds M personally responsible for being captured and tortured while on assignment. Bardem's experience playing a deranged sociopath helps him bring a unique mix of charm and menace to the role. While many may be quick to cite his Oscar-winning part in No Country For Old Men as a source of inspiration for Silva, the character he most recalls is Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight. Bardem delivers a fantastic, film-stealing performance, despite limited screen- time.<br/><br/>If there is a flaw in Skyfall, it is in the stakes—or lack thereof—seemingly uncharacteristically low for a Bond film. Although it's made clear that Silva is capable of carnage on a grand scale, his mission is purely one born of personal vengeance, and there is no evidence that he poses a threat after his personal vendetta is fulfilled. There is no atomic bomb threatening to wipe England off the map. However, this does not minimize the film. The seemingly lowered stakes ultimately work to make the film more personal for both Bond and the spellbound audience.<br/><br/>Working with veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins (best known for his work with the Coen Brothers), Mendes find unexpected beauty in a wide array of set pieces, including a neon-lit Shanghai skyscraper and the abandoned island from which Silva operates. None of the action is spectacular, but it is at least coherent and effective, especially when compared to the frenetic, pseudo-Bourne styling of 2008's Quantum of Solace. The pacing is fluid, and the film never drags despite its 143-minute runtime. Perhaps Mendes' greatest contribution is the overall tone he delivers to the film. While the previous Craig-era 007's could seem overly dark and cheerless, Skyfall remains incredibly fun amidst its thrilling and violent nature."

","Finally, they got a great story-line and a decent plot with-out just a shoot 'em up action flick. To be honest, the action sequences are great but not overdone either. Sam Mendes, is one of the greatest directors to date and he doesn't let us down with 007.<br/><br/>The movie in my opinion has pretty much lived-up to the expectation and makes Bond look like a total B/A, again.<br/><br/>I think Craig is amazing as Agent 007, and he's a wonderful actor for the role. He never ""over acts"" his part, and his serious face isn't irritating. I thought they kept it complex enough to be intrigued, enough action sequences to keep you entertained and a powerful storyline to keep you coming back for more.<br/><br/>All in all, it was awesome. If you are a regular dude, and enjoy the Bond films, yeah it's epic."
"lethalweapon","7","2","10","12 November 2012"," A superb film on its own, and a decent Bond film at that
","The 23rd Bond movie packs quite a punch. The explosive beginning shows James Bond and fellow agent Eve running down an assassin who has stolen a hard drive containing details of undercover agents - a list similar to the NOC list from Mission Impossible. I'll just go ahead and call this the NOC list. By opening credits, Bond is accidentally shot and falls off a bridge to his presumed death.<br/><br/>With the NOC list missing, there is a high pressure political upheaval around M and her division. The Government questions the relevance of MI6 as an organization, as they disputes its relevance in the modern non-war era (This ironically reminded me of how Judi Dench's M was introduced on screen in GoldenEye, where she accused James Bond of being a relic of the cold war)<br/><br/>M is under political pressure to relinquish her post, after a terrorist attack takes out the MI6 building. This bit seemed nonsensical to me. ""Your division to infiltrate enemies and fight in secrecy is clearly obsolete, as evidenced by this terrorist who infiltrated our top secret Govt body in secret, in the shadows"" is a rather thin argument.<br/><br/>But of course, Bond returns, resurrected, and a bit worn out by his ordeal. He tracks down a thin trail that leads him to Raoul Silva, the villain of the piece, a cyber-terrorist who has a meticulously calculated plan.<br/><br/>It is a very entertaining action movie, and a decent Bond movie. It's not as good as Casino Royale - but that's a pretty high bar to reach; It's better than Quantum of Solace - but that's a pretty low bar to clear.<br/><br/>The Bond fan in me was furious that they did not have the gun barrel scene at the start of the movie. However, it was shown in the end, and the movie kind-of seemed like a tasteful segue from the darker tones of CR and QoS into the classic Bond series - with even the interiors reminiscent of the 60s Bond - so I am not complaining on that.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is that this movie showed far too much of Bond's past. I liked to think of Bond as a man with a mysterious past, orphaned at childhood and groomed by MI6 to be the lethal kissing/ killing machine he grew up to be. I like character development in a movie, but Bond was better off without his history as a baggage.<br/><br/>We are re-introduced to the Q branch, which is headed by a nerdy young computer hacker. This makes sense in the modern era, and I can understand their need to move away from wacky gadgets. But their contribution to the James Bond gadget world were - a radio transmitter (low key, but fine... it's useful), and a gun modified so that it can only be fired by Bond; useful when you're facing the budget conscious terrorist who plan on stealing your gun and using it against you, but in a world where your enemies are able to buy their own guns, it is actually worse than a regular gun. Yes, through a curiously improbable situation, this stupid feature pays off once in the movie, but really, Q? Bond would have been better off with some Kevlar.<br/><br/>I liked the villain's performance, but his plan seems to be eerily complicated. I don't usually give out spoilers, but what I'm about to say would be on the edge of spoiler territory, so skip the rest of this entry if you want to stay away from that. (Thanks for reading. Bye bye). The villain, Silva, is a former MI6 agent who holds M personally responsible for his imprisonment and torture by the Chinese, and his entire plan is to take revenge on M.<br/><br/>Taking revenge on M is actually a fairly easy task. Bond sneaks up to her home without any problems when he 'returns from the dead'. To actually sneak up to a Government's secret military intelligence division is actually too roundabout a way to get to M. Even if we extend the storyline explanation and say that Silva wants to take revenge on MI6 as a whole, he could have done that by releasing all the names from the NOC list (He doesn't... He releases 5 names and then the list doesn't appear at all anywhere). And add to all of this, with the elaborate Joker-like plan of getting captured in order to escape (he needn't have done that. He only needed to let his laptop be 'captured' to set his plan in motion), he's just behaving irrationally. His plan also assumes that having a dozen or so armed mercenaries disguised as cops would be enough to subdue a top level judicial procedure involving the Prime Minister and other dignitaries. If you take a moment to think that this is what happens, then it really is an insult to reality. The British Government does look insanely fragile - It's a wonder they got by while Bond was 'dead'.<br/><br/>And Bond's solution to this cybercriminal mastermind's tactics is even more bizarre. He drags M with him discreetly to his abandoned childhood home, Skyfall. He deliberately plants an electronic trail engineered so everyone except Silva will be sidetracked. This is the cunning plan to get Silva to attack him. But once again, if you manage to get three seconds to think about it, it just makes no real sense. People who can and want to help M would not be able to find them, but Silva would - so would all his mercenaries and other enemies who he can bring with him. By the time Silva locates them, he could have just shot a missile at the house and called it a day.<br/><br/>Just because I'm nitpicking on all the available holes for this movie, it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It was a very entertaining movie. It could have been better, though."
"TheXeroXone","7","2","10","12 November 2012"," Serviceable, but Flimsy Bond Film
","Not much to say about this film's plot. All the scenes are appropriately emotional and the actors are all good at their respective roles, but the plot is just a standard revenge plot. <br/><br/>The villain has the same basic storyline as the villain from GoldenEye. He's an ex-British spy out for revenge and Javier Bardem plays him like Heath Ledger's Joker, complete with a disfigured face and a complete nonchalance towards explosives.<br/><br/>And the third act of this film was just spinning its wheels in reheated gibberish. The bad guy comes in referencing Apocalypse Now and the heroes counter with Home Alone.. Really? And even though MI6 knows exactly where Bond is running to, they can't send reinforcements, why? It all leads up to a fan service epilogue. Its not bad, per se... but its really just so paint-by-numbers at this point.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say Daniel Craig isn't a perfectly good James Bond. He's a great Bond, but so far, his villains are really weak. I want the genocidal mad-men and sinister organizations back. What we have now just feels like a series of briefly enjoyable, but ultimately empty one-night stands."
"The_Film_Cricket","10","2","10","11 November 2012"," After 50 years, Bond still satisfies
","It might be reasonable to assume that a series like James Bond, now in its 50th year, might be getting a little creaky. That might have been true a decade ago, but now in the new millennium, this series has been beautifully reinvented. By starting over with Bond's origins, the series is completely brought up to date. We feel that we're not just following the same tired formula but that the adventures of 007 have new surprises waiting for us. He is discovering things about himself and we are discovering new things about him. This is not only a great entry to the series; it's a great film on its own.<br/><br/>With ""Skyfall"" – the 23rd James Bond adventure – the writers and producers have done for Bond what Christopher Nolan did for Batman, they have taken a character that we know all too well and given him a refit that is better suited for the new millennium. That was true six years ago with the superior ""Casino Royale"" – which introduced Daniel Craig to the role - and that is especially true now with ""Skyfall"", a brilliant entry in the series that gives an earthiness but also respects the reasons that we fell in love with Bond in the first place.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Sam Mendes, whose films include brilliant character studies like ""American Beauty"", ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""Jarhead"", this entry is less on pure action and more fixated on characters than have ever been allowed by this series. Oh, the action is there, but there is more to it than simply action and shoot-outs. After the vapid nonsense of recent action pictures like ""Taken 2"" and ""The Bourne Legacy"", this film is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the plot of ""Skyfall"" isn't centered on Bond, but on his ever-confident MI6 boss M (Judi Dench). Early in the film M makes a crucial order that leaves Bond apparently dead, but also leaves an important hard drive in the hands of an unseen enemy. It contains the names and information of agents in the field which is threatened to be exposed. Judi Dench's performance is deeper and more thoughtful than you might think. She plays M as a woman who comes to realize that time has passed her by and that her tenure at MI6 is nearing its end. She turns to Bond for help this time not just for king and country. What grows in their relationship is really quite touching.<br/><br/>The source of the mischief is a soft-spoken psychopath named Silva (Oscar-winner Javier Bardem) whose reasons for exposing the MI6 agents are far more personal than simple global domination; he wants to use computer technology to turn international crime into a free market. There's something in Silva's nature and his history that leaves us with more information than simply a guy who wants something. He is less a function of the plot than a fixture of M's history. He has a reason for wanting her dead that is more solemn and personal than we might expect. Bardem's performance reveals a man who bears deep physical and emotional scars. He makes a move on Bond that we haven't seen before. The deep nature of the film extends also to Bond himself. This series has always been protective of Bond's background, only letting minor hints of his history sneak in. Here we get just enough of his background to humanize him, and to help us understand what fuels his cold blooded nature. There is a touching moment when we understand a little about his upbringing while understanding why he flinches when a doctor mentions the word ""Skyfall.""<br/><br/>Daniel Craig, in his third go-around, has brought something new to the character, an upfront vulnerability. He beautifully embodies the saddest contradiction to being Bond, that a man whose life involves traveling, killing and bedding multitudes of women has no time to maintain a life with traditional details. Better than any actor before him, Craig embodies the cold-blooded nature of Bond by reminding us that he is a man who can never have a proper life, only a lifestyle.<br/><br/>His girl in this entry sticks around only briefly, but she leaves an impression. She is Severine, played by French television actress Bérénice Marloh who is more assured and playful then most Bond girls. Unlike the previous girls who sport porn star names, lovely figures and little personal style, Severine has confidence and sophistication but also a vulnerability that remind us a little of Marlene Dietrich. There is a beautifully played moment when she converses with Bond in a casino and her playful banter changes as he uncovers something about her past just by looking at her.<br/><br/>Of course, all the deep humanity of ""Skyfall"" doesn't obscure the fact that this is a solid action picture. It is made palatable by the fact that the action is mostly based on logic. The stunt work is good but it works in connection with the plot. What we see is happening because it comes out of the story. We get an exciting chase atop of train, a chase through a London subway tunnel and a shootout at a crumbling manor fitted with booby traps. What is interesting here is that the third act doesn't just degenerate into routine action but actually adds something to the story. There is so much to this James Bond adventure, more that we expect; more humanity, more creativeness and a story that leaves with confidence that this series will carry on for another half century. Mr. Bond, don't let us down."
"HeirOfDorne","8","2","10","10 November 2012"," Another Successful Addition
","To start off I will say that Craig is by far my favorite bond, and that I enjoy his movies more than the others. Skyfall is a nice addition to the bond franchise, however I expected a little more. After watching the film it's apparent that Ian Fleming is trying to break the mold that current bond films have followed. The first difference which is slight, is there really is no ""Bond Girl"". In just about all of the films we are accustomed to 007 seducing a gorgeous women and then having her play an essential role in the film. In skyfall however there is no such girl. Bond is then left facing is most recent threat alone. Secondly, it was usually a common theme that bond left England to pursue an external threat. In this installment the threat becomes internal and bond, along with the rest of the secret service is the party being attacked. Unless I am mistaken this is a first for the franchise which may be a positive alternate. My largest critique is that the script was not such that Craig was not able to show his acting skills to the fullest. The biggest disappointment was the lack of twists and turns. Although these are some minor flaws the acting is still superb and Skyfall is without a doubt the front runner for movie of the year. Casino Royal is still my personal favorite."
"miserquest","9","2","10","10 November 2012"," Keep your minds open
","There have been two rather diverse strands of opinions emerging regarding Skyfall. The first expresses utter dismay at the plot, while the second heaps endless praise for the film despite certain plot twists that require our suspension of disbelief. I am of the latter camp, and I will now tell you why.<br/><br/>I believe that many people - whether films buffs or Fleming's fans, devout faithfuls or new converts - walked into the cinemas, popcorn in hand, high expectations in the heart. Those who felt disappointed by Sam Mendes were eager to point out how the plot was riddled with flaws that were not traditional of James Bond movies. But the truth is that the world we live in today is far more different than that of Sean Connery's, and our dear 007, classic as he is, must adapt to the times as well.<br/><br/>Indeed, Skyfall takes its cue from The Dark Knight Rises. I'm not saying that it ripped Nolan off wholesale, but that I sensed quite a few thinly veiled similarities while watching the movie. Perhaps it slightly disappointed me that they did not bother to conceal the similarities, but rather than diminishing the appeal of the film, it added a new dimension of smartness to the plot, one that we might never have heralded two decades ago.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant. Every single actor, veteran and newbies alike, fleshed out their role incredibly well with great professionalism. Daniel Craig once again emits charisma and will make you fall for him all over again, just like all the Bond girls have, though admittedly his character faces some setbacks this time round. And forget all the homo erotic criticisms you have heard about Javier Bardem's character - go in with an open mind and see for yourself how this actor carries the movie incredibly well. I'm only addressing these two because they're the main characters, but you will see that the rest fit in superbly as well, each one of them extremely endearing in their own quirky fashion.<br/><br/>Despite initial worries about Sam Mendes, all doubt has been wiped out. He has deftly crafted out a masterpieces that marries the old with the new. Even as he adds a personal touch to the number, he does not lose sight of James Bond and all that he has represented throughout the years.<br/><br/>You will leave the cinema with both a heavy heart and yet catharsis as its primary themes will resonate with you - that of modern day, technological terrorism, family/kinship, as well as the deeply evocative idea of growing old. Although it did leave me wondering how James Bond would carry on with two more films if they are already confronting his journey with age, it will ignite faith in you that the upcoming sequels will be even better.<br/><br/>Skyfall shines brightly on its own and brings renewed hope for the series following the dismal disappointment that is the Quantum of Solace. The action, cinematography and visual effects all add up to a seat-gripping ride. It will be a magnificent experience for those seeking the familiar, enigmatic secret agent in a challenging pursuit once more - just keep your mind open."

Not everyone is going to like where it goes but, I certainly did. The story is actually quite simple. After a mission goes awry, 007 (Daniel Craig) is thought dead but, is actually living in secret, drowning the negative effects of his job with sex and booze. But, when a mysterious and sinister individual targets MI6 and M (Dame Judi Dench) in particular, Bond returns to action despite doubts from some of his superiors that he still can handle the job. Writers Robert Wade, Neal Purvis and John Logan craft a story that is part spy thriller and part Silence Of The Lambs as Bond faces not a villainous organization or government but, one very dangerous and psychotic ex-MI6 agent known as Silva (Javier Bardem) who is bent on avenging what he feels is a betrayal by his former boss, M. It's a daring direction to give this Bond film a more personal focus despite it's scope and having Bond defending, not Queen and Country but, the one person he can even remotely consider family, M, from a man whose motives for revenge are equally personal. And director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road To Perdition) is more then up to the task. Mendes gives the film the epic scope we've come to expect from these moves as the film travels from Turkey to Shanghai and from Macau to London and Scotland but, never looses focus on the characters or story. He directs the action in a refreshingly old fashion manner, no more evident then in the thrilling train set pre-credit sequence. No quick cuts or shaky-cam, just good intense action. The action is what's exciting, not the camera or editing tricks used to make it exciting. He gets great performances out of his cast. Craig is sensational as a Bond who is a bit burnt-out and bitter yet, is driven by duty and loyalty to return to a life he has a chance to escape a life that maybe is right for him after all. Bardem is simply brilliant as the demented and dangerous yet, disturbingly flamboyant, Silva. A man who is Bond's equal in many way's but, is demented by his inner pain and thirst for revenge. Dame Judi Dench is great in an expanded role for M. She and Craig are magic together and it's great to see them share so many scenes after Quantum Of Solace kept them apart for almost that entire film. The supporting cast including Naomie Harris (Eve). Ralph Fiennes (Mallory) and Ben Whishaw (a young, computer geek-ish Q) are all excellent and provide great support for the principles. Mendes makes this flick look great with some stunning camera work such as the Blade Runner-esque Shanghai and the moody moors of Scotland. The film is deliberately paced but, it is more thriller then action flick although, there is plenty of the latter. Round that out with a very Bond score by Thomas Newman, a classic Bond theme by Adele and one of the best opening credits sequences in some time and you have a solid James Bond flick that is both charmingly familiar and yet boldly treads new ground. Bravo!"
"cadillac20","8","2","10","9 November 2012"," A very entertaining, somewhat poignant Bond film
","While I'm not an old school Bond fan like so many others who grew up with him, I have been a big fan of his recent Daniel Craig led efforts. Having grown up in the Brosnan era Bond, with his fairly cheesy rendition that contained all things Bond, but was more of the vanilla style Bond than anything else, Craig's rendition has been a welcome change. There has been a more emotional impact here, with Bond examined as a character and a human being, versus simply being the caricature of a super agent. A lot of people may take issue with this, as die hard fans may prefer a more fantasy oriented version of the character than one who is more realistic. But there is no doubt that Skyfall is a great film.<br/><br/>In one sense this is even more a character study than any Bond film before it, though I won't suggest I have the knowledge of the series to say for sure. Here, we have a Bond that goes through some radical changes throughout the film. You could even call this a much more mature Die Another Day, with some of the same beats here as in that film. But this Bond film goes into territory that drives in a very different direction from even Casino Royale or Quantum. The relationship between Bond and M is heavily explored, and M herself is examined. Q is finally introduced in this one, and we get a wonderful turn from Ralph Fiennes, who adds to the fantastic cast. But what of the villain. You've most likely heard much about him, and yes, it's true, Silva is fantastic. He is wonderfully quirky and has all the elements of a great Bond villain, from his own secret lair to physical blemishes (thoughts of Bloefeld come to mind). But this is also a villain who is highly intelligent, with a bit of a psychotic streak and who is capable of matching Bond in his skills.<br/><br/>But with all of this, this is still a Bond movie, and it may very well be the closest to an old Bond film than any of Craig's Bond films yet. Gadgets, even if small, become apart of the film, and there's even a small scene involving car gadgets. We also Bond who has gone a bit beyond his angry, gruff, and brutal personality into more of what we've come to expect of Bond. We see him getting more into the role of an experienced agent who acts cool and suave, maintaining a calm collection. And that famous wit that Bond is known for makes an obvious mark here. Yes, this is the bridge that will undoubtedly connect between what we've seen in these past three Bond films to the Bond that we have known and loved for 50 years. <br/><br/>There's also plenty of action to be had, with the gorgeous cinematography lending itself greatly to almost every scene. The action here isn't as big as we've come to expect, with it happening in spurts and consisting mostly of chases, but it is none the less exciting and even with it's nearly two and a half hour running time, the film never feels slow. <br/><br/>Die hard Bond aficionados may find this one too different from their tastes in Bond films to enjoy it, but for most of us who have enjoyed the new turn in the Bond universe, this is a fantastic movie. It goes beyond the typical Bond formula to give us something more. And it is every bit as enjoyable for it."

","... and 7 is on the high side.<br/><br/>James Bond is supposed - required - to display male mystique, idealism, escapism, vicarious experience, hoped-for cool, turn-of-phrase fun, and romping romance with the best the other gender has to offer of that release's generation - and a great watch.<br/><br/>A lot has gone missing with the Daniel Craig incarnation ... and he's not to be blamed. Craig in ""Munich"" is da bomb and presaged what he could do with the Bond role. In ""Munich"" he WAS the young Bond, yet-to-become suave, in-charge, & licensed as 007.<br/><br/>Now the franchise has gone ""real,"" ""feminine feelings"" & ""woundedness,"" set-backs, childhood deficits, and the crazy time-warp thing - is this prequel Bond or is it today's Bond while trying to be both at once? ""Casino Royale"" was OK; but it's been a meander downhill from there. It's kind of the Dalton Bond without the Wayne Newton type of fun and chicks sturdy enough to keep-up & survive all the action ... both kinds.<br/><br/>What should Bond be? A marriage of ""Taken 1"" (and that should have been QoS with Bond rescuing the Eva Green character and bringing her along for another romp, which would've been new, by the way) and Jason Statham's ""Killer Elite"" shaken & stirred with ""Entrapment"" - with some scenics & time-off for wide-screen romantasy & martinis.<br/><br/>In ""Skyfall"" even the watch is unworthy. It doesn't need an internal laser or cutting saw bezel ... just be cool, not middle manager dull with a Speidel Twist-o'-Flex. Bring on Breitling. <br/><br/>What we have now is neither fish-nor-fowl. Something needs to change - perhaps even bringing back Pierce Brosnan who had most of the Bond joy- of-cool going-on. Remember ""Die Another Day"" and his thing with kick-ass Michelle Yeoh blended with the svelte Teri Hatcher? The fight in the sound proof studio? Yum. BMW car debuts? How the '80's & '90's are missed.<br/><br/>The cool needs to be brought back to the mix. Chases & explosions can be found elsewhere & everywhere. The 007 franchise is wandering, adrift, trying to be ""relevant"" maybe when it needs to be mostly as it was - just better & better. Noe one almost expects to see Dr. Phil make a guest appearance.<br/><br/>Now let's all go for some Steve McQueen & Faye Dunaway to shake-off the Sky that fell short, even in IMAX.<br/><br/>Cinematographic Note: The Arri Alexa looked great. Forget the film- digital teapot tempest. The camera just needed to be pointed at more Bond-worthy sets, sirens, & scenery."
"damonous","6","2","10","8 November 2012"," It was the Best of Bonds; It was the Worst of Bonds
","Do not miss the first 10-15 minutes of Skyfall. It's one intense and well-executed action sequence followed into another. Do not miss the middle of the film, for one extremely well-done, satisfying and unique casino scene.<br/><br/>And, then there's the rest: A mixture of some taught drama, some not-so-taut drama, and some totally pedestrian and unworthy-of-a-Bond & nonsensical action scenes. Worst of all, the final battle of the movie is in one of the latter group: something you've seen countless times before in B-grade action movies with far less-important stars and characters.<br/><br/>I've found it's a problem when a movie doesn't know how to play to its strengths and instead tries to switch modes: if you start playing drama too rigidly, your mind goes into 'analytical mode', and then when over-the-top action is presented, as a viewer you start noticing every technicality and lapse of logic. Skyfall suffers from that, and I largely place the blame on director Sam Mendes, who seems to linger and ponder just a little too long on many scenes. It also suffers from an inane running thread about him being 'too old'. Considering they signed Craig for many more Bond movies to come, this is a most curious plot contrivance, and totally unnecessary. They could easily have just extrapolated that his injuries at the beginning of the movie were severe enough to have physically damaged him. They didn't need to make this another Wrath of Khan with constant references to, 'Are you still capable, Mr Bond?' <br/><br/>Were it not that Craig is still so engaging as Bond, and is supported by such great co-stars and characters (such as Ben Wishaw as the new Q, Naomi Harris, Ralph Fiennes and Judy Dench), Skyfall might rate a couple points even lower.<br/><br/>Lastly, while the epilogue is certainly an interesting setup for the next film...you'll either feel a heavy case of deja vu, and/or that it's been a big, long 3-picture journey just to come full circle."
"lasttimeisaw","8","2","10","7 November 2012"," Skyfall
","After CASINO ROYALE (2006, 7/10); QUANTUM OF SOLACE (2008, 7/10), Daniel Craig's resurrection as James Bond arrives in its 3rd round, with Winslet's ex-hubby Sam Mendes holding the director's reins, the film surpasses my presumption to a great extent, not the least with a sterling cinematography achievement from Roger Deakins. <br/><br/>The film kick-starts in Istanbul, a fresh deja-vu of Liam Neeson's TAKEN 2 (2012, 5/10) is the knee-jerking response, however, the subsequent train chase action is the bona fide climax. Adele's theme song comes next, a complete mind-blower (I listened the song for the first time) and visually it reminds me of Karen O's Immigrant Song, the eye-popping opening tune of Fincher's THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2011, 8/10, stars Daniel Craig as well). <br/><br/>The sleek and phenomenal night view of a metropolitan Shanghai is both reminiscent and dear to me (only if the crew could have tapped more into it), and for globetrotters, Bond's journey will never get bored, later on an exotic (but quite artificial) Macao and a godforsaken ghost island will satisfy all the western passengers before things return to London and eventually a surprising showdown at Scotland (the titular Skyfall lodge) Bond's childhood home, the foggy and dreamlike settings are in the perfect sense under Deakins' haunting shots, the atmosphere is deadly artistic yet gripping. <br/><br/>Apart from the digital visual stunts, the film opts to a more detailed revenge route for its (commonly) stereotyped villain and invests more time in Judi Dench's swan song of M, whose superior-subordinate/mother-son affinities with Bond, this time it is not about saving the world, it is a pure and simple vengeance game. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig is still the indomitable Bond, steely but less refined, but the scene stealers here are definitely Dame Judi Dench and the maniac ex-MI6 agent Javier Bardem. The truth is Dench is the real ""bond girl"" in this episode, who dominates a protracted screen-time (only second to Bond), since we all aware that it is the last time to see her in this recurrent role, the film has kindly proffered her some Academy-worthy moments (the poem-citing scene in the court for example), to accent on poising herself with integrity and professional pride for the country she serves while exuding a bit testimony as a human flesh with very subtle but emotional unsettlement. Although I am not on board with M's denouement in the film (too banal compared with other revolutionary merits injected in the reboot of the franchise), Dench and her team behind definitely should champion hard for a seat in the next Oscar race. So could be said to Bardem, but he is much like a long-shot since formulaic villains in the franchise films are principally snubbed by the voting members, Bardem delivers an awe- inspiring performance, period. New bond girl Bérénice Marlohe has scant time but it may conform to the saying ""less is better""as long as her mission has been convincingly accomplished. Fiennes' role is dooming to be more meaty next time and Harris is just another girl can serious kick someone's ass.<br/><br/>I do hope SKYFALL will find more endorsement in the academic field, where in the history of 50 years, James Bond and his makers have never been taken seriously, and the time finally comes when some curse must be broken."
"larryssa-68-866888","8","2","10","7 November 2012"," how Skyfall is a part of History
","With this movie, we literally reach a new step in James Bond's history. This movie is a real turning point not only in the franchise but in cinema too. I'm not saying that this is the best film ever but it's a real interesting point of view.<br/><br/>On of the great thing in the JB franchise is the opening credit: they give an inside, every time, of what will occur in the movie. And these one is quite an history, leaving many questions at the end like what is Skyfall but one certainty: we will learn about really deep about the inside of Bond, and what we will see might be torturous. This actually is a movie with an wonderful actor playing a spy who will at some point have to stop acting, the same for M too. Those two are opening themselves to the audience, and the close-ups, the pause in their dialogues, the way the camera acts around them... reveal so much more about what they can not tell. You have two different times: one before, and one after the opening credit. Before, this is the action Bond, after this is the human Bond. And in that story you can literally see the novels, see the words of Ian Fleming becoming alive. The story is well constructed, might be predictable at some point but the interesting part lays in the characterization of every single one of the character: good or bad, young or aging, male or female, primary or secondary role part... You may pick and admire how this movie constructs himself around actual questions, actual ones : who am i in this owl wild world? what is my purpose? can i evade from my destiny? does even destiny or fate exist? Whatever you decide, choosing to focus on philosophy over action or vice-versa, Skyfall will be the answer. Finally, are we entering in some new era of modern cinema? Like the old golden age, is the cinema not creating itself again? Remember, the glorious period when the cinema was a big entertainment where we could explore the limits of a relatively new form of expression and experiment, but at some point the public concern became a part of the art letting some concern and crepuscular movies take place. I think it is happening again today, redefining and rewriting cinema as a way to question not only the society but ourself as a part of it: we saw it in super heroes (like in the Dark knight, and Dark Knight rises...), dramas (revolutionary road, the kids are alright...) and even comedies or cartoons! we finally are stepping up from the anonymity we hide into... and some like Bond are doing it on the big screen thanks to some really great and human scenarios."

","Starts off great like most Bond films. The pulsating and adrenaline rush inducing opening sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film. However, the rest of the film fails to keep up. The pacing of the movie is erratic, perhaps deliberately so but it didn't work for me. Having said that, this movie has more humor than the previous Craig- Bond ventures though the dark overtones prevail through out the film. Craig continues to give Bond the rough edge but one sorely misses the humor and the witty one liners. They are there as mentioned earlier but are few and far between. Javier Bardem makes for a decent villain though his character derives obvious inspiration from Dark Knight's Joker. Judi Dench, Naomie Harris and Ralph Fiennes are adequate in their parts. The movie is expectedly a visual extravaganza as it moves from turkey to London and then to shanghai and macau.<br/><br/>Has most of the Bond elements like Q's gadgets, shaken martinis & fancy casinos (with komodos) in small measures which makes it a mildly entertaining ride. Expected more, especially with Sam Mendes at the helm."
"jtca1","1","2","10","5 November 2012"," The Real Truth About Skyfall By A True Bond Fan.
","I am a huge James Bond fan. I have watched all the films many times and have played all the video games. I will admit that my favorite James Bond is Pierce Brosnan and I don't think they will find anybody like him ever again. His Bond was a charming gentleman with a great sense of humor but also could be a cold-hearted killer and a lover. Daniel Craig looks like an East European bus driver. He is a ruthless thug with no sense of humor and his Bond is very boring. He is good at the action though and I won't let my dislike of him affect my review of the film.<br/><br/>Many newspapers said that Skyfall was the best Bond film ever. What a load of nonsense! They must have been bribed or wanted to increase Britain's success in this glorious 2012 London Olympic Games year. The first half of the film was abysmal. The opening sequence supposedly took ages to film but was overlong, dull and unimpressive. It was very forgettable. It was just cars chasing cars with no explosions and few stunts. There wasn't another action scene for about 40 minutes, which is far too long when you have a James Bond with no humor and charm to keep you entertained. It was obvious that the budget was lower than previous films with rooms being very simple and locations being cheap and most of it filmed in Britain. The plot was confusing and very poor. What happened to that disc? Surely Bond couldn't have survived a huge fall from the train into the water with two gunshot wounds? The bit in Shaghai when that guy assassinated someone was so confusing. Who was that man and what the hell were those lights/screens and what was this building? The whole Shanghai part was pointless and so was the character of Berenice who only appeared for about 7 minutes. Silva's base was a really low budget location especially the room in which we first saw him, which had plain walls and floor and no furniture except a chair and a few hard drives. The gadgets in the film were terrible. Exploding pens? Yes please. A gun with a fingerprint scanner? No thanks; utterly pointless. The action in the first half of the film was poor. It was mostly hand-to-hand combat and very poorly coordinated. The villain(Javier Bardem) was all right, same standard as the average Dominic Green basically, but it was a little strange that a Spanish person could have been an MI6 agent. Some of his jokes were a little silly and made him look like a pathetic weakling instead of a ruthless, smart and deadly villain.<br/><br/>The music in the film mostly didn't suit a Bond film but there were a few great pieces of music such as the one used at Bond's arrival in China. Adele's theme tune is fantastic, sung really well, and it has a great catchy chorus. It's definitely the best Bond theme tune since 1999's The World is not Enough.<br/><br/>However, the film wasn't all bad. Dame Judi Dench was fantastic in her final Bond film. Ben Whishaw, although he is young, makes a fantastic Q whom you can actually believe is a genius. Ralph Fiennes certainly looks promising as the new M and the character of Tanner played by Rory Kinnear was stronger than in the last two films. The second half of the film (from Silva's escape to the end) was superb; the best stuff I have seen in a Bond film since Die Another Day. The chase on the tube was really exciting and some great stunts were used. The shoot-out in the courthouse where M was being interrogated was the best action scene in the movie: very realistic shooting and the smoke grenades were a nice touch. Bond opening the garage to reveal the Aston Martin DB5 was a classic moment with a nice line by M: ""hardly conspicuous!"" The house in Scotland actually turned out to be a fantastic location for the finale and the sort of place that has never been used in a Bond film before. The action there was top-notch again and the death of M was very emotional. Eve Moneypenny was quite a good Bond ""woman"" but didn't play a major part in the film. The very ending with the copy of that door with the red leather which used to be M's office in the old films was a nice touch. The increase of humor was a great improvement over the last two films. Craig had one funny line ""not exactly Christmas"" but a lot of the humor came from Q and M.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film is definitely Craig's best (nowhere near the best Bond film though, perhaps not even in the top 10) but it was really let down by the first half of the film. It was far too long and so boring. Surely if you know you've got a tight budget, the answer is to make the film shorter rather than longer? Quality is more important than quantity! Daniel Craig still is a very dull Bond and when there is no action and a poor story, the entertainment has to come from the character of Bond himself and this just doesn't work for Craig as it did for Brosnan and the others. However, the film is totally acceptable and enjoyable unlike Quantum of Solace.<br/><br/>5.5/10."

","Apparently, reading the opinions of other people, you either love this movie or you hate it. I loved it. Although I would have preferred a more physical ending - a slug fest between Bond and Silva; I reckon I'm an old fashioned kind of guy. Javier Bardem played his part very well. I got the feeling that he read a lot of Batman comics and coated Silva with a lot of Joker. Craig was good, efficient. He's good in this kind of movie. But the ending suggested to me that after 3 heavy movies, they're going to go back to the lighter stuff. A male M, entering his office through the upholstered door, the banter with Moneypenny, Q, the barrel of the gun... I wonder if he'll be as good at this kind of Bond as Brosnan was. And was I the only one who kept thinking that the part of Kincade should have gone to Sean Connery?..."

","Skyfall (2012) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Daniel Craig's third time as James Bond has his loyalty to M (Judi Dench) questioned after a former agent (Javier Bardem) tries to take her out. Bond travels the globe trying to track down the bad guy but he soon realizes that there's only one old fashioned way to bring it all to a close. SKYFALL comes from director Sam Mendes and it's certainly a major step up from the previous film but it also takes the franchise into a new, more modern direction while being respectful to the old style as well. This film is clearly one of the best looking in the series and especially the stuff taking place in China. The beautiful way everything lights up the screen certainly looks terrific and the director also makes it very stylish and brings it to life. The screenplay here is another very good one and I really liked the way where all the characters are basically questioning stuff they've done in the past and what effect that is having on them in the present times. This is clearly a somewhat darker Bond and it works very well. The performances are among some of the best you're going to see from any Bond film with Craig easily putting his foot on the part and doing wonders with it. It's clear that he's doing something really incredible with the part and I think at this point it's fair to call him the second best. Dench is also very good in her part as she's given a lot more to do here than in previous films. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Albert Finney, Ben Whishaw and Berenice Marlohe are all excellent in their support parts as well. Barden is also very memorable in his role as the villain but one wishes he had more screen time. The film contains one great action sequence after another with the beginning and ending to the picture really packing a bunch. I'm not going to go as far as some and call this the best Bond movie ever made but it's certainly one of the most entertaining and effective."

When Casino Royale was released the transition for Pierce Brosnan to Daniel Craig itself was not digestible. I mean the movie was great but again old ways were missing. Watched Skyfall, I wasn't expecting much from this movie apart from a good story or stunning action sequences. And I was surprised. There was a whole lot more in this movie than what I was expecting.

One Bond film which was great without taking itself seriously. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, it very much has quite a lot of significance in today's society. An excellent reflection on fractured loyalty and relationships and the ability to cope with being someone in Bond's position. Seriously, do they realise what effect it has on being an agent?

","Dr. No first introduced the most famous fictional spy created by Ian Fleming, James Bond 007, in 1962, since then twenty two films and six actors: Sir Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Sir Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig, and the most successful franchise in the world brought us this twenty third film to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the series, from director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition). Basically James Bond 007 (Daniel Craig) and agent Eve (Naomie Harris) are chasing Patrice (Ola Rapace), who killed an MI6 agent and stolen a computer hard drive containing details of NATO agents undercover from terrorist organisations, it's imperative they retrieve it. During the chase Bond and the killer fight on top of a train, Eve has a shot that is not clear, M (BAFTA nominated Dame Judi Dench), head of MI6, orders to shoot Patrice, she ends up accidentally shooting Bond, he is presumed dead falling into the river below, after this M is pressured by Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), Intelligence and Security Committee Chairman, to retire. MI6 headquarters explodes after M's computer is hacked, killing a number of agents, James not dead has been relaxing, but he sees the news report and returns to London, using the shrapnel in his shoulder from one of Patrice's bullets they track his location. Bond meets his new quartermaster, Q (Ben Whishaw), who gives him a new special Walther PPK, he heads for Shanghai, meanwhile five NATO agents are killed after their details are leaked, Bond finds and stops Patrice from killing another, he falls to his death before questioning, but Bond gets another lead finding a gambling chip in Patrice's equipment case. Heading to the casino the chip came from Bond meets the woman he saw during Patrice's assassination attempt, Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) who warns him he will be killed before leaving, she will help him if he kills her employer, after attacking the henchmen and escaping a Komodo dragon he joins her on her boat. Next morning they are taken prisoner to an abandoned island city, Bond meets Sévérine's employer, criminal mastermind behind the explosion at MI6, Raoul Silva (BAFTA nominated Javier Bardem), who reveals he was a former MI6 agent working under M, he wants revenge and blames her for his imprisonment and torture by the Chinese. Silva kills Sévérine, but Bond activated his distress signal before they were captured, Silva is arrested and put in a strong transparent cell, when Q tries to decrypt codes on Silva's laptop computer he inadvertently hacks into MI6 systems and allows Silva to escape through the London Underground, Bond pursues him. Silva tries to kill M at a meeting into her handling of recent situations, but Bond, Mallory, Eve and aide Tanner (Rory Kinnear) stop his attack, M is to be taken away to a place of safety, in Bond's famous Aston Martin DB5 they travel to his childhood home in Scotland, the lodge named Skyfall. Bond tells Q to set a trail for Silva to follow, at Skyfall the gamekeeper of the Bond family estate, Kincade (Albert Finney), brings out some weapons for them to defend themselves, Bond sets up booby traps. Soon enough Silva's men surround the place and they fight off their assault, then Silva himself arrives and M and Kincade escape through the secret tunnel and head for a chapel. Bond escapes Skyfall before it is exploded with gas canisters and dynamite, and he narrowly escapes a fall through ice with a henchman, in the chapel Silva notices that M is mortally wounded, but before he can kill her he is stabbed in the back by James with a large knife, he dies, M collapses, and after some last words she dies. In the end, Mallory becomes the new M, Eve introduces herself properly with her surname Moneypenny and becomes a secretary instead of a field agent, and James Bond 007 is ready for his next mission. Also starring Helen McCrory as Clair Dowar MP, Nicholas Woodeson as Doctor Hall, Huw Edwards as BBC News Anchor and a cameo by producer Michael G. Wilson. Craig is still the impeccable choice for Bond as the cool, suave and determined secret agent with a licence to kill, Bardem is fantastically camp (literally) as the villain with a gross facial deformity from a bad cyanide pill and a truly evil presence, Dench proves herself a great actress as her character is brought out much more in the story, Whishaw as the younger Q is much needed comic relief and nostalgia, and the supporting cast like Harris and Fiennes are great also. Quantum of Solace was a bit flat, this brings things right back up to standard, the characters are terrific, the story is well written and played out, the heart racing sequences are well executed with great special effects and stunts, the Oscar and Golden Globe winning title song by Adele is magnificent, product placement is certainly noticeable, seeing Bond drink a Heineken rather than Martini, ""shaken, not stirred"", and returning Bond conventions like the Aston Martin DB5, Q and Moneypenny make you reminisce on the past great Bond films, it is a brilliant spy action thriller and possibly my new favourite Bond film, with Goldfinger, it became the highest grossing film in the series, and in the UK. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing (tied with Zero Dark Thirty), and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Music for Thomas Newman and Best Sound Mixing, and it won the BAFTAs for Original Music and Outstanding British Film, wand it was nominated for Cinematography, Editing, Production Design and Sound. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Outstanding!"

Everything a Hollywood Blockbuster like Mission Impossible (I like this series too!!!), Bourne, Transformer ... doesn't have, Skyfall has it! There are not much us-productions, which have the same good ingredients.

"C22Man","7","2","11","1 August 2015"," A welcomed call back to the Connery classics
","Bond Review. <br/><br/>Title: A cool title and plays a part in the story. <br/><br/>Pre-Titles: In Istanbul Bond and fellow agent Eve pursue a mercenary who has stolen a computer drive. Whilst Bond fights the man on a train, Eve is order to shoot and accidentally 'kills' Bond. This is a brilliant opening. It is well set-up, the stunt work is excellent and it is all very exciting. I love how the action gets bigger from cars to motorbikes to the top of a train and without it feeling too overblown.<br/><br/>Theme Song: Adele provides a classy and suitably moody theme. It is in the same vein as Shirley Bassey's work on the series and a pleasant call back to the Connery era theme songs. Most of it is thanks to a beautifully delicate piano melody, mysterious lyrics and soaring vocals.<br/><br/>Plot: MI6 is being attacked by a force that is believed to be from M's past. Bond returns from his absence and follows a trail that leads to one time agent Raoul Silva who is seeking revenge against MI6 for its apparent betrayal of him during his service. This is probably the most personal story in the series and it is that uniqueness that makes it so effective. Well finally get a pure look at the M character, her relationships with her agents and even a look into Bond's origins. Silva's scheme is set-up excellently and is interesting, whilst the relationships between the characters are developed and feel real.<br/><br/>James Bond: Daniel Craig does a truly brilliant job. He's probably the closest thing to Connery here in making Bond well balanced in each aspect as he's ruthless, sardonic, witty and charming in just the right amount. Craig also nails the more expressive scenes as well as being believable as a wearier and wiser Bond, while his relationships with M and the new Q are excellent.<br/><br/>Bond Girls: The Bond girls are probably the weakest point. Naomie Harris is decent as Eve and delivers her lines with a warm charm, but she just doesn't convincing in the action sequences and doesn't have much chemistry with Craig. Berenice Marlohe is very good as Severine and has an engaging presence, but the character is given little screen time and has absolutely no development. <br/><br/>Villains: Javier Bardem is fantastic as Silva. He has an interesting look, delivers some really effective lines and feels like an intellectual as well as physical threat. The fact that Silva's a hacker is a smart update and even the homosexual undertones work surprisingly well. His motivation makes sense and his link to M is explored excellently, while Bardem succeeds in being memorable. <br/><br/>Support: Judi Dench is superb as M. She adds a more sympathetic side to the character and her relationship with Craig is just wonderful, while every word she says and every expression she makes feels real. Ralph Fiennes is great as usual as the tough intelligence chairman Mallory and Albert Finney brings warmth as gamekeeper Kincade, while Ben Whishaw is fantastic as the new youthful computer smart Q and brings a lot of subtle humour to the role.<br/><br/>Action: The action is brilliant. Bond tracking the mercenary and fighting him in one of the Shanghai buildings is shot amazingly. We get a fun fight with some komodo dragons that hearkens back to the Connery fights. The whole sequence of Bond chasing Silva through London is just fantastic in every aspect, while the shootout in the enquiry room is great too. The climax is superb and is effectively Bond does Home Alone as he tries to protect Skyfall, it's packed with tension and nicely inventive.<br/><br/>Score: Thomas Newman provides an excellent score. He simply creates a great balance as his compositions move between pounding intense pieces to sweeping classic sounding arrangements, while incorporating oriental sounds and subtle electronics smartly.<br/><br/>Production Values: Sam Mendes does a great job with the direction. He knows when to keep it simple and how to create memorable imagery which is exactly what you want from a Bond director. The visuals are a highlight. This is possibly the best looking film of the series, there are so many beautiful shots when Bond is in Shanghai thanks to a really expressive colour scheme and the shots of the Scottish hills are just oozing with atmosphere. The writing is very good. The characters are believable and their motivations are plausible, this is very much a character driven film and the plot fits around this direction smartly. The dialogue has a just the right mix of intelligence and humour. In fact the humour in this film is effective because it is so low-key, it shows that you can do a serious Bond film and have plenty of amusing bits throughout. As noted the locations are brilliant and are all captured perfectly.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Skyfall is a fantastic Bond film in every sense of the word. It is constantly entertaining while managing to be gritty, funny and stylish whenever it is called for. Daniel Craig is just superb here and he really does include everything you want a Bond actor to have. Judi Dench is outstanding in a bigger role, Javier Bardem makes a memorable villain, the supporting actors are fantastic, the action is very enjoyable, the score is engaging and the visuals are spectacular. Sure the female leads are a little weak and the plot may well be too convoluted for some, but this is Bond at its most entertaining and it is a welcomed return to form."
"johnx20","9","2","11","29 November 2012"," Simply extraordinary!
","When going to watch this film I was a cautious as I had heard that Sam Mendes has made some changes to the bond franchise which, as a big bond fan, is worrying. To put it simply I was simply blown away by this film, even the opening was different and a nice refreshing change to the previous starts. The great cinematography in this film makes it feel even more magical as we see fights in this film which seem almost like a form of art.The characters in this film are, for the most part, intriguing and complex especially those of M and James Bond. The villain in this film is new and different to other villains as he isn't as conventional as others, but also, his motivation for doing what he does makes the film seem more personal and meaningful than other films. Another great part of the film is that we don't quite know what all these pieces of the puzzle add up to until the end as the film comes to a memorising end of great metaphors and a very emotional end. Performances in this film are superb as Judi Dench portrays a deeper character than any other bond and she becomes the main Bond girl in this film. Daniel Craig gives his best performance as bond showing Bond at his weakest but mainly at his best which he step up to very well. The special effects in this film are unlike anything else seen in other films in the action genre. The mood of the film is a comfortable one which can quickly have you on the edge of your seat.This Bond film simply leaves any other action film a lap behind, I've never quite experienced any action quite like this."

","I've been waiting for this film for a very long time. Not just the actual film but the idea of it. I loved Daniel Craigs first 2 films as Bond but felt they were a departure from what a Bond movie really was. This movie has brought Bond back to Bond.<br/><br/>Bond movies are clever, funny, action filled, sexually charged and beautifully shot. Skyfall does every one of those and more.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is breathtaking. I saw this in IMAX and was blown away by almost every shot. The fact that this was all done mostly in camera(as much as possible) makes the cinematography in this film leaps and bounds above movies like Life Of PI. Light and composition are used in a beautiful way. I found myself just staring at the visuals throughout the whole film, I had to see the movie a second time to make sure I didn't miss anything. If this doesn't win the Oscar for cinematography the Academy is surely insane. <br/><br/>I've been a bond fan for a long time. I was awaiting a film that brought back my love of the Bond movies that Connery and Moore made and this film restored my faith in filmmakers, movies and Bond. welcome back."

","Firstly I'm going to say it...yes this is the best Bond film I have seen to date. In regards to all the reviews which seemingly label this as an awful movie I wonder whether we have we seen the same movie??<br/><br/>There are so many elements in this movie that come together and feel just right from the beautiful set locations to the outstanding performances including the movie's main antagonist Silva, who in my opinion delivered a genuinely sinister yet engaging performance (not unlike TDK's Joker).<br/><br/>That's not to say this is the best action movie to date as it does suffer from a very few fundamental flaws (pacing issues, plot holes) however as Bond films go this is certainly worthy of the name"

"Robert_duder","8","2","11","12 November 2012"," Solid entry in the Bond Franchise, Craig still continues to shine
","The immediate conversation of anything Bond will erupt in debate for fans. You can't have an iconic series for 50 years without causing some debate. Bond has formed itself into far more than thee action/spy franchise and instead is an epic film in and of itself. At an unapologetic 2 1/2 hours long, it does not feel it for an instant. There is as much story and drama as is there is action. Say what you will about Daniel Craig (he is the first Bond I ever saw, and since then I have watched Connery and Brosnan Bond films) and he brings a completely new Bond to the table and Skyfall showcases how different his Bond is. Craig's Bond is jaded, violent, brooding with a mysterious past. He has many vices including alcohol and women of course but Craig still manages to show the suave, womanizing, social side that has made Bond an icon for years. You can't expect every iteration of Bond to be the same or that would make for a very quickly dying series. Skyfall is epic, sweeping, all encompassing but still has good solid action scenes. I think the drama does drag in certain spots and the story isn't perfect but it is still entirely entertaining and worthy of any Bond fan.<br/><br/>I think I've spoke enough about Craig but he is a great Bond. He has the chemistry, charisma, and acting chops to pull off this role. The only thing I always notice with Craig is that his ego tends to come through in his performances. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. For Bond, I think it works. Judi Dench returns to her iconic role as ""M"" She was good, she plays her role well. Her character arc was a little weak, I sort of saw where it was going right from square one. They try and focus on her as a source of the story but she just doesn't really blow you away at it. Javier Bardem is getting all kinds of buzz and accolades as the flamboyant Bond villain. Certainly he does a great job and him and Craig have decent chemistry. He wasn't the most brilliant villain I've ever seen but he is still terrific in the role. Naomie Harris and Bérénice Marlohe are our Bond girls. They serve their purpose well enough, I think I would have liked to have seen more from Harris but she had a good role and the chemistry was good with Craig. An excellent supporting cast includes Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw and Rory Kinnear in small but important roles. Also honourable nod to the amazing Albert Finney who had a great cameo role towards the end of the film. I also thought how great it would have been (although completely implausible and impossible) to have Sean Connery appear in Finney's role. But Finney was still terrific.<br/><br/>I think that a truly great Bond film encompasses imagery, cinematography, women, gambling, gadgets, espionage and just a little bit of cheese. Director Sam Mendes nails every one of those things. He doesn't miss a single angle of who Bond is, even a new Bond like Craig. The film truly has an epic adventure feel and tells the story without burying it under mindless action. The action scenes are well shot and the film makers gave fans a truly outstanding nod to fan service in the form of a certain vehicle that everyone in the theatre seems to really enjoy. It wasn't a perfect film but it was still terrific. I think it was as good as any of the Craig Bond films up until now. It is certain to be financially successful and I truly hope this is not Craig's last go at the world's most iconic spy. 8/10"
"StarshipTrouper","9","2","11","12 November 2012"," Skyfall-was it good?
","You bet. Only CR beats it in my book. Sam Mendes does a marvellous job (please let's have him back for Bond 24) Super action sequences.The chase through the Turkish streets and rooftops was wonderful.Obviously loads of set pieces,with the obligatory massive explosive ending (Does Broccoli and Wilson insist on this? ) Q's re-introduction was far better than I expected,no longer a part without any character,Ben Whishaw is excellent. When the walls in the cinema are no longer shaking with the action shots,we have a literate script. All the main charters are up to the job.Barden is an excellent villain.Craig as ever is brilliant.Without a doubt the best Bond. What can you say about M?.Judie Dench has been superb in all the films. Some people are squawking about Bond not being fit, more vulnerable.They are people who have never read Fleming. In Thunderball and particularly YOLT Bond was in a very bad state,on the point of resigning S.I.S. Personally the only character I wasn't happy with was Moneypenny. For once we get to see Bond in our own country.The second half is Bond in Britain. It's no accident this film is doing well at the box office."
"DesiBaba","8","2","11","11 November 2012"," Not your run-of-the-mill 007.
","This movie may not go well with those who'd like to have Bond movie cling on to a very specific formula. Cars with ""tricks"" up its sleeves, futuristic gadgets, and of course, bond fornicating with a slew of femme fatale before taking care of the bad guy. While this movie retains some of that, it is also a noticeable departure from the past 007 movies. Especially the last hour or so, which feels more like a western rather than a bond movie. For my taste, this was one of the better Bond movies in a couple of decades. Even better than QoS and CR, which are both quite good as well. I hope Craig continues to play 007 for the foreseeable future, he is the best bond since Connery. Too bad M had to be replaced, she will be missed. It is not a surprise that this will be the highest grossing Bond movie ever."
"raeannedupont","Null","2","11","9 November 2012"," More Than Just a 007
","Daniel Craig is back in his third Bond movie and as a adamant fan of the previous two movies I found this one to be even more compelling. Filled with the right amount of action and classic smooth Bond moments this movie kept me riveted in my seat with suspense. Uniquely visual locations and brilliant acting, Skyfall delved into the past and confronted the future of MI6. Questions are asked and answered, but while one is answered another appears, weaving a web of code that the viewer (and the characters) are desperately trying to solve. Witty remarks and humor underline the film along with the constant pressure of time and the dwindling clock. I highly recommend this film and it is well worth experiencing it while it is in theaters."
"JamesHitchcock","7","2","11","9 November 2012"," Back in Safe Hands
","Daniel Craig's first outing as James Bond, ""Casino Royale"", was one of the best of the series, but unfortunately his second, ""Quantum of Solace"", was one of the worst, and raised serious questions about the direction in which the franchise was heading. It was followed by a four- year hiatus, not a deliberate decision on the part of the producers but rather a consequence of MGM's financial troubles. Nevertheless, the extra time may have been beneficial in allowing a major rethink to take place, because ""Skyfall"" is actually rather good, certainly far better than its predecessor, if not quite in the same class as ""Casino Royale"". <br/><br/>The plot is not particularly original. The McGuffin- the thing the bad guys are trying to get hold of- is a computer disc containing details of undercover MI6 agents whose lives will be put at risk if their identity is revealed. This plot device is hardly new- there was, for example, a similar storyline in one of the ""Charlie's Angels"" films. The villain, Raoul Silva, is a rogue former MI6 operative with a grudge against the organisation he used to work for- just like Sean Bean's character, Alec Trevelyan, in ""Goldeneye"". <br/><br/>Yet in the context of James Bond, familiarity is not always a bad thing, nor is innovation always a good one. I don't mean that every Bond film should be a virtual remake of ""Dr No"", or ""Octopussy"", or even ""Goldeneye""- such a film would be unlikely to succeed, either artistically or financially, in the very different climate of the 2010s. One of the flaws of ""Quantum"", however, was that it departed too far from the traditional idea of what a Bond film should be, and ""Skyfall"" restores the balance by being more respectful of Bond tradition. The hero once again introduces himself as ""Bond, James Bond"", and once again enjoys his dry Martinis shaken rather than stirred. Two recurring characters (both last seen in ""Die Another Day"") who make a return are Miss Moneypenny and Q, here played by Ben Whishaw as a youthful, bespectacled computer geek. <br/><br/>Craig has been criticised, largely by those who blame him for not being Connery, or Moore, or Brosnan. Yet one of the strengths of the series (as with ""Dr Who"") is that each actor who has played the main character has been free to bring his own interpretation and insights to the role. Craig's Bond is more serious, disillusioned and doubt-ridden than Connery's, Moore's, or Brosnan's. Of his predecessors, he probably has most in common with Timothy Dalton. Some may regret the loss of the note of light-heartedness which once characterised the series, but any attempt at Moore-style levity would probably be alien to Craig's style of acting. In this film we get to learn a few things about Bond's background and of his childhood, things which might explain his rather gloomy demeanour. We learn, for example, that he was orphaned at an early age and that he grew up at Skyfall Lodge, an old manor-house in the Scottish Highlands. This definitively answers the question of Bond's nationality, although none of the actors who have played him, except Connery, have given him a Scottish accent. <br/><br/>I was initially disappointed to learn that Judi Dench, a relic of the Brosnan era, was still playing Bond's superior M. Although Dame Judi remains a fine actress, even in her late seventies, I felt that even in ""Quantum"", four years ago, she was too old to play the part convincingly. Plot considerations, however, made it essential that she be cast in the role as Silva's grievance centres on the way in which he was treated by her in the past; a key element in Dench's characterisation has always been M's ruthlessness and willingness to sacrifice her agents in what she sees as the wider national interest. <br/><br/>An important part of the success of any Bond film is a convincing villain, and this was something in which ""Quantum of Solace"", with the colourless Mathieu Amalric, was conspicuously lacking. ""Skyfall"" does much better in this regard. Javier Bardem's Silva, softly-spoken but menacing, is perhaps the most memorable Bond villain since Sophie Marceau in ""The World is Not Enough"". Bardem- better here than he was giving that over-praised performance in ""No Country for Old Men""- is also able to show that Silva is something more than just a villain, a man whose villainy arises from the fact that he has been made to suffer unjustly. <br/><br/>On the debit side, Naomie Harris is not the most charismatic of Bond Girls, and it is a pity that a more substantial role could not have been found for the lovely Bérénice Marlohe; her character, Sévérine, joins the long list of ""Bond Girls killed off too early"". (Others include Shirley Eaton in ""Goldfinger"", Maud Adams in ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" and Caroline Munro in ""The Spy Who Loved Me""). <br/><br/>""Quantum"" was directed by Marc Forster who did not seem to have much idea about how to direct an action movie. For ""Skyfall"" the producers turned to Sam Mendes, one of Britain's most distinguished living directors and the man responsible for masterpieces like ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"". ""Skyfall"" is not perhaps a masterpiece, but it is a very assured piece of film-making, with none of the dreadful shaky camera-work which marred ""Quantum"". Mendes also invests some scenes with a visual beauty surprising in a Bond film, and makes the action sequences as thrilling as they should be. The Bond franchise seems to be back in safe hands again. 7/10"
"Grendel2501","8","2","11","7 November 2012"," Bond Revisited
","A little bit of old, with a lot of the new and current, and a splash of reinvention splashed in. This film was perhaps a Bond film that stands alone in it's scope, cinematography, acting and story. What is the best Bond film of all time will always be debated, but it's hard to deny how entertaining this installment was. You can clearly see how Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight heavily influenced Sam Mendes' direction on Skyfall. I love how he brought in Bond elements of films past and reset the landscape of the story going forward. Moreover, I love how we get a peak into Bond's back story, which really helps to give the character more development and depth. Most of all, Javier Bardem absolutely kills it as a villain. Definitely worth the coin."
"minorplusest","10","2","11","5 November 2012"," What does everyone expect of a James Bond movie?
","For me its fun to see any James Bond movie, mostly because I have no other expectation but to be entertained, the James Bond character is just fun to follow ... its somehow hard to understand why so many people react like if James Bond where ... I don't know: father?, lover?, alter-ego?.<br/><br/>Well, that parked aside, Skyfall is a fun movie to watch if you want to be entertained.<br/><br/>The main cast (Craig, Dench & Barden) does a fine job. New comers will have to work hard to gain their place in the franchise (no names to avoid spoilers). The plot have some serious holes, but well, that is part of the 007 franchise too. The entire checklist is filled: opening action sequence, nice girls, semi-exotic locations, the bad guy, the martini ... well, you know it. Additions to this movie are some nostalgia and tears (think I've only see those in Lazenby's Bond). With such a large list of ""needs to be in the film"" elements I think Sam Mendes does an elegant job mixing them together, and if the movie is a bit long, is just that he needed time to add the differentiator content.<br/><br/>Skyfall is just another fun James Bond movie to watch ... probably because Goldfinger did not change my life, nor Moonraker is the worst movie I've seen. <br/><br/>Grab some popcorn and enjoy! thats what James Bond is all about."
"seeviewpictures","10","3","22","2 November 2012"," The best Bond film in the franchise
","I'm a huge fan of the Fleming books, and it was only really with Craig's first outing did we see the literary incarnation on screen in all its glory for the first time in years. Dalton's brief tenure allowed us an interpretation of the character, but then you have to go back to the 60's before that for more accurate representations of Fleming's character, under both Connery and Lazenby.<br/><br/>Quantum of Solace undid a lot of the hard groundwork the producers achieved in Casino Royale, making Bond human and occasionally vulnerable, and gladly they've returned to this more realistic concept again for Skyfall.<br/><br/>Craig's third outing really nails the character, based particularly on Fleming's last two novels - You Only Live Twice and The Man with the Golden Gun. It is refreshing to see Bond lose his fitness and sharpness, to see him more vulnerable and human, see him make mistakes.<br/><br/>There are some beautifully shot moments, but what else would you expect from Mendes and co. There are also a few shocks, and a few crowd-pleasing moments too, particularly the return of the Aston Martin DB5, which was received with a huge round of applause from the audience.<br/><br/>The last few minutes of the film will put one huge smile on your face, and leave you with a feel-good-factor wanting more.<br/><br/>In many ways Skyfall reboots the franchise in a more definitive way than Casino Royale before it did. This is a true Bond classic, with all the traditional element back in place, only used more carefully and subtle, with taste and dignity. Fleming moments are also littered throughout, resulting in a movie EON have tried desperately to achieve in the past 50 years - a combination of cinematic Bond and Fleming Bond that would actually work in one film, and not create a feeling of disjointed confusion - not knowing whether to be funny or serious, OTT or realistic. This was the fault with many of the Moore and Brosnan flicks.<br/><br/>Undisputed classic, Craig's best Bond yet, and probably the best film in the entire franchise. This will set the standard for all future films to beat - and not just Bond.<br/><br/>I wouldn't at all be surprised if Skyfall is nominated for quite a few of the big Oscars next year, such is the quality of this brilliant film."

","Who knew that bringing Sam Mendes on board to direct the 23rd James Bond film would result in the best James Bond film ever. Don't get me wrong but even though I like Sam Mendes, I wouldn't think he would be cut out for a Bond film. Well, this film feels like a classic Bond film with some modern updates attached to it. People says this feels like a Bourne film, and in a good way it does. This film is action-packed, has a great theme song(I usually hate Adele's songs), wonderful acting, a great score, and superb visuals.<br/><br/>Mendes's film has Daniel Craig returning for his third adventure as James Bond. MI5 has been infiltrated from within and it's up to Bond to single-handedly save his agency, career, and the career of M.<br/><br/>As usual, Daniel Craig kicks mighty ass as Bond. We see him getting older but of course, he knows it. I like his wisecracks about his age. Judi Dench plays a bigger role this time around and is superb. She should have been nominated for an Oscar. Javier Bardem, just like in No Country For Old Men, does very well as the psychopath villain. Ralph Fiennes is a welcome addition to the cast and supplements Dench very well.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an amazing Bond film and I'm proud to say it's the best of the series. It's a classic Bond in a modern world and it brings that feeling to life. There is lots of action here and it has some amazing set pieces. With the addition of Mendes, he brought some character building here and because of that, we care more about the characters. If you're looking for action, cars, and girls, they are all here. I rate this film 10/10."

"jimjo1216","Null","2","12","5 December 2012"," Reboot complete: Bring on more Bond!
","Sam Mendes's SKYFALL (2012) seeks to answer the question, ""Is there any place for James Bond in today's world?"" The plot addresses this issue head-on, and in so doing the film proves that there's still room in modern cinema for the British super spy.<br/><br/>The film is the twenty-third in the popular franchise, and third since the series was rebooted with Daniel Craig as 007. Its release in 2012 also marks the 50th anniversary of the film franchise. Today's James Bond has been updated from the character's Cold War roots, but SKYFALL pays tribute to the Bond legacy. Bondophiles will spot several references to the previous films, but it's not like the 40th anniversary (and twentieth film) extravaganza of DIE ANOTHER DAY (2002). We do get to spend time with our favorite Aston Martin.<br/><br/>The pre-credits chase is classic James Bond excitement and sets the plot in motion. Oscar-winner Javier Bardem plays the eccentric Bond villain. A former secret agent with a mane of blond hair, he's a computer hacking genius (finding the physicality of spy work too exhausting). He seeks a sort of revenge against M (Judi Dench) and MI6. British Intelligence is crippled and 007 is off his game. But in a world where spies are deemed old-fashioned, Bond is the only one who can save the day.<br/><br/>Naomie Harris plays a fellow agent who has a nice rapport with Craig's Bond. Ralph Fiennes joins the franchise as an authority figure at MI6. His performance hearkens back to Bernard Lee in the original Bonds. Bérénice Lim Marlohe plays an exotic woman of mystery. She makes for a beautiful Bond Girl, and it's a shame she doesn't have more screen time.<br/><br/>As with every Bond film, SKYFALL takes viewers to exciting and exotic locations. The action takes us from busy Turkish streets to Shanghai by night to the foggy highlands of Scotland and even to the tunnels of the London Underground.<br/><br/>The opening chase scene is great and the action also includes a cool nighttime fight in silhouette, a ""Home Alone"" booby-trapping montage, and a Komodo dragon pit. Bond also finds ways to ride an elevator and catch a subway train as only a secret agent can. Bardem's character is a little quirky and his ominous arrival at the climax is accompanied by an old rock 'n' roll song, an interesting in-story choice.<br/><br/>Mendes does things with the James Bond character we don't often see. Bond is vulnerable and, as we learn, less than bulletproof. Bond is confronted with age and the changing times. Fiennes's character considers Bond over-the-hill and washed up. We also learn a little about Bond's past. His childhood. Not too much, but more than has ever been hinted before. Albert Finney plays a character from Bond's youth.<br/><br/>Like other Bond films, the title (""Skyfall"") sounds much cooler than its actual significance. Adele's theme song, though, is an instant classic and the title sequence suitably trippy. Adele's song is catchy and perfectly sets the tone. The theme is incorporated seamlessly into the film's Bondian musical score.<br/><br/>The James Bond franchise has been rebooting itself since CASINO ROYALE (2006), when Bond first gets the job. In SKYFALL the final pieces fall into place, including the introduction of the modern tech-savvy head of Q Branch (Ben Whishaw). With the Bond supporting cast finally coming into the picture, the updated series is ready to roll. SKYFALL feels like the end of the beginning. It clears away the clutter and sets the pieces up for the *real* adventures yet to come. The final scene is great and will leave viewers thirsty for BOND 24.<br/><br/>With SKYFALL Sam Mendes takes James Bond, a relic of another era, and makes him relevant and new. He proves that there is a place for super spies in the modern world and the modern cinema. SKYFALL puts the new Bond universe on a firm footing and sets the table for a promising series of new adventures."
"keegan72","10","2","12","2 December 2012"," I feel bad for the casual viewers
","I personally think this movie got a bad rap. Sure all the film critics loved it but for the casual viewer i'm afraid you might not like it which is wrong.<br/><br/>I talked to a lot of people who said they weren't a fan of the new bond movie which i think is terrible because Skyfall is an almost perfect movie. I won't say anything about the plot but the director Sam Mendes did a magnificent job, it looked beautiful and it was magnificently paced. Most people might call it boring because all they need is Michael Bay explosions but it was a great story that had me glued to the screen from start to finish, for a nearly 3 hour movie i wanted more. The smart introduction of Q and Moneypenny into the series plus the new M was wonderfully well done and i hope to see them in all the new entries into the series. <br/><br/>There is too much to say about this masterpiece. The only thing they could have added to make this a 10 out of 10 would be the famous Shaken not stirred line but i fear it would let the movie down a bit after the last two movies without it. And it would also be nice to see the gun shot at the start next time but if they plan on putting it at the end from now on that would be fine just don't get rid of it, all bond fans know the importance of that tradition. <br/><br/>A word of caution to any casual viewers, please don't go into the movie with a casual mentality as you really must watch it closely to fully appreciate the amazing movie that is...

"michinine","8","2","12","28 November 2012"," The franchise lives
","I only review movies that had some sort of effect on me. This movie did.<br/><br/>James Bond is back, and, instead letting Daniel Craig hunting the gang from the last flicks in another action firework, he hunts ghosts from the past: his. And ""M""s.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes was a slightly controversial selection. MGM had no choice. They had to deliver something fresh to the table of modern agent flicks.<br/><br/>He did more than service to the franchise. Brilliantly shot, in much ""closer"" view then any of the films before. He showed depth, he delivered a more human Bond, who is showing his age - and the knowledge, that there is no simple exit plan for people like him. With the sharp writing of Purvis and Wade, this movie adds another layer to the question: why is 007 needed? Why does he exists? And who controls the chessboard with pawns like him? Is there even a political context? Some of these questions are answered, but it opens a box of new questions even someone like James Bond can't run away from.<br/><br/>This brings us to the 'insanity' that is played by Javier Bardem. What ever people thought about him, this is ""his"" Dark Knight moment. Like Ledgers legendary Joker, he breathes Silva, the ghost from the past, a worthy adversary. Not because another doomsday-device, but because he knows Bonds fears. Because Money, Guns, Computers, People...are only tools in his lunacy, in his quest to make everybody ""understand"" what he has to say.<br/><br/>Some shots with him are pure cinematic gold, comical, frighting, absurd. He is even channeling some of Bonds old adversaries like Scaramanga or Max Zorin. Mendes gives the actors room to breathe and reaps the benefits ten times.<br/><br/>People will continue to talk about this movie for ages. Everybody was stunned by the performance. When I left the cinema, many popcorn bags were left, half full. There was something else to do. Experiencing a well refreshed franchise, with a old Bond with lots of new wounds. <br/><br/>Who still has a job to do. And one or two stories to tell. My best movie of 2012."

","Daniel Craigs third time playing James Bond OO7, In this straight laced action spy thriller, that never tries to be cartooning has some of the other ones. The action scenes are pretty memorable, nothing too over the top, but in a realistic way, it also has some great suspenseful scenes too. Judi Dench a M, has more too play on, then just being an angry boss.<br/><br/>It's been fifty years since James Bonds first film appearance in Dr.No(1962), so this film does pay homage to other Bond films of the past, but a little more suttle than Die Another Day(2002) did. Ben Whishaw is memorable as Q. I will long to see who could be as good has Daniel Craig?"

","It's been a while since I've went to a movie with sky high expectations and the movie met and exceeded every single one. That's exactly what this movie did. The opening sequence was great, followed with great visuals accompanied by an amazing theme song by Adele. Within those short 20 minutes I already knew I was in for a treat. Don't let the long run time fool you, the pacing of this movie is well done and I didn't find myself wondering off during any parts of the movie there was always something that kept the interest there and left me fully engaged. Which brings me to the story which I found to be one of the best executed stories in a bond film. Some may say it has been done before, but believe me it hasn't been done like this, there was an added sense of urgency that made every scene seem that much more important and I have to say the last 30 to 40 minutes of this film were extremely tense more so than I've ever seen in a bond movie.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything, but I want to say GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It is great for old and new bond fans. I personally believe it is the best bond to date and in 10 to 20 years will be looked back on as the best bond movie."
"ciara-b","4","2","12","2 November 2012"," Watchable but disappointing
","This was the first James Bond Movie I had ever watched and was bitterly disappointed. I have never read a James Bond book before so was not previously acquainted with the characters and style of the whole franchise but I found the movie to be lacking in any desirable plot. This therefore made the whole movie slightly tedious to follow as the story was so basic. <br/><br/>Although the actors were competent especially Bardem and Harris apart from the character of Silva all the other characters seemed very two dimensional and dull. The Bond character was especially unappealing as he lacked any personality or interesting quirks, his script was very flat and he didn't act like a 'Gentleman'. The most unnecessary moment in the whole movie was near the end when Bond kills Silva. I was expecting to be pleased that 'good defeated evil' and I thought I should have respect or even pride for Bond but none such emotions were felt. Instead there was simply the unnecessary and immature remark made by Bond when he said ""last rat standing."" I literally retched when he said that! He has just murdered a man who has an obvious reason to be mad after being left to be tortured for six months and M refused to help him and rather Bond showing any remorse or respect for a former ally he does the un-chivalrous by sarcastically insulting the man in his dying moments.<br/><br/>As with a surprisingly high amount of movies my interest ended up with the antagonist Silva played by Bardem. He was the only character with any back story, character flaws, quirks and brains and for someone who had never been immersed into the wold of James Bond before I found myself almost forcibly latching onto the villain! which I'm sure wasn't the intent of the movie but never the less I found more sympathy in this characters demise than I did with M.<br/><br/>This movie is rated OK in my opinion. The plot was basic and therefore a struggle to follow and all characters lacking in any emotion or personality. However the character of Silva should be commended and makes the movie somewhat watchable."

","This is by far the best 007 film I have watched, including the films since Sean Connery and Roger Moore. Skyfall showed that it would not be just one more already in the opening scene and initial credits. Afterwards, with the very best script and a competent direction it did achieve a higher level probably no James Bond movie ever reached. It is much deeper than all of them, previous or tepid Spectre. Bond and M's lives and relationship are dealt in a more mature and complex way 8n Skyfall than we are accostumed to in 007 franchise. Besides that, action scenes, original Adèle's song and locations are breathtaking. The villain portrayed by Bardem is also the best nemesis for James Bond ever. To resume, Skyfall was able to, being a much deeper and seriously developped movie, be true to the character and to the franchise, in many elements present in the story until the end."

","'Skyfall' is superb.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig continues to shine as Bond, giving one of his best performances in the role here. He isn't my favourite James Bond lead, that doesn't mean he is anything less than impressive though.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is this film's main villain. I love what he brings to the table, he is outstanding as Silva. Naomie Harris is a welcomed addition, I would've liked to have seen her given more screen time in truth. Small shoutout to Ben Whishaw also, he makes for a very good Q.<br/><br/>In terms of the plot, I think it is one of the best from the series so far. Although, I will say it wraps up pretty surprisingly - given what the entirety of the film spends doing beforehand. I still enjoyed it, mind.<br/><br/>Not as terrific as Craig's debut in 'Casino Royale' or two other Bond productions, but this makes the upper echelons of my 007 ranking."
"sterlinrivera-2000","10","1","4","10 February 2020"," A Bond-tastic Masterpiece
","Skyfall is easily the best Bond film with Daniel Craig, and is easily in the Top 5 best Bond films. It was incredibly impressive, well made, and satisfying to the max.<br/><br/>Skyfall is about James Bond (Daniel Craig) has an assignment that backfires, and undercover agents are getting exposed around the world, which leads the head of MI6 and Bond's superior, M (Judi Dench) to relocate the agency, and gets Bond to help her. Bond, now aided with a field agent, Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), has to protect M as a man from her past, Silvia (Javier Bardem) wants to asassinate her. Bond must to everything in his power to not only save M, but save MI6 once and for all.<br/><br/>Skyfall was incredibly excellent. It had such amazing action, which I felt was the best thing about the whole movie. It was well put out and made with great satisfaction.
The story is really good. At first, you'd think it might suck because (SPOILER) Bond gets shot and falls off a train in the beginning but manages to come back three months later after he retired, and save the day.
The acting from everyone was magnificent. Daniel Craig still has it in him to be a capable Bond, Naomie Harris was great as the Bond girl, Javier Bardem was a pretty good villan, and I liked how Judi Dench gets the most screentime and is a focus in this one. She's been in the Bond films since GoldenEye, and she did really good in this one.<br/><br/>Overall, Skyfall is what I consider to be outrageously awesome."

"paulclaassen","8","1","4","23 December 2018"," The Best Bond film by far!!
","Having putting off watching this for so long, I can't stress enough how impressed I am with this installment in the James Bond franchise. Daniel Craig lends a humanity to the character no other actor has been able to do. The wittiness of notably Sean Connery and Roger Moore made way for a much more serious approach to the character. (Note that Connery and Moore were very good being witty and I'm not criticizing them. I just enjoyed the seriousness more).<br/><br/>This is an incredibly classy action thriller with great cinematography. The film has some impressive action scenes, and great dialogue, too. Yes, there are the cliches of fleeing on the rooftops and fighting on a moving train, but this film takes it a few notches higher). I did find the film's running time unnecessarily long with some scenes dragging the film down. Cutting some of these scenes would drastically have improved the pacing. The film features some amazingly stunning visuals not seen before in any Bond film.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem was exceptionally good as the antagonist, probably the most charming and different Bond villain yet. It was quite refreshing , actually. Judi Dench was very good as always, and Daniel Craig is just so damn SEXY it was an utter delight watching him. Daniel has a great body and they find perfect excuses to utilize this. I'm certainly not complaining.<br/><br/>The last half of the film was almost too good to be a James Bond film. It was filled with more depth and emotion than any previous (Bond) film, and was actually quite suspenseful. The visuals during the Skyfall raid scenes are STUNNING!!! This is by far the best and most enjoyable 007 film yet! The film bears none of the trademarks of the previous films - Bond didn't even have a Martini!!<br/><br/>'Skyfall' won 2 Oscars, with another 65 wins and further 120 nominations, which I believe to be the most awarded James Bond film ever. Well done, Sam Mendes!!"

Anyone ofcourse can enjoy this ""special Bond edition"", but this edition is very dear to me, because for the first time acting in a Bond movie is taking seriously and the terrific acting performances by Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney are to be thanked for that. Topped of with the brilliant direction by Sam Mendes. This is seriously something else in the James Bond genre, quality wise speaking.<br/><br/>This Bond really went out of its way to make it something really special: it is RAW and REAL. And it has got story twists never seen before in any Bond, in all of its history. Really, all cliches went out of the window and everything was up for grabs. Young viewers wont notice these sublte differences ofcourse, but for all those adults (40+) who have been watching Bond since the sixties or seventies, this edition is really unique and special, storywise. Doesnt mean you like it, maybe you will even NOT like it for the same reasons I DO like it, but I only wanna applaud that this edition is SPECIAL.<br/><br/>This Bond has got a feel to it none of all the other modern Bond editions have had. It was made in the spirit that it could have been the last Bond ever made. It wasnt the last though, but it was one of the very best, if not the best modern Bond ever! That's just my humble opinion though, who isnt a Bond movie fan by the way. So my opinion could easily clash with all the regular fans. This review is mainly written for all those who would never consider watching such a commercially bland Hollywood procuct.

"willcundallreview","8","1","4","2 January 2015"," Bond is back in complete style
","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>Skyfall is Bond movie that not only boasts fantastic action and adventure, but some thoroughly great acting as well. With explosions galore and a plot also deeply explored within, you can't help feel after watching why critics so loved this movie. It could be said it is slightly overrated but I'll get to that, It was firmly an impressive film and here below is why.<br/><br/>The story is big, and by that I mean epic with it's more exciting scenes merging well with the more dramatic scenes to create one film that not only epitomises Bond but also the entire spy genre thriller. It really does start to get fast toward the end and any resentment against the film for being too slow at the start need only be temporary as James really kicks into action and manages to also not go over the top on the 50 year anniversary clichés.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig performs well yet again as Bond and although in Quantum his performance was overshadowed by a negative reviewed film, he really brings a much more dark yet emotional portrayal of Bond, far beyond just the cars and guns. What can I say about Javier Bardem other than that man runs this film, his portrayal of Silva is one of the best among Bond characters and he beautifully masters the role that only someone like him can. Cast members such as Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes and Naomie Harris bring this movie to be one the best acted ever in the franchise and all credit to the producers.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes directs well yet it can slightly seem like he does slow it down just a little when it ought not to, no real complaint though as he does a great job in the end. The writers really excel here and Neil Purvis, Robert Wade etc do a job that is not easy, make Bond actually smartly written. The cinematography and the stunts are beautifully done and they all really come together including the effects to make one memorably looking Bond film, just adds to the excitement.<br/><br/>My critical eye you may think would be over my perceived slow start to the movie but in truth the only criticism I can think of is slightly well, silly parts. There are scenes which just don't need to be done and add too much extra time to the movie, I think they wanted an all round blockbuster but some parts make it seem like a slow moving drama film, manages to just wriggle out by the end.<br/><br/>If you love Bond then this won't go a miss, it stacks up completely to the very best and should really please anyone who enjoys Bond or even dislikes Craig. I think if you are looking for action after action then this probably isn't exactly for you as it just doesn't contain that and although some parts can seem slightly like that, it still has that dramatic edge that some movies really seem to lack.<br/><br/>Overall a fine movie and for me ranks right at the top near abouts in a Bond ranking list. Celebrate Bond and this should be looked back on just as we look back on Goldfinger which Is usually considered the very best. I will also add that if you want to see an acting ensemble do well then look no further than this one, just magnificent and a truly remarkable set of cast."
"disinterested_spectator","6","1","4","22 November 2014"," Man Versus the Gadgets
","You know there are too many gadgets in our lives when even James Bond is sick of them, for this movie expresses an unconscious revulsion against the very gadgetry in which this franchise once gloried.<br/><br/>The first James Bond movie, ""Dr. No"" (1962), had no gadget. In that film, a man from Q-branch gives Bond a Walther PPK, to replace the Beretta, which the man dismisses as being fine for a lady's handbag. It would not be until ""From Russia with Love"" (1963) that Bond would get his first gadget from Q, a black briefcase, with all sorts of nifty stuff in it. But the die was really cast in ""Goldfinger"" (1964), when Bond was given an Aston Martin, with machine guns, an ejection-seat, and I forget what all else. After that, no Bond movie was complete until Q performed the ritual of giving Bond his gadget. Like technology itself, it had acquired a life of its own. But in ""Skyfall,"" Q gives Bond another Walther PPK, to replace the one he lost, thereby bringing us full circle, back to that first movie, when all a spy really needed was a gun.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Bond chasing a bad guy. The bad guy has stolen an important hard drive, and Bond is getting lots of assistance from a technological control center. This is just to get us in the mood, to remind us of the technology that now saturates our lives. Then Bond is shot and falls to his death, which may be inferred from the fact that the movie just leaves Bond suspended below the water, unconscious. We never see him coming to and swimming to the surface, or being rescued by some bikini-clad Bond girl, as would usually be the case. The rest of the movie is Bond's hallucinatory fantasy in the final moments of his life, where he dreams of a return to a simpler world. This is suggested by the theme song, which has the lyrics, ""For this is the end / I've drowned and dreamt this moment.""<br/><br/>When we next see Bond, he seems to be in some tropical paradise, safe from the world of gadgets. But he realizes it is not enough to hide from those gadgets. He must return to London and stamp them out. It is after he gets back that he has the encounter with Q. When Q gives Bond the Walther PPK, plus a routine tracking device that is really no big deal, Bond seems surprised. Q asks him if he was expecting an exploding pen, and then notes derisively that they don't do that anymore. Well, thank goodness for that. It's not just that we are tired of that cliché. In a world full of gadgets, what could Q have possibly given Bond that would have stood out from all the technological clutter that now constitutes just so much background scenery?<br/><br/>Later in the movie, there is a parliamentary inquiry, at which M is the key witness. The argument being made by one of the ministers is that we don't need secret agents anymore, because now we have technology. Just then, the bad guys burst in the door and begin shooting up the place, almost killing the contemptuous MP, until that obsolete secret agent James Bond shows up to save the day. Looks like that parliamentary inquiry is over.<br/><br/>MI6 had by this time already retreated underground in an effort to be technologically inaccessible, but now Bond decides to go all the way, and retreat to his childhood home in Scotland. Ultimately, this expresses a desire to return to the safety of his mother's womb, where not even an ultrasound can get to him. But first, he goes to a secret garage, where he and M get in the old Aston Martin of ""Goldfinger"" days, because that way they cannot be tracked. But then he arranges things with Q so that he can be tracked. Well, how much logic do you expect in a man's hallucinatory dream? Besides, it's just another expression of his ambivalence to technology. In order for Bond's plan to work, he needs the very technology he is fleeing from. Later, we find out the real reason for his bringing the Aston Martin. It's so the dang thing can finally be destroyed. In this way, Bond avenges himself on the gadget that really started it all.<br/><br/>When Bond and M get to the house, they encounter the gamekeeper, from whom we learn that Bond has been an orphan since childhood, and he is thus incapable of having the maternal protection that he unconsciously seeks. In fact, the situation is reversed. M becomes his mother-substitute, and he must protect her, instead of the other way around. In any event, the house has not changed in all these years. Bond, M, and the gamekeeper lay their weapons on the table. Aside from Bond's pistol, there is an old rifle, a shotgun, and a knife, the most primitive weapon of the bunch. Right then, we know that it will be the knife that kills the villain, a slap in the face to all the gadgetry Bond has had to endure for fifty years now.<br/><br/>When M, his mother-substitute, dies, Bond realizes that he will never be able to escape from this gadget-saturated world, that there is no going back to those days of innocence, when you could go a whole week without someone inventing something. The movie should have ended with M dying in his arms, as Bond's dream comes to an end, and death, not his mother, embraces him, giving him the sanctuary of the grave.<br/><br/>Instead, the final scenes, which are not part of his dream, are merely a device to suggest that there will be more Bond movies to come. I suspect that in the next one, Q will be back with a real gadget again. There is just no getting away from them."

","Although I did not like the storyline personally as it was over sentimental and too personal for professional characters like M, Bond and Silva but no shame in admitting that giving the driver seat to Oscar winning director Same Mendes did wonders to this already cult bond franchise. He took the cheesiness out, made you root for the characters, gave back story to central characters, provided the uneasy darkness and all this is done with lots of conventional bond style and technical excellence. All conversations are so delicious that you want to hear them again and again. Daniel Craig in his third outing as James Bond never misses a beat and his scorching screen presence is worth of your ticket money. Javier Bradem as lunatic bad guy is a treat to watch as usual (Remember No Country For Old Men). Bringing Ralph Fiennes adds the extra intensity and hopefulness for upcoming bond outings. Even with average storyline and bond not actually going for some big threat to world, this Skyfall takes bond legacy to sky high."
"Lejink","6","1","4","15 October 2013"," Future to the back
","After the soulless mess that was ""Quantum of Solace"", it was important that James Bond's next outing get the franchise back on track and to a degree ""Skyfall"" does that. Much more like ""Casino Royale"" which was Daniel Craig's first outing as 007, here again we see greater concentration on character, with Bond entering the post-modern era with questions over his fallibility, age and even childhood brought to the fore. Again, the use of established 007 motifs like glamorous Bond girls and weapons gimmickry are largely curtailed indeed the most prominent female relationship James enjoys here is with his boss M, played by Judi Dench. Personally, I've been critical of this development so that I'm not unhappy with the outcome at the end of this movie, where hopefully we can see Bond move on with a bit less emotional baggage, taking on megalomaniac would-be world conquerors once again, I hope!<br/><br/>It all starts encouragingly enough with a thrilling chase on motorbike, car and train, introducing the rather simple plot line of a disgruntled former MI6 operative's grand revenge scheme against M but of course this doesn't prevent the use of glamorous locations like Shanghai and Istanbul as well as more down-to-earth locales like central London and the Scottish Highlands. There's intrigue initially as we're made to wait for Bond to reappear from his apparently certain death (how he does so isn't explained, just assumed) while MI6's computer security is hacked by M's pursuer, which brings Bond and his boss into a proximity that lasts the whole of the film.<br/><br/>Underlying the main story is the sub-text of Bond's personal struggle to stay relevant and competitive in his field, but this is overplayed when he rendezvous with a new, younger, geeky Q at the National Gallery in front of Turner's symbolic (for Bond) ""The Fighting Temerare"". I didn't like this new Q, a sop to younger viewers and also didn't like Albert Finney as Bond's old ghillie in the Highlands, with old Albert not even attempting a native Scottish accent.<br/><br/>The film rumbles on with an attempt on M's life at Parliament, with tasty nostalgic morsels thrown at older fans to keep us interested, like the beautiful old silver Aston Martin, complete with ejector seat and his favourite drink wordlessly inserted into the piece. However the linking between the action scenes isn't always engaging and besides, Javier Barden looks more like a demented Boris Johnston than the psychotic mastermind he's meant to be and I also can't think why Moneypenny has to be black either.<br/><br/>The movie's certainly an improvement on ""Quantum"" but could have done with sharper editing and a clearer focus on what kind of Bond film it wanted to be. A bit like James himself, the film has a bit of an identity crisis, but just about recovers itself in time, leaving hope that his next outing will be better again."
"jftomhawaii","9","1","4","17 August 2013"," The Age of a Blonde Bond
","I remember fondly staring at the picture of Daniel Craig, a day or so after the announcement was made that he was cast as the next Bond. As a 90s kid, I grew up only knowing the suave and charming Pierce Brosnan Bond, and in all fairness Craig carried a different atmosphere to him. He seemed to have an edge; his smile didn't make a girl melt, but made her wonder who he was and what he was doing. He seemed more like a brainless, tough-guy henchman with no brain than a international super spy who took his martinis in a ""refined"" fashion. I concluded that he could have been a good Jason Bourne, but not a James Bond.<br/><br/>Perhaps I was a little cruel to Daniel Craig. My expectations followed a narrow corridor of Bond-logic that I've grown accustomed to during my childhood. There was Pierce Brosnan; bedding women and groaning like a strong-man competitor pulling a bus fifty meters uphill. Craig would inevitably not be the Pierce Brosnan Bond. He would not be the slightly timid Roger Moore or the (then) male sex symbol Sean Connery. He would most resemble the hot-headed, mean-streaking Timothy Dalton, but that doesn't do justice to the amazing transformation the last three Bond films have given to a once dying franchise carried by Craig.<br/><br/>Craig has brought his own Bond to the mix. A vulnerable Bond; one who has lost his step and has the vices that many men like myself have. He's loved; he's lost. Besides Craig's horrible, somewhat forced chemistry with Naomi Harris in this movie, he has shown sides of Bond that younger fans may have never seen before. It was a thrill to watch the man I once so revered as being a statue in the face of danger to be broken down. Sometimes it is good to go back to the origins of a character and explore them deeper. Skyfall did all of it successfully. No invisible cars, jetpacks, laser battles in space or bolos that can snap a man's neck. Just Bond, in the flesh, with the ever vigilant M and MI6 at his side (sort of). It did stroke the fanboy ego to some extent, and I commend it for that. Nothing wrong with a little Aston Martin coming to the party, especially since Bond seemed to have no particular choice in car the last two movies.<br/><br/>There are the characteristic plot holes, and I was not a huge fan of the mental breakdown of Javier Bardem near the end (it was just confusing and seemed to contradict his former, very manipulative personality even if he was ""unstable"") so it's not the perfect movie. But for the Bond fan who has been waiting for years to see a worthy addition to the Bondverse, the wait is over."

","I loved Casino Royal. After the folly of Brosnan's Die Another Day, the series received a much needed kick up the backside, and was relaunched with a gritty, stylish take on Her Majesties Secret Servant.<br/><br/>Quantum of Solace, while not terrible, didn't quite hit the same highs (something to do with a writers strike(?)) So, like any Bond tragic, I desperately wanted this instalment to live up to (or at least approach) my very high expectations. And for the first hour or so, things were looking pretty good. We had the obligatory pre-credits chase sequence, a killer title track, a brief lull while 007 recuperates at the bottom of a bottle of Vodka, the pre mission briefing, and then the introduction of a suitably colourful villain.<br/><br/>And then Q turns up. Now let me just say that Desmond Llewellyn's character was one of the most iconic and endearing figures in movie history....but since the 'geek with gadgets' device has more recently been hijacked by numerous other action movies (Mission Impossible, XXX, Van Helsing to name just a few), I thought maybe Bond had outgrown this character.<br/><br/>To the movies credit, the new Q is low-key and edgy: ""Exploding pens? We don't really go in for that sort of thing any more"". The fact that he is now the irreverent youngster, and Bond the world-weary cynic is also a refreshing change, and the repartee between the two is far better than anything we saw from the Brosnan movies.<br/><br/>Enter the Aston Martin. OK, so in Casino Royal we learned that he won this in a game of chance, and I thought it was a nice touch that, instead of simply discarding it (as seems to be the way with most of the Bond's stuff), he went to the trouble of bringing it back to the UK and putting it in a lock-up garage. A respectful tip-of-the-hat to the old movies.<br/><br/>BUT WAIT.....What's that? A secret button on the top of the gearstick? Oh dear, what started as a tasteful homage to a bygone era is starting to feel like something a lot less subtle. <br/><br/>And suddenly, this Bond movie did't feel like a Bond movie any more, as it descended into an overly drawn out set piece, with 007 and his old game keeper deciding the best way to protect the head of the British Intelligence service is to hide out in a remote homestead, with little ammunition and no support.<br/><br/>And just when I felt I could suspend my disbelief no further, one of my most cherished film-going memories was raped as the Aston Martin was revealed to be (inexplicably) decked out with machine guns! WHY??? Of course we all know what happened in Goldfinger, but in the context of THIS Bond story arc, IT MADE NO DAMNED SENSE! They may as well have had the shimmering figures of Connery, Moore & Lazenby appear as ghosts, and come to the aid of Craig in his darkest hour. <br/><br/>I really thought that Casino Royale represented a new beginning for 007, and we would see them take the series in a fresh and exciting direction. But by the end of Skyfall it was painfully clear that the producers had got cold feet. The movie ends with the instatement of the 'new' (male) M, and in the words of Roger Waters, ""Isn't this where we came in?"" Next stop: a full remake of Goldfinger."

Overall, The Movie seems to be very entertaining, if you don't give importance to certain details.<br/><br/>Bond gets shot twice, considering it wasn't on the right spot, how did he survive such a fatal fall when he was supposedly unconscious ?<br/><br/>When he does come back to London, how does he get far worse than a newly assigned field agent at the work he's been doing for years ?<br/><br/>Not to mention M's unfailing trust in Bond, after he had failed twice. M decides to let him back on active service though he fails to pass the tests. No wonder M was killed.<br/><br/>Then comes Silva. Suppose he is as powerful as they say he is, why did he have to run away from MI6. He could've finished the job right there.<br/><br/>Where was Q's radio when Silva arrived at Skyfall ? Did Bond think he had it under control ?<br/><br/>The time-line in Bond Movies has become vague. Lots of unanswered situations.<br/><br/>Great things in Skyfall :<br/><br/>The intro chase scene. <br/><br/>The CGI for the Theme Song. <br/><br/>The Theme Song. <br/><br/>The Bond Girl, however brief her appearance. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem's Acting.<br/><br/>M's Interrogation at the court. <br/><br/>The Aston Martin DB5. <br/><br/>The Scene with Ralph Fiennes as M.<br/><br/>Overall, The Movie didn't have the charm, humor, elegance and an undivided plot we expect from a Bond Movie."

But unfortunately I did not really sense the classic ""BOND"" element which one would really expect in a Bond movie. It's more of a character focused movie, venturing into some childhood details of Bond and the relationship with M. It didn't really show any cool Gadgets, and disappointingly, scenarios with the Bond girls were't sexy enough. The Music and technical details were superb. Great Direction. But in a Bond movie, we are used to see some fantasy dreamy silly stuff....i missed that. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is a fantastic action movie, I enjoyed it.

"davidjemitus","7","1","4","24 January 2013"," Too many plot holes
","This review is for people who have seen the film – not those deciding whether to go or not. OK, so my favourite recent Bond movie is Casino Royale - lots of action, great girls, gripping storyline and great performances. Skyfall takes Bond in a new direction and we should go with that. But it didn't work. Bond is made into a hopeless, weak shadow of his former self!<br/><br/>As a redemption movie maybe it could have worked, but Bond is all about style, taking on the bad guys, success against the odds and above all lots of action, girls, gadgets and fun. Skyfall does have some good action scenes – but that's all there is to commend it. I don't mind plot holes where the film is enjoyable enough to get over them, but this film left a nasty taste in the mouth. For example : 1. The bad guy goes to enormous effort to crash a tube train underground. WHY? The train is clearly empty (tube trains are never empty). A train full of injured people would slow down pursuers but an empty train – pointless. It's in the film just to appear in the trailer. 2. Q connects the bad guys computer onto the MI6 network. No IT worker in their right mind would connect a suspicious computer onto any network. Q is supposed to be the smartest person around –instead, he's mister thicko. 3. The bad guy escapes and Bond is in poor shape but he's the only person who chases after the bad guy. Why? What happened to everyone else who works for MI6? 4. Bond wants to protect M and catch the bad guys – so he takes her to a wilderness and has just a handgun for protection against a small army led by a genius. Bond's not just a has been – he's taken leave of his brains and so did the scriptwriter. I hope the next Bond film is a lot better and returns to the classy, dangerous spy thriller adventure we all expect."

","James Bond devotees will get their fix in this excitingly sculpted story that takes 007 to a new level. Following the shenanigans of James Bond movies has as part of its reward the opportunity to see some of Britain's finest actors with a smattering of other countries polished veterans as well. The usual Bond formula - absurdly impossible chases and fights, scenic splendor form around the globe, beautiful women in daring roles, and the blur between justice and revenge - are all present.<br/><br/>When James Bond (Daniel Craig, buff and strong as usual) mismanages his latest assignment in Turkey etc - the unsuccessful chase of Patrice (Ola Rapace) despite the very fine support of agent Eve (Naomie Harris) and the sidetrack of Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe), Britain's agents around the world are exposed and MI6 is attacked forcing M (Judi Dench) to relocate the agency. These events cause her authority and position to be challenged by Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the new Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee. With MI6 now compromised from both inside and out, M is left with one ally she can trust: Bond. With the aid of MI6 computer geek Q (Ben Wishaw) 007 takes to the shadows aided only by Eve and follows a bizarre set of clues to the secret island where the slimy Silva (a blond wigged Javier Bardem) is plotting his lethal and hidden motives that have yet to reveal themselves in the very place where Bond began - Skyfall, his Scottish home still managed by his old friend Kincade (Albert Finney). In perhaps the most spectacular (and loud) pyrotechnical exhibition of the Bond 23 films to date (more to come, we discover), the film simmers to an end.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes directs this very long but tensely exciting global travelogue of violence and Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan pepper the script with enough humor and clever lines to keep the audience entertained on a more cerebral level. The cast is uniform strong, with Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, and Judi Dench in full control of their lead responsibilities and supported by the fine acting of Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Ben Wishaw in the smaller roles. If you love James Bond You'll love this. Most critics are saying it is the finest of the Bond series...so where does it go from here? Grady Harp, January 13"
"kslay8713","7","1","4","19 January 2013"," A bit of a let down, but still entertaining
","Maybe it's just the greatness of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, but Skyfall is a tad of a let down, but yes, still entertaining. The films finer point is easily Bardem. He plays an incredibly villain, even being compared to Tom Hardy in Batman. His character is extremely dark and cerebral. He alone makes the movie worth checking out. <br/><br/>Overall though, the bad guy just can't pull the movie all together in one tight package. This film is easily the worst of the Craig films in the Bond series. I am a huge fan of Bond and especially the Daniel Craig way of playing him. <br/><br/>Don't think that because I'm saying it is the worst of the three, that it's not still a good movie. It's a decent movie and I will be adding it to my collection when it comes out on Blu Ray. Just make sure you go into the theater realizing what you are actually there to see. I do think this movie is worth 7 out of 10 stars and also feel that if you go in thinking the right thing, you will enjoy it!"
"osog2000","8","1","4","16 January 2013"," Not as good as Casino Royale
","Skyfall is a great movie because it has mystery, action and adventure, and it was filmed in beautiful cities such as Istanbul, London etc...<br/><br/>Daniel Craig's Bond has a wonderful mystery in this movie, for me Casino Royale is a better movie than Skyfall, but it has magnificent scenery and the action scenes had me on the edge of my seat. The opening scene has the greatest impact I have ever seen in a Bond movie. It was a great decision to use Adele for the theme tune.<br/><br/>The villain Javier Bardem has a spectacular character and for me he is the perfect enemy. The flashbacks to his childhood showed his weaknesses and why he became an angry and violent man. I strongly recommend you see this movie."

","First off, I would like to explain myself before people get angry. This was not the best Bond and this was not the worst bond. The movie had some good scenes, do not get me wrong. The thing that really made me dislike it was how it wasn't like the ""old-style"" Bond. He really didn't do anything that made me jump out of my seat.<br/><br/>Let's go to the opening scene where Bond was in the building trying to save his operative. No one wants that. If anything he could have made a better exit.<br/><br/>Now here are some things I liked. The villain was probably the best one out of all the bond movies. Furthermore, the abandoned city was also interesting. It is crazy how Bond gets out of that with not much trying involved. He makes it look easy, that is what I like about him.<br/><br/>To end on a good note, Quantum of Solace was definitely the worst and will always be the worst. Bottom line: Go see it because it is not a waste of money."

","A computer drive containing the information of MI6 Agents planted in terrorist organisations has been stolen and Bond is tasked with recovering it. While on the mission, Bond is severely wounded and presumed dead, until months later when he returns after learning that MI6 itself has become the target of a bomb attack. Bond forces himself to return to active duty only to discover that not only are his skills as an agent have been impaired, but that M's life is in danger.<br/><br/>It is both understandable though strangely perturbing that Skyfall is a standalone entry into the new era of Bond films. While continuity in the 007 history is all over the place, there is the situation that certain plot points, primarily that of the criminal organisation known as Quantum, should have surely been expanded upon. As it stands, there is little in reference to Bond's lover Vesper or Quantum, two important aspects in the shaping of James Bond (Daniel Craig) as a character, and it comes as a missed opportunity. Nevertheless, we are presented with a new villain, Silva (Javier Bardem), who has a a pretty hefty grudge against M (Judi Dench). Silva is definitely the most interesting Bond villain of recent years and is a highlight of the story, but his introduction comes a little later than expected but this is a minor issue. Skyfall's plot is an interesting one: what starts off as a hunt against a formidable villain turns into a retrospective of Bond. However, this latter point never feels fully developed, and can appear at times to be tacked on to further the length of the narrative.The integral point of interest in humanising Bond is his feeling of betrayal by M for her lack of confidence in him. And then it is over. Just like that. The development of Bond feeling jaded against is quelled as quickly as it arises. The strong emphasis on humanising Bond will either be interesting to you or distracting after how subtly this thematic element is convincingly explored in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. Nonetheless, it is the film's identity which is most at crisis. Skyfall constantly switches between passé and new-age 007 that it fails to find or even stick to an identity for the sake of consistency. Bond is more believable in the modern adaptation but the film expects the audience to accept its questionable narrative logic for the sake of plot advancement. In past Bond films this would not be a problem but following Casino Royale, where plot advancement made some semblance of sense, in Skyfall this comes across as overreaching. <br/><br/>Though there is no denying that the recent 007 films have all employed rather commendable performances from the entire cast, especially that of Daniel Craig who has provided a sense of concrete believability to the somewhat caricature nature of Bond. While Bond in Skyfall is much worse for wear than he has been, there is no denying that Craig does, at times, come off as far too stiff. This is a most noticeable when he has some quick words to spare upon someone, otherwise the forlorn act he presents can make you feel for him, though whether you choose to buy that is another matter. Judi Dench continues her stellar performance as M and its great to see how her role has matured from the Brosnan era to the Craig era, and with her added screen-time for Skyfall she definitely does not miss a beat. Rounding off the trio of important actors is Javier Bardem as Silva. Silva is a different type of villain compared to that seen in the previous two outings. He is one part happy-go-lucky, one part vindictive and all sociopath, but still you never quite feel as if you should be rooting against him. Bardem portrays a charm that really pushes his character to the forefront of almost every scene he is in, outpacing both Dench and Craig with little effort. It is a pity that his character does not appear more often in the plot. The rest of the cast are all noteworthy in their performances. Naomi Harris as the operative Eve, Ben Whishaw as the new Q and Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, Head of Intelligence and Security all do a great job.<br/><br/>A welcomed change from Casino Royale, as echoed with Quantum of Solace, is the move towards a more diverse array of action sequences, such as vehicle chases. What makes the action that more effective are the locales themselves. There is a distinctiveness to the likes of Istanbul Shanghai, Macau, Gunkanjima Island, among others, that provide each action sequence is distinct personality. This is only made better by the fact that there are some great locale shots outside of Bond doing what he does best.<br/><br/>As expected of a 007 film sexuality has its place but within moderation. Language usage is emphasised on the odd occasion while violence, in which there is quite a bit is never explicit.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a fun film to watch. There is nothing that can deny this. Good acting, an interesting plot, an interesting villain; good action sequences and some lovely cinematography have the making for a top notch film. However, as interesting as Skyfall is to follow, its narrative caves within itself at points. The strange turn to humanise Bond about two-thirds through seems at play against what came before, and this itself is heavily played to the point that Bond himself begins to lose much of the intrigue that makes him who he is. Additionally, some plot advancements, like Silva's plan, do not get the attention the audience deserves in terms of understanding how it ultimately works. And lastly there is the dual identities the film attempts to balance, but that never feels like it really comes off. Bond is still doing what he does to be the world's super spy icon, but sometimes, maybe the world is not enough."

","2012: Bond is back ... or not? Seeing this movie the first time I had high hopes for Skyfall. Me, being a huge bond-fan, hoped that this movie would be all about the action. However I should have known that director Mendes didn't want another Bond-movie, instead he wanted an Oscar-movie with a character named Bond. Does this mean that Skyfall failed: not at all. The strength of the movie is hidden in a little thing called nostalgia. <br/><br/>Director Mendes is able to combine the action of the older (brosnan en Dalton) Bond-movies with the brains of modern action-dramas. Skyfall is a more realistic Bond-movie than Moonraker, Die another day or even From Russia with love could ever be. Nevertheless Skyfall has a greater Bond-sphere (i.e. Sean Connery sphere) than both Quantum of solace and Casino Royale. <br/><br/>Bond-actor Daniel Craig is playing Bond for the third time and he is finally becoming one with his character. Despite the fact that his workout has undoubtedly had its results, it must be said that his aging hasn't gone very well. Nevertheless he once again given a splendid performance. <br/><br/>Than comes Javier Bardem, the appearance of his character made me think of Max Zorin (played by Christopher Walken in A view to a kill (1985) and just like Walken I expected him to be the better actor in this movie. Without wanting to spoil anything I can only say that the performance of Bardem immediately made me think of Heath Ledger (playing the Joker), with that little difference that Bardem failed in every way. Not only has he no credibility, also his manner of speaking is extremely annoying. <br/><br/>As for Action and special effects: despite the fact that most action (other than the opening sequence which is pretty amazing) is rather limited, is must be said that that limited action has been brought both beautiful and realistic.<br/><br/>In short Skyfall is a more realistic Bond movie, in which not the action of gadgets, but the story and its characters of most importance are. Despite the disappointing soundtrack you'll find Skyfall to be a very entertaining and bond-worthy movie."

","I did not fall in love as much with ""Skyfall"" as others did, but I still did bond with it enough to enjoy it. The latest James Bond chapter ""Skyfall"" brings back some of those momentous Bond features, and also for the first time examines his childhood. In ""Skyfall"", Bond's operative mission is the capture of a high-tech villain named Silva who has his sights on not only terrorizing the MI6 but also seeking vengeance against the captain of the MI6 ship, which of course is the one that sits between L and N; which would be M. Did you get my letters? Anyways, Silva does have a past with the MI6, which I won't share too much in order not to shake & stir this review with too many spoiler points. Silva is the 21st Century Villain, a techy madman who in just a stroke of a key can cause massive havoc. Director Sam Mendes does carry out his directorial operative mission well with the fast-paced action of ""Skyfall"", and its background checks on the pasts of Bond and even M. The three-headed Screenplay team of Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan did not shoot blanks with their scribe of ""Skyfall"". Daniel Craig is again proving to be a formidable James Bond, and was glad to see some of that sly Bond humor return with his ""Skyfall"" thespian effort. The great Judi Dench was marvelous as M. Javier Bardem's juicy bad-boy performance as Silva deserved every ""Silva"" dollar you paid to see it. Ralph Fiennes delivered another fine performance in his brilliant acting resume as M's superior Gareth Mallory. And we also had a young GQ I mean Q in the picture with Ben Whishaw's stellar work as that infamous MI6 gadget master. And there has to be a Bond girl mentioned here somewhere, so therefore I must state that Naomie Harris was money as agent Eve. Adele's ""Skyfall"" song is the best Bond tune in the last two decades. Even though ""Skyfall"" had all these positives, I do not think it was the best Bond film and still have more of a liking to ""Casino Royale"" in the ""Craig as Bond"" era of the franchise. Nevertheless, witnessing the ""Skyfall"" is still a mission that you should accept. **** Good"

With this third Daniel Craig Bond movie, Craig has still never appeared in a traditional series gun-barrel sequence shown at the start of the film. However, it was shown after the end credits conclusion. The loudest movie scenes was the London underground tube train crash that occurs when James Bond chases Raoul Silva. Several different locations in the city of London were used as interiors and exteriors for the film, some of which would not normally be accessible for filming. London locations: included Vauxhall Bridge; Millbank; The Old Vic Tunnels; an underground car park on Great Suffolk Street; Trinity Square; the entrance to Broadgate Tower; The Virgin Active Pool in Canary Wharf; Cadogan Square, The National Portrait Gallery; Parliament Square; Tower Hill; the building roof of the Department for Energy & Climate Change (DECC); the Smithfield Meat Market; St Bartholomew's Hospital; Charing Cross Underground Station; Greenwich's Old Royal Naval College; Southwark; Whitehall; and London's landmark Trafalgar Square. <br/><br/>*Emotion- This is a spectacularly beautiful and exciting film. The night establishing shots are breath-taking. This film clearly lives-up to and surpasses the high mark that previous Bond films established for decades. This film is a MUST SEE in a theater to get full effect, not just on a small TV monitor. You will lose some of the uniqueness on the small screen. To put the theme of this film's plot in one concise phrase, ""passing the torch- from the classic to the new'. In this film you see the 'old guard' actors playing their Bondian characters that they have for many films and this new 50th anniversary film plot establishes new actors to be in those iconic Bondian roles. There is a new Moneypenny, head of ""Q"" branch and a new MI6 leader ""M"". The film's villain is truly despicable and creepy, and well acted. Also we see homages to the classic Bond films cleverly embedded in this film and referred to in dialog or visually on screen during scenes, so watch for those. The Bond film franchise is re-charged and ready for 50 more years of excitement and success. God see this film even if you're not a Bond Fan, it's great cinema!"

","When a mysterious threat from the past hacks into the computers of the British Secret Service, superspy 007 must discover the intruder's identity and bring them to justice ...<br/><br/>On his third outing as James Bond, Craig finally scores big in a movie which is grandiose spectacular action entertainment all the way and the best film in the Bond franchise since the nineties. He was good in his first two flicks but they were both let down by lacklustre action and plotting. By contrast, this is extremely well directed by Mendes, with great set pieces (an eye-popping motorbikes / train chase opening, a fight in a sumptuous oriental casino complete with Komodo dragons, a suspenseful pursuit scene through the London Underground, an explosive firefight finale in a Gothic Scottish ancestral pile), a full-on raving loonytoon villain, liberal doses of good humour, gorgeous locations (Istanbul, Shanghai, Macau, Hashima, Glencoe) and a great storyline revolving around M which even manages to make some perceptive social comments about modern-day espionage. Perhaps the best thing is the cast; Craig's physicality and self-confidence are irresistible, Dench's dramatic chops carry the story, whilst Bardem is wonderfully mad, with crazy blonde hair, homoerotic tendencies towards Bond and Oedipal psychosis towards M. Newcomers Harris and Whishaw both judge their performances as the new Moneypenny and Q respectively just right, Finney has a nice bit as an old family retainer and even Fiennes is good (which is quite something, in my view). The film is full of nice bits of business for them all, be it Bond's comic asides (I love the ""Health and Safety"" moment), villain Silva's wonderful story of the rat infestation, or the delicious irony of M being reprimanded by a Parliamentary subcommittee which Silva proceeds to shoot up. There may be a few plot holes (it's best not to ask how Silva escapes from his MI6 lockdown) but they are few and far between and never detract from the enjoyment of the picture. Mendes has astutely assembled an ultra-talented crew to capture and enhance the action - cameraman Roger Deakins uses old school long shots and close-ups to fine effect, Dennis Gassner's sets are spectacular throughout (particularly Skyfall itself), composer Thomas Newman delineates the characters expertly with a splendid bombastic score and mixes in the traditional themes at all the key moments, uber-selling diva Adele contributes a fabulous title song and Daniel Kleinman puts the icing on the cake with his best opening credits sequence since Goldeneye. This is cracking good fun and the best Bond movie in ages - don't miss it."
"Theshapeo31","8","1","4","15 November 2012"," Overrated... But does me saying that mean its bad? Read to see
","I've been a fan of the James Bond franchise since I was 7 so 10 years I've been a fan with the first I've seen being Die Another Day (which ironically is one of the worst). When I heard about Skyfall this year in May, I couldn't wait for it and got excited to a new Bond movie on the big screen. However lately this movie has been getting a lot of praise as ""the best Bond movie ever"", 5 Star ratings & considering how bad the last Bond movie was (Quantum of Solace) I had high expectations.<br/><br/>After watching this movie opening weekend I confess myself to be disappointed. But with me saying that does it mean it's bad, not necessarily because most of the time that is the case but this is one of few exceptions. I do like this movie but it's overrated for all of the buzz it's been getting: Daniel Craig on Saturday Night Live, various T.V. Commercials, & 3 minute long trailers and disappointing because it's not the best Bond movie and doesn't live fully to expectations. I was ready to say this is the best Bond movie or in my Top 5 Bond movies but overall this scores 9th place. <br/><br/>The basic plot of the movie is James Bond after being accidentally shot by his partner is presumed dead but really he's been living on some undisclosed island for 3 months and has come back to help after seeing terrorist attacks on MI6 Headquarters. But at first he doesn't get to help because after being M.I.A. for 3 months he has to go through his tests again testing his stamina, accuracy, & physical strength which he fails scoring a 40. So th movie is focusing on James Bond having been out of action for 3 months: is he rusty? Can he still get the job done? Has he lost his touch? <br/><br/>Our Bond villain Roaul Silva (portrayed by Javier Bardem) isn't all really interesting, he has his cool moments every now and then but doesn't stand out as a Bond villain. Even when we learn who he is and his intentions (a former MI6 agent under M's command who was captured and tortured by the Chinese who wants revenge on M and his main goal is to kill her). Hes just one of the lesser villains he's no Dr. No, or Blofeld or Goldfinger. Also when we first meet him he comes off as a homosexual in a homo-erotic scene with Bond. <br/><br/>I said in the Beginning that this movie is overrated and it is, this isn't the best Bond movie ever Goldfinger still holds on to that honor and overall this is Daniel Craig's best performance as James Bond but this isn't a better Bond movie than Casino Royale but it's almost on Par with it. This movie does have its share or pros such as: the return of the Aston-Martin (the car from Goldfinger with machine guns on it), Javier Bardem's performance (while his character was bland and uninteresting he does a good job in the role). Also the story of Bond trying to get back into action is interesting but could've been executed and written better. But me saying this movie is overrated doesn't mean it's bad, it's a pretty good and fairly solid but in the James Bond franchise it takes the 9th best prize and overall is the 5th best movie I've seen this year and I'd rate this a 7.5 or at best an 8 or at least a 7. It's up to you whether you want to see it or not but I'll admit at some parts I was bored but overall it was worth the matinée price of admission I paid."
"Schnayblay","8","2","13","4 December 2012"," A Fantastic Milestone That Takes The Bond Series To Brave New Frontiers and Is Definitely One of the Best of them All
","I was hesitant about getting too excited about ""Skyfall"". I had gotten so hyped over ""Quantum of Solace"" before its release, and then been so disappointed, that I tried to ignore the buzz and wait to judge the film for myself. All I hoped was that ""Skyfall"" would either match or exceed ""Casino Royale"". I didn't see it opening night and all I heard was that critics loved the hell out of it and that it was being called ""The Best Bond Ever"". Does it deserve that graceful title though? <br/><br/>The film opens up with a chase scene. This opening really got mixed feelings from me. The chase was cool but at the same time I think it really lacked the punch that ""Casino Royale"" did. But this is where one of the main plot points stems from. Bond is accidentally shot by his fellow agent and is declared dead by MI6. He goes into exile for months and drinks his face off and slums into a pretty pathetic life. But when a bomb attack at MI6 reveals a conspiracy against M, Bond returns to London to protect his mentor and help find whoever is threatening her life. The initial premise of ""Skyfall"" is kind of boring, but it works perfectly because the film focuses on the themes that the story involves, and it seems like its natural and not just put in for character development.<br/><br/>And character development is one of the movie's strongest points. Daniel Craig returns in his third outing as Bond. For me, Daniel Craig defined the role as 007 in ""Casino Royale"", surpassing Sean Connery. He was cold, ruthless, and it took Vesper to show him love and that he could stop his job and live a normal life. When Vesper was killed though, he lost the reason to have that normal life and so went back to being cold and learnt to not trust anyone. I felt in ""Quantum of Solace"", nothing new was brought to Bond. However, in ""Skyfall"", Bond is taken to new levels that have never before been touched by the series. You can see when he's exiled that he doesn't enjoy it at all and he's living in his equivalent of hell. When you remember how he feels that he lost that chance at a normal life when Vesper died, it really makes sense why he's so unhappy with his existence and longs for his old life in the line of fire. When Bond comes back to MI6 though, he's lost his touch and can't even fire a gun properly. He feels old and out of date, not fitting in with the new world of technology. This is one of the main themes of ""Skyfall"". The whole film circles around Bond trying to reclaim his pride and prove himself again. This type of theme was touched upon in ""Die Another Day"", but here it's done with much more style and competence.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem plays Silva, the villain. His performance is mesmerizing; anytime he's on screen you can't your eyes off him. His entrance is probably done with the most class of any Bond villains in history. Silva is an ex-MI6 agent who was a favorite of M. However, Silva was captured on a mission in China and left to be tortured. Again, this is another type of theme that was touched on in ""Die Another Day"". After failing to kill himself with a cyanide tooth, Silva swore vengeance on M for leaving him to die. He's probably the best Bond villain in history, other than Ernst Stavro Blofeld. And while he longs to kill M, he still cares for her and is a great parallel to Bond.<br/><br/>Judi Dench returns as M. M had been a major character in the previous Craig films, but now she's finally given the spotlight she deserves. M feels responsible for the deaths of all the people who have gotten caught between her and Silva and turns to Bond to help her. Even when Bond fails his service test, she allows him to go and investigate because of the trust she has for him. There's a brilliant unspoken bond between James and M, and it's one of the best things the Craig films have had in them. However, their connection is explored much more in depth in ""Skyfall"" and brings them closer together than ever. Typically in Bond films, there's a girl that Bond needs to save and it usually goes that he ends up sleeping with her. The brilliant part in ""Skyfall"" is that M ends up being this film's Bond girl, but she breaks the mold so much because instead of being the typical damsel in distress, she's a strong, independent woman who can match Bond's cold heart and ruthless nature. It's less of a cliché ""love"" story and more a tale of friendship between mentor and student.<br/><br/>Ben Wishaw makes his debut as the new Q, taking over from John Cleese. He and Bond instantly form that close but whimsical relationship all us fans have grown to know and love. Q himself really adds to the theme of Bond feeling out of date. He's young and amazing with technology, clashing with the old-school intelligence and gunplay style Bond reflects. Ben Wishaw's performance is perfect. It's smooth and confident, and he doesn't seem pressured by the shoes he's filling at all. I'm highly looking forward to seeing him in future installments.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought ""Skyfall"" was amazing. I found the first half a little boring, but all together I thought the film was an amazing way to mark the 50 year mark for the franchise and it finally brought Bond to new levels that I had been waiting to see for years. I would definitely get this film for full price on Blu-Ray. It's worth every dollar and is a milestone for the franchise, and I can't wait to see where they take the series from here."
"acolu7","10","2","13","28 November 2012"," If not the best Bond film of all time, it's pretty damn close
","Skyfall is in my personal opinion, one of the greatest James Bond movies ever. I realize that what I have just said is a very huge statement to make, but Skyfall delivers so much on so many levels. Director Sam Mendes deserves a ton of credit. From the dialogue, to the cinematography, and amazing villain (portrayed brilliantly by Javier Bardem) it's hard to stop praising this movie. <br/><br/>For the first time ever we get to see a Bond who is actually pretty rusty. Due to the events in the beginning of the film, Bond is trying to get back into the field at MI6 and has to go go through testing (which turns out to be not as easy as it once was for him) Bond is aging and a bit weathered and this film clearly portrays that. <br/><br/>This however, by no means takes away from the elite killer and bad ass that he still clearly is. I felt that Daniel Craig stepped more into the character of Bond in this movie than in his previous Bond outings. Long time Bond fans will be sure to love a couple of throwback scenes and references from the old movies that are in Skyfall. <br/><br/>I think in the end the main thing that really makes this movie work is Bond's connection with M. A major plot point of the movie is Bond protecting M, and exploring the sort of mother/son relationship the two of them have. As always Judi Dench is great as M and you really do see how deeply she cares for Bond in this movie. Another great thing about this movie is that the dialogue is just as engaging and interesting as the action. This is a very sharply written script, and I found that a lot of the character scenes were executed perfectly. The movie doesn't drag at all and keeps you interested the entire time. <br/><br/>I really can't stop praising Skyfall. Craig is great, Bardem is flawless, I don't think one bad actor is in this movie. Skyfall is a must see Bond film that will leave you hoping and praying that the next film in Craig's series will be just as good or even better. Definitely see this in theaters if you get the chance to do so! 5/5"
"kluseba","8","2","13","19 November 2012"," Another big step forward to depict the new face of the world's most famous spy
","Since Daniel Craig incarnates the role of the most famous spy in the world, the James Bond series have profoundly changed. The movies got away from the image of a slightly arrogant but somewhat charming heart breaker who has superficial sexual relationships with the most exotic women in the world and who faces megalomaniac but vulnerable enemies and beats them with the weirdest gadgets. These movies certainly had a unique charm but when one objectively looks back on these films nowadays, they were often somewhat limited. A big portion of charm, humour and sex has gone and the new special agent has become a more emotionally driven character instead of the unbeatable superhero he has been before. While ""Casino Royale"" perfectly showed the new face of James Bond and can be considered as a milestone of the series, the direct follow-up ""Quantum Of Solace"" had its lengths and lacked of consistency.<br/><br/>""Skyfall"" is just in between the quality level of its two predecessors. It features a more emotional agent who has faced death, who gets isolated, who has alcohol problems as well as mental weaknesses and who finds himself in the abyss of his existence. The special agent becomes a quite authentic character who shows us the darker side of his personality one has never known before. One also learns more about his special relationship to his superior and the movie even takes us back to the childhood of the character. The latter part is particularly atmospheric and intriguing and innovates the series fifty years after the cinematic creation of this format.<br/><br/>The main problem with the new movie is that the personal story of James Bond gets so important that the plot about the new main villain almost gets too secondary even though Javier Bardem does an excellent job and incarnates a smart madman who has many similarities with his opponent. On the other side, the plot has its lengths. The parts turned in China are visually stunning and Bérénice Lim Marlohe convinces as mysterious femme fatale but the whole thing is too long and features too many unnecessary dialogues. The final showdown also has its length and doesn't come along very spectacular. These parts are saved by an authentic and strong acting but anybody who is waiting for breathless action scenes may only be satisfied by the explosive opening. Action fans should rather check out ""The Bourne Legacy"" that has come to the movie theatres last summer.<br/><br/>In the end, the series still head for new shores fifty years after ""Dr. No"". The focus in this film lies on James Bond's personal story and the character development and not on the action scenes, locations or villains. From time to time, this film feels like a drama and not like an action flick. It introduces though a couple of famous characters of the traditional James Bond series again which is quite addicting for old and new fans and makes the wait for the twenty-fourth feature even more exciting. ""Skyfall"" follows the tendency of its two predecessors but makes a more radical step forward. It's up to each fan to decide if he or she prefers the new face of James Bond or the traditional one or if they happen to be intriguingly complementary which would be my personal description. In the end, I enjoyed the movie despite a few flaws and I would put it in the upper midfield of the table featuring all twenty-three features but it still doesn't come close to my personal favourites that are ""From Russia with Love"", ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and ""Casino Royale""."

","And so Bond 23 arrives, in which our hero tries to retrieve a missing record of compromised agents in order to save M's political skin.<br/><br/>That's it as far as synopsis is concerned. The trailer gives you an idea, but there is so much more in this film than you expect, and I don't want to spoil the finding out of it, particularly the last third, for which I was completely unprepared (including the significance of the film's title).<br/><br/>So let me talk in terms not specific to the story, other than to say that the story is firmly rooted in the real world, with no Spectre/Smersh-type goings on. We have an up-to-date story of espionage and revenge which is utterly credible.<br/><br/>And we have some terrific action pieces, spread throughout the film, some of which are unlike anything ever seen in a Bond film.<br/><br/>And we have excellent performances from the whole cast, with Daniel Craig, Judi Dench and Javier Bardem turning in the three best performances ever in Bond films.<br/><br/>And I came out of the cinema aware that, for the first time in a Bond film, what I had seen on the screen was art. This was not simply action sequences and travelogues: this was a conscious effort to put together eye-catching, beautifully composed, images, with every element of shape, colour, light and shade considered for maximum visual impact and narrative complementation.<br/><br/>This may not be the best Bond ever (although, if not, it comes damn close) but it is without question the best Film in the Bond series."
"nichomach","9","2","14","1 November 2012"," The best Bond for some considerable time
","I was apprehensive after Quantum of Solace, which I felt was deeply disappointing. A weak plot with a weaker villain, a stilted script and limp direction. I was still convinced by Craig as Bond, but the material he had to work with was poor.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a very different kettle of fish; gripping from the opening chase scene through markets and over rooftops, it rapidly explores themes of loyalty and betrayal which will be carried throughout the film. Craig is once again a convincing Bond, matching ruthlessness with wit, convincing equally in hand to hand combat or the casino. Dench's M this time captures a brittle hardness that hadn't previously been quite so much to the fore, and plays well to the plot. The new Q is convincingly dismissive initially of the old hat methods of field agents like Bond. Bardem's villain is especially praiseworthy; flesh-creepingly unhinged, he brings palpable menace to the role.<br/><br/>The action is well-paced, the dialogue taut and the plot development well-handled. I thoroughly recommend it."

Daniel Craig and Judi Dench return as Bond and M, with new cast members Javier Bardem, (No Country for Old Men, Biutiful) Ralph Fiennes, (Schindler's List, Harry Potter) Naomie Harris, (Pirates of the Caribbean, Miami Vice) Albert Finney, (Tom Jones, Erin Brockovich) Berenice Marlohe and Ben Whishaw. Skyfall sees the return of two Bond characters that were absent in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace-Miss Moneypenny and Q. <br/><br/>The premise of the film is that MI6 is attacked, and Bond's loyalty to M is tested when a secret from her past is revealed.<br/><br/>This was a really great film, probably the best Bond film yet. Daniel Craig is a spectacular Bond, second only to Sean Connery, and all the cast, especially Dench and Bardem, are fantastic. Bardem has already proved he can play a great villain, and in Skyfall it is the same. He is a truly menacing and great villain. Judi Dench is really never bad in a film. Right from the start, there is bucket loads of action, especially good was the London Underground sequence (which you will have a hard time believing is not actually filmed in the Underground) and a wonderful final act. The globe-trotting aspect of James Bond is still here as Bond travel to Turkey and China, though not as much as previous films have. Whishaw was a great Q and Fiennes, Harris and Kinney all put good performances in also, and Sam Mendes' direction was amazing, as was John Logan, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade's writing.<br/><br/>The only problems I had were that the 2 hour 40 minute run time was a bit too long, and some pacing issues meant that the film slowed down in some parts, lingering too long on a few parts while rushing a few. Nevertheless, a really good film."

Finally we have excellent movies with respectable characters and everything and everybody involved in production. Imagineed ""superheroes"" are brought down to Earth, became human and regained dignity they deserve. I simply love Mr. Craig as Bond. He is not a clown or some careless playboy any more, winning the game with barely 2 per cent of his efforts, mainly because he has not only psychotic but essentially stupid opponents. After Mr. Lazenby has shown us raw model (""how to behave as a secret service employee""), Mr. Craig is the best Bond ever (yes, including Mr. Connery - sorry, ladies). And, yes, I've followed Bond movies since the beginning. Mr. Bardem is the best opponent (including Mr. Brandauer in Never Say Never Again, who was fantastic) he had so far. Truly an exquisite movie (all elements included) with few minor flaws (therefore 9/10 stars), probably due to production requirements.

","Please be aware that this review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>After watching Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace (which i thought was great movies, ..just not Bond movies) i thought that the franchise was dead. James Bond has finally seen its end. You know the criticisms of those movies, so i won't elaborate (""Do i look like i give a damn"" - for example). <br/><br/>I've read about this upcoming Bond film for a long time, and the first thing that struck me with this movie was, they brought back Q! What a wonderful decision to make (him being absent in the previous two movies was really a letdown). I really thought - perhaps the producers finally intent to get THE James Bond back to where he really should be. So i watched this movie.<br/><br/>I was so impressed by the producers decision to bring back everything that defined Bond in the past, back. Moneypenny, the old office, male M (not that Dench was bad), Bond's cold and calm attitude. This is what the franchise is about, it's not about overused action scenes, boring love dramas, Bond avenging his lover etc. This movie blended the good parts of the previous movies with true Bond elements and made it a masterpiece. While i do understand that some plot twists and overacting in fact DO exist in this movie, it may not be the greatest movie ever made, but for what i care, it doesn't matter - Bond has made it back, and this is what a reboot is all about: Bringing a franchise into the modern world. <br/><br/>They're not trying to recreate Goldfinger, they're trying to make a good action movie out of a bond movie while still retaining the things that defined the character. Alright, there's things that could've been done better, i'm not saying anything else, but i'm not watching Bond movies because they're cinematicly the best, i'm watching them for one reason, and one reason only - because they're Bond movies.<br/><br/>Now i can finally look forward to the next bond movie, knowing that the franchise is back on tracks. Whatever rating it gets on IMDb in the end, this movie will always be known as the ""Dr. No"" of the reboot. <br/><br/>These three movies tell the tale of how James became Bond, now we want to see how Bond fares in the modern world, now that he's finally back as we know him.<br/><br/>Two things i may suggest in the next movie, that will really Isis the cake - Gun Barrel sequence in the beginning of the movie (YES it's been pointed out millions of times), and the sparingly using of ""shaken, not stirred""."
"caseymoviemania","9","2","15","3 November 2012"," Casey's Movie Mania: SKYFALL (2012)
","When SKYFALL made its theatrical debut in U.K. and many international countries on October 26, many have hailed this as ""the best Bond movie ever"". So, does it really deserves such a high praise? Well, I'm proud to say all the four years' wait was well worth it. This is the follow-up to the excellent CASINO ROYALE (2006) that should have been. That said, SKYFALL is a whole lot better than the disappointingly glum QUANTUM OF SOLACE (2008).<br/><br/>At the first glance, hiring an untested director like Sam Mendes who never direct an action picture or a big-budget blockbuster before is a very risky choice. Look what Marc Forster has done to QUANTUM OF SOLACE when he was chosen to direct Daniel Craig's second Bond movie. However, it's a huge sigh of relief that Mendes proves to be a highly-competent director after all. First of all, he manages to handle action department admirably. With the help of second-unit director Alexander Witt (who also coordinated CASINO ROYALE), the action here is exhilarating and perfectly staged. The first 12 minutes or so -- the jeep-and-motorcycle chase through Istanbul's Grand Bazaar and atop the roof, before ending up in an entertaining showdown on a moving train -- is particularly one of the best action set-pieces ever made in any Bond movies.<br/><br/>But extra kudos to Sam Mendes for reconstructing the typical Bond formula. Let's just say SKYFALL isn't much of your traditional Bond movie per sec. Mendes is smart enough not to top or even replicate the overwhelming success of CASINO ROYALE in term of its high entertainment value. Instead, he goes for the uncharted territory that the previous 22 Bond entries for the past 50 years wouldn't bother to explore -- Bond's rarely-mentioned parents as well as his personal history. He also bold enough to reintroduce Bond all over again. Sure, we have seen Daniel Craig playing a more humane and vulnerable Bond before in his previous two 007 outings. But Mendes lifts his character a few notches above by presenting him as a man whose best days may be all behind him. While the movie may have been drama-centric, there are plenty of well-timed sense of humor as well. Speaking of humor, there are plenty of winking nods that this movie celebrated the 50 years anniversary of Bond movie franchise -- the Aston Martin DB5 in 1964's GOLDFINGER, and the crocodile farm scene in 1973's LIVE AND LET DIE (which is replaced by komodo dragon in the Macau-set sequence) Speaking of Daniel Craig, he excels his well-worn role admirably. For the third time in the row, he has certainly aged well as a vintage Bond -- older but wiser. Most of the supporting casts here are equally captivating, which includes Ben Whishaw as the geeky and younger version of Q and Ralph Fiennes. Even a small role by Albert Finney who appears at the climactic finale of the movie, is memorable as well. Still kudos goes to both scene-stealers, Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. Dench gives a commanding performance with dignity and poignancy as M, while Bardem made a fabulous entrance for his Silva character -- no doubt one of the best Bond villains of all-time -- where he first tells a little story about himself (the one involving the rats in a barrel is particularly thought-provoking). Then there's the sexual side of him -- the way how he harasses Bond by touching his face and (gulp!) caressing his thighs -- has certainly brought something new to the table than your average Bond villain.<br/><br/>Technical-wise, SKYFALL is remarkably top-notch. Roger Deakins' strikingly beautiful cinematography has no doubt plays a very important role here which rarely seen in a Bond movie. The way how he plays around with contrast, mood and shadow are certainly something to behold. His particular cinematography in the Shanghai-set scene is the most eye-catching of all -- the neon advertising that illuminated the skyscrapers are simply sexy and alluring. Thomas Newman's score is memorably catchy, while Adele's emotionally-driven theme song is one of the best ever heard in a Bond movie.<br/><br/>Despite all the great things in SKYFALL, the movie is still not without flaws. The Bond girls, Berenice Marlohe and Naomie Harris, are somewhat underused. At 143 minutes, there are times the plot has a patchy feel in it (the one involving the Macau-set casino scene is the most obvious one of all). Subsequent action moments after the excellent pre-credits sequence, are unfortunately pale in comparison. The Scotland-set finale is somewhat anticlimactic, although I do appreciate the radical change of an otherwise grandiose ending often associated to a Bond movie.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised if any casual Bond fans may find this a disappointment because frankly, SKYFALL is more character-driven than the action-packed mode like CASINO ROYALE. The movie's deliberate pace might be a turn-off as well. But once in a while, it's a welcome change of pace to watch a Bond movie in a different light."
"mikesull2291","10","2","15","1 November 2012"," Three Words: Bond Is Back
","Without a doubt, one of the best Bond Films, certainly the best bond film in the more recent years (only *possibly* topped by something like Goldfinger, You Only live twice or any of the 'classics'), but certainly highly entertaining, and for many reasons.<br/><br/>The first thing I would like to mention is the films musical score, which so brilliantly compliments the film, but what is most enjoyable about it is the fact you hear the bond theme! Yes Ladies, Gentlemen and anything in between, you here the good ol' fashioned Dumm, Dumm, Dumm, Dumm...with interjections of the Skyfall main theme song (again, Fantastic! So much better than Quantum of Solace's main theme)<br/><br/>Another fantastic thing about the film is how sexy it looks. Genuinely, it looks amazing. The cinematography is just simply perfect (Watch out for the China scene, the opening shot, and generally all the establishing shots)<br/><br/>I am sorry that the previous two things have only been brief so far, but that is because I want to talk more about two things: The story, and Javier Bardem.<br/><br/>Now the story is one that is simple, Good guys lose something that bad guys use to damage good guys. Good guys get revenge, everyone ends up happy. Ish. But what is so beautiful about this film is how you see the relationship between M and 007 develop, you have so much of the film invested in their life stories (You hear about M's husband, 007s parents and some of the problems in Bonds life as well i.e. drug and alcohol addiction) but the risk with so much time is spent on developing each character is you lose interest in the story. This is brilliantly avoided by having a perfect amount of large set action pieces such as the opening chase sequence, the tube line chase, the casino in china, and the finale which is EPIC (unlike QOS, which had too many forgettable flashes of action). This is so evenly dispersed throughout that you never for one second thing it is dragging or paced slowly. The 165 minutes just fly by. The other amazing thing about the story is the introduction of characters, such as Q, Money penny, and Silva.<br/><br/>Now, if there isn't at least any major recognition for JB on this film, there is no justice in the world. I genuinely think he is the most likable bond villain, but at the same time just terrifying. Reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker. There are so many great moments and lines from JB, that makes you want to like him, but he will go ahead and do something truly brutal and horrifying (You'll know what I mean), and do it all with a smile on his face. Genuinely terrifying. I could go on and on about it, but alas my limit is near.<br/><br/>In short, I would say if you had to see one film this autumn/fall, this would be it. A serious Oscar contender. A must watch for any Bond fan/Not a bond fan/everyone.<br/><br/>Well done Sam Rami (again, Kudos to him for an amazing job!)<br/><br/>Too much to say in 1000 letters..."

","I'm a big fan of Bond series but I didn't like Craig's version. I thought that was ridiculous that producers turned Bond into some kind of bodybuilder and topless Daniel Craig appears on the screen more times than topless hot Bond girls but honestly... SKYFALL is apparently the best Bond in last 30 years! A brilliant tribute on 50 anniversary of the series. Storyline is very interesting and allows to show that Bond is getting old, reveals his secrets from the past and focusing on his relations with M (sometimes I thought that SKYFALL is more about M than Bond). I think an idea of mother-son relationship between them was great. Some people in reviews already mentioned about references to the old episodes so I can only add that music score and Adele's song are superb and last but not least... Javier Bardem! Oh men he's one of the best Bond's opponents ever! He's role can be easily placed next to Hugh Ledger's from Dark Knight. I liked the ending a lot, final showdown got the style of movies from 70's. Sam Mendes once again showed that he's the one of the best directors in nowadays so go to the cinema and pay the tribute to Commander Bond for 50 years of service.<br/><br/>Cheers"

"johnnyboyz","7","1","5","28 July 2018"," No chance of the sky falling in on this franchise JUST yet...
","""Skyfall"" proves there is life in the James Bond franchise yet. Indeed, shouldn't these films have died a death already? It is remarkable they are still going, in the wake of the culmination of the Cold War; the initiation of the War on Terror; Britain's own changing place on the world stage as a super-power and the ever-changing tastes that cinema-goers have. Just where does Bond, as both a filmic entity and a character within his own universe, fit in to all of this? <br/><br/>The spy thriller demands, when all is said and done, a narrative, but Bond is big-business and very much part of mainstream film culture, which of course isn't interested in narrative. When Daniel Craig sits, pensively, in a gallery staring at a painting of an old warship being tugged away, it doesn't require much thought to work out the allusion. The scene is somewhat spoiled by another character verbally confirming it to us, but there you go. Later on, a scene involving Judi Dench being asked by an obnoxious MP as to what the ""point"" of her division is anymore should strike us as probably the series' most existential ever moment.<br/><br/>Beginning in Turkey, the film opens with an impressive sequence involving the infiltration of a building; a foot-chase through the dusty streets, which evolves into a car chase, before settling for a battle aboard a freight train as Bond (Craig) and Naomie Harris' Moneypenny strive to reclaim a stolen list of identities of undercover NATO agents. What is striking about this opening, aside from the somewhat awkward moment whereby Bond must 'take-over' driving duties from his female accomplice in order to properly land a fatal blow, is its pessimism - the heroes do not obtain the list; there is no win or quip after all the stunts, just a failure. <br/><br/>This is due to Moneypenny accidentally shooting Bond with a sniper rifle (can she do nothing right?) - he falls from the train and a bridge into a river; director Sam Mendes cleverly transposes the sound effects of the running water whilst focusing on a distraught looking Dench in a wet London as rain teems down the window she looks out of. The first words of the title song we hear thereafter are ""this is the end..."" We sense then that there is something afoot, and everything thereafter carries with it a strange sense of vulnerability. <br/><br/>Bond is not dead, of course, but utilises his time in the wake of his injury to bed women and engage in nefarious drinking games on a Caribbean island while, back home, M (Dench) is told she's being phased out of her role as head of the division. Intelligence is then hit by a cyber-attack. It is to the film's credit that is sets aside time for Bond's rehabilitation back into being an agent of some stature again instead of making the mistake of merely allowing him to be able to pick up where he left off before an alcohol-fuelled sabbatical. <br/><br/>What is most impressive about ""Skyfall"" is its ability to be able to look back as well as ahead AND be able to systematically tell a decent story of espionage - Mendes has managed to make a Bond film with an opinion on its own status: it has time for the silver Aston Martin, but doesn't think much of the exploding pen gadget. The film is otherwise peppered with the imagery of our time: an exploding London underground train; characters utilising YouTube and has one eye on the dominant role computer run neural networks have in our world. The idea of 'hackers' as villains might have ended up as stale and silly, but the film pulls it off and it even comes across as quite original. <br/><br/>A mention must go to Javier Bardem for playing the lead villain in the form of Raoul Silva, whose entrance is put to a long unbroken shot of the man entering a large warehouse on a long-since abandoned island that is therefore stuck in time and so clashes with all the tech-savvy equipment around him. As he talks about controlling the world via the Internet, his terminals begin to look like rolls of razor wire stacked up together thus inferring a sense of the impenetrable. If we are surprised that there are degrees of duality between Bond and Silva after a later reveal, we perhaps should not be - Mendes' had already introduced the pair of them at their respective moments in the same manner: with a long, slow pacing towards the camera.<br/><br/>Certainly, after the nature of ""Quantum of Solace"", which I did not think terrible but appeared plastic and hurried in the wake of ""Casino Royale"", ""Skyfall"" brings narrative clarity; genuine excitement and, most importantly, heart back to the series which may exist now in a very different world to the one it was born into, but is nevertheless still able to pack a punch."
"aaf-47132","8","1","5","1 May 2017"," This movie, from my perspective, serves as an honor to all the past James Bond films. This film is indeed worth 2 hours and 23 minutes of anyone's time.
","** Spoilers!!<br/><br/>Skyfall 007 film features Bond, represented by the actor Daniel Craig, embarking on yet another dangerous and thrilling mission to save MI6 and perhaps the world. The film starts off with Bond and Eve, played by Naomie Harris, chasing down a mercenary who possess crucial information of the names of the agents in MI6. When Bond finally manages to subdue his opponent to submission, Eve is ordered by her superior, M, played by Judi Dench, tells Eve, ""TAKE THE BLOODY SHOT!"". (Skyfall 007, 2012). She misses the attacker and the bullet hits Bond, where he plunges down into the river nearly dead. The same yearning theme of all James Bond films recurs again and again: the best ways are old ways. Throughout the history of James Bond films, this idea has always remained and will always remain as an essential part of each and every James Bond film. For Instance, A proof of this is easily shown in the last James Bond film. During the poker game scene in Casino Royale, Bond is seen to rely on his gut feeling and abandon traditional methods of winning poker. This of course works out for him, and he earns a huge payout as a result. This scene provides evidence of the same culture so clear in James Bond films that the audience never tires of. Furthermore, later on in the film, Bond returns to MI6 after having heard of a recent attack on MI6 headquarters. He describes his unintentional time out of action to M as simply ""enjoying death."" When he returns, he seems to have declined somewhat physically and mentally, having been characterized by the psychologist as a person with a degree of physical and mental trauma and having failed almost every part of the assessment program of MI6. However, due to the tender of M, Bond is given clearance after unknowingly failed his 007 re-entry exam. This shows a clear example of how the importance of tradition and instinct overrides logical analysis and reasoning.<br/><br/>Moreover, during the course of the film, Bond and other characters continuously refer to the ""old ways"". For example, In the scene between Eve and Bond at the suite, Eve makes a remark about Bond using a cutthroat razor and Bond responds by saying, ""One ought to do things the old-fashioned way.""(Skyfall 007, 2012). In addition, when Eve is shaving Bond, she makes a slick remark saying that he's an ""Old dog with new tricks."" (Skyfall 007, 2012). Lastly, during the last fight scene of the film, Bond uses a knife to kill the main boss. This signifies that sometimes the surest and most effective ways are always following tradition. Another vivid example of the importance of tradition in James Bond films could also be examined in the opening credits of the film. As in all James Bond films, there is referred to as the ""Unique Gun Barrel Sequence. This classical sequence so characteristic of Bond films features Bond shooting at the viewer of the inside of a gun barrel. This opening is a trademark of Bond films and always reminds the James Bond fan that some things will never change.<br/><br/>Subjectively speaking, Skyfall 007 is a manifestation and reminder of the classic James Bond films. It always references the importance of keeping with tradition, and remembering one's history. This movie, from my perspective, serves as an honor to all the past James Bond films. This film is indeed worth 2 hours and 23 minutes of anyone's time."
"ibrarsiddiqi","8","1","5","30 January 2017"," Bond, shaken and definitely stirred.
","My love of Bond definitely lay with the earlier actors who delivered Bond as suave, confident, intelligent spy who served on Her Majesty's behalf in the interests of Great Britian in the Cold War era in which Fleming based his fictional character upon.<br/><br/>Enter Daniel Craig who brings a harder, grittier, focused Bond with a killer edge capable of dispatching both friend and foe effortlessly. To take on a well established role and bring your own interpretation of Britain's well loved spy is difficult enough initially but Daniel has moulded Bond to his best of acting experience in 'Skyfall'. Having not seen his previous outings as Bond, I had to watch and form my own opinions.<br/><br/>'Skyfall' opens with a surprise exit of Bond for six months thanks to a colleague acting upon a decision made by 'M', leaving British Intelligence operatives fully exposed, there are repercussions for 'M' who is effectively under orders to retire following the fiasco. British intelligence is unaware that Bond has survived but is shaken to the core after being shot. We see him drink himself to oblivion but sobers up when he decides to pay 'M' visit after M16 is attacked in London. M16 have regrouped and are operating underground literally with Bond who must now find his nerve but we see his vulnerability he's still pressed into action despite reservations. Bond seeks to find who has the list of his comrades and seeks a ghost operative whose ruthlessness knows no limits. With Bond in Shanghai, he is exposed and subsequently brought of out his shell taking on a adversary determined to stop at nothing, even bringing the fight back to the ancestral home in Scotland.<br/><br/>The film itself in the former half is refreshing, it changed my opinion of Craig's abilities but the latter half of the film felt incomplete and wholly slower than I'd expected as Mendes fails to deliver. Craignshould have been given artistic licence and free reign to take Bond further but is limited by poor direction and the desire to finish a plot that was rushed somewhat.<br/><br/>Not fully disappointed, I believe Craig can do better but with a better director but bravo to him to showing different facets of Bond's usually suave character."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","9","1","5","18 September 2016"," James Bond gets the creative refreshment he needs.
","*Possible Spoilers Ahead*<br/><br/>007 has gone through quite a lot in his 50+ years of cinema; and Skyfall, believe it or not, is one of the all-time high points for the character. Skyfall actually shows Bond getting HURT, instead of being this invincible superman figure we're so used to seeing all the time and getting bored of. The scale of the adventure is big, memorable and very British (something you don't usually feel in modern blockbusters). Daniel Craig is very good here and it seems like this SHOULD have been his last Bond feature in his contract because Skyfall does have that 'penultimate' feel about it, something that predecessor Quantum of Solace lacked in nearly every way imaginable. I guess Skyfall got everything right considering this was released on Bond's 50th (cinematic) Anniversary, and what a birthday surprise this was for him indeed."
"Fluke_Skywalker","8","1","5","16 September 2016"," A more personal Bond
","Plot; Struggling to regain form after an injury in the field, secret agent James Bond finds himself matched against a shadowy hacker who may be much more.<br/><br/>Whatever else Sam Mendes' first take on Bond is, it's certainly gorgeous to look at. From London to Shanghai to the Scottish Highlands, it's a diverse and often breathtaking tapestry of environs. Thankfully it's not just a pretty face. Matched with a strong, personal story, the stakes here are far more intimate--and powerful--than the standard ""world domination"" thing (which is more or less true of all of Daniel Craig's Bond outings thus far). Speaking of Craig, his Bond may not be in good form here, but he certainly is. Bursting on the scene in a strong way in Casino Royale (in my opinion the best film in the entire franchise), his footing seemed a tad less sure in the thin and uneven Quantum of Solace. Here he clearly relishes the focus on character and pathos and delivers in a major way. Also strong are his supporting players, including newcomers Naomi Harris (Moneypenny), Ben Whishaw (Q) and Ralph Fiennes (Mallory). But there true star here may be Judi Dench as M. In a way, this is as much her movie as Bond's, and the veteran actress more than holds her own against 007.<br/><br/>If there's a weak spot here it's Javier Bardem as the villain. I like Silva in concept, but Bardem too often strays into camp, robbing the movie of some of its dramatic power at key moments. This is clearly not a universal opinion, as Bardem received several award nominations (including BAFTA and SAG) for the role.<br/><br/>When I first saw Skyfall back in '12 it seemed a strong course correction after the stumble of Solace (a film I've since come to appreciate a tad more), and I'm pleased to say that remains true four years later."

The positives that I thought this film had was the casting and to be honest for what they were going for I think this film did it good. I thought the action was weak. I didn't understand this film that much. I will keep watching this movie until I am satisfied with it. What did annoy me on the release was people stating that it is the best Bond film.

But what makes this movie so damn good is that its just so enjoyable tense and really great action film, although there are things that you can nitpick here and there but Bond rarely gets this entertaining throughout the whole film, its just a blast! and we have some great cast as well, one of my favorite villain in the series played by Javier Bardem and he is having a ball with this role and does it extremely well. This movie also introduces a new q... does anyone feel like we just reached a Harry Potter movie in his first scene? anyways he does great and is absolutely a fine addition to the series, he ain't no Desmone LLewlyn but he is great in this film.

Pierece Brosnan ruined the character by portraying Bond as a sex crazed womanizing moron, depending heavily on gadgets to get his job done. I've read most of Ian Fleming's work and DC comes closest to Flemings Bond,a dark,ruthless,coldblooded spy with a dark past and having his fair share of demons.

","Breaking the continuity that carried over from Casino Royale to Quantum of Solace, Skyfall is a standalone feature which takes the series to an all-time high by becoming the most successful chapter of the long-running franchise and with its strong word-of-mouth reception also turns out to be the fitting instalment to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Bond series.<br/><br/>The story of Skyfall presents the 007 agent at his most vulnerable after he's accidentally shot down by his own agent while on a mission. Retiring to a peaceful life once he's presumed dead, Bond ultimately returns to duty after an assassination attempt is made on M after which further investigations lead him to a former MI6 agent who seeks revenge against M for betraying him.<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Mendes, the film begins on a rousing note with a spectacular chase sequence set in Istanbul, followed by an even more remarkable theme song by Adele, after which the main plot surfaces. The film delves into a much darker territory this time but at its core lies a very emotional tale that's elegantly handled by the revered filmmaker throughout its runtime.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, Skyfall might very well be the most beautiful looking film of the franchise as almost every element is carefully processed & executed. Roger Deakins' spellbinding cinematography makes the film truly stand out & is at its most dazzling during the Shanghai sequences. Editing firmly controls its pacing and both set pieces & locations are smartly chosen.<br/><br/>Use of CGI remains minimal with more emphasis given to stunt work & practical effects to keep the action sequences as grounded as possible. Continuing their successful collaboration since the beginning, Thomas Newman comes up with another terrific score that beautifully intertwines with Mendes' narrative while Adele's theme song might very well be the franchise's finest to date.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Daniel Craig shows great comfort in getting under the skin of 007 this time but Skyfall boasts a really strong supporting cast this time amongst which Judi Dench & Javier Bardem end up impressing the most. Dench as M is upgraded to leading lady status as her character plays a significant role in the events plus her relationship with Bond is the film's core ingredient.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem plays the main antagonist with finesse & even though the odd persona he portrays as Silva is very commendable, it isn't as intimidating as I expected it to be. Ralph Fiennes is always a treat to watch no matter what role he plays, Naomie Harris' character turns out to be the worst driver ever while both Ben Whishaw & Bérénice Marlohe are fine additions in their given roles of Q & Sévérine, respectively.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Skyfall is a welcome addition to James Bond franchise and although many like to call it the best Bond film to date, I would still put my money on Casino Royale. Realigning its route by advancing into the future without leaving behind the old-school charisma, Skyfall is a worthy follow-up that ultimately lives up to its hype &, despite its overlong third act, manages to deliver the thrills it promised."

","At the end of the day, liking 'Skyfall' depends on whether you are a Bond fan. If you like mindless mayhem and some interesting characters, like the good old days of 007, then this film is for you.<br/><br/>My own sister says that this is the first Bond film that she has really enjoyed since Roger Moore hung up his shoulder holster after 'A View To A Kill' (1985). Even this film's villain looks creepily like Christopher Walken's Max Zorin...<br/><br/>Those who knock 'Skyfall' (and I haven't found very many of them), surely can't deny that Adele provides one of the best Bond songs ever, closely recalling Shirley Bassey's 'Goldfinger' and Tina Turner's 'GoldenEye' with her powerful vocals that are so Bondian and right for the franchise's Golden Anniversary. The fact that it was being played in every shop, supermarket and on the radio shows that it must have been good!<br/><br/>Again, yes, the plot doesn't make tons of sense if you look at it practically, but this is James Bond - he's had fights in hollowed-out volcanoes and in outer-space in the past!! It's not John le Carre and the escapism of it is what has made Bond endurable for all these years. So just sit back and enjoy, rather than being lost in a convoluted plot!<br/><br/>Javier Bardem makes a superb villain, bringing back to the series the sense of Blofeld or Scaramanga alive and at play in the world of politics, business, culture and intrigue. He does some pretty incredible things, which you could either take as an outrageous shoe-horning in of plot elements, or actually the machinations of an incredible vindictive schemer. He's definitely not as lukewarm as Mathieu Amalric from the previous film!<br/><br/>Dame Judi Dench gives one of her best performances as 007's boss, 'M' and is, indeed, a central figure in the plot, thus repeating the excellent decision made at the outset of Daniel Craig's assumption of the Bond role to make 'M' more important. There is certainly no shortage of references to the mother-son-style relationship between the two characters. And, also, it is interesting to see Dench paired up with another stalwart British actor: Albert Finney.<br/><br/>Naturally, as with 'Die Another Day' (2002) having celebrated the Fortieth Anniversary of the cinematic Bond, there are some classic Bond elements. The Aston Martin DB5 is a courageous warrior in itself once again here, there are some very beautiful women at points, the exotic locations and the ones closer to home are gorgeous, the villain has an incredible lair, and the classic 'Goldfinger'-esque sheen as showcased in 'Casino Royale' (2006) is back.<br/><br/>In fact, this film may be Bond's latest 'Goldfinger', just as 'GoldenEye' (1995) was to Pierce Brosnan.<br/><br/>The action and stunts here work to advance the plot rather than being mere spectacle. Although, of course, there is one stunt in particular that is an homage to the epic flipping of an 18-wheeler truck in 'The Dark Knight' (2008). A hint that the producers have been trying to lure Christopher Nolan into the franchise, or an affectionate affirmation that the producers are taking as much inspiration from him as he has from them, perhaps?<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this is the highest grossing Bond film - ever - and there is a reason why. The old sparkle is back, but with a few new elements sprinkled in here and there. And, who knows, with the rights to Blofeld and SPECTRE now held by the official Bond movie-makers, 007 aficionados may be in store for a very interesting set of new adventures..."

","Well my title says it all about Skyfall. This has to be the best of the Bond films,not just because it's kick ass and fun, but there's also a very good story and characters to go with it. After the debacle known as Quantum of Solace, this is the best return to form since Casino Royale in 2006.<br/><br/>The story this time around is very M-centric. Bond must track down a former agent, Raoul Silva, who is after M for betraying him years before. M is also being phased out as her methods are seen as both passé and dangerous to the agents in her organization, and she both has to fight Silva and the knowledge that the world is changing and that she can no longer keep up with it. Bond also has his own journey as he was presumably killed at the beginning of the film, he becomes out of shape and cynical, but still will protect his boss, who is the closest thing to his mother. We also learn about Bond's childhood at his father's mansion Skyfall, which is really interesting.<br/><br/>We get some of the best acting in this series and fresh faces to old favorites. Daniel Craig does his finest work as an actor in this one, making Bond three-dimensional once again. We get the new Q in the form of Ben Whishaw, whom I think easily fills in for the respected shoes of Desmond Llewelyn. Ralph Fiennes is a government agent Mallory, who becomes M later on. We get Naomie Harris as Eve (Moneypenny) who is unfortunately the one person who doesn't work for me, but oh well.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva. SPOT ON PERFECT CASTING. Silva is my favorite villain of the series, and has set the bar for future ones to come. He is calm and collected, never going over the top in what he does or says. He is also a bit effeminate, which makes him very unique, unlike the gay duo Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd from Diamonds are Foerever. He doesn't overplay it, which is why I mention it. He is also intimidating as hell, being given the best villain intro in movie history. It's a long shot that lasts for a long time until he finishes the story he tells us and Bond. So brilliant! <br/><br/>The director of this movie, Sam Mendes, actually brings a more refined look and feel to this series than even Martin Campbell (but both are on the same level in my opinion) He utilizes quiet dramatic moments with some very well filmed and fast paced action. But he also has the great Roger Deakins to shoot the film, and of course, the photography is beautiful. The one scene that I must single out as beautiful is when Bond fights a henchman in front of a blue light display and all you see is silhouette. It looks exactly like Maurice Binder shot it. Deakins should have won the Oscar for Cinematography on this one.<br/><br/>The action is amazing. And surprisingly, I didn't see much shaky cam, or it was so minimal that I didn't know there was any to be had. It has the best.<br/><br/>And I will mention one more aspect of this brilliant film. Adele's theme song. I haven't talked much about the theme songs in Bond because with the exception of maybe 6 of them, I don't care for them much. But when Adele wrote and sang this song, it added a level to greatness not a lot of people thought Bond would have. She deservedly won the Oscar for the song, nice work! This film is awesome. I have watched it many times, and I'm sure there will be many more in the future.<br/><br/>That concludes Bond month. I'm theflyace, and thanks for reading.<br/><br/>P.S. Prepare for my best-to-worst Bond films, villains, and actors lists in my profile."
"paul2001sw-1","6","1","5","29 April 2013"," Too much
","For the first few minutes of 'Skyfall', you might think you were watching a tense, downbeat, almost-realistic thriller. Then Agent Bond answers his boss in London with a curt, improbable ""Ma'am"", and the silliness begins. Of course, Bond's is a trademark silliness, one that has come to be so perceived as part of what defines Englishness that the character was even included in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics; and it's fair to say that in many ways, Skyfall is an entertaining film, as it romps violently, and theatrically, around the globe in the firm tradition of its many predecessors. Like the other films made using current actor Daniel Craig, there's a superficially dark mood fronting the in-jokes and computer-assisted choreography, and a little less lasciviousness than some earlier incarnations, although I wouldn't go as far as to say that there's anything here that could actually be taken seriously. Sam Mendes handles the job of directing competently, and most of the cast give it a spirited effort: Javier Barden makes a suave, effete villain but Julie Dench is somewhat (and surprisingly) anaemic as Bond's boss M. Personally, I've never quite got the appeal of the franchise; and much as I like the highlands of Scotland, where the conclusion is set, the film is unquestionably overlong. I've seen worse light entertainment; but something so flimsy would be sweeter if shorter."

","Within the first half hour, the movie promised to be something more than the previous Bond movies.<br/><br/>Is Bond getting too old for his job? Would he remain hidden in exile or return to a thankless job? Is M too ruthless? Are agents really necessary in a digital world?<br/><br/>All of those questions were raised, but not answered.<br/><br/>Instead, they spent time on the regular James Bond routine: average dialogue, supposedly witty; action scenes with an immortal protagonist; tropes, lots of tropes.<br/><br/>At least this movie made due without the ever increasingly more ridiculous miracle gadgets.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem makes for a good villain, even though he appears to be more or less a copy of The Joker."
"elene-botha","8","1","5","14 January 2013"," And the sky did fall!
","Daniel Craig as James Bond, to me, has always been a winning combination. Through the 007's that he has made, we have seen a more 'human' side to Bond, which has become synonym with Craig. In this regard Skyfall is no different, we see a more aged Bond contemplating stepping out of the service, only to be returned by a sense of duty. Trips to the Scottish countryside and 007's childhood home, all contribute to the 'more human' Bond-image of Craig.<br/><br/>But enough of Bond, because for the first time, for me, in a very long time the 007 movies have produced a bad guy that can easily be compared to Heath Ledger's Joker, etc. Javier Bardem plays the role of Silver superbly. During the entirety of the film you have to battle between the sympathy you have for him because of his likeness to Bond and the aversion you have towards him for his intolerable cruelty. Love him or hate him, Bardem captured my attention and blew my mind with his five-star performance.<br/><br/>Bravo for, yet again, an entertaining James Bond experience!"
"BeneCumb","8","1","5","6 January 2013"," Not bad at all... And less emphasis on state-of-the-art widgets
","Despite different times, incl. changes in audience and getting used to digital opportunities, the Bond-series has maintained its traditions, repetitions and composition. Adele's song was nice - and the pre-story was also thrilling to follow (the fastest part of the film). <br/><br/>Daniel Craig has improved a lot (he was very unaccustomed to me in his first Bond performance), but I still have to admit that several supporting actors outperformed him: Judi Dench as M, Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva and Ben Whishaw as Q, above all; Ralph Fiennes could have been spent more time on screen, but he will certainly do in next Bond films... Young female characters, however, were too brief and not convincing, the Bond-girl Sévérine (by Bérénice Marlohe) was rather inexpressive. Perhaps the film could have been shorter and with less unrealistic scenes, but still - it is worth watching and definitely in the better half of the Bond-films. 007 can continue, no time to discard him yet. <br/><br/>I am looking forward to the next film already."
"iamanabel","9","1","5","18 December 2012"," Loved this movie!
","Movie 007 Buzzing! Fyeww! A bullets flying, action packed film that continues the great story of ""007"". From cars blowing up on command to getting shot, and still finishing the job. From the well known opening fight where the hot shot trigger finger pulls the trigger; opens a huge mess of problems for MI6. ""007"" is a pretty boy who is full of himself. This is a story of a double agent that lives life on the edge from gun fights with no bullets to hand to hand combat. He will never cease to amaze you with all of the advanced technology that he uses to get the job done. The continuous series has had many A list actors that are definitely cut out for this job. All of the actors are what you could call a perfect personality for the pretty boy that gets all the ladies, and he is always pulling the trigger at the right time. The most recent ""007"" that is said to be the Roger Moore of today is Daniel Craig; who has been a fan since he was a kid. He says he can remember acting out the movies in front of the TV as a kid. The most recent movie in this series is ""Skyfall"". (23rd movie) This movie, made by Sony, brought in a whopping $88,364,714. Sony made this ""007"" movie like no other, being the first in the series of movies that Bond, James Bond did not get ""the girl."" It was also a huge shock when ""M"" played by Judy Dench, the leader of MI6 dies to save the double agents life. The makers of this highly explosive, shoot'em up, love story are very attached. The director and producer have made all twenty-three movies. The producer is Mrs. Barbara Broccoli who is partnered with the director, Mr. Sam Mendes. These two people have done a fantastic job at following the story line of the well known book. The story may become a little slow when they are on a long car ride; just wait, when they get there bullets are going to fly, bombs are going to explode, and cowards are going to run. When this movie is over you will be counting down, and guessing what could possibly happen next. Go see this movie before you are the next one in his cross hairs."
"CryptoGuy","9","1","5","12 December 2012"," Skyfall and Craig Raising the Bar
","Skyfall is film number three for Craig. It is a film about aging, poor choices, diplomacy, revenge, and loyalty. It is also about nostalgia. Skyfall is the first film of the Craig series that introduces many of the Bond staples. This is the beginning of the James Bond we have grown to love. The first two movies, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, were mere back story. They were films that let us know why James Bond is the way he is. Skyfall shows us who he will be.<br/><br/>Skyfall stars Daniel Craig (Bond), Judi Dench (M), and Javier Bardem (Silva, a.k.a. the bad guy). Craig is still rough around the edges, a brutal killer with a touch of necessary class. Whereas former Bond actors like Connery and Brosnan made some men think it possible to be like James Bond, Craig dispels that silly notion. He is built like a gymnast and fights like a mixed martial arts animal. Judi Dench is, well, she's Judi Dench. She's a Dame and superb actress. Javier Bardem is an unforgettable villain He's a throwback of the old Bond movies, way over the top, brilliant, and pure evil. However, his portrayal is grounded in realism, which makes him even better.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty & Road to Perdition). Mendes's direction keeps the momentum going with Craig. It's written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and John Logan. They keep the legend alive. The film is action packed with very few slow moments. The story is rich, rounding out the Bond world well. We get a few surprises and back story on some Bond characters of old. Like I said, this is the beginning. It just might be the beginning of the end, though.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how long Craig plans on making Bond films. I hope it's a couple more, at least. For years, actors had to try and fill Sean Connery's shoes. I'll go out on a limb here and say that from now on actors will need to try and fill Daniel Craig's shoes. He has raised the bar to a whole new level."
"houghtonetet","8","1","5","7 December 2012"," Worthy addition to the Bond franchise
","Bond celebrates his 50th anniversary with this entertaining and enjoyable helping of highly improbable espionage. The franchise has developed over the decades beyond self-parody, and is still developing. Many scenes and situations in Skyfall reflect the modern, shadowy threats to today's society, and in M's public humiliation before a Select Committee, MI6 is reminded it is ultimately accountable to the public. That said, the usual stunts and chases are all there in abundance, together with some sharp banter between Bond and his superiors, his sidekicks, and his deliciously creepy enemy, (played with relish by Javier Bardem). Skyfall benefited from the talents not only of the wonderful Judi Dench and ever dependable Ralph Fiennes but also of the highly promising Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw, who I feel will make Q every bit an institution as Desmond Llewellyn did. If you add in some stunning sequences in Turkey, Shanghai, and Scotland, you have a movie that stands comparison with any other Bond movie (apart from the recent Casino Royale).<br/><br/>The movie was not flawless – there were some gaps that I found puzzling, ie how did Silva escape from his cell in London? What happened to the stolen list of agents? Who was Patrice hired to assassinate and why? How did Bond miraculously recover his shooting skills after failing his fitness test?<br/><br/>The film is well worth a viewing – I enjoyed it very much."
"AngryGazelle","7","1","5","2 December 2012"," good but not perfect
","I'll start by saying that I did enjoy this film it had some good action sequences, great performances and packed in enough nods to bond films past to satiate any fan. But this film suffered from a fairly uneven script, and had quite a few gaping plot holes. Firstly the villains motive to get revenge on M was believable and refreshing but also poses a few big questions. How was he funding this revenge scheme? Where did all his henchman and helicopters come from? Why did he allow himself to be captured when it served no real purpose other than to serve as part of a far too elaborate to be believed master plan? why steal a list of MI6 agents kill a couple and then just give up on the rest? Also the bond girls character was basically superfluous and merely a plot device to get bond laid and in the company of the bad guy. And two words anyone will laugh at upon seeing this movie, komodo dragons! I very much enjoyed the scorpion scene, the scenes of bonds tests at MI6 bond and m's relationship was also a positive aspect of the film. The action sequences had a few very cool moments most of which were spoilt by the trailer, but overall felt slightly lacking I think the movie could of done with some more characters on the bad guy side of things I personally would of had the main villain sell the list of agents to a terrorist cell and use them to service the action sequences and have some cool assassination of MI6 agents sequence. But the film did is job by leaving me wanting more from Bond still."
"svetiev_b","7","1","5","24 November 2012"," Not the best Bond film...
","Quite frankly it was rather dull. I even felt like getting up and walking out of the theater, but thought to my self - I paid money to watch this in our brand new Cineplex theater and I'm gonna last through it. It didn't help much as I felt wanting to hit the fast forward button on an imaginary remote controller for the cinema ... wouldn't that be great - having a cinema theater all for your self with a remote and everything? :))<br/><br/>Now back to the movie. It's short comings weren't the fact that it didn't have any gadgets in a digital era or that it was going for a retro style, I was quite psyched up about that actually. <br/><br/>It was the story. Something about it felt ... uninteresting. Maybe the fact that we've seen it all before in other movies, lots of clichés; I know, Bond movies are all about clichés, but these clichés were just out of character for a bond movie ... at least to me. Like having a bisexual villain resembling the Jackal, Havier's character even looks like him with his dyed blond hair. Although Havier's performance is one of the best in the movie.<br/><br/>Then there are the unexplained parts of the story which bothered me, like how did Bond survive after being shot in the beginning.<br/><br/>Secondly, (spoiler ahead) Bond has a clean shot of Silas in the underground tunnels just before the train drops down, but no he actually has to chat with him and let him detonate a bomb. There was no reason to delay shooting him, they had already contained the situation with the compromised data!? Not to mention that Silas has a point blank shot at M at the hearing and misses just because he delays his shot, come on, you'd think a trained ex agent should be able to make such a shot blind folded while taking a whiz.<br/><br/>And lastly the movie took almost an hour before it got started, Bond movies are supposed to take your breath away, leave you breathless, not leave you yawing in the middle of it.<br/><br/>A trade mark of this movie have to be washed up secret agents which are quite (I mean considerably) down on their game.<br/><br/>On the up note, the music was quite nice. I really liked the brass rendering of one the Bond motives, actually the music is what kept what little was left of my attention and at moments I caught my self just listening to some of the music rather than watching the movie."

","Not as good as the hype says. Craig is as dependable as ever, but get on with the next movie as time is not on your side. Hope he can hold on for another movie. The usual formula of car chases, boring gambling and explosions held together by a paper-thin plot. So many opportunities for the baddie to kill M, why pass them up? Why did Bond draw the baddie to Scotland when he was so unprepared? Why make great show of some assassin cutting through plate glass to poke a gun through to easily shoot through the same plate glass in the building opposite? Why put Bond in Norman Wisdom's jacket? - not going to frighten anyone! References to earlier Bond movies were read as lack of originality. And finally - would M drink product-placed cognac from a whisky tumbler? I think not! The Scottish house looked like a cheap model and probably was. Especially in view of the lavish budget, not good enough Mr Mendes, must do better."

","007- Bond...James Bond is a genre that is supposed to operate within strict parameters of predefined structure. A structure that was created decades ago. Skyfall bravely breaks all the rules and reaffirms change is inevitable. If you want to watch just another Bond flick, then Skyfall will most probably disappoint you. It is not the typical Bond film where you forget to breath until the film is over and Bond emerges victorious- as as unscathed as freshly cast stainless steel- nothing less than a super hero. <br/><br/>But if you want are brave enough to get in touch with reality, portrayed with mesmerizing cinematic visuals, Skyfall is a must watch. This movie gives you everything that you were not expecting and still is a fun ride. The action is good but not up to the mark in comparison to other Bond movies (with the exception of the beginning chase and train-roof sequence). The script was not compact enough but offered an additional perk of thought-provoking, brilliant dialogues. <br/><br/>Skyfall is more about maturity and intellect and less about glamor. It marks a transition - Skyfall - is a film about a system that backlashes on its benefactors. A guardian who a is a cold-blooded murderer with purpose and no regret. A villain who is wronged and hurt but still has style and humor. And finally, a hero who is imperfect and old but committed and invincible in essence.<br/><br/>PS: The title sequence is a treat - typical 007 - one of the best when compared to other Bond films."

Dame Judi Dench is a great actress and here she gets a lot of screen time. The script is taut and the climax mind blowing.

But there is a small time-line problem which might be ignored because Casino Royale was a reboot and the time-line of his previous missions might be changed a bit but indefinitely it was hell yeah awesome and Sam Mendes really does some good work rather than the traditional Bond experience. It gives the reboot of characters Moneypenny and Q which I felt was a good touch and awesome actors were chosen for the roles.

"raypas69","10","2","17","3 November 2012"," What a 50th birthday gift for 007. Sean Connery was finally given his successor in maybe the best Bond movie ever!
","After the Pierce Brosnan era, it had become painfully clear 007 was in desperate need of a thorough renewal. ""Die Another Day"" in my opinion was the absolute low point. Main reason was that the movie went completely over the top. Another reason was that after 40 years the character was still stuck in the 60's and never evolved in any way. He had become superficial and predictable which in the end made him pretty dull, a caricature actually. But then in 2006 there was Daniel Craig in ""Casino Royale"" and what an entrance he made. The storyline went back to basic and James Bond became a man of flesh and blood. All of a sudden he became a character of great interest again. He absolutely still is 007 but now he has his flaws and weaknesses but above all the predictability in his character is gone. The necessary update from the 60's to the present has finally been made. The movie itself was fantastic and perfectly showed the enhanced 007 to the world. Sadly enough ""Quantum Of Solace"" was not able to match ""CR"" but still it was way better then most Bond movies in let's say the past 30-35 years. And now there is ""Skyfall"" and I have to say Sam Mendes has not let me down. The movie exceeded every expectation I had, it is even better than ""CR"". To me in every aspect, from start to end, ""Skyfall"" really hit the spot. In his 3 movies Craig has been able to dust of James Bond and he finally successfully guided 007 into the 21st century. Until ""Skyfall"" Sean Connery has always been THE James Bond. His successors (Lazenby, Moore, Dalton & Brosnan) have shown to be no more than acceptable and ultimately almost forced James Bond down on his knees. Craig with his interpretation luckily brought him back to life and in such a successful way that Connery may have to share the no. 1 position with Craig. He made the realization of the new James Bond a fact but at the same time he also brought him back to the very first beginning. And that, at least to me, is the best 50th anniversary present I as a Bond fan could get ... I was given back James Bond!"

"ryan-craven","9","2","17","31 October 2012"," 007's 50th Anniversary is celebrated in style.
","Skyfall is notable for two reasons, it is the first Bond movie to have an Oscar winning director at the helm, and it has been released on the 50th Birthday of this most celebrated and quintessentially British franchise. These two elements, along with a fine cast, tight plot and supremely intelligent scripting make this one of the best Bonds ever.<br/><br/>Yes, this may seem like a bold statement, but it can be justified. The opening sequence is a masterclass in action set pieces, Mendes proving in the first 10 minutes his Bond will be no pushover in the action stakes. In fact, no action in Skyfall fails to thrill, and they all differentiate nicely (unlike Quantum's dull, Bourne carbon copy fist fights). More important than the action, is the wit and humour the script gives Craig, who, whilst considered the best Bond since Connery, has been criticised for his distinct lack of a sense of humour. Indeed, in Skyfall, Craig becomes the perfect Bond, successfully balancing the brooding with enough dry witticisms. <br/><br/>Suitably for this momentous occasion, Mendes' film manages to reinvigorate 007 as well as celebrating it. The re inclusion of Q and the classic gadget filled Aston Martin DB5 help achieve this. Another throwback is the inclusion of a proper Bond villain, eccentric Cyber Terrorist Raoul Silva, played with creepy style and charisma by the ever impressive Javier Bardem, accentuates the feeling of evolution and wistful nostalgia. The tight plot keeps the action coming, and provides some truly brilliant moments. Most importantly, however, is the exploration of Bond and M's (an outstanding Judi Dench), that manages to ring true emotion, a treat rarely experienced in a Bond movie. Even if the climax only manages to disappoint, the wonderful epilogue brings Skyfall back to undeniable brilliance.<br/><br/>Verdict: Skyfall manages to be cool, emotionally charged and witty whilst in no way sacrificing action. 007 is back."
"supreeta-arya","9","2","18","4 November 2012"," Uncritical admiration
","The image that a typical Bond Movie evokes is one of glitz with hot women, sexy cars and cool gadgets.. how many times have we seen that and wanted more of the same...who wants to grow up? And if that is what you are looking for...Skyfall may not be your poison. I went with an open mind wanting to see what Mendes wanted to convey .. the new genre of 007 movies with Daniel Craig have a different feel ...personally I love them....but Skyfall is in a different league. Casino Royale was an apt beginning..portraying young vulnerable Bond at the start of his career Quantum of Solace fell slightly short of expectations.but Skyfall has a new dimension . It's time for both Bond and Bond fans to mature and introspect... which I suspect is the reason why it did not curry favor with many. Sam Mendes has lent a depth to Skyfall, either not perceived or not to the taste of those who criticize. <br/><br/>The opening scene has the usual high impact drama in Istanbul and Daniel Craig with his oozing machismo so very well fits the role despite an older looking Bond, the appeal is immense..A breathtaking train fight, an inadvertent shot by his own accomplice under the orders of M (who has her own desperate compulsions as the Spy Chief ) and the plummeting of an injured Bond far below ...predictably into deep waters... Of course 007 has to survive...and Skyfall then is the journey and survival of a not so perfect Bond in a real world It is the tale of mind winning over matter.. of will, wit and grit over wear and tear.Problem is that when it comes to Bond, most rather prefer exciting fantasy to sombre introspection..<br/><br/>The frustration of failed tests and the pain is well conveyed by Craig with his haunting eyes and expression... don't we all know that feeling?.. honestly the breezy nonchalance of the Roger Moore Bond used to be annoying to me. Today's Bond though is in a real world with its despairing uncertainty and danger yet ""made weak by time and fate"" ( how brilliant to make M quote these lines of Tennyson) and in a catch 22 situation...and how does he deal with it? Bond's foray is a lesson unto us. What appeals is that he is a doer, an action man, not one after power , but dispelling his duties , however difficult or absurd that may be , unquestioningly with a passion and will power that overcome his disabilities. He says he knows everything to be known of fear, that at once dispels doubts of the foolhardiness and cloaks his daring in admirable light and Craig is so convincing.His devotion to M hint at the emotional side to him <br/><br/>Although portrayed as a substance addict and womanizer, what is contrary is that he loves each woman with a passion and sincerity that leaves the woman happier than she was.. and no false promises qualities that do not conform to the dictionary definition of the same. The villain is played to perfection by Javier Bardem  he steals the limelight at times...his resentment against M has a pathos to it.. you cannot entirely dislike him . M on the other hand has a darker aspect .. the ruthlessness with her agents, but her softness for Bond also manifests. Skyfall has characters with shades of gray but Bond steps out from the shadows and stands tall ..making the choice of facing death every day, yet enjoying Life with a passion and energy, at times reaching the doorstep of death, yet choosing resurrection and duty... a modern Sisyphus..Bond lives life full without looking backBond lives in the present moment...and so is alive every minute....if only we all could do so Seen from this viewpoint, I don't think Skyfall can disappoint,it touches somewhere deep and restores faith...."

And let me tell you something, he is great as a director, I never though that Skyfall was going to be that good. Daniel Craig is an awesome actor and so is every one who is in this movie. The script for this movie is so good, it has some connections with the previous movies that are really funny. Skyfall is a well elaborated film, with a lot of suspense in it and it is totally worth watching. It is the best James Bond movie that I have ever seen, and let me tell you that I have seen the previous 22 and this one is the best. Skyfall is a cinematographic jewel and it is just perfect.

","Damn Jason Bourne. Damn the Dark Knight. How could be anyone naïve enough to compare them with this guy? Many believe that a layer of dust has settled over the antiquated spy. Many believe that he is incongruous, quite irrelevant, in modern times. Many believe that the toy gadgets are a passé. They believe they no longer require this spy who they deem as masochist, misogynist, heartless trigger happy lecher. They feel that it's time to retire Mr. Bond. But they quite forget – Bond is not just another spy. Bond is a yearning. A human being's yearning that he is not just another guy who plays by the rules of the world – but a guy who makes the rule of the world. A yearning for that almost superhuman skills, a yearning to win against all odds, a yearning for those fast cars, a yearning for that adrenaline rush, a yearning for that sweet but dangerous company of the fairer sex. Plane crashes? Yah. Nuclear disasters? I want it! A maniacal dictator? Bring it on. Mister Sarcasm, you may not like Mr. Bond. But your flesh would turn mottled green, your eyes will be eaten out by worms, everything but your bones would survive as you decompose in your grave, but one thing is pretty sure. Mr. James Bond would be quite alive and kicking asses. ""SKYFALL"" says just that. Do I think this is the best Bond movie ever? I of course do. It gave me just what I needed a Bond movie to give me. Exotic Locales. Dangerous, deviant and deformed psychopaths. The chases (car, train, bikes – your call!) that no other movie can match. But this time it gives something more!!! The movie goes back in time where it belonged. Bond doesn't need makeover. He doesn't need to toady to the blank, unemotional, fly by the day, rogue agents like Jason Bourne. All the three Bourne movies (I didn't watch the fourth) were just the same. Though I may have liked the movies, but they hardly have that Bond charm. I never really understood why we Indians like all things British when it comes to their entertainment quota. At least I do. Be it Sherlock Holmes, Harry Potter or in this case Mr. James Bond. The movie packs a powerful punch in the face of all its critics. Oh, I could have given you the details of the plots and sub-plots, but there ain't no fun like watching it! The world today isn't exactly divided in black and white. There is no sharp boundary that separates good from evil. The villains are difficult to nab. The world is difficult to control. And that is exactly why we need to shake off that smote of dust that has settled over the antiquated spy. That is exactly why we need to reintroduce such incongruity back – because that's what that makes it more distinct. The toy gadgets maybe a passé, but the trigger-happy spy is not. He would dance on the blade of sword. He would pounce upon the enemies of the state who thrust a needle in his eyes, he is ready to bear the inhuman torture that his enemies may deliver. He is ready to stake his life against all odds just for Her Majesty's Secret Service. The demons of today's world are more hell-bent on destroying the world, the pessimism about its future prospects all the more pervasive. But a sliver of light shines at the end of a circular tunnel (more like a camera lens). Do I see a man in a black suit? He may no longer like Vodka Martini that is 'Shaken, not stirred', he may not play around the exploding pens anymore. But he is still there, standing – the epitome of all things superhuman. He has raised his gun. Hold your breath. He fires. A bullet whirrs past covering drenching everyone and everything in red. You know his name, don't you? He is Bond, James Bond."

What on earth makes them think of spending tons of money on bullets but one bloody missile? I mean, you can get a chopper...I don't see why can't you buy a freaking missile to just blow the house away and kill ""three old pieces"". I mean two of them could barely run, and the last one can't hold the gun firmly( even though somehow he can make the good shots at the last gun fight). So just saying, you should make the movie more logical."

","I'm not a big fan of Daniel Craig as James Bond - although I am a big fan of his impressive acting work in other films. No fault of Craig's but I just feel he looks more like an adversary of Bond's than I imagine Bond should look. 'Simple as that. And I don't feel he has the personality I associate with Bond - the wit and humor are not there (but I believe that that is the fault of casting director and the writers, not Craig). <br/><br/>I was loathe even to see this film because I feel the producers lost their way in Craig's first Bond flicks - turning the movies into shallow bang 'em up MTV-style videos in a harsh and overly stylistic way that made the style the star instead of the story (which I felt was lacking). But my wife wanted to see this and, in the final analysis, I felt it was a worthwhile movie. It grabs your attention and entertains.<br/><br/>Here, there's a good story. It's well done and well acted. The special effects are kept in check and they don't over-dominate this movie as they had Craig's prior Bond movies.<br/><br/>I still don't feel Craig was cast properly as Bond and I still don't feel the producers are getting the Bond movie feel right. But I could watch and enjoy this film - which is more than I could say for Craig's earlier efforts as Bond.<br/><br/>Seems as if the Bond producers are overly concerned about appealing to a younger audience while paying all too little attention to staying true to their subject."
"Marblebees","8","1","6","27 December 2013"," Don't listen to all the others - this is an old dog with new tricks
","This is not the same bond as the one before and now I'm talking about the old bond. Many complain that this movie steers away from bond being classy and invisible. But it does that for the better. If you just open your mind and take in this modern bond you will see its great. And maybe i just think this because I'm a different generation. I didn't grow up with the old bond movies - but the new ones. I did see the old ones first though. The new bond is of course not the same - but he still makes good movies. Now let me break down pros and cons<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>Great villain! The villain in this movie is just awesome. He seems like the sort of type that could just snap at any moment and kill everyone. He was awesomely acted - and VERY well presented. But the most important thing is that he is memorable!<br/><br/>Awesome action scenes! The action packed scenes here live up to the Bond legacy. But they have a pinch of the new bond in them. They are intense, cinematic and creative. And they are EXTREMELY entertaining!<br/><br/>Interesting spin on the Bond story In this movie Bond is not what he usually is. Hes more human than ever and more vulnerable as well. This could lead to a boring and insulting movie, but instead it shows us Bonds way back into action. This makes the story more intense and engaging!<br/><br/>Great acting! Nothing more to say - great acting<br/><br/>Perfect effects Finally a movie that embraces practical effects so much! All of the effects are well done and look awesome! and for the few computer generated effects (like the great intro) they are also cinematic and well done!<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>Some strange plot points There are weird small plot holes here and there - some things just seem like they wouldn't happen<br/><br/>Quantum of Solace spots Small spots of Bourne like scenes - much like in Quantum of Solace. Although there are only a few here.<br/><br/>All in all - the top reviewers just cling to much to the old bond. Go in and be impressed and entertained by the intense action awesome villain and different plot.<br/><br/>8/10"
"mattgrima7","10","1","6","24 December 2013"," One of the best Bonds ever
","Sensational addition to the Bond series. Again, we see Daniel Craig as a raw and gritty 007 whose relationship with M takes several interesting turns. Personally my favourite Daniel Craig Bond. Sure, the girls and corny gags have dried up a little, but the storyline, coupled with a brilliant villain in Bardem make this a Bond classic. The addition of a new Q and the work of Ralph Finnes really add a special something to this. Finnes shows a lack of respect for M's judgement and is of the belief her opinion is compromised when she sends Bond back in the field. As they have been with all Daniel Craig Bond's, the opener is brilliant! 10/10 - maybe the franchise's all time best!"
"eric262003","8","1","6","16 December 2013"," A Film That Was Customized For Sam Mendes To Direct
","In the James Bond film ""Skyfall"", director Sam Mendes has found his niche which compliments to his rather showy, but at times insipid style of filmmaking. Such films as ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"" are technical landmark for Mr. Mendes; however, the movie is sadly left without a soul. With the immaculate houses, the gorgeous pompadours and the well tailored suits are a mere distraction to the rather wooden characters portrayed in those movies. And the more free-wheeling affairs like ""Jarhead"" indicate to us that Mendes has very limited methods to his direction. While these movies had a plethora of good things going for it, it seems the Mendes' comfort zone rests on rather straight-forward concrete film as opposed to uneven films where the audience needs to dissect the film to draw his/her conclusions. It's obvious from the movies I mentioned that Mendes needed a film where he can adjust himself and lowering his lower qualities in his filmmaking. James Bond's ""Skyfall"" is the key component to Sam Mendes' comeback.<br/><br/>James Bond is the perfect compatible friend that Mendes needs to make a movie to suit his comfort zone. Bond is cunning, remorseless and has his mind set on fulfilling his initiatives. What a match made in movie heaven! In addition to that ""Skyfall"" is the rightful vehicle for Mendes. It's filled with intrigue, it's suave plus it's a paradise full of beautiful evenings, awesome penthouses, exciting casinos, loads of alcoholic beverages, and vibrant lights. The excitement never stops. The opening scene situated atop a moving train which highlights the angry encounters between Bond (Daniel Craig) and the diabolical Silva (Javier Bardem) is a sight for sore eyes. The other memorable fight in Macau is saturated with both style and substance. ""Skyfall"" has a steady flow that avoids scenes that end so abruptly or refrains from any awkward moments. The colors are magical as well the women are beautiful and the cinematography by Roger Deakins will likely put a smile to your faces.<br/><br/>The perfect rivalry comes in the perfect form of Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem as Bond tracks down his adversary with the feeling of real life hatred between them. The supporting thespians are just as equally effective with Ralph Fiennes, Judi Dench and the well-learned Ben Whishaw as the gadget expert Q. The much talked about theme song by Adele is so beautiful it fits right in there with the Bond theme. The final showdown is both epical and at the same time uplifting, it shows that Mendes was spot on in dedication and confidence in his work. ""Skyfall"" truly represents what a Bond movie should be and in this vehicle the director deserves most of the credit here."

","'I like you bettah without your Beretta'...he says gently into Severin's left ear in the shower, and her reply: 'I feel naked without it...' With that kind of scene dialogue, and almost half-way through the film, you'll eventually begin to realize you're watching not only a subtler and more refined version of earlier Bond films, but a new genre of them: more seductive musical scores, better background scenery and fewer external distractions which stay tighter with the anticipated action - and impeccably filmed and edited scenes. Nevertheless, your memory will recognize the initial intent within any Bond film: to alert, instantly, on the dramatic - and which exercises one's heart to full capacity in one of the finest movie series ever to hit the big screen."

Bond returns to his past.<br/><br/>The franchise is really hitting its stride with Daniel Craig. The first half is the glossy polished 007. The iconic scene is James Bond jumping onto a half demolished train. He lands solidly and slowly brush off his jacket then he catwalks off. It's all flash. Even when he's shot off the train and left for dead, then he returns as a weakened 007, the movie still churn out it glitzy wares. Then it truly turns as we see the iconic Aston Martin. It turns gritty. We lock ourselves into an isolated English mansion. The only thing I find odd is the Home Alone booby traps. They should leave that improvised weapons to the comedies. Overall, this is a high point of the recent Bonds."
"stefanlsb","8","1","6","2 August 2013"," Truly epic film
","This film is without a doubt one of the best Bond's ever. This 'it's not a proper Bond' line is simply rubbish. There is a crazed Villain, Money Penny, M, Q, some sex, great music (including a proper theme tune), an Aston Martin DB5 solid action scenes and unexpected twists and turns in the plot around every corner. This was the only way you could do a modern Bond film without breaking too many traditions. Die Another Day was awful, Casino Royale was good but not 'Bond' enough (for me anyway) and Quantum of Solace was simply a terrible film.If you preferred Quantum of Solace, then I suggest that you go see a Bourne film. The plot holes people here mention are not plot holes, as they are explained in the film. <br/><br/>I believe this to be a 'relaunch', so that we can have some even better films in the future. This was Mendes' 'Batman Begins'. I for one cannot wait for his Dark Knight."

There is no doubt that this film is a very good film, but I find myself asking the question: 'it is a good Bond film?' as it somehow doesn't feel like a great Bond film, as I am failing to remember a distinctive moment such as Ursula Andress' famous scene or Halle Berry's or even a moment with a bond car or gadget doing the unexpected. However I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film and would definitely recommend it to you. Bardem is an extremely good villain and Dame Judi decent as ever puts in a top performance as M. There are some moments where you wonder why didn't they just do this? But that just isn't the Bond style to do it the easy way now is it?"

I was very impressed with the outcome, it was very well scripted, there was tense parts and the ending was very emotional. Casino Royale was good, Quantum of solace was OK, and Skyfall was amazing. It doesn't get a 10 out of 10 simply because i thought some scenes where a bit boring and dragged on for example when Bond meet the new Q was just too dragged out.

","First I want to get the title out of the way, when I think of the term skyfall I think of things falling out of the sky. Or maybe of the old ""sky is falling"" overreaction to an incident. But it isn't any of that, ""Skyfall"" happens to be the Scottish estate where James Bond grew up, and it is where the big finale of this movie happens.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is OK as James Bond , but I grew up seeing all the old James Bond movies and Craig looks more like a beaten-up prizefighter than he does an M6 special agent. He is an acceptable actor, but this film succeeds, if it does, on the story. And for me (and my wife) the story just didn't resonate much. It wasn't very exciting, for a Bond movie. A secret list of agents and their cover names, on a jump drive, encrypted, and a rogue agent with a grudge threatening to expose them all.<br/><br/>Judi Dench is back, and effective, as M (or is it 'Em', short for Emily?). But to me the real star here is Javier Bardem as Silva, the rogue agent. We know Bardem is good, from his prior roles. But here he is the only actor that is superb, chillingly so. He is such a good actor he makes all the others seem very ordinary in comparison.<br/><br/>The movie has its requisite chases and fight scenes, and a few gadgets, but nothing that approaches what we have come to expect from Bond movies. The franchise needs to be energized, they need a new star, new writer, and new director."

"jamesflashlawton-543-60607","9","1","6","2 May 2013"," Happy 50th Mr Bond
","Let me start off by saying, I had very little faith in this film. Been an Englishman and a movie fanatic I always feel somewhat proud of the James Bond franchise. Its without a doubt one of the most successful movie franchises of all time and its British, so I have much love for the series. Now the reasons why I had little faith. This been the 50th anniversary, I still had memories of the 40th anniversary film Die Another Day (2003) not a bad film but really not a great swansong for Pierce Brosnan (come on Invisible cars, no thanks). Then there is the matter of Quantum of Solace (worst title name ever?). I was disappointed with that film, the work they had done on Casino Royale just got flushed away. But thank god this film is Right! In fact its more than right.<br/><br/>With Sam Mendes directing straight away I thought oh okay American Beauty, so it could be art house cinema, will it work. And work it does, yes its Bond with the usual mix of Action, Drama, stunts and finally a touch of humour, but with Mendes at the helm you knew you would get some great cinematography too. The Cinematography by Roger Deakins is just breathtaking, the scenes in Shanghai and Macau are just beautiful the colours and all the lights of Shanghai just mesmerize, one scene in particular takes place in Shanghai, adverts of Jelly Fish moving with lights all around becomes the only light in a dark scene and what a way to light it, it all looks Art house cinema like.<br/><br/>The film starts off with one hell of an opening, we meet Bond trying to locate a computer hard drive in Turkey. With a female agent in tow (Naomie Harris). He chases the man who has the drive right through the city, we get motorbike chases through buildings, markets and on rooftops and its just brilliant only bad thing for me is the use of CGI. (the CGI again I know its my Bane!). Some scenes in this chase they placed Daniel Craig's face straight over the stunt driver with CGI looks bad to me but hey its the only thing that let me down in this film, they could of done it old school long range shots so we couldn't tell it was the stunt man (maybe I'm just to old school). No spoiler here its in trailer, our hero gets shot by the female agent and ends up falling off a train. This missing hard drive has the names of undercover agents, so as you can imagine they have to get this back, which doesn't help poor M who is now under the watchful eye of Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). Bond returns and needs to get back to peek condition to get out to field, we are introduced to the new Q (Ben Whishaw) who is amazing as Q. We may think he is too young but even Bond thinks so, and we get some wonderful chemistry between them both, it works so well.<br/><br/>Our heroes journey for the information and who has it, takes him through the before mentioned Shanghai, Macau and a great climatic showdown in Scotland (they had to use the home Country of the legend Sir Sean Connery). And what a climax it is like if they gave the cast of Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2012) a Home Alone (1991) booby trap type house and some shotguns you would not be far off this climax. The Villain in this drama of Cat and Mouse happens to be the great Javier Bardem, who is just legendary as a Bond villain, he could go up as one of the great ones.<br/><br/>Now we know Bond has to have a ""Bond Girl"" so enter Judi Dench as M... Hang on am I right, well she might as well be called that because there is no else, and when I say Bond Girl I don't mean in the usual sense! Its a stroke of genius from Mendes because its not the usual Bond film, M and Bond sort of discover more about each other and each others past, which builds up on such a close ""bond"" of friendship (good pun.. Well I thought so) they develop. Talking about Judi Dench, an actress close to my heart, she was born and raised in the same City (York) I was born and raised in! She is amazing in this film stealing scenes as ever in her role as M, and this time we see a very human and vulnerable side to M, she pulls off so well.<br/><br/>Another scene I adore and was given away by a Top Gear special and various clips on the TV, is the return of the Aston Martin from Goldfinger (including ejector seat) this for me was amazing it took bond back to its roots for me, and the music even returns much to my pleasure. They had to celebrate 50 years of bond with a reference or two.<br/><br/>This is not just a great Bond film, this is a great film full stop. The set pieces, the acting, the cinematography, the direction, the stunts, the cast and the drama all works so well together fully deserving of its best British film Bafta award. Thank you for these wonderful 50 years Mr Bond and long may you carry on! This Review is taken from my movie blog http://james-giant- movies.blogspot.co.uk/ please check it out."
"manusanchez90","9","1","6","4 April 2013"," One of the three best movies in the 007 saga
","I am a huge fan of James Bond and Daniel Craig, saw this one with very high expectations and must write that""007: Skyfall"" is no doubt one of the three best movies in the 007 saga in my opinion. To me, the other two are ""007: the world is never enough"" and ""007: Casino Royale"". What is sure is that the latest one is the most profound Bond movie. It is the only one that mentions something about Bond's childhood. The movie is not based in any tale or novel written, so the script is original. Sam Mendes had never directed any movie from the action genre, but surely he has done a good job. His dramatic trace is present in the movie, but it is not easy to identify it because this movie has almost nothing to do with what he directed before. The typical Bond's topics are present in this movie and the action scenes are frenetic. The film is well paced even though its pace may seems a little irregular, partially because it is the longest in the saga. The real fans of Bond (like me) will enjoy more the movie thanks to some details I will not explain here. This is a very ambitious script. The photography is very nice, like in all Bond movies, but in this, London appears much more minutes than usual. Pay special attention to the opening scene in Istanbul. The theme song sung by Adele is nice, as well. The acting is excellent. Judi Dench is the best M of all times. Daniel Craig continues to be great as this Bond, who is a real tough guy. I do not like Javier Bardem much, but I must admit that his performance as the evil homosexual ex-agent of MI6 is good. The rest of the cast does an excellent job, as well. The plot will amuse everyone interested in the movie and even has some twists that nearly nobody expects. In conclusion, the strong point of the movie is that it is the most profound (the real fans will understand it after watching it), contains amazing action scenes, the opening scene, a beautiful photography and strong performances. On the other hand, the irregular pace is its least strong point. I did not mean that it is so irregular, there are just contrasts between some scenes and other. Moreover, those who are not real fans of 007 will not take as much advantage as me from ""007: Skyfall""."
"joelsephthkid","8","1","6","2 April 2013"," Fantastic!
","This is by far my favorite James Bond film! They were able to add a lot more when they wandered from Ian Fleming (this is the first 007 film which wasn't based on a novel). This film has excellent chase scenes, including one which uses basically every means of transportation. This movie is extremely unpredictable as well, unlike some Bond films when you know what's going to happen five minutes into the movie. They had a perfect villain; a touch of absolute vermin with a hint of criminal mastermind. It was interesting to see Bond not in his complete element for part of the film as well, seeing as he's usually absolutely unbeatable. There's also quite a few easter eggs from other Bond movies which were fun to see. I would definitely recommend this film!"
"Mikel3","Null","1","6","4 March 2013"," The best Bond in years even with it's flaws
","We saw Skyfall on DVD Saturday night. I have some issues with the story, still it was the best Bond film I've seen in ages. It confirmed for me that Daniel Craig is the best actor to play Mr. Bond since my favorite, Sean Connery. The film was loaded with action like most Bond films. It also contained some interesting back stories on Bond's roots and that for some of the other characters. If it had ended better I would have liked it even more.<br/><br/>Warning - stop now if you have not seen the film. Spoilers are coming.<br/><br/>I didn't like how the white slave girl was killed during the target pistol challenge to Bond. Bond makes his move to fight right after she's shot instead of before in order to save her. It should have been written differently. He had more or less given her hope he would save her on the boat. The Bonds of the past films would have done more for her. This Bond hardly seemed fazed by her impending death.<br/><br/>The villain was played very well. You could even understand his hatred for M. Problem is that his escape from the cell and the way he played Bond's agency made them all look like total knuckleheads. Would it have hurt to put a good padlock on his cell in addition to electronic doors? They knew their systems had already been compromised once.<br/><br/>I thought the way it ended with Judi Dench's M dying was a mistake too. I know they were going for the emotional impact. Maybe it was how she paid for the lives of the agents she'd sacrificed. She was even willing to write off Bond if it meant saving more agents. Now it was her turn. The problem for me was Bond had spent the last part of the film doing everything in his power to save her life. He even totally destroyed his ancestral home. And worst of all the classic Aston Martin from Goldfinger. It was so nice to see the car back, then they totally destroy it. It was so silly that M escaped onto the moors through a hidden passage only to then start walking with a bright flashlight. In the dark that flashlight showed exactly where she was to her pursuers. She might as well have sent up a flare ! Then she hides in the only other building left standing. If they had simply hidden on the moors in the dark with the flashlight out they never would have been found. Also, there should have been an army there to help protect her after the attack. Instead she has only Bond. If they were using this as a way to show that Bond still had what it takes to be the best, they should not have made all his efforts to save her be in vain. The ending I would have preferred was her retiring. Maybe even hinting that she was going to have some sort of relationship with that grounds keeper and retire to a simple life for her final years."

"djkoz78","8","1","6","12 January 2013"," Skyfall probably the most emotional Bond film I've seen.
","I have read several user reviews and I respect everyone's opinion however I must disagree. Out of all the reviews I've seen most of them universally hated the film. Most of the time I'm on the side of my fellow IMDb users because I usually will read the so-called professional film critics and then completely ignore what they say and make up my own dang mind. I've also found that I trust most of the USER reviews over most Film Critics to be perfectly honest. Alas this seems to be one of the rare times I disagree with the users and actually agree with the critics. (GASP!) I know it shocked me too.<br/><br/>I'll try to keep this spoiler free as best as possible in fact I'll try only reviewing this based on how I felt about the film. OK Like all Bond films it opens up with a fast paced action scene with Bond chasing who could only be a bad guy and then quickly devolves into James Bond feeling like he's been betrayed by the Espionage MI6 company he works for. Typical plot points for spy films. However I noticed that they were putting a more realistic side to 007 that they have never really done before. Now I can admit I have never seen every single James Bond film ever but I did grow up watching most if not all the Sean Connery era Bond and some of the Roger Moore and I believe I have seen all the Pierce Brosnan along with all of Daniel Craig. So I hope I can give an informed review. Now to all the purist I know most of you feel that Sean Connery will always and forever be James Bond. I can agree that Sean Connery was the best Bond so far but the Bond films were not the best.<br/><br/>Skyfall is probably in my honest opinion one of the best 007 film I have seen. I say this because it's a more realistic James Bond. I noticed one reviewer listing either what he thought was plot holes or something he didn't like. One I believed he named was something to do with Bond running to catch up with the villain Silva (Javier Bardem) instead of stopping a police officer or getting a vehicle to catch up. It's such minor scene and yet they don't really show how Bond catches up so off screen Bond really could have stolen a car they just don't explain how it happens because it's showing M at a the hearing. Yet he mentions the older Bond films especially the Roger Moore Bond films and how they're so much more realistic. Seriously!? Like how a car can flip over and ski upside down while shooting its guns and killing the cannon fodder enemies? Or better yet the Buzz Saw in a yo-yo like device? Should I keep going the Laser Watch? The Invisible Aston Martin? How about the Hat that could cut your head off. What about the main villain telling 007 his whole plan of taking over the world then putting him in a ridiculous death trap and then walking out leaving the trap to kill Bond without actually verifying him actually dying. Instead of pumping 2 bullets into Bond's head? That to me is unrealistic and thank god the new James Bond doesn't follow these plot devices anymore. They even make a joke about it in Skyfall.<br/><br/>""No Mr. Bond I expect you to die!"" Now the movie was longer than it should have been and I prefer Casino Royale's action to Skyfall. And I absolutely hated Quantum of Solace. So I'm not biased towards Daniel Craig and his Bond films I just think that they added a more realistic side to Bond films than any other film so far. Most Bond films always made James Bond as a super suave good looking spy who never let anything compromise his missions not emotion, losing a friend, always had the right gadget in the most dire of situations. It didn't matter if he was shot, injured, drunk, or completely tied up with no escape he would save the day and then have time to bang the hot chick who just met him 30 seconds ago. He was an unemotional unstoppable killing sex cyborg with a genius level intellect who never makes any mistakes. Which is why I like Skyfall because he isn't portrayed this way. He is still an incredibly suave extremely efficient killer, MI6 Agent, and generally will stop at nothing to complete the mission, but in Skyfall he's having to deal with feeling betrayed and being injured and loss. Also dealing with the fact that he's not a young buck anymore and it might be time for him to leave MI6 for the younger guys. The director (Sam Mendes) put in the human element. That James Bond is not perfect and bad things can happen.<br/><br/>Now it was a little slower than a lot of Bond films but for me that doesn't detract from the overall movie. I don't need explosions every 10 seconds or I'm falling asleep or start watching another movie in my head. I just think that overall it was one of the better Bond films. Casino Royale is my favorite still but Skyfall is definitely worthy of the title. So for other Bond fans who like the Daniel Craig films I hope you enjoy it. Don't take my word or anyone else watch it yourself and make up your own mind."

","Who ever though Sam Mendes would direct a Bond movie? Don't get me wrong. He makes great movies, but, with American Beauty a masterpiece, but a social satire, Skyfall seemed out of genre. Nevertheless, Mendes takes it on and nails it. One of the most intriguing aspects of the new Bond is the way it was filmed, the elaborate camera angles, and the expert sense of cinema paradise is breathtaking. <br/><br/>Next is Daniel Craig. In Casino Royale, he looked promising, then in Quantum of Solace we doubted his confidence in the role. Now he's got it mastered here in Skyfall. He has all the intensity of Connery, but a small vulnerability can be sensed as well, a vulnerability never sensed when Connery was on screen. Here, in this role, vulnerability is good thing, as long as it comes short and subtle. It helps to create more of a sense of humanity within the Bond character. <br/><br/>As Skyfall drives down the road that is its ever winding plot, there are many decisions to be made. Shall we go right, or left? To use to word in its non-directional fashion, Skyfall goes right. Mendes and the producers are smart enough to see temptations leading to formula and an overdrawn linear plot, and they steer clear of any such cliché. Skyfall is an intelligent, well- paced action thriller that restores our faith in films of its genre."
"kishore_govind","8","1","6","16 December 2012"," Good but lacks the depth
","Skyfall is a long-awaited film thanks to MGM's financial woes, but it delivers. Skyfall takes a darker approach as we've seen with the past couple films and it's very character driven, yet Sam Mendes and the screenwriters still provide a massive injection of fun.<br/><br/>Yet, what struck me is the chemistry between Bond and Sévérine. She trusted Bond and Bond proved worthy of her trust. I personally thought it was a significant regret that she died of a terrifying death.<br/><br/>I love it because of the fresh approach Sam Mendes took with the visual part and the story. I hate it because Sony has postponed it for two years (despite new Bond is one of their most profitable movies) so Daniel Craig is looking as a retiree now.<br/><br/>The action scenes are greatly choreographed and filmed, having a modern touch without relying too much on computer effects."
"gstuteley","9","1","6","14 December 2012"," Great Action Movie
","At 2 hours 23 minutes, this is a long film - but it did not feel like it. It starts off with a frenetic shoot out, car, motor bike, train chase that sees the destruction of dozens of cars, wagons, stalls, bikes and even a train carriage! I did not time it, but it probably lasted 10 minutes or more. <br/><br/>It is in about 4 segments, each of which could almost make a film in its own right: Bonds chases assassin who steals list of secret agents; Bond goes after the former secret agent (Silva) turned rogue assassin; Silva wreaks havoc on London, trying to get at M; Silva goes after M in Scotland.<br/><br/>The film is about two main themes: Revenge and Relevance <br/><br/>Revenge: The rogue assassin, Silva is a former British agent, who believes (with some justification) that M sold him out. He has concocted an elaborate plan to gain his revenge on her. How plausible this plan is could be challenged - it seems to depend upon a lot of chance things coming together in a somewhat unlikely fashion. <br/><br/>Relevance: M is under attack from the Government about whether she is competent, on the one hand and whether there is even a need for her department on the other. Likewise, Bond is under pressure to demonstrate whether his skills are still relevant, on the one hand and whether his body is still up to the job (""it's a young man's job"") on the other. <br/><br/>Is it a good film? Well, let's suspend belief, because Bond films are not really meant to be plausible. There is plenty of breath-taking action, some snappy dialogue, some good acting, a bit more character development than the usual Bond film and some pretty wild imagining. The 143 minutes goes very quickly and I did not want it to end. So I would give it the ""thumbs up"". Really exciting and absorbing film and possibly the best Bond film to date."

","Skyfall is one of the better action movies out there.<br/><br/>I suppose I could end my review there, but that would not be enough of a reason for me to be here. I would like to issue an open complaint in a form of a question: why do even good action movies insist on introducing a few lines of stupid dialogue and preposterous plot points? Surely someone has to read the script once it is done and approve it, and then approve the movie itself once that is done. What is the problem of the man or woman producer who watches how when something occurs in the movie one of the character has an annoying tendency to describe the event out-loud and the producer, upon seeing this, does not go: ""no wait, that has to come out coz that just sounds f&*$ing retarted. It looks fake and stretched.""? Somehow, no memory of such action-movie annoyances rises when recalling the good old James Bond featuring Roger Moore, so when did it start creeping in? Skyfall does not have too many of such moments but enough to be distracting.<br/><br/>It is good to see an action movie not involve the story of a nuclear bomb threat, but Skyfall's story is not exactly original either. We have yet another vengeful operative wreaking havoc upon the agency and Mr. Bond is up against both the villain and father time, both of whom have been moving on leaving Mr. Bond behind at a disadvantage.<br/><br/>The whole thing moves like a James Bond flick and makes sense as a whole, but if you did try to actually think Skyfall through scene by scene, the flow looks a bit bumpy and common sense questions can be raised quickly - obviously something that must never be done when watching an action movie.<br/><br/>There is not much to say of the acting, other than that Javier Bardem was brought on board as the villain and Javier to Skyfall is what Anthony Hopkins was to the Silence Of The Lambs, i.e. a good villain like that makes half the movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes are greatly choreographed and filmed, having a modern touch without relying too much on computer effects."
"chandanshivaramu","7","1","6","22 November 2012"," Slightly Overrated...Falls short of Casino Royale.. big time.
","I wonder how people get biased when they get to see a Bond film set in very English locations viz., London and its surroundings.. Yes, it has some great retro moments with old styled action sequences, great music and a vintage Aston Martin car coupled with Ice cold Craig.<br/><br/>Is it the Best Bond or the top 3 Bond titles ever? I don't think so. Just because it has those retro styles, you wouldn't consider it a Classic.<br/><br/>Coming to why i found this movie just another good action thriller: 1) very unattractive Miss Moneypenny.. Yes, she may be a star in Hollywood but just doesn't fit into Moneypenny's role. She reminds me of pre-Thriller MJ.. her face just looking like him in every angle including her hairs. No doubt she wears such alluring clothes but falls short of being sexy or alluring. 2) very short screen time of Berenice.. She is just awesome looking like a crossover between a (mandarin + Latin = french).. actually she really is..;-) but her role is nowhere near any of the other great bond girls we have seen earlier. Just when her characterization reaches a critical point, she is unceremoniously thrown out of the movie. Her screen presence is just electric..!! 3) Javier Bardem.. likes to go on and on with his monologue speech which looks ludicrous at times.. and funny most of the time. Mads is 100 times better in my opinion. 4) The story looks promising but somehow the role of other agents and other millions are very feebly characterized. 5) Its just another day in office for Daniel Craig.. he is in his usual cold self.. i wonder why other reviewers rate him as the best.. is he suave or charming or charismatic? a strict no. Sean Connery is any day better than him. DC has absolutely sub zero comic timing...!! 6)Coming to the action sequences .. the only thing which is unique is the climax which is brutally shot and kudos to the director..<br/><br/>Considering all the above, i found QoS to be so top notched Bond movie..i would say its the 2nd best bond movie after GF. Finally its just my opinion, you may have an entirely different view to this.."

I have to say that this time around having an African American bond girl is awesome. I especially loved who they got to play Eve/Miss Moneypenny. After seeing her in Pirates of the carribian this is a much better role for such a beautiful woman. I was expecting allot more than this movie dilivered in case of a 007 movie.

"TheUnknown837-1","7","1","6","11 November 2012"," If James Bond did not do what he does here, we would probably be asking for a refund
","There is plenty to like about ""Skyfall,"" the latest of three James Bond films starring Daniel Craig. It has just about everything that a fan of this long-running series of spy movies could want out of it: well-choreographed action sequences, snappy one-liners, a good sense of humor about itself without condescending into self-parody, and a memorable villaineven if he is unforgettable for possibly the wrong reasons. But I had an unusual reaction to the movie. I enjoyed it as a whole, but the things that I liked best were the cinematography and the misc en scene: two attributes that can be primarily credited to director of photography Roger Deakins.<br/><br/>Deakins is one of the most unsung geniuses floating around Hollywood for the past thirty-some years. I don't know how much cinematographers get paid, but I hope this guy is getting rich. When a film producer hires this man to light up his sets, the audience is bound to be impressed. His work in ""Skyfall"" is no exception and demonstrates Deakins' willingness to experiment from film to film. Usually, in movies like ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""Fargo,"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James,"" Deakins flourishes the camera lens with colors. He does the same here, but this time has an especially fun time playing around with shadows. The film's two best action scenes (one set in a Shanghai skyscraper, the other in a remote English field with a mansion burning in the background) applies both of these to the hilt. I particularly liked the shots with Daniel Craig, as 007, running across a frozen pond with the inferno blazing behind him. Craig is silhouetted, and the orange strobes of the fire cast brilliantly against the ice. Lighting is not as easy as many make it out to be, and Deakins' work here is jaw-dropping in its beauty. Another sequence, more psychological-focused than action-driven, set in a Chinese bar with Komodo dragons kept in a pit beneath the customers, is also pretty to behold.<br/><br/>Cinematography is a key element, but it cannot necessarily make or break a movie. Thankfully, Deakins was put onboard a good project that would have done well even without his genius. This new Bond film is considerably wittier and more exuberant than the last one, ""Quantum of Solace,"" in which Craig's performance was about the only saving grace. Craig is still his usual self: physically fit, commanding in his presence, and uncannily suitable for the role. He still is, as far as I'm concerned, the best Bond since Sean Connery. Sadly, we don't get much of a Bond girl this time (in fact, Judi Dench, as ""M,"" spends more two-shots with Craig than Naomie Harris, Berenice Marlohe, or an unnamed character early in the movie, all of whom are the romantic interests). Craig has a steamy scene (literally) with one of them, but there's not much chemistry or interest between them. Bond does get sexually approached by the (male, mind you) villain of the picture. Javier Bardem's performance, and the scene where he plays homoerotic mind games with Bond while he's tied up (stroking bullet wounds on his chest) is something that would have never gotten by in the old days. As for the big scheme that puts the third act in full-speed, it's the typical mastermind plot. Nothing new, but then again, sometimes the familiarity is the whole idea. What's more shocking than the scheme is Bardem's comically over-the-top performance. He's more funny than he is charming or intimidating. Just how much of the humor was intentional and how much was inadvertent (the last part of the climax comes to mind), I cannot say, but Bardem, though hamming it up, is not boring for a second.<br/><br/>My only big reservation about ""Skyfall"" concerns the dramatic parts of its third act, in which it explores James Bond's past. Some movie characters, like Indiana Jones or James Bond, really are best with their histories left unexplored. Let's face it: just how much do we care how James Bond became James Bond as opposed to seeing him seduce women, driving motorcycles off bridges, and fighting bad guys on the brim of a skyscraper? I also would have preferred to hear more of the classic James Bond theme. The music by Thomas Neuman is good, especially a suspense cue that reminds me of the late Jerry Goldsmith, but I can still remember the old classics when John Barry's guitars and trumpets would start strumming whenever Sean Connery would so much as walk into a room or step out of a car.<br/><br/>My few quibbles aside, this is a solid November release. And it does reaffirm the old theory put forth by film scholars generations ago that sometimes the formula is exactly what you want. After all, if James Bond did not do what he does here, we would probably be asking for a refund. And one final note about Roger Deakins. I'm sure he will get his tenth Academy Award nomination for this movie. Would it be too much to ask that he gets to take home the gold this time? I confess I haven't seen every 2012 release so far, but none has left images in my mind as long as ""Skyfall."""

Though the excitement begins right with the beginning scene, it won't last longer. But I like the movie because it has everything shown 'Real', everybody, esp, the Villains' character.<br/><br/>To briefly explain the plot in 5 steps:<br/><br/>1 Bond dies in a Chase but returns/resurrects 2 M officially orders 007 to identify the Villain, meanwhile she faces Political stress. 3 Bond traces & arrests the Villain(a former M16agent), but he escapes 4 Bond takes M to His childhood place, Scotland-Skyfall building to Rescue from Villain 5 Villain traces, destroys everything, Bond kills him but M dies from her earlier wound.<br/><br/>The movie has few breathe holding action(natural) episodes we would normally expect from Daniel craigs' bond movies.

"behniwal","5","1","6","4 November 2012"," Disappointing...
","I saw this movie on the second day of it's release, which was very disappointing at that time, 'cause I wanted to see it on the first day itself. I'm a hardcore Bond fan with a personal collection of all Bond films. Which makes me question ... Is ""Skyfall"" a Bond movie? The essential ingredients of any Bond movie include buzzing action scenes, sinister plots, twists and turns, beautiful women, passionate sex, unbelievable gizmo's and death defying stunts. Where are all these in ""Skyfall""? Apart from an opening trademark action Train sequence, which failed to raise the adrenaline, the story is just an action thriller... Could have been a Van Damme movie actually. Do we want to see the human, vulnerable side of Bond? Bond is a killer ... cool, calculating, ruthless, almost inhuman. So when Skyfall showcases a weak Bond, i can only sit and protest. How did this man become human? That's not 007 for me. And lastly the movie is Dark...too dark for a Bond movie. Had it been any other action thriller i would have given it a 8.5."
"ross-heighway","6","1","6","31 October 2012"," A good Bond, but not the best Bond.
","I was anticipating Skyfall a great deal, as i am a massive Bond fan and have always liked the traditional values of the films as well as the well written story lines. Daniel Craig, in my eyes, is perfect for the role of James Bond, sophisticated and cool, everything you need to be to play one of the most renowned spies in film. And he shows that again in this film, he was brilliant in the film. Skyfall is a good film, no doubt about it, however there are a few things with the film that make it fall just short of Casino Royale, which is highly regarded as the best Daniel Craig film. One of the flaws with this film is the one-liners, there are many in this film and it ruins the sophisticated and cool look of the James Bond franchise. Another is the role of Q, the actor who plays Q in this film isn't a strong enough actor, and whenever he is in a scene it takes you out of the submersive view that the film has put you in and back to reality. However this film is a good film and should definitely be seen, however if you're wanting to watch the best Bond movie ever, then this is most certainly not that. Try Goldfinger."
"Ben_Horror","7","1","6","29 October 2012"," A low-key and not very action packed Bond
","In 2006, Martin Campbell directed 'Casino Royale' starring the then controversial choice of Daniel Craig. The casting of fair-haired Craig marked him as the first Bond to be blonde and – unlike his predecessors – the first actor to play Bond who was under six-foot (for the original producer, the late Cubby Broccoli, this would have been something of a strict no-no). The decision was greeted by almost widespread disapproval (heck, someone even set up a website to vent his fury at the decision)and things were not looking good. However, the risk paid off and Casino Royale turned out to be one of the best Bond movies in recent years. It did good business and laid the groundwork for the follow-up (and sequel, of sorts – a Bond first) 'Quantum of Solace'. While still being a huge hit, the words ""boring"" and ""hard to follow"" were not exactly uncommon place at the time. Which leads us onto the latest movie 'Skyfall' – the twenty-third in the franchise (that is if you don't count Sean Connery's 1983 venture in 'Never Say Never Again' and 1967's 'Casino Royale' starring – ahem – Woody Allen as 'Jimmy Bond').<br/><br/>After an operation goes wrong, Bond goes missing in action for a while – not in the least helped by the actions of M (Judi Dench). Meanwhile, a shadowy and ruthless figure from M's past comes back to haunt her by first of all exposing the names of undercover agents before moving on to more explosive tactics. This forces the now embittered double-o-seven to put his anger aside and return from the 'dead' to help his boss out with this latest threat to Queen and country. <br/><br/>First thing's first: there is a lot that this movie does right. The entire cast are excellent. From a fantastic opening scene and the refreshingly low-tech opening titles which could have came from the seventies (a far cry from the CGI drenched titles of the Brosnan years) to the title song, sung in an unshowy, understated fashion by Adele, this movie marks a return to the basics in a way unseen since From Russia With Love. You see, Skyfall is not really about set pieces and gadgets; it's more of a drama this time – but with some action thrown in. <br/><br/>As with the previous Craig movies, this kicks off with a – surprise, surprise – chase. Whereas Casino's was on foot and Quantum's was in cars, this one starts on foot, moves to motorcycles before ending up atop a moving train. Make no mistake: it really is riveting and on edge of your seat stuff, but it's something that comes back to haunt the filmmakers later on Yes, you've guessed it: this movie suffers from a severe aliment known as 'The Dark Knight Rises syndrome'. What this means is the opening is SO good and spectacular and sets the bar so high, whatever comes after it can only hope to live up to it. And unfortunately, as with The Dark Knight Rises, Skyfall also shoots its load too soon and although it tries, never quite lives up to the breathtaking opening.<br/><br/>There are some aspects of this movie that don't make any sense. They may be a legacy of last minute script editing and if this is the case, it really shows. For example, in one part of the movie, Bond and co discuss a certain evil character who has no country/nationality/next of kin and is basically a 'ghost' with no permanent base/home; yet Bond quickly gets the location of his next destination via a simple text. In another part, Bond is taken to meet Silva - the bad guy of this movie (a fantastic Javier Bardem) by boat. While on deck, he takes out a homing device and puts it in his pocket. This understandably has bad repercussions for Silva and leads inevitably to the obvious question: why on earth wasn't Bond frisked beforehand? Meanwhile, in another scene, two people are trying to flee stealthily from a violent shoot- out/assault in a rural area so as not to alert the ruthless hit men; yet they don't have the gumption to avoid switching on their flashlight which alerts the bad guys. It is silly moments like these that really drag the quality of this movie down a notch. There's no excuse – the makers have had four years to sort this stuff out. And let's not get started about all the product placement <br/><br/>The rather odd thing about this movie is it cost a reported two hundred million dollars to put up on the screen, but it does not look it. James Cameron was able to make Avatar for just forty million more and in 3D. For the amount of money that was spent on Skyfall, you kind of expect spectacle, i.e., envelop pushing action scenes. In general, most people come to see Bond movies for the excitement and the action. Who can forget the helicopter/roof chase of 'Tomorrow Never Dies'? Or the huge, multiple tanker truck set piece at the end of 'Licence to Kill'? With the exception of the exciting – and spectacular opening scene -sadly, the set pieces here are few and far between. There's a few sporadic action scenes scattered throughout the long running time but they're so brief as to not stand out like previous Bonds. Yes, Sam Mendes may have took the admirable step of taking things back to its 'roots', but it comes at a cost of the very thing that Bond is known for.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while Casino Royale still remains the benchmark of the Daniel Craig outings – if not also the best Bond movie of the last fifteen years – this is still a huge improvement over Quantum of Solace, and makes for an engaging two-hour plus of good story telling. It's just a shame that the number of large-scale action set pieces can be counted on one hand."

Also I agree with one of the reviews here that I read - the list just seems to get forgotten about.<br/><br/>What I can't believe is that people pick these films apart as if they're supposed to be realistic. There is nothing realistic about them, so why ask why Naomi only had one bullet etc. In these types of films, you have to just go with them.<br/><br/>Judi Dench as M, who is in danger here, is marvelous, and Javier Bardem is an absolute scary, crazy scream as Bond's nemesis. Daniel Craig is wonderfully handsome and in excellent shape. He's a brilliant actor and totally wasted in these films, but I suppose the money is fantastic.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes lets his receding hairline show and drops his leading man status here, and he gives a steely performance.<br/><br/>There are enough explosions, car chases, fights, shootings, and train wrecks to last a lifetime.

"lesleyharris30","9","2","21","2 November 2012"," Action Packed, one of the Best Bonds yet,
","Skyfall is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a magnificent cast. I found it to be one of the most gripping, unconventional Bonds yet. It is an action packed thrill ride from beginning to end, without forgetting to contain some slower, dialogue based moments that takes time to develop its characters. There are also a lot of decisions made throughout that are unexpected from a Bond film, some character choices, plot development, as well as a gripping scene between 007 and the lead antagonist that is somewhat humorous. It makes for a unique experience that fans have not seen before. <br/><br/>It did tend to drag at certain times, probably one of the most slow moving outing for Ian Fleming's creation. Sam Mendes clearly wanted to take the time to add humanity to these characters and bring the pacing down to do so, clearly taking inspiration from his previous work, such as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, which is fine, however, there does come a stage where we, as an audience, begin to desire some action and intensity, there were stages were they kept us waiting for too long. <br/><br/>The cast is top notch from beginning to end. Daniel Craig shines, as always, in the lead role, the charisma and natural screen presence he has as Bond is undeniable. Judi Dench is spellbinding as always, and the lead villain, played by Javier Bardem, steals every scene he is in, a threatening, likable character who we almost route for. This film also includes the introduction of three new actors playing classic Bond characters, Naomie Harris is an excellent fit for Eve Moneypenny, Ralph Fiennes is fantastic in every role he has, Gareth Mallory being no exception, and Ben Whisaw is without a doubt my favourite Q, charming and quirky all at once.<br/><br/>It is an experience unlike the previous films. Action packed, stunning visuals and dedicated performances, I would recommend Skyfall to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. <br/><br/>MI6 comes under attack and Bond must prove his loyalty to M and find the people who are responsible. However, after Bond is accidentally shot, he loses some of his skills and must get them back.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Daniel Craig"
"williampsamuel","9","1","7","17 January 2015"," The Best Bond in a Very Long Time
","Bond is back. After the fairly standard Quantum of Solace and repeated delays due to funding problems, MGM and EON productions have gone all out for the Bond franchise's 50th anniversary, and the results are spectacular.<br/><br/>In his third appearance as James Bond, Daniel Craig continues to show why he is the best man for the role. Suave and sophisticated, intelligent, immensely physical, able to go from deadly serious to playfully charming at the drop of a hat, and showing utter disregard for procedure and authority, Craig epitomizes everything we love about the character. His earnestness and skill as an actor make situations that would otherwise be ridiculous believable, or at least nearly so. Connery will always be the best Bond, but Craig comes in a fairly close second.<br/><br/>And as with the previous two films, Skyfall continues to deepen the character and give us a sense of who he truly is. Not merely a playboy or a killer, Bond is a man of duty and honor. Given an easy out and every reason to give into bitterness and turn his back on Queen and country, he still returns to save the day yet again. He puts himself at the greatest risk again and again, not for money or fame, but for someone who has used him, taken advantage of his past circumstances, and made it abundantly clear that he is expendable. That he chooses the course he does is truly the mark of a hero.<br/><br/>Judy Dench is to be commended as well for giving her best performance yet as M. In the face of failure and disaster she is unshaken. Tired, doubted by those above her, and beset by enemies professional and otherwise on every side, she remains resolute, offering a powerful defense not only of herself but also of her profession. I was also glad to witness the return of Q, and highly approve of his re-imagining as a young computer wizard. In reinventing the character the filmmakers have both made him more relevant for the 21st century and avoided any hint that the new actor is merely a replacement for the late Desmond Llewellyn<br/><br/>And casting Javier Bardem as the latest villain was inspired. As Silva, Bardem evokes memories of Alec Trevelyan and Francisco Scargamonga, with a hint of Hannibal Lector and strong overtones of Anton Chigurh. He is an absolute genius, easily on par with Blofeld in his ability to weave complex plots and predict his enemy's moves. He has all of Bond's knowledge and skills as an agent, and then some. And he is utterly insane. There's something about him that produces a powerful sense of unease the moment you see him, one that is greatly heightened by his every word and movement. In his first meeting with Bond, the interplay between the two is sublime. Their rivalry is a perfect game of will and wits.<br/><br/>This being a spy thriller there are of course plenty of gunfights, chases and explosions, all of which are expertly done. The movie starts strong with one of the series' best pre-title sequences, a fast paced car and foot chase featuring one of the most original uses for construction equipment ever put on film. The 'fight of the silhouettes' is another high point; a sort of martial arts meets Cirque du Soleil. And nothing beats the drawn out final showdown, with its gunplay, massive explosions, and surprisingly emotional finale.<br/><br/>And the icing on the cake is that Skyfall always knows just the right tone to strike, and always nails it. It's funny, romantic, somber, or heart pounding exactly when it needs to be. It knows when to be a tense, serious thriller, and when to go for goofy, over the top action. It even manages to be self referential at times, with homages to previous films, including an important appearance by a very famous car. And unbelievable as it may seem for a Bond movie, Skyfall has a clear message: There are still threats to our safety and freedom lurking in the shadows, and that's where they must be fought. MI6 is as relevant today as it was at the height of the Cold War, and so is James Bond. Here's to the past."

","I am neither a fan of the genre nor the franchise. The only reason I decided to watch this film is because Daniel Craig and I support the same team.<br/><br/>So there I was started watching Skyfall. First part of the movie was kind of slow. I started regretting my decision. Then it started to dazzle me, with beautiful visuals, film editing and cinematography and sub plots. They didn't introduce us anything new. It was all recycled from regular action movies. But the way they executed the small parts, I can't find the proper adjective to praise them. All the minor pieces that makes a film, they were proper class in this film. I am hooked up. I mean before watching Skyfall I didn't care for James Bond series. Sure I would have watched a spy film every now and then. But that was it. And now I am eagerly waiting for the next James Bond film. In my book that's a huge success, hooking up a new fan who thinks the spy genre is lame.<br/><br/>This film is pure class. Probably the classiest film I've watched in my life. And dare I say the best British film of all time."

","Just watched this again today and I loved it as much as the first time I saw it., last time I watched it was in the cinema when it came out. I love Bond films, but had watched very few after Roger Moore's stint, Dalton and pierce just left me cold. then came casino royale, I bought it on DVD after reading positive reviews and I enjoyed it. so when sky fall came out I returned to the cinema to watch it, the first bond film I'd seen at the cinema since octopussy, I was not disappointed. Daniel Craig is just relentless in his pursuit, the quick quips are still there, but it's sarcasm not the jolly one-liners of Moore et al.The opening scene/chase is a thrilling edge of the seat experience, better than the parkour scene in casino royale, Bardem is an excellent baddie, with a misguided sense of the grandiose on a mission of revenge against his former employee. A great theme song and title sequence, some great female companions, the return of the db5, Bond taking matters into his own hands to get the job done, yep all the elements are there for classic bond!"

","I had heard a lot from friends and family about their impressions of Skyfall. Some with film backgrounds, some without, but I can honestly say their was a severe divide between everyone about this film. Some absolutely hated it whilst others thought it was the best Bond film yet. Needless to say, I went into that cinema with mixed emotions.<br/><br/>Thankfully, these soon dissipated after an enthralling action sequence which started off the film in good strides. Motorcycles being thrown at cameras and riding across rooftops; Bond and his assailant committing an epic train fight stunt; and a thrilling cliff hanger right before the opening titles, all told the audience the old Bond was back with some new tricks. The impressive detail to cinematography, set design, and editing were absolute standouts amongst all the production values for Skyfall and the heads of these departments should be extremely proud. Continuity and makeup were lacking precision in some scenes but that's forgivable in light of the film's scope and vision. Speaking of, Sam Mendes' exceptional directing skills shone throughout this film, with his intentions clearly sustained for the film's entirety. Acting gongs must be given out to Javier Bardem for his spine-chilling portrayal of Tiago Rodriguez, a name I won't be forgetting in a while, and Daniel Craig of course, for managing to show us Bond's various weaknesses in the short time he was given, amongst all the bravado we know him for.<br/><br/>Finally, and possibly the most impressive element of the whole film, was its introduction of ""the new era"", a term constantly referred to throughout the film. The point was well-made by the production team that the Bond we all know and love is no more. A world of guns, grenades and Bond girls is no match for the new wave of ""cyber crime"" we are experiencing each day. As the ""new"" Q comments ""I can do more damage on my laptop, sitting in my pajamas, before my first cup of Earl Grey than you can do a year in the field."" Bond-lovers who expect the crew behind this legendary story to maintain the ""old ways"" are told repeatedly throughout Skyfall they are foolish for expecting such a thing when the world is constantly changing and its up to Bond and Mi6 to keep up the best way they can.<br/><br/>Skyfall is for me, everything I love in a Bond film. Action scenes were a step above the precedent; new characters provided a refreshing change to an old narrative; and the focus and care taken by the production crew in all their capacities is inspirational. Its films like these that makes me want to work in the film industry. Well done 007.<br/><br/>More reviews available at mayakavanagh. blogspot. com"

","This is my favourite Bond movie ever made period. The film combined Daniel Craig's almost dark acting persona with an amazing storyline to create a film that I just couldn't get enough of. Unlike Craig's first Bond movie, Casino Royal, this one, although just as long, didn't drag on all day. I appreciated the quasi-criticism of calling the shots via proxy, as M did in the first scene, which saw Bond almost getting killed. Through events such as that, this film went beyond the typical action movie in it's plot and acting. With Javier Bardem playing the villain we saw one of the creepiest and oddest characters in last year's films -- a man who gained practically no sympathy from the audience. When Raoul Silva (Bardem) killed the Bond Girl in cold blood it left me in total shock and made me really hate the character -- I really wanted Bond to get this guy. The look back into Bond's childhood put this film past the superficiality of typical action movies. When he blows up his childhood house in order to stop the villain it put Bond's country and the lives of others beyond his vanity which is something no Bond has done in the past. Honestly, I thought Javier Bardem deserved a Best Supporting Actor nomination but the academy, like so often, disregarded this as a real film. In short, this was one of the best movies of 2012."
"ggallardoc","9","1","7","27 May 2013"," Skyfall. Bond rises
","Using the terminology of the Dark Knight trilogy of my admired Nolan, I can say that James Bond has emerged from the abyss into which it fell after the disappointing Quantum of Solace. SKYFALL is presented as the film that celebrates the 50th anniversary of the series, a high bar that far exceeds.<br/><br/>Eye spoilers! The argument is born and dies (and this is not a cliché) with M, Bond's boss with the wisdom embodied by Judi Dench usual. The plot revolves around the theft of identities list of MI6 agents, a sort of revenge carried out by the villain of the movie, our Javier Bardem, which does very well as bad, surely one of the best of 007 films.<br/><br/>I could say the same about the movie, but Casino Royale is unsurpassed. The direction of Sam Mendes, which gave us American Beauty and Road to Perdition, is just remarkable, is beautifully filmed and photographed, with a small section of the film lacks pace perhaps, but very good overall. Daniel Craig continues to confirm that is the best Bond, the places you visit are so incredible as always, the Bond girls breath away when they come on the screen and the plot is very entertaining. As the film progressed I felt as trapped, although the room was not the room 25 Kinepolis wonderful as I remembered my friends conveniently.<br/><br/>An anniversary like this needed a Bond to match, and the continual references to characters, gadgets, villains (tribute to shark included) and cars in the series are to thank for the fans of it. The time that the new Q presents James is anthological dialogue with really bright. Just leave two data without revealing: why the title, a success over the tape and the replacement of a character to be at the summit."
"mjlong1985","9","1","7","25 February 2013"," My favourite Bond film
","*CONTAINS SPOILERS* (don't read if you haven't seen this film and plan on seeing it, also contains spoilers for Die Another Day) <br/><br/>Skyfall marks the 50th anniversary of the most successful movie franchise in history and it is appropriate that this special anniversary is marked by the greatest Bond film of all time.<br/><br/>One of the major strengths of this film is the acting. The supporting cast - featuring the likes of Helen McCrory, Rory Kinnear, Berenice Marlohe, Naomie Harris and especially Ben Whishaw, Albert Finney and Ralph Fiennes - is outstanding but the best performances come from Javier Bardem and Dame Judi Dench.<br/><br/>Bardem is absolutely wonderful as the central villain and is one of the best villains in the entire series. He is so good that there was talk of him getting an Academy award nomination, which is unheard of for a Bond villain. He doesn't actually make an appearance until half way through the film but his presence is still felt (there is echoes of Joseph Wiseman's Dr No here), he is in the shadows and causes massive problems for MI6. When he finally appears, the viewer isn't disappointed. He is camp but threatening at the same time, is very mysterious and has a real grudge against the secret service and especially against M. He gets captured but somehow manages to escape, which was a great decision by the writing team as it makes him appear more of a threat.<br/><br/>Judi Dench is even better as M. Back in 1995, many people were sceptical about this particular role going to a female given the massive success the legendary Bernard Lee had in the role and the skill set required to play this character. These people have been proved completely wrong and Dench's M is one of the best characters ever to appear in this franchise. In this film, she has a pivotal role that allows her to fully showcase her amazing acting talents. Her first discussion with Mallory (played by Fiennes), her courtroom scene and any scenes involving her and Bond are all examples of this. Her death at the end is quite emotional and Mallory (the new M) has a lot to live up to.<br/><br/>The cinematography, score and Adele's song are all excellent and it was good to see these all get nominations at the Oscars (with Adele deservedly winning).<br/><br/>The only minor problem I have is that no explanation was offered for how Bond survived getting shot in the opening sequence. In the novelisation of Die Another Day by Raymond Benson, a reasonable explanation is offered for how Colonel Moon escaped almost certain death in the opening sequence of this film. Something similar here would have been excellent.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is absolutely excellent and is actually the best film of 2012 beating off some very strong competition. It is a shame that the Academy didn't give this film what it deserved in terms of awards and at least a best picture nomination.<br/><br/>It is fully deserving of a 9/10."

"biffyclyrolover","9","1","7","11 December 2012"," Skyfall begins a new age of Bond films.
","The Good: Daniel Craig is as great and badass as ever in this new type of Bond film. Despite looking old and rather haggard, he is still brilliant in his role. The concept of James Bond's age is a really interesting one. Is Craig the best Bond? I would say him and Connery are tied in first place. <br/><br/>Great intro with action and tension right off the bat. <br/><br/>Amazing opening credit sequence with Adele's Skyfall really blending well with the design of the sequence.<br/><br/>Judi Dench as M. She has given a consistent and excellent performance since Goldeneye and hasn't stopped for this film. Here, she is at her best. <br/><br/>The return of Q (Ben Whitshaw) and Moneypenny (Naomi Harris). Two beloved characters of the films return and are superbly played. Q is a young man, not old like John Cleese or Desmond Llewelyn, breathing new life into the character and Moneypenny is still hot but wraps up her transition from field agent to desk worker very well.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory. Interesting story and great performance. <br/><br/>Direction by Sam Mendes. The director of American Beauty and Road To Perdition has not lost his touch. Amazing cinematography and dark lighting give the film a very Dark Knight sort of feel to it. This may not be a reboot, but the direction makes it feel like it is. It's started a new age of James Bond films and has jumped a long way since making James Bond wear a clown costume in Octopussy. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva, the antagonist. He is a villain with the motivation of revenge. But, although this motivation is common as muck, his reasons for wanting to kill M are reasonable. Plus his performance is just amazing. Do I see an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor on the way? You bet your ass I do. <br/><br/>Brilliant 1st and 2nd acts, which really draws you in. There's always an undercurrent of humour and quiet scenes which show off the cinematography before kicking your brains ass (in my alternate universe, brains have asses, don't question it) for falling into a lulled sense of security with a brilliantly shot action scene. Excellent pace!<br/><br/>The Bad: The third act definitely starts sinking the film a little, trying to go into the title characters back-story. Most of it is good but that's when you start to feel that the film is 2 and a half hours long. With the first and second acts, it only felt about an hour long. This is where the film dragged like a ship that hits a mud-bank.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10. AWESOME!!!! Brilliant story, characters, cinematography, references to old James Bond of the 60s to 80S, it's all around amazing. Only thing that keeps it from a perfect rating is the third act, which could have been done a little better. But it's a damned amazing film, definitely in line for an Academy Award or an Oscar. Is it the best Bond film ever? Well, yeah. Affleck and Jackson had better not disappoint with Argo or The Hobbit because this film could be unbeatable."
"diane-34","9","1","7","11 December 2012"," There can be no need for more action
","Diane and I saw this wonderful movie this afternoon and at least I and probably she also were stunned by the amount of choreographed action sequences. I watched the entire older Bond films last year on TV in a retro-viewing of them and I found too much action and not enough intrigue. Skyfall was much the same as those older script outlines but having said that I found this new Bond film more edgy but saddled with too much new century action. It reached the point of me wondering when it was all going to end. I gave the film a 9 because it was an excellently worked action film but with no ""twists"" and little suspense; this action however, was good enough to maintain our interest In terms of the acting: Judi Dench is memorable as are the other players with on-screen time and speaking roles. The destruction in the action sequences is truly amazing and the cities where it takes place also deserve billing because they provide an extraordinary tableau upon which these sequences are played. Watch this film and this last sentence will make perfect sense. Even if you come away with niggling little concerns as deleted in my observations you will still, almost certainly, have enjoyed your afternoon or evening."

","23 movies into the Bond series and someone (Sam Mendes) can still manage to maintain the fantastic Bond experience is beyond words. Not only is this definitely one of the best Bonds but one of my personal favourites. People are saying that there isn't enough action and my response is 'get a grip'. There isn't a film in this world that only has action and you can still take seriously. No good film is without talking. And this film is a terrific Bond. As soon as I heard Sam was directing I had to see. If some other unheard of director was doing it and would have said no immediately. It must have been hard for Craig as well. Casino Royale=Best Bond<br/><br/>Quantum of Solace=Worst Bond<br/><br/>Skyfall=Incredible I have no time what so ever for Quantum it is horrific nobody really liked apart from Craig fans and even they didn't really like. <br/><br/>I certainly recommend this film to anyone who is a Bond fan or loves film as this one is superb."
"jvetrau","9","1","7","8 December 2012"," The most controversial Bond
","This is one of the best films in the series because of its fresh approach. It's focused on Bond's personal story and reveals a lot of his personality (it's happened only in Licence to Kill earlier). It's heartrending because of the development of the relationship between Bond and M. It's fresh because most locations are in the UK not in exotic countries.<br/><br/>And this is one of the worst films in the series because it's ruined the unique way of telling the Bond story as a trilogy that was started by Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. They were building something massive with the idea of a huge global organization that is a total mystery. But they're buried it for a simple formulaic revenge story.<br/><br/>I love it because of the fresh approach Sam Mendes took with the visual part and the story. I hate it because Sony has postponed it for two years (despite new Bond is one of their most profitable movies) so Daniel Craig is looking as a retiree now.<br/><br/>I love it because it has so much respect for the classic movies in the series. I hate it because of the main villain is a clown (despite Xavier Barderm acting abilities) and the new Q is a joke.<br/><br/>I love it because it turns the story around again. And I hate it because its broken expectations set by previous Daniel Craig movies. It's one of the most controversial Bond films ever."

","I am not really a Bond fan but I decided to go this one as I hadn't seen Daniel Craig in the role and the reviews had been good. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the film a lot but there is no doubt the highlight was the performance of Javier Bardem as the villain, Silva. He marks his first appearance in the movie with a memorable speech about rats and after that he steals every scene that he is in.<br/><br/>Judi Dench as M has quite a big part as she and Silva have a history. Craig as Bond didn't really convince me.His acting seems one-dimensional and po-faced. Let's face it. The whole idea of the indestructible, unaging secret agent is slightly ridiculous so it should, up to a point, be played with a slight wink to the audience. Maybe I'm being patriotic Irishman but I think Pierce Brosnan did a better job of it than Craig.<br/><br/>""Skyfall"" is good Bond movie, not as groundbreaking as some reviews make it out to be. Bond fans will love its spectacular locations and dramatic action scenes. Others like myself will be giving thanks for Javier!"

","This wasn't the best or worst Bond. I thought Adele who sang the theme did a great job but I felt producers put her in the role to appeal to a new and younger generation of Bond who are not aware of the films. A few weeks ago my friend came up to me and said 'did you see the new bond movie, that old women at the end died' I got ticked off as 'M' the old lady was a very central character in the films and the reason he was attracted to the film because of Adele and was not aware of the history of the films and Ian Flemming's characters.<br/><br/>At first I was a bit sceptical of Sam Mendes directing the movie but the end result was outstanding. The casting was great but one person I felt didn't match their role was Naomie Harris who played Moneypenny.

","After being let down by Quantum of Solace, I was afraid to revisit Bond on account of his new ""wanna-be-Bourne"" look and acting. Thankfully, this film shattered my expectations and is a clear indication that Bond is coming back strong.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig soars as a man that has been beaten and destroyed, but somehow refuses to give up. I mean, was anyone worried that Craig would be the worst part of this film? Seriously, I can't think of a film he has been the worst part of, and of course he just kills it here. This guy IS James Bond.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent. Kudos to Judy Dench as ""M"" for bringing a more emotional and involved role to that character. The villain is amazing as well. Silva is easily one of my top three favorite bond villains of all time now. His first five minutes of screen time contain the best dialogue in the film. I just wish he could have had more time on camera to really scare the audience.<br/><br/>My gripes? After the first action scene it takes a long time for the film to really get going, and too much time is spent with establishing shots of the scenery, but these early scenes are ripe with Bond's character development, so I'll settle there. Also, as the movie progresses, the plot starts to really narrow down to three main characters and the conflict between them, and while this enhances the emotional impact, much of the complexity is thrown out the window.<br/><br/>Still this is the best bond film since Goldeneye. Welcome back Mr. Bond."

","I happened to catch Skyfall last night and all I kept thinking was that somehow this Bond would be inferior to QoS. I was totally wrong! It was actually pretty damn good. <br/><br/>The car chases were great, the story was good, the action crisp and the villain was just...something. Javier Bardem did a great job as a villain. There was just an interesting presence about him. It just made his character become more along the lines of a Super- Villain. He's no Blofeld, but hey he did a great job.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig with his stoic Bond behavior did a good job playing out the legendary agent. However, I felt he was getting tired of this role and the fact that this was it, the conclusion of the Bond saga. The bond women, I was questioning. The theory that the 1st girl usually dies but here, the bond theory is broken! That blew me away but what really made me happy, the Aston Martin DB5 is back! (Thank you Top Gear for that one)<br/><br/>All of those just blew my mind and I left the theater happy. All of these factors made this Bond a stunning conclusion to the 50 year saga. There were a few minor details that I didn't appreciate but overall, Skyfall gets my approval. Overall, 8 out of 10."
"rhymelyric","6","1","7","12 November 2012"," A Good Bond movie for the die hard fans but not much else.
","This is a good movie. I just want to get that out of the way because I don't want to come of as bashing this movie as being bad, because it's not. The problem then is that this movie is not great. The feeling I got when watching this film can be compared to the feeling that fans of the Miami Heat had when they watched their team play it's first season after picking up LeBron James, they must of felt like "" this is good but should't it be even better?"" This movie should have been better.<br/><br/>If the movie was judged based on the intro song alone, it would easily be ranked higher than the previous Daniel Craig bond films but that is the only part of this movie that I liked better than the previous two. The things I like less are many, for instance, the mystery seemed to be solved too quickly, the villain never really seemed threatening enough, and the action seemed spaced to far apart and awkwardly implemented. In fact the pacing was probably the biggest killer for me, it was as if they did't know where they wanted the film to go next and they just added scenes until they figured it out. Then there is the character development that seemed to be nonexistent how supposedly important characters never really made an impact enough to be adored or loathed by the audience, they literally just seemed to come and go without attributing much at all too the story. I counted two charters that could have had most of their scenes cut and it wouldn't have made much of a difference at all to the movie. The villain never seemed crazy enough, or intelligent enough, or diabolical enough, he just seemed silly. I never felt suspense, I never felt surprised, I never felt on the edge of my seat or amazed by what I was seeing unfold before me. I felt all these things with the last two installments. Quantum of Solace for all it's negative reviews, can never be called boring but I was bored watching this. <br/><br/>So why if there are so many things I dislike about this movie can I still call it good? Because I am jugging based on the extremely high standards set by the two D. Craig bond films before this one. Those movies were great and this movie is merely good, so this seems worse because of it. It all comes down to expectations and like the Heat fans who expected a championship performance every time their team hit the court, I expected a movie that left me wanting to buy a second ticket for a re-watch be got a movie that left me ready to go when it was over like some non-bond movie so leave your expectations at the door."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Celebrating 50 years on film for Ian Fleming's creation, we get the 23rd official James Bond movie. Many critics are hailing it as the best one yet, though having seen all in the series, it is difficult to understand a proper form of comparison. The Connery run varies significantly from the Roger Moore period, and though Pierce Brosnan brought a touch of seriousness back to the role, it wasn't until Daniel Craig that the character and series took on an ultra-intense structure. Clear influences are seen in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, as well as the Bourne series.<br/><br/>This latest entry has some distinct advantages. Most importantly, Sam Mendes in the director's chair brings a love and understanding of the Bond template, but the skills to deliver both top notch action sequences as well as realistic human drama. His background includes such fine films as American Beauty and Road To Perdition. Mendes brought on famed Director of Photography Roger Deakins (9 Oscar nominations) who delivers a look and feel superior to any previous Bond film. Also, the villain plays a key role in determining the strength of all Bond films. Here, Javier Bardem offers up a megalomaniac bent on revenge, and his unusual approach immediately vaults his Silva into one of the top 5 all time Bond villains.<br/><br/>Of course, none of that matters without a strong Bond, and it is quite clear that Daniel Craig has made the role his own. This particular script from series vets Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan demands some real acting as Bond faces his mortality as well as his childhood roots. These issues combined with the physical demands of the action and the ability to toss in a few zingers, make Mr. Craig a nice fit for the tailored suits ... and the classic Aston Martin.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be Bond without the Bond ""women"", and while there isn't much familiarity of Berenice Marlohe, her Severine is interesting enough to capture our attention ... even with Komodo Dragons hovering nearby. We also get Naomie Harris as Field Agent Eve, and the argument can be made that she is weakest link in the film. Surprisingly, the real Bond woman this time is M, played once again by the great Judi Dench. Much of the story revolves around her and there is quite a bit of ageism involved. Experience does matter ... unless you are speaking of the new Q. Played with fascinating geekery by Ben Whishaw, the museum scene with Q and Bond is one for the ages.<br/><br/>The usual global jet-setting is on full display with Istanbul, London, Macau, Shanghai and the Scottish Highlands. The traditional opening action sequence finds Bond racing across Turkish rooftops on a motorcycle, while wearing a beautifully tailored suit. These are the same rooftops on display in Taken 2, but it's much more fun here. Then, as if motorcycles on the roof and through the Grand Bazaar of Turkey aren't enough, we find Bond fighting atop a fast moving train ... well, until M makes a business decision that quickly changes the arc of the story.<br/><br/>When Bond finally meets Silva (Bardem), it is on the deserted Hashima Island. We quickly learn that Silva is no ordinary criminal and definitely not one to just sit and chat. His quest for revenge adds a personal touch. His personality and demeanor and background add elements previously missing from Bond films. It's no surprise that the film's best sequence involves Bond and Silva together and the tradition of the villain explaining what's ruffled his feathers.<br/><br/>The climax of the film occurs on the hardscape of Scotland and forces Bond to come to terms with his past. There are also plenty of parental issues thanks to M and the caretaker played by Albert Finney. The personal forces at work in the script are more developed than in other Bond films, but we definitely don't get cheated on explosions, gun play and hand to hand combat.<br/><br/>As always, music plays a vital role. Adele sings the opening title track and it plays over an unusual opening credits graphical sequence - somewhat bleaker than we are accustomed to, but no less dramatic. Also, Thomas Newman's score is excellent and incorporates Monty Norman's iconic Bond themes (though not often enough for my tastes).<br/><br/>This latest Bond film is a fine bounce back after the disappointing Quantum of Solace, and it may be the best made of all films. The idea of cyber-terrorism is very timely and a reminder that not all bad guys are trying to take over the world. Some just need revenge. Determining if it is the ""best"" Bond ever will be your call."

","Skyfall has some good and bad elements: The good: Skyfall is well directed and acted. There is no weak point in any scene or performance. The movie is a throw back to the old Sean Connery movies. There is no P C messages, characters or themes. Skyfall's story and characters are just as they are. Bond is a Connery type who is a ruthless killer who is loyal for God and country. The bad guy is a whack Job who is who he is because of betrayal. The bad: Has no neat gadgets which I love to see. There is no invisible cars etc. The bond movie is void of any humor ie. like in the Roger Moore era. In the end, Drench is gone and the old Bond is returning with the introduction of new realistic characters. I give Skyfall a six out of ten. Not one of the better Bond movies but a transitional Bond movie as the series re-invents itself."

","I have seen every Bond movie made through Craig. Connery was my favorite Bond, and Moore was my least favorite. Was a very big fan of Dalton in the role and Brosnan did a fine job. Craig is now hands down for me the best Bond casted and Skyfall is the best movie. With the sad exception of character deaths this was a moving, churning, story with an outstanding cast. Dench is a wonderful M, stoic stalwart and duty duty duty. I like the new take on Q. The plot was good throughout and Bardem was a fine villain portraying a character different than he is usually associated with. Craig's Bond is a believable bad ass, if his hair was longer it would get mussed, he seems destined to work without a multitude of gadgets which I particularly enjoy. Page Eight proved that a spy flick can be very human. If you have never watched a Bond movie this is a great stand alone that will get you rolling in the current incarnation of a character that has been iconic one hell of a long time. More than worth the time to watch."

","Here's the drill - if you're like me, you gave up on Bond when Sean left, because his two prominent replacements were far too sleek, feminine, etc. Bond needs to be played by a man's man and Craig (who is far less handsome than Connery) is perfect. He understands the dimension in this seemingly one-dimensional character. But what makes this film just wonderful is old- fashioned momentum, with just enough action. This is new Bond that nearly outshines the classics. Are there issues? A few. Never mind. There is a fabulous villain, perhaps more understandable in his evil than those of the past, and intriguingly as suicidal as he is murderous. Most astounding of all is the spin on the Bond girl. She is perfection in fear and beauty, and I found it remarkable that this 'classic' had the guts to deviate from the form in making her appearance so brief."
"eshwarmail","8","1","8","12 January 2013"," A very well made action thriller not just for the Bond fans
","Easily the most entertaining Bond movie I have come across and the best after 'Casino Royale' which only beats it for its trend-breaking factor. A Bond movie is basically an action-thriller and the thriller part has been forgotten for so long until the movies with Craig started and this one complements it to the core. It got most aspects right with a good balance of dramatic elements, subtle humor (occasionally Q misfires not with the bad taste of jokes but the wrong timing), a villain to match, brilliant visuals and action sequences (I especially liked the silhouette fight in Shanghai), pulsating background score (the one with the rapid violin mixing Adele's tune and Bond's theme) and a strong climax (though the final action took forever).<br/><br/>Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed dead when a pursue mission goes bad. He comes out of his exile when he learns about the bombing of MI6 headquarters by a former agent Silva (Javier Bardem) who is planning to exact revenge on M (Judi Dench) for betraying him during his time with the agency. M is under scrutiny for the security breaches from Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) and she wanted Bond so badly that she puts him on active service even though he fails all his tests. With the body count rising, Bond resorts to isolate Silva to take him on individually going against odds with little firepower and no backing from the Agency.<br/><br/>It is not without its flaws even with all the positive chatter for example, the bad guy getting caught intentionally has been overdone these days and the editing during some action sequences did not look studio standard and so are the numerous obvious continuity errors or goof-ups. Craig looked old and may not suit for another installment but fits the part perfectly as the story recognizes his aging. The Bond girls share too little screen time unlike its predecessors. It was a surprise for me when I heard Sam Mendes will be directing a Bond movie but he actually did a fantastic job by having a good story, developed characters but also mixes all the craziness associated with the franchise.<br/><br/>A very well made action thriller not just for the Bond fans"

"sohansurag","8","1","8","14 December 2012"," The Best thing to happen to James Bond!
","Skyfall was the single most anticipated movie after the Goliath that released in July. James Bond movies have always captured a huge audience in-spite of age, sex and whatnot. Directed by Sam Mendes, I was curious enough to see how 'Revolutionary Road' helmer would craft the 23rd James Bond movie. A lot has been left in his hands and it really has to be a milestone especially when they are celebrating '50 Years of James Bond'.<br/><br/>Following a thick action sequence I was greeted to an awe-inspiring title sequence with mind-bending-cryptic-visuals accompanied by Adele's epic 'Let the sky fall' track, it was a sure sign that Skyfall would blow your mind. Daniel Craig returns, once again as 007 and there's just too many words to describe him though for one I'd say ""Unstoppable"". Daniel as 007 was introduced as a welcome change from the James Bonds we've seen previously. He was molded through the worst like we've witnessed in Casino Royale and Quantum Of Solace. Craig's James Bond always felt tough as nails yet slightly disturbed inside and even his stance felt ready to pounce, hasty in decision making that actually made way for some of the best action sequences ever. I just couldn't digest this guy once played a sidekick to Angelina Jolie's Tomb Raider. I realized that Naomi Harris doesn't have that essential oomph factor that Bond girls usually gets drenched in. And on the other hand Berenice Marlohe did have her screen time and did really well. The real Bond girl in Skyfall is without doubt, Judie Dench once again reprising her role as M. Despite everything that has happened since Casino Royale, M was the one person whom James Bond was close with and the director really pulls some strings to get the best outta them. Ben Whishaw, after his awesome performance in 'Cloud Atlas' takes on the role as Q. He made a remarkable use of his limited screen time striking both charm and drollery.Its only close to the 2nd act that we see the who'd blow your mind (no puns intended). Till now we've been introduced to only pansy foes against Bond. And its a shame given Craig's bond is so inured and isn't given a proper villain to test everything he's got. Be it Casino Royale's 'Le Chiffre' or Quantum's 'Dominic Greene', neither of em had what it takes to be true Bond villain. Enter Skyfall's Silva, a solid and finally intimidating villain for James Bond played none other than Javier Bardem. If Bond was Batman, Silva would be Joker, oozing both brain and brawn this guy is a force to reckon with and comes off as a laudable supervillain in the Bond reboot.<br/><br/>As a James Bond fan (Who isn't?) I was well received I should say. Bond ain't formulaic anymore. At least till the last decade Bond movies were so formulaic – all thanks to the cheesiest Bond ever, Pearce Brosnan, a supervillain, 2 girls one of which would turn out to be a bitch and killed off leading to an Brobdingnagian-finale. However Skyfall is the best thing that has happened to James Bond since the Casino Royale reboot. Up until the 2nd act Skyfall played the usual James Bond fare, but it was whole new ball game after that. Action-enthusiasts and not alike will like what's in store for you in the second half. At times I was left asking myself ""Am I really watching a James Bond movie?"" (in a good way of course). Thomas Newman's score was pure bliss promising espionage themes at its best. There are some great homages as well that'll please some Sean Connery fans.<br/><br/>Skyfall is for everybody, people who thought James Bond was over-rated and people who idolize him as Ian Flemming's iconic Agent 007. Yes I do question the liberties it has taken to revamp it but it was enjoyable nonetheless. This is Bond like you've never seen before and yes, 'James Bond will Return'. The apple has fallen from the tree though not so far to not be relished."
"asda-man","9","1","8","13 December 2012"," Bond is shaken and stirred!
","I'm unashamed to admit that I have never seen a Bond film in my life. They've just never appealed to me due to the sexism, clichés and tired old conventions. However, what caused me to go and see Skyfall 50 years too late I hear you ask? Well, the reviews were shining and I heard that it's almost a rebirth of the tired old Bond and my favourite critic Chris Tookey also approved the film with a perfect 10/10 so I just had to see it. Whilst it's still no masterpiece, it's sheer entertainment of the highest quality.<br/><br/>Now, just because I've never seen a Bond movie before doesn't mean that I'm ignorant to all the conventions. There's always a Bond girl for example who gets unfairly oogled over, he always asks for a Martini shaken and not stirred and a bad guy often ends up surviving at the end. What Skyfall does beautifully, right from the start is play with these conventions. Maybe not as inventively or as intelligently as say The Cabin in the Woods, but it's great to know that it realises these conventions are tired and people are getting fed up. The opening would be a real shocker, if it wasn't for the marketing campaign's which spoil it, nevertheless James Bond getting shot and failing is certainly something that should take you off-guard.<br/><br/>Skyfall sends you straight into the action. There's an exhilarating opening, shot beautifully by Sam Mendes who did that incredible film called American Beauty. It's a drawn out chase sequence in Turkey and is marvellous fun to watch and also quite tense at times, especially at the finale of the scene where M famously says, ""Take the bloody shot!"" It's also great to see M have a major role. Judi Dench is a wonderful actress and plays the hard-nosed and often humorous M perfectly. It was also refreshing to see M being the target of the villain's vendetta rather than Bond or M16 itself.<br/><br/>The film then takes Bond on a tour around several exotic locations where some cliché's are played out. My Mum dismissed the film by calling the action 'corny' (hate that word) and just having a hatred towards the Bond genre itself (Bondaphobia) but what she failed to see is that the action is no 'cornier' than any other action film, it's just entertainment and fun! There's a string of exciting and tense action sequences when Bond travels the world, and it was also surprisingly beautifully shot. However, I would argue that it did get a tad drawn out, especially in the Casino place where Bond has a long conversation with a Bond girl which adds very little to the film.<br/><br/>It's when the villain that's introduced that things become very interesting. Javier Bardem stole the show in my eyes. He played the role with a creepiness almost matching the Joker. His presence was carried throughout and he was also a very well written character, who's always one step ahead of Bond. It's just a shame that Silva wasn't introduced earlier on because I would've loved a Dark Knight-esque battle of wits between them throughout the film! I'd also like to add that Silva's entrance was absolutely brilliant with one long drawn out shot of him walking and telling a compelling tale. It really conveys his power and dominance over Bond. I loved him (not in a gay way).<br/><br/>Things only get better when the action returns to London and it does become a battle of wits between Bond and Silva. There's an incredibly chilling scene with Silva talking to M in his isolated cell and when he inevitably gets out there's a thrilling and action-packed chase to match any spectacular chase scene! The action and writing excels right up until the explosive finale in Scotland, where things become even more fun and joyous, all adding to a climatic and emotional ending, leaving any audience member fully satisfied! Another thing I loved about Skyfall was its use of humour. I laughed quite a bit, especially at the banter between Bond and M as it's obvious they secretly love each other! I've heard comparisons being made between Skyfall and The Dark Knight and whilst there are echoes, I'm afraid that this is definitely not as good as The Dark Knight! The Dark Knight has a much deeper and emotional story, with greater and more intense action sequences and characters. But if we compared every film to The Dark Knight we wouldn't be very happy! As Skyfall stands it's an incredibly entertaining and intelligent action film which left me fully satisfied. I had a lot of fun and think (if you're open minded) you might too!"

","To start, I Just loved the constant references to previous Bond Films. I found it a gripping dirty thriller with great character arcs. Skyfall doesn't have the invention and the pure Terrifiedness your are feeling for bonds life like Casino Royale has, but i must say it is a great ride and entertaining all the way through. So while it was a very good Bond film, I don't think it deserves it's billing as ""the best Bond film ever"" as it has a few too many flaws for that. It's not even Craig's best Bond outing as the superb Casino Royale still takes that honour but it is infinitely better than Quantum Of Solace, it's just a shame that they couldn't stick to their convictions about taking Bond in that new direction they had done with that gritty Bourne feel running through. Lets hope we have that back in the new one."
"dfle3","8","1","8","6 December 2012"," A quite straight Bond. 82.5+%
","This movie plays as a more drama orientated franchise outing but it doesn't do away with the humour the series is known for. So, you can include this movie in the category of more 'serious' Bond movies. It's a solid entry in the Bond franchise but I'm not sure that it will have the same 'repeat viewing' attraction of some of the fluffier instalments. That being said, it is one of the best movies of the series, but I'm sure on repeat viewing the unusual endgame will drag for some, although it doesn't really on first viewing.<br/><br/>My memory of Bond movies isn't so great, but there's probably other Bond movies which have this kind of plot to it...criminal mastermind wreaks havoc with super spy James Bond's employer, MI6.<br/><br/>In this case, the criminal mastermind is Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem). His entrance is actually delayed in the movie and if you hadn't of been bombarded by the film's pre-publicity, you could miss his first appearance...he's quite self-effacing. There is much fun to be had when Raoul met James for the first time. Dare I say that Daniel Craig (James Bond) wasn't acting when he looked very uncomfortable in his presence? Awkward! Anyway, in previous Bond movies, I'm sure that Raoul would be really camp...but here he is insane yet full of pathos at times. I'm kind of hoping that there is a deleted scene of Raoul waggling his hips and finger and saying something like ""Nuh uh!"". I was kind of expecting that to happen in any case! To the movie's credit, Raoul has a very detailed back story so he's more than just a cardboard villain.<br/><br/>The action sequences are impressive here...quite the Hollywood style spectacle, but maybe the franchise has those at ten a penny, so I didn't find them as incredible as in some earlier films...I'm probably just getting old! If I can have a little gripe here...Daniel Craig's running style...touch of the Forrest Gumps to it!<br/><br/>One thing I did find odd about this movie was some lines either James Bond himself says or other characters say to him. Odd in the sense that they didn't seem as believable coming from him/them as they would of, say, in Roger Moore's last movie as James Bond, ""A view to a kill"". I just don't think of Daniel Craig's Bond being in the same boat as Roger Moore's Bond in his final movie.<br/><br/>Adele's title track is amiable enough but it suffers from having a non-word shoehorned into the lyrics. I like other Bond themes more and even some with silly phrases in them (e.g. ""Goldfinger"") could at least be justified on the basis that it was an actual name in the movie. If Adele wasn't contractually required to use the title of the film in her song, it might have been more alluring.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie suggests to me that the future of Craig's Bond may lie in direct remakes of earlier Bond movies...ones starring Sean Connery, for example. So, I could imagine ""Dr. No"" being next cab off the rank in the Bond franchise...or ""On her majesty's secret service"". If that's right, I could quite enjoy that...Connery's earliest Bond movies didn't seem very modern...they seem dated, even for the time.<br/><br/>One of the best Bond movies."

He chases the man who has it and they have a brawl on top of a train.<br/><br/>Eve,(who is actually ""Moneypenny"")posing as an agent sent to assist Bond has them in her cross hairs but hesitates to take the shot because she might hit Bond but M orders her to take it.

She is told that she'll be allowed to retire but she refuses to leave till the matter is resolved. So she returns to HQ to work on it but as she arrives, there's an explosion. See the movie to find out what happens!<br/><br/>This time Sam Mendes takes the helm and I must say this is the best Daniel Craig Bond movie yet! The film goes back to the original Bond elements missed in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace such as music, gadgets, characters, cars and girls. Again the classic gun barrel returns but at the end of film, the film loses a star for that. The locations, big budget sets and stunts are photographed and filmed near to perfection! What made my day was the return of Bond's classic DB5 in the third act of the film. Still with the mods that were installed in Goldfinger, along with the classic Bond theme, you have one hell of the third act. Saying that however the film has some sadness with one of main characters getting killed and the DB5 getting blown up and destroyed by Bond's enemy Silva played by Javier Bardem in the last 10 minutes.<br/><br/>With the return of the original Bond elements, Great direction, acting, editing and writing this is very well in the top 5 of best Bond films. 9 out of 10!"

","Bond returns after being presumed dead to find MI6 in peril from a man with a (big) grudge against M.<br/><br/>Fans of the series won't really care about the plot and its holes; it's all about the explosions, pretty girls, high body count, and 007's cleverness. Daniel Craig's emotional repertoire consists of pursing his lips and squinting his eyes - he's no Sean Connery (who, by the way, would have been great as Bond's trusty, Scottish gamekeeper). We do get much more of Judi Dench as M and she's wonderful. Javier Bardem is good as the crazed villain, but his blond hair keeps him from being truly menacing.<br/><br/>My biggest problem was with the plot which is quite narrowly focused on offing M, rather than the traditional 007 storyline of massive weapons of mass destruction aimed squarely at the West. It was okay but didn't have the gravity of some past Bonds where world domination was at stake.<br/><br/>The movie delivers nonstop action scenes and that's what James Bond is all about. 7.5 stars."

","By Miguel Herrera www.thatsmye.com <br/><br/>Bond and Eve are on a mission to retrieve a hard drive containing the undercover identities of NATO agents, who have infiltrated terrorist organizations. A chase ensues and Bond is right on the unknown individuals tail, and eventually the chase ends up on top of a moving train and a fight begins. Eve gets ahead of the train and prepares her gun to take down the unknown individual if necessary. She gets the call to take him down but,unfortunately, she misses and hits Bond instead. A search for Bond begins but he is never found and is declared dead. Due to the mishap of unknown individual getting away with the hard drive, MI6 is under investigation and M comes under political pressure to retire due to this. Now M must do everything in her power to apprehend the person who stole the hard drive.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with this movie it had everything a Bond movie is known for, quite a bit of action, some drama, suspense and sophistication that only Bond can deliver. The overall pace of the movie was a bit slow in the beginning for my taste but it picked up after about 40 minutes. I enjoyed the story which was all about revenge and redemption for both M and Bond. M trying to redeem herself after that mishap with the lost hard drive, and Bond coming back after being declared dead has to prove that being an agent isn't just a young mans game. Personally I thought M (Judi Dench) was phenomenal in this role really liked her character and the things she has to go through. Much like in the past 2 movies more so in the first one, you got to see the vulnerable side of Bond one that has been beaten and must prove to himself and to others that he still has what it takes to be a MI6 agent.<br/><br/>I thought there was enough action to satisfy my taste and make it feel like a Bond movie, from him being stealthy to just going out with guns blazing. I also enjoyed Daniel Craig as Bond once again, and I think he simply is Bond and he brings the character to life quite well. I also thought Silva (Javier Bardem) did an excellent job as the villain in the film. I especially enjoyed the interactions he had with both M and Bond throughout the movie. As far as the action scenes are concerned I enjoyed them immensely, I thought they were excellent and somewhat over the top, kinda what I've come to expect a Bond movie to be. I thought the opening sequence was awesome, it was a cool chase scene that ended up with Bond falling off a train and into a river. Overall I thought the action was good and not too much, but enough when necessary.<br/><br/>While I did enjoy the movie I did think the movie started off a bit slow, but other than that it was a good Bond movie with a good story line. All the characters were great in this movie, but Judi Dench stole the spotlight in one of her best performances portraying M. I enjoyed watching Javier Bardem as the villain, I thought he was both witty and funny, and his first encounter with Bond will make you laugh. The action sequences were great and complemented the movie very well. Overall while this movie takes a while to pick up, it does, and it ends on a high note."

","Casino Royale was a great Bond film. It respected the traditions, but set out immediately to do its own thing. And it succeeded. Then came Quantum of Solace, which wasn't all that good. The plot had no character, the novelty had worn off and it was very forgettable. Gladly this movie managed to rise above its predecessor and resemble Casino Royale more closely in style and substance. It's a great Bond film and a perfect one to celebrate the anniversary.<br/><br/>What I like most about Skyfall and Casino Royale is that they're aware of the deep and rich history, part of which they are about to become, but they refuse to be bound by it. They have their own idea of what the character of James Bond should be like and they don't care if someone doesn't like that idea or would rather see nothing changed. Yet they don't disregard those traditions. Skyfall has all the hallmarks of a proper Bond film from a blazing beginning opening action sequence to the Bond girls and the over the top villain. They're all there, but they're not the main part of the story. They're more of acknowledging and respecting nods than restricting clichés. Though I must say that the few times that the film makers decided to stick with the traditions, it really works. Perhaps the best example is the villain, played by Javier Bardem, who's a contender for the creepiest and most unsettling villain Bond has yet to face. His introductory scene is one of the most brilliant prolonged monologues that I've seen in a long time. He feels like a Bond villain, I can recognize him as a Bond villain, yet he's still a creature of his own making, something slightly new and twisted. A statement, which pretty accurately describes the rest of the film as well.<br/><br/>Not to say that the film is without any flaws, as it isn't perfect. While I praise Bardem's take on the role, the character that he plays isn't developed as well as he could have been. Now he gets an amazing introduction, but then he just sorts of stagnates to a generic kill it because it insulted me once kind of bad guy, who's devoid of any great motives or feelings. He's still not awful, but he could have been better. The same with the third act of the film, which tries to through too much in at the last minute, leaving as scratching our heads in the process. A more leaner, compact storyline would have served the movie better.<br/><br/>Still, as a whole this is a great film. Is it the best Bond yet? Probably not, but it's there in the top five, or at least the top ten. Definitely worth a watch for the fans of both the old and the new."
"Anurag-Shetty","9","1","8","22 November 2012"," Bond is back, and he's better than ever! Arguably the best 007 film of all time!
","Skyfall is the 23rd movie & the 50th year in the James Bond film franchise. After being accidentally shot by Eve(Naomie Harris) while chasing down the bad guy, James Bond(Daniel Craig), who's presumed dead goes into hiding. After a bomb blast at the MI6 headquarters which nearly killed M(Judi Dench), Bond returns. The new villain's name is Silva(Javier Bardem) & for some reason he's out to get M. What Bond doesn't know is that M is hiding a dirty secret of her own.<br/><br/>This movie has all the classic 007 trademarks. The breathtaking locales, sexy Bond girls, the modern and the vintage cars, awe inspiring gadgets, the inimitable villain & of course, non-stop action & suspense. The viewer can never guess what's going to happen next. Unlike the previous film, Quantum of Solace, the non-stop action has a solid plot as well. A note on the performances. Daniel Craig is mind blowing as James Bond(and don't worry, this time he does say Bond, James Bond). Craig plays a much physically & emotionally weaker Bond who's lost his edge after the accident. Javier Bardem is spectacular as Silva. Bardem is both menacing & witty at the same time. Judi Dench as usual is outstanding as M. Ben Whishaw is brilliant as gadget expert, Q. Ralph Fiennes has a wonderful cameo as Garreth Mallory who is going to take over MI6 after M retires. The Bond girls Severine(Berenice Marlohe) & Eve are effective as well. I also love the fact that there's more of London in this film, since I've gone there. All in all, Skyfall is a must watch for Bond fans & pretty much everyone else."
"benjamin-orr","9","1","8","16 November 2012"," James is ""dead"" then comes back to life for some more action
","Skyfall<br/><br/>On Friday I got the luxury of getting to see the new Movie Skyfall It is the newest installment into the James bond series. Overall I thought that the movie was good Especially in Imax! The beginning of the movie had a cool chase scene on motorcycles thru a foreign city. The chase ends when James and the man who he is chasing are brawling on the top of a train when James's assistant takes a shot at the man who is trying to get away from James but the shot misses the target and hits James and he falls off the train that was crossing a bridge at the time. So James is falling off the train into the water below the bridge. The movie has a great storyline tons of action. The story will keep your interest the entire time. The best part of the movie is the war fought towards the end of the movie. I will speak no more of the end of the movie for spoiler purposes. Now onto the acting. The acting was very well done, with Daniel Craig acting like he has been Bond for his entire life. Judi Dench once again is fantastic as playing M. The new Q played by Ben Wishaw makes a great actor for the role. The only difference I would have made is trying to get Andrew Garfield instead as the actor for Q. Great movie overall"
"maneckk-414-209658","8","1","8","14 November 2012"," Skyfall  the old ways are the best ways
","I remember when I was a kid, Dad used to take me for English movies especially Bond movies as those were his favorite too. Ian Fleming's James Bond movies complete 50 years and I thought of no better way to watch it than to take Dad for this one. I am happy I took him because he got witness the birth of a new James Bond.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig reveals the more human side of the invincible MI6 agent, an agent who bleeds, gets emotional, is not scared to show his attachment for his boss 'M' and for the first time reveals his family background in 50 years. The movie advocates and reminisces the olden days and the old ways. This intent is revealed quite early in the plot when Bond's partner Eve watches him shave with an old-fashioned cut-throat razor implying that ""old ways are the best"".<br/><br/>The movie starts with a signature Daniel Crag chase sequence trying to recover a hard drive from a professional assassin. The first 10 minutes really set the tempo going and the high adrenaline chase which starts on foot, cars, motor-cycles culminates on top of a train in a brilliant finale which sets the mood for the rest of the movie. The plot revolves around tracking a mysterious buyer who is buying MI6 secrets and challenging the secret service at every step. Without revealing the plot much, 'M' has a more substantial role in this one, who is questioned by the new age politicians about her agency's old ways, while she keeps Bond on her toes despite his questionable attitude and fitness after he fails to track him down in Istanbul, Turkey. Like all bond movies this one takes us to the streets of Istanbul, high rise buildings of Shanghai, casinos of Macau, London underground and finally the castles of Scotland.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig has always been my favorite bond. His love for one on one fights of settling a score has been exploited to the fullest in this outing of him as James Bond. He shows a vulnerable side to James which no other actor who worked as Bond has ever revealed. For the first time he revisits his past and connects with his roots giving insight into his inner demons and as 'M' aptly puts it in ""Orphans always make the best agents"". Dame Judi Dench as 'M' has a much meatier role than any previous series and seems more like a mother figure to her agents, protecting them besides their shortcomings. Naomie Harris should be catapulted to fame with her portrayal of the latest Bond Girl, and though she is brilliant in all sequences, the scene to watch out for is when she gives Bond a shave with a cut-throat razor.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem as the villain Silva is an intelligent and sinister strategist (being an ex MI6 agent himself) and his first face to face meeting with 'M' is simple but hair-raising. Bardem's character though owns an island has not been portrayed larger than life and believes he and Bond are the last ""2 Rats"" (agents) standing. I did quite notice Bardem modeling himself on the character of Joker played by late Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Ben Whishaw (hadn't heard of him before this) as Q changes all moulds of his precedents and is a geeky, computer genius Quarter Master (Q). His statement to Bond that he can do more damage sitting in front of his computer in his pajamas gets us ready for the future Q to come. Albert Finney as the castle caretaker, and Ralph Fiennes, the one taking over as the boss of MI6 play small but pivotal roles. Director Sam Mendes has done brilliantly to bring out the chemistry amongst Bond, 'M' and Silva.<br/><br/>Now, James Bond is not given a car in this movie, but that is the good part. It's good as he borrows the old Aston Martin D5 (used in Goldfinger) from a garage and puts it to good use. The Aston Martin is the surprise package of the movie and completes the belief advocated that ""old ways are the best"". At one point of time you can see Bond jokingly toying with the ejection seat button when 'M' is in the passenger seat. Seeing the D5 being used after ages did lend a feeling of nostalgia to me and a fitting tribute to 50 years as James Bond and his Cars have always been inseparable.<br/><br/>For me Bond has changed over the past 50 years, he has become more mature, emotional, less dependent on gadgets and more importantly ""human"". There has been a lot of Bond bashing by some critics after the release of Skyfall but for me this was one of the greatest Bond movies. This movie has set a precedent for a new James Bond we would be witnessing in the future."
"hoobalkanoobal","7","1","8","12 November 2012"," Competence, Darkness, Beauty
","I expected not to like this film, not seeing how it could possibly manage to avoid staleness, so its competence was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Part of the way Mendes freshens things is by subtracting parts of the most familiar stories that we know every Bond film will have. The seduction scene is a notable instance. We need only one shot here to mark the happening of the inevitable, and don't need to be told at all when it results in Bond's capture.<br/><br/>To complain about the many gaps and inconsistencies in the film is fair enough, but I think misunderstands the nature of the undertaking. These things are designed by committees. They are meant as vehicles to serve up compelling moments, and mostly that's what this one does best. How else do you explain the Bond death scene?<br/><br/>This has some of the brooding darkness of The Dark Knight and uses several of that film's tropes and plot points in ways that turn the realism up a bit. A notable instance of that involves Bardem and reminds one of the CGI Two-Face. Since it is briefer and more subtle, the effect works much better here, yielding one of the film's most resonant moments.<br/><br/>Mendes plants a Turner painting early on that had the effect for me of transforming the billowing smoke at the end into a reference back to the painting. The resulting implication that we have gone into a painting would be meant, I think, to help with the suspension of disbelief needed to enjoy a strikingly beautiful sequence. It's not for everyone to take an interest in such things, but I was amused by it.<br/><br/>Some pieces struck me as gratuitous such as the derailed train from ""Hugo"" and the repetitious asides about how silly MI6's gadgets are, which are undermined by the fact that two key plot points are built around those devices.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the centrality of M's character. I thought Dench was a weak link in this otherwise solid cast. I suspect we forgive her incompetence because she is Judi Dench.<br/><br/>The computers=magic stuff is all straight from 1995. Have we really made so little progress in how we think about and visualize technology since ""Hackers?"" Is that a bluetooth Bond is wearing at the beginning?<br/><br/>Can a person learn anything from a film such as this one? It aims only to be momentarily compelling. That it mostly succeeds on that score is remarkable enough."
"rphoebus-3","6","1","8","12 November 2012"," Pretty Good. Not ""The Best Bond Ever"" as Advertised
","Skyfall is pretty good, although it is not ""The Best Bond Ever"" as advertised. Then again, promotions tend to exaggerate in the first place. Great opening sequence, but then it kind of wanders for a while. When it finally gets back on track, it reminded me more of a Bourne Identity film than either of the two most recent Bond films. The new Quartermaster is pretty well done, and I like the way they have kept the gadgets out of the new series. It is difficult to offer too much without including spoilers, and so I'd say, go see this one as it is worth your time. Just don't expect anything that tops Casino Royal, and you will really enjoy this film."
"twillis600-152-449978","7","1","8","11 November 2012"," Harris should eat and the camera does not love Craig
","Professional reviewers don't always give the full story. I will try to: <br/><br/>1. The plot of the missing agent list, has been over-used in too many spy movies. 2. Half way thru the movie, the original plot was forgotten and was never solved. It then evolved into, a plot to assassinate M. 3. The initial scene was exciting and Bond was shot in the shoulder by a semi automatic firearm. But while bleeding profusely from the wound, he continued to jump, climb, lift and fight as if the wound was surgically repaired, mid-scene. 4. To conclude the initial scene, Harris(Eve) shot Bond with a high powered rifle, from atop a moving train, that was traveling at a high rate of speed, across a bridge. Bond fell, what looked like 100 feet or more and crashed into a large body of water. A very weird cartoon like hand, then pulled him down, into what looked like a drain. The very next scene Bond was seen in bed, having a kissing scene with a woman, that was never introduced or explained any further. A. Did she nurse him to health? B. How did he not break every bone in his body from the fall into the water (water is like concrete, after such a fall). C. After sinking to the bottom of the ocean and being pulled down by the cartoon hand, was he rescued by a dolphin or does he have gills and can breathe under water. How did he not drown after sinking to the bottom of the ocean? <br/><br/>5. In yet another water scene(this movie likes water scenes)Craig is trapped on a frozen body of water. He shoots out the ice, where he and one of the hit men, fall thru the ice and an underwater fight scene takes place. They fight/ sink what looks to be 50ft, then Craig kills the assassin. But while under the frozen water, he realizes, he can't find the hole in the ice to escape. So, under what would be pitch black frozen water, he swims further down to retrieve the dead, sinking body of the assassin. Where he retrieved a flare, from the pouch of the dead man. How would he have known the man had a flare on his person, as they fought to the death? After being under the frozen, pitch black water, overcoming an assassin, Craig showed no signs of hypothermia or exhaustion and went on to save the day. <br/><br/>Just ENTIRELY Unbelievable. <br/><br/>Harris (Eve)is a very attractive actress but she definitely appeared abnormally thin. Her height is 5'8"" but she appeared to weigh about 90lbs. We have to stop this social maniacal obsession to push society into eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia etc. Her face was beautiful but the tailored dresses and attire she wore, showed her entire skeleton. She does not look healthy. Craig(Bond), no matter how much the camera focuses on his deep blue eyes, at some point they will have to show the rest of his face. The camera does not love his face! Beyond his eyes... his profile, the apple like shape of his head and his overall facial features, do not make a viewer think, ""ladies man"". He has the face, body posture and structure of a construction worker you would see every evening in your local Walmart. He is muscular like a construction worker, that has been breaking bricks all day. As opposed to a tall elegant, stealthy build, that would suggest more of the suave elegant, tuxedo look, of a true ladies man. Craigs modest height (5'10"")athletic build, looks like he should play along side Jason Statham in his next transporter movie. At only 5'10"", he probably has to stand on a stool, to do many of the kissing scenes with many of the taller model actresses. Craig was wrongly cast for this Bond role from the beginning.<br/><br/>Just ENTIRELY unbelievable !<br/><br/>There are too many other unexplained, unbelievable parts of this movie to explain. I rated it a 7 because they obviously spent A Lot of money on the car chases/ explosions etc. The explosion in the train stations, the train wreck, the destruction of buildings, such as in the final scene, appeared very believable."
"xankali","9","1","8","9 November 2012"," Good action movie
","Skyfall is well worth seeing if you are up for action. Daniel Craig is still as sexy as ever. The movie moves right along taking you all around the world. As with many action movies, you are there to be entertained and not to try and read more into the movie than necessary. I don't care too much for people who are haters over a movie because they have dissected it way to much that they have forgotten the purpose of a Bond movie in the first place. We are there to be entertained, not to have to think too much. What would have really been the icing on the cake for this movie would have been to of had all prior Bond's who are still alive put in a cameo. Now that would have been a great 50th year gift."
"RoyBatty88","9","1","8","9 November 2012"," Best Bond ever? I'll say so myself.
","Even better than Casino Royale. It gives James Bond even more depth than Daniel Craig already gave him not to mention Adele whom I don't like at all does an amazing opening song. Skyfall is to Daniel Craig was Goldfinger was to Sean Connery, any Bond fan is going to love it, any person who has taste is going to love it. It's an amazing movie from beginning to the very end. It has a classic Bond feel but still gives the audience surprises and provides something new. They're creating a new Bond universe. <br/><br/>The movie begins with Bond chasing a man who has a list of all the M-I6 agents of course like any Bond movie the beginning is action packed and builds up to an awesome title. Bond gets shot by a woman named Eve he was working for and leads everyone in MI-6 to believe that he is dead. He comes back (Sounds a little like You Only Live Twice doesn't it?) after someone blows up the embassy. It is learned that is lead by a vengeful man named Silva (Played by Javier Bardem) who has an agenda against M. Now, that is all I am going to tell you, basically I'm just telling you what the trailer has already said. There are many twists and turns that it needs to be seen. I hate giving spoilers.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem, easily the creepiest Bond villain he's cynical, flamboyant but not over the top like some of the past villains were. He's the Joker to the James Bond universe. Daniel Craig gives his strongest performance as James Bond, in fact the best acting any James Bond actor has ever given. He gives a darkness to that character, also complexity. They also get a little into James Bond's origins in the movie. It becomes like other Bond movies in the sense that Q (Played by Ben Winshaw) who also is quite hilarious and quirky. Though do not expect over the top gadgets.<br/><br/>Skyfall is literally one of the best movies of the year and also the best Bond movie of all time. I will argue that it is even better than Casino Royale. It's loaded with excitement, terrific performances and enough thrills to keep the audience busy for the two and a half hour ride. Enjoy! I give Skyfall and A."
"morganstrk","8","1","8","4 November 2012"," Best Bond Yet
","Action scenes tempered with artistic flair add a certain class not seen in the film franchise's recent history, but within themselves are inherently ""Bond"" and make this film my favorite ever. Excellent acting, most notably Javier Bardem's, lend a certain magnetism to the plot and the presence of a story associated with the villain give this film a more personal edge. Further exposure of the rough vulnerability of Daniel Craig's Bond and focus on the development of this enigmatic character are strangely endearing, without returning to the stale events of Casino Royale. It is with eager anticipation that I await this new Bond and his return to the classic plot with a revamped cast."
"vicarious_tool","8","1","8","3 November 2012"," Old dog new tricks.
","The movie was picturesque and likable but not excellent. There is nothing extraordinary about the movie as far as the performances or plot or even gadgets are concerned. However, the action sequences are up to the mark some even unique. The cinematography and in particular, locations, are great, the Shanghai part for one, was eye-candy. There is also some subtlety involved (lookout for the dog showpiece owned by 'M' for example) some good dialogues an antagonist with a philosophy and understandable motives, and they even play with the issue/question of whether field-work/espionage is of any importance in the modern day. On the whole, definitely something new to entertain and amaze you, but do not expect too much else. Another thing I liked is that there were some answers as to how Bond ended up being an agent, and of course more is revealed about the ever-so-enigmatic 'M'."
"speaktobijoy","6","1","8","2 November 2012"," A different and interesting plot but could have been loads better
","The movie was far more realistic than usual, with a story line much more personal and intense. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem's (Silva) character is remarkable and Bardem did this exceptionally well with his own charm. Watch out for the scene where he makes the entry.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect is that we get to see more of M (Judi Dench) and Bond's association with her. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes (Mallory) was another unexpected gem of a character in the movie.<br/><br/>So what is the problem? Mendes did a bad job in making the movie agree to the usual ""Bond motifs"" unnecessarily and poorly. During the first half, Severine's character just steps in and out and sleeps with Bond without adequate build up. Mendes failed to hold the first half of the plot together, and it showed lack of directional control. <br/><br/>I personally started liking the movie only from the second half. The movie became original and different only with it's exploration of Skyfall's theme towards the end. <br/><br/>Overall, I would like to blame Mendes for not doing a better job."

"davidgee","8","1","8","1 November 2012"," Lots of thrills and one big shock
","Sam Mendes really has breathed new life into the 007 franchise. Not only is SKYFALL better than the woeful near-plot less QUANTUM OF SOLACE of Solace, you could argue it's even better than CASINO ROYALE and GOLDENEYE, the last two movies that attempted to give our superhero a much needed kick in the pants!<br/><br/>What really works this time round is a decent script. Once the producers had exhausted Fleming's original novels, the screenwriters came to rely on cobbling together a few original fragments with some conspicuous recycling of previous highlights (ski and underwater sequences being the most blatant examples of this). There is a bit of under-the-counter re-vamping in SKYFALL: the stolen disc with agents' names reworks the nuclear-code device from FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (or even FROM Russia WITH LOVE's cypher machine). Javier Bardem's peroxided villain Silva is a camped-up version of Christopher Walken's Zorin in FROM A VIEW TO A KILL, but the sharpness of the new script and the tightness of Mendes's direction makes the film seem very far from formulaic.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the Fleming books (as I am!) Daniel Craig is so wrong to play Bond (physically, Tim Dalton came closest to the Bond of the novels, with Piers Brosnan a close second), but Craig has now stamped his seal on the part. SKYFALL, however, really belongs to Judi Dench. M's role here has been beefed up to its best since THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. Dame Judi really seizes the bit, alternately ruthless and vulnerable. She ends up in the Highland scenes looking more like Bond's partner than his boss. Ralph Fiennes gives a nice turn as a creepy Whitehall mandarin who thinks M is past her sell-by date. Ben Wishaw is low-key as the new Q, from whom we can surely expect bigger things in the future. Naomie Harris is very appealing as the fledgling agent; her little 'surprise' at the end of the movie makes a pleasing 'coda' after SKYFALL's big shock (which must be one of Movieland's most successfully kept secrets of recent times). There are some pleasingly sly references to the Bond 'heritage' (Martinis, the Aston Martin, the original Bond theme and, of course, the obligatory 'Bond, James Bond').<br/><br/>Adele's slightly plodding theme-song is not going to knock Shirley Bassey off the top of the Bond charts. The blowing-up of MI6's Thames House is not CGI's finest hour. Other 'set pieces' are a bit daft, especially the runaway tube-train which we saw in the trailer and even the Istanbul rooftop chase at the beginning. But the Shanghai highrise generates vintage thrills and the London scenes have terrific tension. The Scottish moors prove to be an atmospheric location and bring a well- paced movie to a seriously thrilling climax."
"Thomas-Giffin","8","1","8","31 October 2012"," Certainly on par with casino Royale
","Is this the best Bond film ever?<br/><br/>No. Is it the best Daniel Craig Bond film?<br/><br/>Harder to answer, I would say that it is certainly on par with the brilliant Casino Royale in many respects. It has less of the shockingly raw feel that Craig's first Bond film had but overall it seems that he has settled much more into the role. To see James Bond now still as the physical monster he is but also showing a humanity and character depth works hugely to Skyfall's advantage.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes shows just how much difference having an Oscar winning director at the helm can make. The film is visually stunning and yet it is the characters that form the main piece of the film. For each exotic location to show off, there is a quieter scene that adds to either Bond himself or another character.<br/><br/>But at it's core, it is a quintessential Bond film, from Adele's brilliant theme song to a creepy villains lair. At some points it is almost too eager to look after the past 50 years of Bond films, in some cases that is the cause of several laugh out loud moments, at other moments it feels a little blunt. <br/><br/>Speaking of villains, Javier Bardem is perfect as De Silva. A blond, reptilian wall of unpredictable power. His back story really gives the character a greater sense of fear and menace and towards the end, his single minded drive to complete a mission of his own gives the last act a great feeling of desperation and urgency.<br/><br/>The Bond girls in this film really do tend to take a back seat, Naomi Harris as Eve pops up every now and then and Berenice Marlohe (Severine) has very little screen time but both of them are strong characters in their own right. But, the real girl of the film is Judi Dench as M. Developed even further than in previous films, Sam Mendes really brings out the hard, callous edge that M needs to do her job whilst also highlighting her fondness for Bond. It's a really quite touching relationship and one that has only really been explored since Daniel Craig took over. <br/><br/>The action is great in the film too, less of the borderline superheroic chases of Casino Royale and more of a human feeling edge of both the fist and gun fights. One particular scene in Shanghai is utterly beautiful and fantastic to look at. <br/><br/>It's not perfect, by any stretch. There is a long running time for the film but I didn't notice much at all. What I did notice is that the third act, where the personal story starts to take the stage, slows the pacing of the film to a crawl compared with the jet setting shenanigans that fill the first two acts. <br/><br/>I suppose all in all, this was a damn fine film. And a bloody good Bond film. As I said, it lacks the 'Wow!' factor that Craig's debut film had but the whole thing is much more fluid, emotional and the characters are much more satisfying. Watch this if you haven't already."

Mendes & Craig pulled off an enjoyable 007 adventure with a reliable cast including a good baddie at last in Javier Bardem. Good location use of London's familiar landmarks. Also glad to see the end of Dench era, a good Eon servant but now with Fiennes as a new younger 'M' perhaps offers more scope. Finally good to see the movie rewarded with awards particularly Adele's title song & Thomas Newman's soundtrack. Now we look forward to their efforts of Bond 24 which is rumoured to start filming in October 2014."

","I am not a big fan of the newer James Bond films; I prefer Sean Connery's Bond films. With that said, this installment gets an A+ from me, and I consider it one of the very best films of 2012, and it contains the best acting performance I have seen in 2012: Dame Judi Dench as M (: She is the co-lead of the movie, as the movie goes back and forth between Bond and M, both dealing with getting older in the spy business (; The opening chase scene is one of the greatest I have ever seen - I don't particularly like chase scenes but this one was so well paced, directed, and performed. The opening credits were witty and exciting and aided by a brilliant theme song sung and co-written by Adele. The film hardly has any let ups (or let downs) and my only minor criticisms is that I couldn't understand the Asian woman's dialogue when she & Bond were outdoors; and I would have shaved 5 or so minutes from the climax, which was a bit repetitive at times, but these are minor quibbles.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is a wonderful witty formidable villain. It was interesting that he doesn't show up until at least half way through the film and yet this decision completely works! Ben Whishaw is one of my very favorite young English actors and his addition to the movie as ""Q"" was a total delight.<br/><br/>Naomie Harris as Eve is a real find; I am looking forward to seeing her in other movies.<br/><br/>Albert Finney was completely unrecognizable and great fun in his role.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes' direction is top-notch. It's the best work he has done ever as a filmmaker imo.<br/><br/>The cinematography, art direction, sound, editing, costumes, sets, and especially the musical score add considerably to why I give this film an A+.<br/><br/>But mostly I loved Dame Judi Dench's M. She is sharp, funny, precise, active, reflective and formidable. There's nothing like a dame! especially this particular Dame! (; Was it only me or did I want her to be sitting behind her desk at the end of the movie? ""Say it isn't so"" - an era has ended..."

It was always a surprise to see what was going to happen next. It had its unrealistic points, although what good would a movie be without them. The main downfall for me is that, at the very beginning the movie did not make a whole lot of sense, but they pulled it together well in the end. The action spread throughout the movie was very well put together and could really draw you into the movie. My confusion at the beginning of the movie was pretty well all pulled together at the end of the movie."
"CelluloidDog","9","1","9","9 December 2012"," Bond Full Circle
","Daniel Craig finally makes a Bond film worthy of Sean Connery, by general consensus the best Bond. To do that, the filmmakers had to go full circle for this film. Casino Royale was too serious; Quantum of Solace was just action; but Skyfall brings back the nostalgic Bond.<br/><br/>The movie has its usual intense chase and fight scenes. Some casino gambling. The ending is intense as it gets. One of the strongest Bond endings.<br/><br/>It's not without flaws. For example, the opening credits move the classic eye and shot trademark to the end. And the opening credits visual effects were confusing and not as fun as some of the cheesier but classic 60s and 70s Bond films. An unconvincing Komodo Dragon. And Albert Finney as an elderly Kincade shooting 'em up. The gorgeous Bérénice Marlohe is absolutely two notches ahead of Craig's companions, e.g, Eve Green in the Bond girl department. However, she is quite too expendable and Bond loses his female counterpart. Remember, Bond is supposed to get the girl. Don't confuse Eve played by Naomie Harris. Save that for a pleasant surprise. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem is a great actor as the villain but he falls a notch short of his role in No Country for Old Men. He's a bit awkward in the entering scene. Is he a villain? Or a strange dude? The good thing is that as the movie progresses, Bardem gets better with his Silva character. Otherwise the acting was strong with Judi Dench as M and Ralph Fiennes moving in as the future man. Ben Whishaw as Q represents the thematic anti-technology that classic Bond embraces. As the movie progresses, the new Q realizes, technology isn't all there is.<br/><br/>The movie is a bit like Never Say Never Again or Thunderball with questioning whether Bond is in shape, ready for action and deserves his license to kill. Or should he join AARP in the retirement home? <br/><br/>Some things can't be measured such as the propensity and art for killing. One can see some influence actually perhaps from the pursuit of Osama Bin Laden. To remain hidden from American intelligence, he had to cut off modern technology. M16 has just that problem. And so does Bond. To operate covertly, technology must be the most advanced. But what if it is compromised. How do you remain hidden? Ninja-like. Bond-like. It channels Sam Worthington's character in Terminator Salvation or Woody Allen's Sleeper. It's the sometimes played theme: to infiltrate the enemy, you must have no name, no record. You need your Aston Martin and Walther PPK. Several criticisms pointed out they didn't feel the classic Bond. Perhaps they were not paying attention since the film deliberately brought back that especially with the classic Aston Martin ripping out of the garage. And this is the film that reveals Bond's parents, as Ian Fleming would have it at the Skyfall cemetery.<br/><br/>The next mission leaves no electronic trail. But it can leave a paper trail or folder on the table for your eyes only. In that manner, it justifies the return to the classic Bond."

","James Bond's hobby is resurrection. And he does it which such a flair! SKYFALL, I felt is a mixture of nostalgia and newness.<br/><br/>The movie is quite a change from last 2 field works of Daniel Craig. But he still smites you with his quirky charms and confidence. A farewell movie for Judi Dench with good moments. The villain, Javier Bardem was pretty evil to mommy M in his ways. I personally liked Bérénice Marlohe in her brief act and she does grab your attention. The cinematography is so colourful and attractive by Roger Deakins. Some really beautifully and impressive shot scenes of Turkey, Shanghai, and Scotland. The setup made in Macau was just drop-dead gorgeous! Also cars blowing up right from Beetles to the old Aston Martin DB5 of Goldfinger. The screenplay and Sam Mendes's direction is at good pace and keeps you interested.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me of Sean Connery's era with more suspense, thrills and espionage skills and less of hand combats, car chases and special gadgets which I did miss. Now I won't say its the best Bond movie or not, because I personally like all Bond movies, hate comparing them and always look forward to them. But SKYFALL will surely have its proud place in my movie collection, pretty soon! Must watch."
"patrickwigington","8","1","9","23 November 2012"," The Modern Spy
","The new James Bond movie is a fantastic movie. While maintaining the allure and stylish action of the Bond franchise, it adds a significant amount of depth to both its plot and its characters. Perhaps this 23rd (or 24th depending) installment in the James Bond series might not be as visceral and archetypal as the Sean Connery movies, Skyfall is a triumphant attempt to bring 007 into the modern era.<br/><br/>The plot of this Bond movie is much more personal than any one before it. After faking his own death (once again), Bond lives out his time on some unspecified beach. However, he learns that MI6, the agency he works for, has been bombed by a terrorist. So Bond heads back to England to make sure M, his mother figure, is safe and unharmed. She has him come back to the force and try and track down the man responsible. All of this happens during a barrage of politics and somewhat heavy handed dialogue about how the world doesn't need top secret agents anymore. Of course this movie then goes about making the case for why we still do, at least in the 007 universe.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig really delves into his role as Bond in this outing. He gives the character added depth and complexities that were previously never even considered. Although Craig seems like a strange choice for 007, he has been doing it for 3 movies now, and he seems to fit the role really nicely. Along with Casino Royale and especially this new one, Craig has helped shape the series into relevancy in the 21st century. Judi Dench plays M, the leader of MI6. Her role is greatly expanded in this movie, and Dench really delivers a knockout performance. Javier Bardem plays the villain, a evil mastermind (of course) who is hellbent on killing M, for his own mysterious reasons. Bardem is maybe the best Bond villain of them all, giving a fascinating performance that is highlighted by his character's disturbing back story.<br/><br/>The only character who seems flat and uninteresting is the new Q, head of gadgets. Played by Ben Wishaw, he seems to be more of a ""lets try and appeal to the indie crowd"" move than an actual character. Also, the gadgets are a little disappointing. Bond only gets a handgun that only he can shoot, and a radio device for them to track his signal. No fancy stuff, but this Bond movie is doing that on purpose. It seems to be a minimalist Bond film, trying to purge itself of all the overblown and needless aspects of previous installments, and reinvent itself in a way that is both exciting and necessary. Bond is barely the suave, debonair Cary Grant type figure. Classic lines and motifs from other movies are only hinted at here; and even the Bond girl is little more than a plot point. How you feel about all of that really depends on your taste, but it is certainly a very interesting take on the franchise.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes, who has directed such classics as American Beauty and Road to Perdition helms this spy movie with stunning visuals. Mendes creates a dangerous and attractive world that marked by assassins, dangerous women, and modern architecture. The action scenes are tight and fun to watch; Mendes never tries to be too flashy with the camera work, letting the fights and chases and shootouts speak for themselves. And the dramatic scenes are emotionally engrossing—especially when Bond cries at the end. Yeah, that's right.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a great James Bond movie, and an even better action film. Adele's title song is the best since Live and Let Die. The movie is a phenomenal experience, and seeing it on the big screen is well worth the time and money.<br/><br/>thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","9","1","9","22 November 2012"," Easily one of the top 5 best Bond films.
","Could we be entering a second golden age of James Bond films? After the last disappointment of a Bond film, Quantum of Solace, the thought would not have even entered my mind. But Skyfall easily holds its own against the very best bond films. As with Craig's first film, Casino Royale, Skyfall successfully adopts the ultra serious, brooding tone that is prevalent in many of today's action films while still maintaining its identity as a Bond film. <br/><br/>In the latest Bond adventure, the lives of James Bond and his chief, M, are jeopardized by a rogue MI6 agent named Silva, played brilliantly by Javier Bardem, (you can't find a better person to play deranged psychopath than Bardem!). Silva, who has a personal vendetta against M, stole a hard drive that contains a list of British secret agents working in the field. James Bond must recover the hard drive before Silva can release the list to the public. The film opens in Istanbul with Bond and a fellow agent played by Naomie Harris (whose character cannot be revealed in this review) in pursuit of Silva's men. Bond's chase leads him to the top of a freight train with one of Silva's henchmen while Harris watches helplessly through the scope of a sniper rifle without a clear shot at the enemy. M orders her to ""take the bloody shot"" anyway, almost callously. Harris hits Bond instead, just as she feared, and Bond is assumed dead- but of course, he comes back to England just when M needs him most. <br/><br/>Skyfall earns a place among the best Bond films because it takes the series in many new directions. For once James Bond has a great personal and physical obstacle to overcome, as he has not completely recovered from his physical injuries or his psychological injury from his betrayal. His loyalty to M and MI6 are put to the test while he confronts one of the most dangerous villains he has ever encountered. Craig brings a certain toughness to the role that I don't think we have seen since Sean Connery, but he also brings a vulnerability to the part that we haven't seen before. <br/><br/>But the most surprising development is Judi Dench's M, a character who has never been given much depth. Skyfall examines the dark side of espionage work by focusing on the morally ambiguous decisions that must be made in the field. As the head of MI6, M has made many of these decisions in the past, and she has a significant sense of guilt. The film is also more politically aware of the controversies of intelligence work, a place the series has not dared to go in the past. Director Sam Mendes, an unlikely choice, turned out to be a brilliant call on the producer's part, as more traditional action directors might not have been capable of directing this kind of Bond film. <br/><br/>Another thing that makes Skyfall stand out among Bond films is just how remarkably subdued it is- the most complex gadget is a radio, and it features few exotic international locales. The film takes place almost entirely in Britain, and the final action scene is in Bond's abandoned family mansion, Skyfall. Compare that to the inside of a volcano or a space station! This is not the first Bond film to feature few gadgets, but what surprises me is how determined the producer Barbara Broccoli is to stick with this formula. In the past, the series has always reverted back to the over the top, tongue in cheek style that characterizes the majority of Bond films. Skyfall is joyfully aware of its deviations from the series, most notably in a verbal quip from the gadget master Q that MI6 does not do ""exploding pens"" anymore. Yet the film also embraces Bond's past, as the classic Aston Martin from Goldfinger makes an appearance, and old school fans will love the recreation of M's office from the Connery and Moore eras. <br/><br/>Of course, the plot elements in Skyfall have been explored in other films, but the Bond series is not about originality so much as damn good entertainment, and Skyfall accomplishes this in spades. The pacing is a bit off at times, slowing down in the middle, but it all comes together with a riveting conclusion where Bond defends M with shotguns, dynamite, and knives, a very raw action sequence for a Bond film. <br/><br/>The James Bond series has been revitalized thanks in part to Barbara Broccoli understanding the need to give the series a face lift. Skyfall is going to be hard to beat, but I hope Barbara Broccoli can churn out one or two more great Bond films before Craig leaves the series. With one more great Bond film, I think Craig's era will match or possibly outmatch Sean Connery's films."

","After the awful plunder and fall of one of the biggest grossing franchises, Bond fans were undeniably distressed. Quantum of Solace had undone everything that Casino Royale had done right; it was a Bond film that was bigger and better, it even rivalled Sean Connery's best effort 'Goldfinger'. Despite the lack of gadgets in CR everything was astounding and Bond fans were looking forward to the next instalment and the first direct sequel (although the character from Dr.No, Sylvia Trench reappears in From Russia With Love; this was not a proper sequel that followed on from the original).<br/><br/>However when released in 2008, Bond fans thought the franchise was over and mates would ask and wonder why it was as bad as they had heard it was. <br/><br/>Was it the acting? No. <br/><br/>Was it too long? No.<br/><br/>What was it? (This can be answered in less than a sentence) It has a plot that only Bruce Willis or Jason Bourne could care about. It feels like The Bourne Insanity. (Basically the villain wants to stop water coming in to Bolivia. Bond fans thought it was a lie. No! They shouted in despair, but that was it. This left the fans in outrage: Neil Purvis and Robert Wade should be shot dead. The Bond franchise was dead in the mud and with nothing left for the fans to do they re-watched Casino Royale. Even that though lost its enduring appeal; they needed a new bond film, a better bond villain and plot.<br/><br/>So in October comes the long awaited entry to the Bond franchise: Skyfall. Would it entertain?<br/><br/>Would Q return?<br/><br/>And is it at least watchable?<br/><br/>All of the above can be ticked off with pleasure. Skyfall delivers and it passes and sails with flying colours. OK so Eve is a bit annoying and has very little on screen chemistry with Bond and it feels forced. However, the many other aspects of the film will even please the most angered and bad tempered critic out there. Want evidence: it currently has an 8.1 score and is on the Top 250, on Rotten Tomatoes it has a 92% approval rating from over 250 critics, still not satisfied? OK then I will elaborate.<br/><br/>Throughout the film Bond's pain is felt, he's unsure if he has still got what it takes to be a super spy and stop the villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) from hunting down M. Silva's motive for this is that he believes M betrayed him, his cyanide capsule did not work. Therefore, he believes that she must pay and so will MI6 for his suffering and torture. Bardem is the ultimate Bond villain bringing passion and vengeance to the role, his role is probably the best to date and therefore Silva is on par with Bond villains like Auric Goldfinger. <br/><br/>Q makes a welcome return even if he only supplies Bond with two different gadgets, one of which is only a distress signal and hardly worth much if any of Bond's time. However, the negatives are all forgotten about with so many positives and strengths within the film it's hard to pinpoint the key elements and moments. Although not as good as Golfinger or On Her Majesty's Secret Service, this is still one of Bond's best.<br/><br/>As Bond girls go Eve is quite lame, but the surprise in this film is that it departs from the average and by the books Bond formula. M is the Bond girl in this instalment. As such we see her fear, even more swearing and how she reflects on her 'sins' as put by Silva. This is an odd turn, surprising yet it still works well within the film and leads to a sad yet spectacular finale.<br/><br/>In this film everything is there: the action, the beautiful women, the gadgets (sort of), the villain, the cars and the exotic locations. The finale will never disappoint even on a second viewing. Even though the majority of the film is set in London it ties in well with the Olympics this year and makes us all proud to be British. After fifty years, Sam Mendes proves that nobody does it better than Bond and never will do. Bond fans rejoice; the Bond Ultimatum so to speak is here!<br/><br/>P.S. Wade and Purvis all is forgiven!"

I thought it was a brilliant milestone for Bond's 50th anniversary and although it had its flaws and some failed connections, it was beautifully shot, full of action and humorous as always! Nice one, Mendes.<br/><br/>There was quite a lot of obvious marketing in Skyfall which disappointed me as the producers are only doing it for the extra money. The last thing I want to see in a fictional film is big logos and brands that we see in a consumer's every-day culture. However, on a more positive note, there were no Apple products! I was so pleased at this; I hate Apple. Another thing I picked up on in Skyfall was how similar it is to classic Bond films from the 60s and 70s. I thought this was a great thing to do as Skyfall marks the 50th anniversary of James Bond and revives some of the moments from old Bond films.<br/><br/>Sorry, these were just a couple of small paragraphs from my review as a kind-of taster.

"multiracial54","9","1","9","12 November 2012"," Bond is definitely Back
","This is my first ever review for IMDb, I often used IMDb but after watching Skyfall, I had to let my opinion be known. As a Bond fanatic I can say with complete surety that Skyfall is a refreshing departure from the themes of the last two Bond films (Casino Royale, and the major disappointment Q.O.S). Produced by the late Albert Broccoli's two children, Skyfall possesses all the characteristics that made Bond, Bond over the last 50 years. Gone are 007's/Daniel Craig's attempts to embrace 007's faults and struggles as an agent with his personal demons. Skyfall fully embraces the role of 007 as suave, super agent, a man of both mystery and muscle, instead of the 'action hero' persona captured in the last two bond films. My grades below:****Spoilers Below***** A: Full of ACTION. From the opening vignette, the movie is jam packed with action sequences, broken only by the intermittent segues into more action B: BOND IS BACK! Daniel Craig must be given credit for his portrayal of Bond the secret agent. He is able to both capture Bonds mortality, and his ability to just plain ol kick some ass! Sam Mendes deserves even more credit for recapturing the essence of Bond. Exotic locations, camera work and angles, lighting, beautiful women, and enough drama to satiate the Bond purists. F: Femme fatal. A necessary component of EVERY Bond film. Berenice Marlohe is a knock out, a tribute to many of the former French models who have been in previous Bond films. Her screen time equates to what seems like a cameoHer character and interaction with 007 could have been further developed. Someone that hot, deserves more screen time G, G, G: Girls,Guns, Gadgets. Q-branch finally made it into a Bond film with DanielCraig, a theme a I thought was missing from the last two Bond films,Walther PPK is back, and the girls are great, Naomie Harris, Berenice Marlohe, and Tonia Sotiropoulou as Bonds lover. L: Location, althoughmuch of the action takes place in England, we visit destinations such as James home town of Scotland, Turkey, and China as well. Music: Adele totally rocks the theme song, paired with the dusky, primal, yet sexy song paired with the opening credits. N: Nostalgia. A theme I very much enjoyed, as many of the elements that made Bond Bond are back. These include vodka martinis, casino scene, Walther PPK's, and even the gray Austin Martin first featured in Gold Finger, and again later in Casino Royale, all play roles in the movie. Even M's office so prominently featured in many of the Connery movies is brought back. T: Time. At a shade under two hours, 23m, it is one of the longer Bond films, but it doesn't disappoint, nor does it leave you wishing the film was shorter. V: Villain. Javier Bardem is adept at playing dark, ominous characters. They should have had him embrace this role more fully instead of playing a 'gay' jilted former MI6 operative That's my synopsis, without giving too much away; I am already eagerly anticipating the next Bond films. Based on the developments in this movie, and the fact that Daniel Craig has signed on for another 3 Bond movies, you can rest assured that Bond is Back!"
"tasev1","9","1","9","11 November 2012"," The good outweighs the bad
","No matter what, I gave this film a high score because what it did well, it did VERY well and it more than made up for the things I hated about it.<br/><br/>Positive - for the 50th anniversary, this film does a fantastic job at playing homage to all the original films from the obvious, right down to the smallest of detail that may be missed. The movie takes Craig's Bond full circle in character development through 3 films (from rough inexperienced, through angry and vengeful) right into the 'final version' of his Bond's character and gently depositing him in Connery's shoes. The movie is not in my opinion a traditional bond flick, but that in it's own respect is what I actually like about it (QoS was more traditional). We get an insight into his soul and where he comes from. Character introductions were brilliant.<br/><br/>Negative - Bond villain was terrible. Bond girl (if that's what you call her) was even worse. Eve his fellow agent was more of a Bond girl than anything, and though beautiful (and no offense intended - you will understand at the end) was the wrong (in my opinion), er, nationality. Q was way to young to be believable despite the fact that they try to excuse it in the film. And his TWO gadgets, well, apparently we just don't use gadgets anymore . And the story: WEAK. Old plot device told poorly (and they almost allude to that in the story itself)."

","You grab your seat, with a bucket of popcorn, anticipating a bond-wagon to roll you over and you see a start which is perfectly in line with that anticipation- a mad chase in a Non-British, Non-American country which provides cultural variety, crowded streets, colorful landscapes and everything one has traditionally associated with a location for a spy chase sequence. Even before you get a chance to settle in, you are asked to get ready for a trip as start credits begin to roll along with some brilliant visuals and trippy music.<br/><br/>I have always considered Bond movies as wholesome entertainment packages with which a lot of famous names have been associated over years. I could never see it fall in the category of serious cinema where I would want to spend a lot of time. But I was pleasantly surprised and was full of hope the day I got to know that Skyfall is being directed by none other than Sam Mendes who has created more than one masterpiece in his not so long career and is a master at slow plot building/twisting and also loves to create life like characters who are complicated,dark and layered.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a rare experience in itself .It is a blend of what Bond movies have stood for over five decades and what Mendes has perfected as an art. It is that rare bond movie where scenes are not exhilarating but are absorbing in nature. Here, director doesn't want the adrenaline to rush but wants your senses to go numb and flat before they surge back with a different kind of excitement. Skyfall is by far the most beautifully shot Bond movie ever. The climax sequence which is being shown to be happening at the time of dusk in some beautiful Scotland countryside location is one of the most hauntingly beautiful shooting sequences that you will ever come across. The manner in which blueness of sky and the glow of fire and bulbs complement each other is a sight to cherish. The portions shot in Shanghai and Macau are neither loaded with nor devoid of what you are used to see in a Bond flick but refreshingly suck you in the scenes through beautiful frames and lighting and most importantly a surrealistically relaxed treatment. <br/><br/>In times where Nolan has created the most revered anti-hero character, it is very natural that any director, how so ever acclaimed he might be would tend to get inspired by the character of Joker (The Dark Knight). It would be extremely unfair to say that Mendes and his writers drew inspiration from Joker's character while they created Silva's character for Bardem but there is no doubt that there is uncanny similarity in the development and treatment of both these characters. Javier Bardem plays a fantastically devilish ex-agent of MI6 who takes the path of cyber- terrorism to seek revenge from M, the head of intelligence wing of British secret service played by Judi Dench. She has played her part satisfactorily as required by the plot but the expectations are much higher when an actor of her caliber is cast in a production like this and that certainly is an area where Skyfall could have thrown few more punches.<br/><br/>Go and take a plunge in the world of Mendes's Bond. It could work for you just like it worked for me but I have a feeling that a lot of 007 aficionados would feel a little cheated."

He is what Bond needed. Rugged and sophisticated and a real person. The film has no silly over-the-top gadgets, its back to basics and the film is reminiscent of the great Terence Young Bonds. In the early Bonds, he had no fancy gadgets. I liked Connery and Craig is equal to him. The story is excellent and Bardem is sublime as the crazy baddie.

"rivertam26","9","1","9","9 November 2012"," A Pleasant Surprise
","I've always liked the James Bond movies but I wouldn't say i was enthusiastic about seeing them. The trailers for Skyfall looked decent and despite the buzz I set my expectations about mid range.I have to tell you I was really blown away. It may be the best of The Bond films and one of the best of the year. Daniel Craig reprises his role as the title character but this time around he looks aged and battered. Gone are his slinky, seductive charm and anew is a more human relatable angle, gritty even. I don't really want to go into Skyfall's surprisingly unique and complex plot line but I'll just say it blew me away. And it all lies in the films superb execution Director Sam Mendes beautifully fuses heightened action sequences, character based drama and good old fashioned espionage suspense into a film that explores age, history and relationships between lovers, friends and mentors to surprising depth that illicits a surprisingly emotional punch. Gone are the the high tech fluidity and garishness of previous entries and it's back to the basics in a form that really works for this franchise. But the great thing about Skyfall besides the outstanding direction, strong performances from Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem is the fact that it feels new altogether. The film starts off with a nicely choreographed but less than stellar and little hammy in my opinion action sequence and morphs into a character drama with some truly unforgettable scenes. One of my favorites concerns Bond being Interrogated by Bardem and he starts to feel him up a little. It's played with a sly homoeroticism that takes the scene to all kinds of new levels as Bond replies ""what makes you think this is my first time"". Also I really loved the cinematography it has the most gorgeous visuals I've seen all year lush colors and settings used to full effect and an abundance of well placed lighting and shadow that echoes films of the past and brings them roaring into the present. Skyfall may be a Bond film but it's a new experience all together there's even a little Home Aloneish nod turned into the films finale which adds to the films overall unexpected effect."
"anthony-burton4","7","1","9","5 November 2012"," The Franchise returns to standard format
","Ian Fleming's Bond was a cold, calculating, ruthless killer, who showed little in the way of emotion, instead turning to alcohol, cigarettes, women and gambling (both with money and danger) as a means of dealing with his job. <br/><br/>The first James Bond movie, Dr. No in 1962, made a good compromise between the book and presenting a suspenseful thriller with some sci- fi/action thrown in. Bond delivered a handful of one-liners but the humour was completely black. The movie suffered from some very average special effects and acting, but it was a good start to the franchise.<br/><br/>After this the movies increasingly diverged from the books sometimes they just borrowed bits of the plot, sometimes just the title! The characterisations they touched on in Dr. No were abandoned and increasingly implausible plots became the norm. We were fed a diet of non-stop action, (especially car chases), gadgets and cheesy one-liners. This was particularly true when Roger Moore took over. The exception to the general trend, was the George Lazenby experiment - On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which was pretty faithful to the novel. This attempted to be a slightly more meaningful movie, however Lazenby didn't come close to possessing the acting skills. Bond movies after Dr. No were never more than light-hearted entertainment.<br/><br/>But then along came Casino Royale and changed the rules. Ian Fleming's Bond exposed for the first time in film. This was a film that was seriously dark at times, and Daniel Craig delivered the performance that may have been asked of Lazenby, with the exception that Craig delivered brilliantly. We see the ruthless killer, but still with a human-side (he is new to the 00 scene after all). I fully expected the human-side to be diminished with Vesper's death at the end of Quantum of Solace and eagerly awaited Skyfall.<br/><br/>Skyfall spectacularly failed to deliver though. Right from the word go we have a reality-failure with a car-chase that reminded me of some of the less plausible Roger Moore shenanigans. With Skyfall, we have a return to the old blend of action and cheese - all attempts at delivering anything deeper have been abandoned. This movie and Bourne are frequently mentioned in the same breath - you have to be kidding me - Skyfall is entertaining and pacey - but don't expect any substance - If you liked Roger Moore as Bond you'll probably love it. If you liked Casino Royale and expect more of the same here, you'll be disappointed."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","8","1","9","5 November 2012"," The best Bond ever?
","I went to the cinema with ideas of seeing the best Bond movie ever. Every movie critic that I know and read said that this is the best one! So, naturally, I was expecting something spectacular and earthshaking. Is it? Well, not really.<br/><br/>The story: Conceptually divided into three parts and every part functions marvelously. Put together they work even better making this movie an admirable and well connected whole. Everything is present: the action, the classic Bond elements, the innovative and controversial new ideas and places. Portrayting Bond's past, his weaknesses and failures was bold and well done. We actually found out what Bond is like, who he is, where he comes from etc. It gives him a human, realistic shape and brings us closer to understanding his nature. The plot itself is not very original and is at the beginning predictable and digestible. To be realistic, nobody really expected a Prometheus-like story in a James Bond movie, so no setbacks there. The problem with this segment of the movie is that it's just too long. 143 min is way to long for a movie of this type. The climax of the story got lost. In the beginning of the third part of the movie everyone (including the actors) understood that the climax is missing. Exactly when the biggest action is expected and the keeping-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat scenes are expected, Mendes slows down and creates an intro to the real climax which is marvelous and beautifully shot and acted, but way to long and a bit overdue. One star less because of this.<br/><br/>The acting: classical British perfection. Craig got the idea of what Bond needs to be and did it marvelously, 'till one point. Here we, again, come to the third part where Craig simply gave up, almost giving me the idea that he's a bit fed up with the character. This decline in the acting is way too obvious and spoiled the whole, really good final idea. Because of this another star down. Dench, a classical marvelous performance, having way more influence and screen time than so far in any JB movie. Finnes was great, showing that he can act as a good guy. The absolute Oscar worthy, Cannes worthy, BAFTA & Golden globe worthy performance is Javier Bardem's. He understood how much screen time he had (not a lot at all) and decided to grasp everything he had and gave one of the best performances in his career and, without a doubt, the best performance in the movie. He simply ""ate"" everyone standing in the same scene with him. Power, hatred, evil, sorrow, done with such ease, without a glimpse of force. Natural and relaxed, just like he is Silva.<br/><br/>The name: Even though I spoiled some elements of the movie the last part I will leave to the reader to decide weather he thinks like me, or disagrees with me. Both is fine, and both views have it's ""pro et contra."" Just ask yourself what do you think ""Skyfall"" stands for? When I finally figured out it cosed the movie another star. Maybe you will think otherwise, but a movie with such a powerful name, in my opinion, has to give greater meaning to the name itself.<br/><br/>All in all a great JB movie, a fantastic action movie with some marvelous performances, fantastic directing, and breathtaking camera-work and scenes. The best Bond ever? Close, but still far from it."
"dario_malic","8","1","9","4 November 2012"," The end is the beginning
","It has been fifty years since ""Dr. No"", the first James Bond movie came out, and to celebrate that anniversary we have before us twenty-third installment in the series, ""Skyfall"". For the first time in the hands of an Oscar winner (Sam Mendes), new Bond has a list of very respectable names attached to it. First draft of the screenplay was written by Peter Morgan while one of the authors of the final version is John Logan. The music is written by Thomas Newman, and Roger Deakins was handling the cinematography. The cast is surely one of the best ever, with Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Albert Finney and Ben Wishaw. And of course, there's Sam Mendes at the helm. Having liked the previous two Craig's Bond movies and looking at that list of names, I was really convinced that this could be the best Bond ever. After watching it I'm not that convinced anymore.<br/><br/>So what's it all about? Someone stole the list with the names of every British secret agent and trying to recover it Bond went missing. It becomes obvious that whoever has the list has some personal quarrel with M. After an attack on the MI6 headquarters Bond comes back and helps M find the person behind it. It turns out to be Tiago Rodriguez a.k.a. Raoul Silva, a former MI6 operative who's after M because of some things from the past. Luckily, Bond is here to save the day. Or is he? <br/><br/>With the arrival of Craig as James Bond, the character, as well as the series, was given a new look. Bond became vulnerable, more violent and not so well-mannered. But this time there is another change, with considering Bond's age and is it interfering with his abilities. Probably motivated by 50th anniversary and the talk of the series becoming old and redundant, the movie discusses Bond's ability as well as the ability and necessity of the whole MI6 department and shows us in the end that they still have a lot to give and we still need them. Talking of course not about just Bond and MI6 but the movie series as well. This theme is not the only thing inspired by the anniversary. In fact, there are a lot of smaller and bigger details pointing back to the series' roots. From the classic silver Aston Martin DB5 (""Goldfinger"", ""Thunderball"") which even has the same license plate number, and the locations in Turkey and Scotland (""From Russia with Love""), to a criminal mastermind with his own island (""Dr. No"") and a little deranged personality (all of the early Bond villains). There's also a sense of going back to the roots in introducing new versions of key characters, and even the office in the end and M giving Bond a new assignment remind of old Bond movies.<br/><br/>Alongside that with the early entries in the series, there's another parallel ""Skyfall"" draws, the one with Nolan's Batman trilogy. Nolan's Batman and new Bond are both troublesome characters trying to overcome their weaknesses to do a greater good, which isn't so uncommon, but some of the similarities with ""The Dark Knight Rises"" are striking. In the first place it's the relation with the main bad guy. Just like Batman and Bane, Bond and Silva share the same training and mentor. For the first it's the League of Shadows and Ra's Al Ghul, while for the others it's MI6 and M. Both Bane and Silva were discarded by their mentors which filled them with rage and both of them brought chaos to the cities of their enemies (in Gotham it's the stadium which collapses while in London it's a part of the London Underground). There's also previously mentioned issue of being too old and incapable to do what has to be done, discussed in the latest Batman movie as well. The movies even share a line foreshadowing the imminent destruction (""A storm is coming."").<br/><br/>But this is still a Bond movie. It has great action, beautiful locations, beautiful women and a sense of humour, although not all of that to the same extent. The action really is great and the locations more than beautiful mostly thanks to Deakins's cinematography which is outstanding and deserving of his 10th Oscar nomination. Of course, credits go to Dennis Gassner's (interestingly, another frequent Coen brothers' collaborator) production design and Mendes's direction as well. The other two things I have a problem with. There are two women in the movie, aside from M of course. One of them can't really be called a standard Bond girl due to her probably continuing appearance in the series, and the other is given very little screen time, appearing and disappearing in the middle of the movie, and thus for the first time making M the most prominent female in a Bond movie. In accordance with the story, of course, but strange nonetheless. With the lack of women, but without greater meaning than to provide a comic moment, comes Bond's first homo-erotic moment, Silva touching his legs and Bond implying it would not be his first time. It gives Craig a great line, but sticks out as unnecessary in the same time making us aware of how little humour there is in the movie.<br/><br/>Read the complete review at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

","The plot is quite familiar the acting is brilliant the director focuses on theme and characterisation the action is actually quite scarce the villain is similar to the joker.<br/><br/>some of the plot is very similar to the dark knight the ending is brilliant overall, one of the best best Bond movie, and daniel craig is a superb 007. Skyfall, the often dazzling, always audacious new entry directed by Sam Mendes, is no different. For better or worse we live in the age of the superhero, and so Mendes's film is less hardboiled spy saga than blistering comic-book escapade. The template here is Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight."
"anish-7","8","1","9","1 November 2012"," Amongst the very best of Bond
","Bond fans can heave a sigh of relief. The franchisee is in safe hands with Sam Mendes and the redoubtable Daniel Craig. <br/><br/>Bond no. 23 (Skyfall) for most parts works like a charm. Its beauty lying in the deft directorial touches from director Mendes and ably supported by master actors like Judie Dench and Javier Bardem. Bardem is slimy, memorable, deranged, grand, dramatic, homo-erotic and frighteningly off his rocker as the wrecker in chief, Silva. Silva is an honorable entry in the rogue's gallery of Bond's nemeses. Bardem pulls off the act well, never letting it get out of control. <br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes clearly is a Bond fan what with many references to previous Bond films cleverly inserted here and there. Mendes also is high on symbolism. We see a crook in a cop's uniform running helter skelter to save his skin, the two ""rats"" scampering through underground drainage like real rats would, court proceedings being brought to halt by some instant justice meted out and of course the final denouement in the house of Lord.<br/><br/>Mendes has also tried to be crowd pleaser with a new, young, freshly scrubbed Quartermaster (Q) and Ms MoneyPenny, obligatory love making scenes plus the new eye candy Bond girl (Bérénice Marlohe). But thankfully he doesn't try too hard. A word must be mentioned of Roger Deakin, the staple cinematographer of Mendes' films. He lends a refreshingly beautiful, majestic and picturesque touch to the locations and proceedings.<br/><br/>The film opens with a crackerjack of an opening action sequence which grabs you by the seat of your pants and doesn't let go of it till Adele belts out her haunting and memorable theme number.<br/><br/>So how does Skyfall stack up against other Bond movies? Well, my answer is that it is good enough to be counted amongst the top 5. <br/><br/>A job well done Agent 007. I am going with 3.5 stars on 5."
"1bilbo","10","1","10","13 July 2014"," Great until Finney turns up.
","This is by far the best Bond ever – despite the goofs.<br/><br/>That is until Albert Finney appears; the idea that a Scottish gamekeeper would be so foul mouthed is implausible. Finney's entire character is not believable and should be fast forwarded. It is also ludicrous that they could have defeated the highly equipped bad guys with a few sticks of dynamite – Welcome to Scotland"" should have been ""Welcome to nonsense.""<br/><br/>All the rest of the cast are superb; especially Rory Kinnear and Ralph Fiennes who were both perfect in their roles. The entire MI6 set up is entirely believable and the film is terrific until they cross the border.<br/><br/>This is the only Bond film where there is believable banter between 007 and M – there are some great comic moments, ""Run out of whisky where you were"" and ""You're bloody well not sleeping here."" Are gems from M.<br/><br/>I gave it 10 because it is so good – without Finney it would have been even better."
"dankneece","10","1","10","6 December 2012"," Skyfall, A Worthy Addition To The Bond Legacy
","Finally got to see Skyfall today at the Dine-In AMC Theater in Marina Del Rey, California. Wanted to go to the Landmark in Westwood, but time did not permit. The AMC was nice though at least at first sit with electric recliners and food and bar service right in the theater similar to the Alamo Brew House in Austin. When the film started a few things bugged me though. People tend to feel a bit more like they're in their living room in this environment which means a bit more talking. Its not a stadium seating room, but the main bone to pick is the night lights in between each seat which seemed overly bright during the screening. As far as Skyfall itself, I really liked the film. Adele's title track wasn't strong enough, but all in all a good Bond film which helps erase the mental trauma of that most terrible of films, Quantum of Solace. Skyfall feels like a Bond film. The opening sequence is very good and the shots are wide enough so we know where we are as it unfolds. The film itself has enough tense scenes and calm scenes to have great pace and engage the audience. Unlike Quantum of Solace you actually care about the characters, good and villainous, and it has a story, an honest to goodness story. Mendes did a good job of direction and Deakins Arri Alexa photography was gorgeous. I did not see the Imax version which I thought would be useless since the film wasn't shot in Imax, but the version I saw looked great with no noticeable digital artifacts. I still think the first five Sean Connery Bonds are the best of course, but Skyfall is a worthy addition to the Bond legacy. Now if only I could erase Quantum of Solace from my memory. Unfortunately nothing short of a lobotomy will do that and I'm not ready to go that far at this juncture. Skyfall is good. Casino Royale is the better Daniel Craig Bond, but Skyfall is a close second. If you haven't seen it go. You'll get quite the ride."
"seaview1","8","1","10","5 December 2012"," Bond's Triumphant Return in SKYFALL
","Daniel Craig made an impressive debut as Ian Fleming's super spy James Bond in Casino Royale, but its followup, Quantum of Solace, was a marked drop off which threatened to derail the franchise. Enter director Sam Mendes (American Beauty), a well honed script (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan), and a dream cast. The result is a well acted, emotionally compelling adventure thriller that takes the formula and rips it open to expose Agent 007 as we've never seen before. It is also one of the best films of the year and certainly one of the very best Bond films.<br/><br/>British secret service agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) and fellow operative Eve (Naomie Harris) are in pursuit of a killer who has stolen a hard drive containing the names of all NATO agents imbedded in terrorist groups. A fateful decision by MI6 boss M (Judi Dench) leads to Bond being put out of commission. While M is being leveraged into retirement by her supervisor (Ralph Feinnes) and Bond has lost his edge, a mysterious figure (Javier Bardem) from M's past begins a reign of cyber terror and revenge. As agent 007 struggles with his future and his loyalties to M, he must look to his past to reconcile his biggest challenge. <br/><br/>There are obvious comparisons to The Dark Knight Rises with a fallen hero searching for his 'mojo'. Most Bond films operated superficially and featured unusual characters, and with rare exceptions (On Her Majesty's Secret Service and of course the more recent Casino Royale) did we delve into the personal side. While early incarnations of the super agent showed him nearly invincible, this Bond is a more humanized reinvention without emasculating its hero. For the first time, Craig's Bond has a sense of humor with puns and quips (a staple of the earlier films). In fact, much of the dialogue is sharp. <br/><br/>By delving into the core relationships, the filmmakers have added layers and twists to a conventional formula. The main themes center on loyalty, sins of the past, and tradition clashing with the new order. There are parallels between Bond and M as relics of an age gone by and between Bond and his doppelganger as direct opposites. <br/><br/>This is Dench's showcase as M. Although her allegiance to Bond was a recurring theme in the previous two films with Craig, never before has her character been shown in such depth. After seven Bond films, her M has gone from background to foreground as a primary plot point, and she does not disappoint. <br/><br/>There is a nice buildup to Bardem's entrance whose psychological motives are questionable including his sexuality. This is not your father's Bond villain. As Silva, a man with a dark past whose methods are bold and brazen, Bardem instills a decided creepiness and cunning that is refreshing. Think of Bardem's character as the black sheep of a dysfunctional family with M in the maternal role. <br/><br/>A strong supporting cast includes Ben Whishaw as the new quartermaster Q, a young computer whiz who represents the new breed of spy, Bérénice Marlohe as a stunning beauty who holds the key to her dangerous employer, and Harris in a pivotal role. <br/><br/>With splendid global locations (Istanbal, Shanghai, and Scotland), this may be the most beautifully shot Bond film (Roger Deakins) since You Only Live Twice. Some scenes are visual standouts like a sultry shower rendezvous and a moment of hand-to-hand combat all done in shadows and silhouette. <br/><br/>In this age of 24, Jason Bourne, and Homeland, the stakes are much higher in depicting realistic action and techie scenes, and Skyfall holds its own with solid set pieces including a subway bombing and a tense climax with echoes of Straw Dogs. There are specific references to the Bond canon including the reappearance of a certain iconic car. <br/><br/>It is remarkable how current, top directors have been directly influenced or inspired by these movies. Steven Spielberg did the Indiana Jones movies as homage to Bond films and even cast former Bond, Sean Connery, as Indy's dad! James Cameron did his take on a super spy with True Lies. Christopher Nolan filmed an entire sequence in Inception as tribute to Bond. David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has Bond style, opening credits; (Skyfall has terrific credits and a sultry, throwback theme song by Adele). Even Quentin Tarantino suggested several years ago that the Bond films needed to get gritty and basic; think the filmmakers took notice? <br/><br/>As J.J. Abrams' Star Trek and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins showed, a classic franchise can be reinvented or updated while reaping enormous dividends. With the most touching finale to a Bond film, there are big surprises and a distinct familiarity by film's end that sets the series for a grand run. For Bond purists, this is uncharted territory, but by 'shaking' up the mythology, Bond's story has become 'stirring'."
"arminfakouhi","7","1","10","5 December 2012"," Good job, 007
","James Bond turns 50...this truly called for a big party and that's what Sam Mendes delivered. Bond No.23 managed to show us 007 as an agent from past times who is vulnerable and has a hard time to keep up with the World 2.0...but proves throughout the journey that he is not only still relevant but also adaptable. IMHO the past Bonds had the flaw of a predictable franchise trying to check off all the typical Bond features. Now what are the attributes setting this one apart? Yes, James Bond is still a lady killer and gets them all, yes the movie brings us to the up and coming cities in the world and yes there are gadgets....but it's all done in a much more settle and yet very powerful and efficient way. A big contribution to this pictures' greatness was the choice of the cast, Judi Dench is rock solid as usual and Ralph Fiennes is a great new addition to the cast, plus there is one surprise character which explains a certain shortcoming of 007 during the movie. But the character which truly makes the difference is clearly Javier Bardem. He is finally the super villain which I have missed in the recent Bond movies, somewhat of a cocktail of a hands-on Bloefeld of our times and a PG-13 version of Bardem's ""No Country for Old Men""-character. Throughout these very entertaining 2 h, ""Skyfall"" takes us ""back to the future"" (you'll see what i mean) and it's a great ride...."
"davideo-2","9","1","10","1 December 2012"," Not the classic some have said it is, but still a superior, spectacular thrill ride
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>James Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed dead after a mission in Turkey ended with Agent Eve (Naomie Harris) making a fatal error. Of course, he's survived and has simply been skulking around, living in the shadows. Which is just as well, after a major terrorist attack rocks London. Knowing no other agent can match his wits (even if his physical fitness reports aren't what they should be!) M sends Bond to Shanghai to retrieve a list of other potential targets. But the elusive terrorist mastermind Silva (Javier Bardem) has a bigger fish to fry- a grudge against M and MI6 that can be settled in no way other than blood.<br/><br/>In an age where long established franchises are seemingly the only thing that makes the box office tills clatter and cling, it must have seemed odd for film connoisseurs that such a long period of time passed (four years, no less) since Bond's last, highly disappointing entry Quantum of Solace passed. Production difficulties were stated (but, basically, they just didn't have the money!) but, good things come to those who wait, and Skyfall will no doubt be more than what the really devoted fans were expecting, even if a really critical guy like me couldn't quite call it a classic.<br/><br/>I would personally hasten that Martin Campbell could have done a better job directing, but Sam Mendes is a more than competent choice here. Even if he allows the pace to drag in parts, there is enough sweeping cinematography, awe inspiring spectacle and lavish action set pieces to keep the fans on edge. Like the best of the modern action films, it also never forgets to be relevant and topical, with the plot centring as it does on terrorism and M's speech justifying her agency, stating how 'the enemy today cannot be seen and is not known.' Less than ten years after July 7th, some may find it a bit hard to stomach, but others will find it lends added tension and razor sharp realism.<br/><br/>Cast wise, Craig is still a fine Bond, even if the script cleverly prods at him getting older, with his character not passing his fitness reports and Ralph Fiennes's character hinting his job is 'a young man's game.' Few will forget his performance in No Country for Old Men, so Bardem is an inspired choice for the villain, really keeping the viewer in suspense dragging making his presence known out. Harris is a steely, feisty Bond girl who comes to have more relevance at the end when Judi Dench's M takes a surprising turn.<br/><br/>Like many films nowadays, it may be one I need to see twice, but sadly on first viewing I couldn't quite take it as a classic. Still, for sheer spectacle and as a sheer cinematic experience, it's a must, with Adele providing one of the most soulful, stirring theme songs in ages. ****"

With opening tunes by Adel, the traditional opening eye shot is held to the end and this 50th Anniversary flick shows that Bond is still the ultimate secret agent man.

"colinbarnard-1","7","1","10","19 November 2012"," Good Film, But NOT Best Craig Outing
","I'm probably being too harsh with the 7 out of 10 rating. I've given much lesser films the same score. I love Daniel Craig's take on Bond, and the new direction of the Brocolli ""franchise"". Skyfall is beautifully shot, directed, with many strong moments. <br/><br/>I literally cringe when watching any non-Craig film. The camp, and the tongue-in-cheek unbelievability prevent me from watching more than a few minutes' worth. Sorry, MGM, but you've spoiled me: I shan't be purchasing any boxed sets, at least not until Craig does as many as Roger Moore and they are available separately. <br/><br/>But warning note to the Brocolli-Wilson braintrust and MGM in toto- the injection into this film of ""Q"", Moneypenny (as played by Naomie Harris) and Ralph Fiennes' ""M"" (replete with Bernard Lee's office), as well as a villain who is too much of a mustache-twirling cad, signals a possible return to the camp of the past. That is why this film gets a ""7-10"".<br/><br/>If they had have used a nuanced antagonist (note the words) for Bond, the film could have topped ""Casino Royale"". Le Chiffre was wonderful. Anton Chigre was not. Save your casting money, MGM- you need it. Use you writers to come up with believable stories and antagonists for Craig's character. We can always turn to Jason Bourne if you insist on creating a cartoon for Craig-Bond 4. And for God's sake, don't keep Naomie Harris behind a desk........"

","A touchy-feely James Bond with life coming to a full circle for the super agent as he returns to his not so humble origins complete with Batman's Alfredish housekeeper if you will. Don't go looking for swanky gadgets and death-defying stunts. This one's more for the soul and not for the eyes as was evident by the lack of a leading 'Bond Girl'. DH with his uncanny ability to name that one thing you can't put your finger on,compared it rightly to the 'Bourne' movies. No major punch lines. Nice subtle humor. Exotic locales for only part of the movie. You get the idea. Daniel Craig's best performance till date as he finally shakes off the 'love's labor lost' demeanor from the first two movies and becomes the gutsy lone hero. Also, as I always say , a super hero movie is only as good as the super villain. Watch out for the pseudo seduction scene between Bond and nemesis Silva played by none other than Javier Bardem. Silva too has a personal vendetta and it's not world domination this time. A cocky new Q, a fragile and poetry spouting M and a made over Miss Moneypenny completed the cast. Biggest disappointment for me, Lord Voldemort's return. No, not literally.I meant Ralph Fiennes, whose character sort of just lurked in the shadows and didn't really contribute. Instead an awe-inspiring title rendition of 'Skyfall' by Adelefor me, second only to Garbage's 'World Is Not Enough' original sound track.<br/><br/>This is the end and I liked it."

"jeasto1966","7","1","10","10 November 2012"," The Changing Face of Bond
","One of the most noticeable changes of the newest installment of the Bond franchise is a lot less sex. James has only a couple passing romantic flings in Skyfall, and neither occupies too much of the plot. Obviously this goes along with the new direction of the franchise for a more gritty, less plastic Bond. The fact that there are less gadgets feeds into this as well. While the fan of the traditional Bond may see this as a failing, the truth is that the Bond-girls aren't less sexy...it's just that James has a job to do. <br/><br/>Everyone in this film were superb in their roles, including Albert Finney who is perfect for the part of games keeper of the Vond family estate. (The fact that we have now given Bond a family backstory is one of the few flaws in the film, as I see it. Part of Bond's appeal was his anonymity.) Javier Bardem apparently has a knack for villains....first No Country for Old Men, and now Skyfall. The villains in the last two films I felt we're rather weak, but Bardem resuscitates a long tradition of great bad guys. <br/><br/>All in all a good way to spend a Saturday afternoon."

","I never liked Daniel Craig from the start, he was too much like Bourne and he didn't add any humor. I was really worried this movie would disappoint. My fears were put to rest, however. Skyfall has to be the best Bond movie by far. I have watched all the other EON Bond films, and the remake of Thunderball with Sean Connery, Never Say Never Again. If you haven't, then you probably did not enjoy this movie as I did.<br/><br/>Skyfall makes many references to older Bond films, and I'll say right now, they make this movie. No doubt. Obvious references to Goldfinger, For Your Eyes Only, Goldeneye(and Never Say Never Again?), and, You Only Live Twice. Others can be argued, but these were the more indisputable ones.<br/><br/>Beyond that, If you just wanted an entertaining Bond movie, Javier Bardem makes a fantastic Bond villain, smart, funny, still bad, and one of the more entertaining Bond Villain deaths, even if it wasn't elaborate or 'Bondish.' There are two great entrance scenes, and he even makes an oblique reference to Jaws from the Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the old, more original Bond movies, please go see this, even if, like me you're not a Daniel Craig fan and it's been painful to call Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace Bond films, if you get through Skyfall, I guarantee many of you will be looking forward to Having Daniel Craig signed on for Bonds 24 and 25. The ending wrapped up so nicely and Bond is back by the end!"

This makes it the 2nd best Bond Movie yet. Bond is all about the action and the smartness, you get it all from Skyfall. Such an amazing movie it's unreal! I didn't want it to end.

","One thing people should do is reflect back through the James Bond films a little. The plot of this new film revolves around ""M's"" mistakes and failures as head of the 00 department. We see it a little in ""The World is Not Enough,"" and ""Golden Eye."" Her continued mistakes on how she treats the 00's and certain cases in her department is further reflected in the opening scene of the movie. As a result the movie shows how her mistakes have taken a toll against her and her department.<br/><br/>I told myself I would not give out any spoilers, however I will say that the movie reasonably produces a new series for James Bond. And in the end you see the new players that will be making the new movies of the series. I actually think they gave the end justice, by producing a new cast for future James Bond films.<br/><br/>This movie was pretty awesome and did meet my expectations. I still feel it is missing something of the older James Bond Movies. I'm not sure what it is, but perhaps the older James Bond Films Villain's seem a bit more evil and more world devastating than the new James Bond Villains. I suppose its because they are trying to be more realistic with their scenarios and plots. <br/><br/>As far as the actual characters they used for bad guys... awesome, awesome job. This guy was scary as hell. What is even more scary is that he probably is the calmest villain I have seen throughout the entire James Bond Series. <br/><br/>I stick with my review and will also say that contrary to the people who really dismiss the James Bond films, this James Bond film has a completely different style, which I will say is gloomy and eerie at the same time being action packed. Throughout the film James Bond's ""style"" is not dismissed. So I'm glad to say that the directors, screen writers, and etc, haven't completely gotten rid of James Bond's tradition."

The opening sequence is a smash and keeps you staring at the action... the opening credits are, as always, a work of art.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite superb cinematography and very interesting shooting locations, because of the storyline I find the movie fails at being a simple Bond movie with exotic day time locales and I was expecting a less ""realistic"" movie for lack of other word. You're treated with something very grim both emotionally and in terms of events and there's nothing pretty there. This movie is simply troubling... draws comparisons in some respects with movies like those based on Ludlum i.e. Bourne or something like Ronin... I really don't get why the critics treat the movie as if it were business as usual. It's dark stuff."
"zardoz-13","9","1","11","10 November 2012"," Craig's Best Bond!!!
","The twenty-third installment in the James Bond film franchise ""Skyfall"" qualifies as an above-average 007 opus with several surprises. Clearly, this predictable but entertaining thriller ranks as the best Bond for actor Daniel Craig. Previously, Craig acquired his license to kill in ""Casino Royale"" (2006) and brandished it again in the lackluster ""Quantum of Solace"" in 2008. Oscar-winning ""American Beauty"" director Sam Mendes orchestrates the action with distinction. He gives it a polished look with the help of ace lenser Roger Deakins. Nevertheless, he cannot maintain a full head of steam to keep this actioneer from losing momentum in its last half-hour. Furthermore, ""Skyfall"" wears out its welcome during its final thirty minutes after serving up some vintage hard-knuckled heroics throughout its preceding two hours. Mendes does a good job of staging a rugged fistfight in a skyscraper in Shanghai, another knock-about brawl in a casino, and an early shoot-out scene at the arch-villain's hideout where 007 turns the tables on him. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig's James Bond struggles to stay at the top of his game after recovering from a near-death experience. ""Skyfall"" concerns James Bond more than his boss M. Scenarists Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan provide us with several insights about Bond's life before he joined MI6. Whether he is clinging to the bottom of an elevator ascending a towering skyscraper, scrambling after a subway train as it hauls out of the station, or swapping blows with an adversary atop of a speeding train racing into and out of tunnels, 007 survives by the hair of his chin. Comparably, ""Skyfall"" resembles ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and ""License to Kill."" Not only does ""Skyfall"" shun the usual puns, but it also avoids romantic entanglements. Bond shares the shower with one gal and flirts with another who enjoys shaving him with a cutthroat razor. Primarily, Her Majesty's best espionage agent spends most of his time under pressure to save his immediate superior M from an insane villain who resembles the villain in ""Law Abiding Citizen."" Judi Dench makes us feel M's pain but admire her pugnacity. ""Skyfall"" is surely her finest hour in Bondage. Ralph Fiennes makes a solid impression as M's rival. <br/><br/>""Skyfall"" unfolds in scenic Istanbul as 007 (Daniel Craig of ""Cowboys & Aliens"") discovers that the top-secret hard-drive from a laptop computer belonging to a British agent has been stolen. Bond pursues the killer, Patrice (Ola Rapace of ""Beyond""), with the help of another MI6 operative, Eve (Naomie Harris of ""Miami Vice""), who knows how to maneuver a truck through traffic gridlock. When Eve tries to cut off the elusive Patrice, Bond seizes a motorcycle and careens in close pursuit after him. Patrice ditches his motorcycle and leaps from a bridge onto a train. Bond follows him over the edge. Like Titans, they rain blows down on each other from the roof of the train. Eve lines them up in her gun sights. Since she cannot get a clean shot at Patrice, she refuses to pull the trigger for fear of hitting Bond. Back at MI6 HQ, an impatient M (Judi Dench of ""J. Edgar"") prompts Eve to take the 'bloody shot.' Eve's bullet slams into Bond rather than Patrice. Bond plunges from the train into the depths of a river below to be swept off in the rapids. The elaborate credit sequence that ensues is one of the more surreal since it depicts Bond's near-death experience. Later, M learns that the hard-drive contains the names of all NATO agents who are deep undercover in various terrorist organizations. <br/><br/>Miraculously, Bond survives the high fall, and chills on the beach before duty propels him back to London to help M sort herself out of her darkest hour. The interval in Bond's life is glossed over by the filmmakers. Mind you, this is James Bond at his most vulnerable, but he suffers a worst fate than this in ""Die Another Day"" at the hands of the Koreans. Nevertheless, 007 doesn't shuffle off this experience quite so easily. He is definitely damaged goods when he returns for active duty. Meantime, one of M's former operatives from her tenure as the head of Hong Kong bureau has gotten his hands on the hard-drive. This peroxide blonde madman, Silva (Javier Bardem of ""No Country for Old Men""), emerges M's worst nightmare. Silva is as deadly as he is deranged. He plans to release the names of these embedded agents if MI6 cannot thwart him. Silva has an ax to grind with M because she sacrificed him to the other side in exchange for six agents. Silva shares with her how the lethal cyanide capsule didn't kill him. Meanwhile, M has to contend with an unhappy Prime Minister, Clair Dowar (Helen McCrory of ""Hugo"") who questions the necessity of British Intelligence in the wake of this debacle. This is about the time that Silva and his gun-wielding henchmen burst in with guns blazing!<br/><br/>""Skyfall"" completes the reboot begun with ""Casino Royale."" Not only does this movie bring back M's secretary Miss Moneypenny, but it also recalls Q (Ben Whishaw of ""Cloud Atlas""), the quartermaster who dispenses Bond's gadgets. Unlike the classic 007 capers where our hero could count on a clever gadget to bail him out of any tight spot, ""Skyfall"" provides Bond with a radio transmitter to keep track of him and a pistol designed so only he can fire it. The Scotland scene is looks like something out ""Home Alone,"" but ""Skyfall"" gives a good send-off to James Bond's Aston Martin from the Sean Connery years. Oscar winner actor Javier Bardem is fiendish as the arch-villain. Sadly, he goes out with a whimper instead of a bang. Although it is dramatically intensive, ""Skyfall"" cannot compete with the best Roger Moore 007 outing, but looks more like a Bond caper after ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace."""
"djperry7200","8","1","11","9 November 2012"," One of the most balanced Bond films in years.
","Skyfall was conceptually the greatest Bond film ever made. Let me explain.<br/><br/>Every idea for the film's development into classic Bond was perfect. We were given Q, with a more realistic and modern incarnation of Q Labs. There were many complaints about the lack of gadgets, and the writers clearly knew this would be the case, so they give is clever throwbacks like the ejector's seat in the old Aston Martin and Q's quip about the exploding pen. I have a feeling we'll be seeing many more clever AND realistic gadgets in the future of the franchise with Wishaw's fantastic portrayal of the Quartermaster himself. We were given an amazing actor, Ralph Fiennes, to replace the always brilliant Judi Dench as M. A tearful moment for fans of her perfect portrayal of the character. We were given an Oscar-worthy performance by Bardem as Silva. Bardem was given, arguably, the most difficult character to play in any Bond film to date. Silva is an absolute mess of psychological instability, and Bardem's ability to slip between crazy, depressed, vengeful, betrayed, and apathy was a masterful piece of acting. His monologue was, bar none, the greatest villain monologue in any Bond film as of the present. And we're given Moneypenny. A good performance by Harris, and a fantastic relationship development between Bond and Moneypenny. She ""kills"" Bond, for God's sake, and the witty innuendo-ridden banter begins.<br/><br/>To address the comparisons to the Batman franchise:<br/><br/>Yes. It is true. It's difficult not to notice some of the influence from The Dark Knight. Silva gets captured, but it was all part of his plan. There is tension about the death of Bond's parents. And Silva's character seems to have gone to the side of ""do whatever I want to do, chaos is profoundly revealing."" This is very much a Joker-esque type of mentality. I do not believe, however, as some quacks have seemed to try to note, that Q is some kind of ""Robin"" character. There is absolutely no evidence, other than his youth, that this is the case or was the intention.<br/><br/>To address the flow/story arc:<br/><br/>Admittedly, the first half-hour seems to move very quickly, and we're never entirely aware of how Bond managed to come back from getting shot in the shoulder, falling headlong into a river, sinking, flowing down the river and plummeting off of a waterfall, and being pulled out by an unidentified pair of hands during the musical segment at the beginning of the film. It's not terribly difficult to imagine that he was pulled out and aided, so much as his survival of the amount of violent, jarring tumbling around that his body had taken in the process. But hey, it's Bond, right? So it does seem to jump from point to point a bit too quickly at the beginning.<br/><br/>The plot was a bit more simplified from previous Craig films, especially the mind-bending acrobatics that was the plot of Quantum of Solace. Basically, MI6 loses the hard drive containing the location of every 00 agent embedded into terrorist organizations around the world, Bond gets shot accidentally, presumed dead, isn't dead. Silva attacks MI6 out of vengeance because M left him to be tortured in a foreign country after he was made. Bond finds out it's Silva, makes chase. Everything is part of Silva's plan, so Bond leaves the realm of Silva's planning by taking M to his childhood home. Silva makes chase, climactic scene at the house Bond grew up in, bad guys die, M escapes house and goes to nearby sanctuary. Silva makes chase, Bond makes chase, climactic scene in the church, MI6 is re-established with a new M, a new Moneypenny, and Q Labs. Bond is back and ready for classic Bond.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>A fitting film in the franchise, massively enjoyable even at it's length, and a clear step in the right direction."

","Enough to recommend but after fifty years it could have been better. Great opening sequence but how did Bond survive? Don't ask? <br/><br/>What made the best Bond movies great were interesting antagonists. Here we get a blonde Javier Bardem complete with gay overtones. His performance and look was often distracting.<br/><br/>Plenty of action, lots of shooting and explosions. Bond runs a lot, through streets, over the ice, through the office. Run James run. It has the locations, the music, and a few bond girls to keep your attention.<br/><br/>In addition to the action there are some poignant moments and some back story that was never included in other Bond films. Even the title is new information.<br/><br/>Deliveries what you expect from a Bond film including the welcome assurance that James Bond will return to the big screen in the near future.<br/><br/>It's a tad long but it's the best of the Daniel Craig efforts."

","""We are not now that strength which in old days Moved heaven and earth; that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."" Alfred Lord Tennyson, spoken by M (Judi Dench)<br/><br/>The 50th anniversary 23rd James Bond thriller, Skyfall, is a superior combination of nostalgia for the old-school spy story and the smarmy, glamorous new, the seasoned Bond and the young, techno-oriented operatives. The ancient reliance on intuition and human footwork and technology like the Aston Martin Db5 has been challenged by computer technology that can crash a train or blow up a building with far less manpower and combat than in previous iterations. <br/><br/>Bond (Daniel Craig) resurrects himself after being presumed dead in Istanbul from the traditional preamble (as good as the best Bond opener ever) to help M (Judi Dench) find the maniac who has commandeered the computers of M16 and threatens to reveal the identities of the agencies deeply-covered spies. Amid all this chaos, the typical Bond madman, Silva (Javier Bardem—remember him as the heavy in No Country for Old Men?), has a reason from the past to seek revenge on M. Bardem's play of menace and self parody is so refined as to make you forget the impressive Gert Frobe as Goldfinger. Adele's modern theme song is delightfully evocative of sultry Shirley Bassey tunes. The old and the new work for the enduring franchise.<br/><br/>So begins the link to the past that culminates in a climactic standoff scene in a remote region of Scotland, where Bond may find real spiritual comfort while neglecting his trademark womanizing.<br/><br/>The requisite chase scene at the beginning of the film is splendid to behold with motorcycles racing over roof tops and trains, and through outdoor markets. Roger Deakins' cinematography is a kaleidoscopic buffet, be it the cool blue of Shanghai or the grey of Scotland.<br/><br/>As always the really interesting drama is Bond and M and Bond and Silva exchanging barbs. Fine actors all and a delight to hear.<br/><br/>The rest of the film plays off the conflict between the old and new, culminating in fire war between shotguns and helicopters in an abandoned estate in Scotland. Also Q (Ben Whishaw) is new, a young whippersnapper who needs to be taught the value of the old school, and he is taught that in the course of the action. The new Bond played by Daniel Craig is a more business-like operative than Sean Connery's, more Jason Bourne, brooding and crying, less dashing, not as interested in seduction,but he is more efficient and caring.<br/><br/>It's all fitting for a new age when technology and humanity collide. So far the humans are winning but with casualties."
"mrmacman-54744","2","1","12","10 August 2019"," Every movie gets more PC
","I've noticed over the last few Bond movies they're getting more and more PC, emasculating Bond and putting in more roles for females, especially with the black Moneypenny. Of course this is all leading up to the elimination of the traditional James Bond being a British/UK male. Well, to hell with tradition, let's just destroy the whole bloody series. That's what they are trying to do, and it looks like they're succeeding."

","James Bond (Daniel Craig) is back and the organization he works for is under full attack. The head of it M (Judi Dench) is asked to step down. Bond tries to help her regain her job and go after villain Silva (Javier Bardem) who is targeting the agency and revealing the identities of double agents.<br/><br/>This has gotten very mixed reviews and it's easy to see why. The plot is kind of vague to put it mildly. I (at first) thought Craig was wrong for the role but I do have to admit he's very good here. Dench is good also as M, there's Naomi Harris as Eve Moneypenny (a new character) and it's always good to see Ralph Fiennes in anything. There is plenty of action and this movie is back to the incredible old stunts of the original Bond films (after the overly serious ""Carino Royale"" and ""Quantum..."") and a title song sing by Adele. All in all it was well-done...but I really didn't like it. There are CONSTANT references to Bond and M as being too old for their jobs. Is this how we're supposed to celebrate Bond's 50th anniversary? There are plot loopholes galore--I still can't figure out how Silva knew where Bond was at the end. At the end the plot completely derails and it turns into ""Wuthering Heights""--with plenty of action and explosions:) Even worse is Bardem as Silva. He is a very good actor but he's all over the place in this role. He seems unsure of what exactly he's doing and (for some reason) almost sexually seduces Bond at one point. The movie is far too long also. So--an OK addition--nothing more."

","Bond is back baby!<br/><br/>This film is awesome... I was so surprised at how good it is.<br/><br/>I do like Casino Royale and even Quantum of Solace, but to me they didn't feel like Bond movies. There was something missing from them... but as action films, they were awesome. But, Skyfall brings it right back. This is a Bond film! It has it all... I never saw Daniel Craig as James Bond before, but this film has finally, in my opinion, changed that... he is now James Bond.<br/><br/>The beginning action sequence was amazing... I really liked the chase at the beginning of Casino Royale, but this blew it away... what a great opening to a movie.<br/><br/>Skyfall has a really good story to go along with the action. I honestly am struggling to find a fault with this film. It has some parts in the film that give a wink to some of the classic Bond movies, which I thought were clever and a lot of fun. Plus it was so good to hear the original Bond theme tune again.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem plays Raoul Silva, the main bad guy in the movie... and he does a really good job... Another classic Bond villain.<br/><br/>The only thing I can think of to criticise this film is, it is a long movie, and it felt long. It is on for nearly 2 and a half hours! I was in the cinema and towards the end I was really uncomfortable and fidgeting, I couldn't feel my butt anymore and wanted to stand up. But even though it is a long movie, you don't get bored... It was entertaining from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I know all Bond films are unrealistic, but there were a couple of moments in this one that I felt were a little too unrealistic. They really stuck out. But again, it didn't spoil the enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>I will give this film 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>Excellent film, and if you like the classic James Bond films and have not seen Skyfall yet... go and see it!<br/><br/>For more reviews, check out my Facebook page:<br/><br/>http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"3xHCCH","7","1","12","13 November 2012"," Simple Revenge Plot Improved by Cinematography and Acting
","""Casino Royale"" established a new kind of James Bond in Daniel Craig and his gruff and rough portrayal of the usual suave and cool Bond. ""Skyfall"" continues to mine this new James Bond persona, as we actually see a James Bond emotional enough to shed tears. I am getting ahead of myself.<br/><br/>The title ""Skyfall"" refers to the old Bond estate in the Scottish highlands where James' parents Andrew and Monique Bond were buried. This estate was the site where the climactic booby trap and shotgun battle between Bond and the bad guys took place.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie started from a stolen list of MI6 agents which devolved into a story of revenge of Silva (Javier Bardem in another crazy eccentric character reminiscent of his ""No Country for Old Men"" performance), also a former MI6 agent, who wants to kill M (Judi Dench) for betraying him. Ever loyal Bond, of course, does all he can to save his boss, despite being betrayed himself.<br/><br/>Despite the very basic plot, the good thing about this Bond movie is the breathtaking cinematography by Roger Deakins. I echo other critics in finding this probably the best shot of all the James Bond films. Having Oscar winning director Sam Mendes at the helm, the dramatic trajectory of the story is built up perfectly. As the 50th anniversary presentation of this spy franchise, homages to Bond lore abound throughout the film, from the classic theme song to the classic Aston Martin.<br/><br/>I felt the simple revenge story line was stretched too long for comfort maybe by an hour. The entire Macau scenes, including the Komodo dragons and Bond girl Severine, could all have been excised without really affecting the basic story. However, the amazing cinematography highlighting the best of the exotic locales, the editing of the fantastic action sequences involving trains and the evocative dramatic performances of Daniel Craig and Judi Dench make this still a compelling Bond movie overall. That said, I still say Craig's Bond is NOT the Bond we knew 50 years ago."

","The cold war came and went, technology has undergone a sea change and the very definition of entertainment has changed, but here is an interesting data point- the Ipad 3 survived 6 months, James Bond 007 on the other hand has managed 600 months. And with @Skyfall, it seems he is good for 600 more as the movie is smart, savvy and surprisingly believable- good enough to restore life back into the franchise after the shameful Quantum of Solace.<br/><br/>Who is James Bond? What do we know of him besides that that he is the occasional kiss kiss and the more frequent bang bang assassin working for the government? It has taken 50 years, 23 movies and an incredibly sharp director in Sam Mendes to delve into Bond's back-story, his origins, conjure up enough slam bam action in exotic locations and tie it in with a plot that is eerily realistic in today's world, cyber- terrorism. Skyfall does a dangerous tightrope act just right- on one hand it has enough campiness, cheesy one-liners, gadgets, car chases, femme fatales to keep old fans happy, and enough gritty action, intensity and a foreboding sense of mortality with a continued dose of bullheadedness that is the signature of Daniel Craig's Bond to keep the new fans satiated. Skyfall additionally boasts of some out of the world cinematography by Roger Deakins, sports one of the most mentally unhinged villains of the franchise in Javier Bardem's Raoul Silva, and like Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, is about endings as well as new beginnings.<br/><br/>More of a personal battle this time round for Bond as an ex MI6 operative turned dangerous cyber terrorist Silva trains his guns on the only woman Bond has in his life and is really attached to- Judi Dench's M. In a brilliantly shot opening chase sequence involving super motards, Land Rover Defenders, Turkish rooftops and trains, Bond is shot by his own team and left for dead. Bond and Silva have similar backgrounds and similar mommy issues- but the latter when put in a similar situation takes it out on his ex-employers while Bond understands the rationale behind M allowing him to be sacrificed, and rallies to defend her against all odds. This is Craig's most effective outing since his chart busting debut in Casino Royale 6 years back. With due respect to Bonds of yore, wisecracking is certainly not up his alley, but as an action star and an incredibly buff Bond, he has no parallels. Judi Dench signs out in motherly style, and Ben Wishaw as the new Q is excellent- he in many ways is the pajamas wearing equivalent of Craig- brash and prone to making mistakes, yet brilliant and geeky. Ralph Fiennes is classy in a small role in Skyfall but lots of promise in future movies (wink wink). The ladies Naomi Harris and Bernice Marlohe remain serviceable eye candy, but its always a good thing for a movie when the villain is exceptional. Javier Bardem channelizes his own deadpan terror Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men, along with a bit of Heath Ledger's crazy cool sociopath Joker for a scene-stealing act as the suicidal Raoul Silva who literally loves M to death.<br/><br/>What further sets Skyfall apart from the usual Bond movies is the third act, shot in beautiful, haunting Scotland, and has deep linkages to Bond's past- this part of the movie plays out like a taut thriller, a stakeout, a final stand by one old man and a woman along with our hero against an army adept at using both guns and the system. Speaking of beauty, globe trotting is a given in the franchise, but never has it been so pretty- the neons of Shanghai, the glitter of Macau, the lively walls of Istanbul, even a komodo dragon infested fight-pit are so beautiful that they are distracting- and that IS a compliment. Just note how shadows and light has been used to give a graphic novel feel to the entire production.<br/><br/>Bottomline-Skyfall is just what you expect from a Bond movie- it is not a mindless actioner, nor a slow paced thriller. He gets to drive cool cars, he gets the girls, uses his license to kill and does all that with style. The Walther PPK is there, as there is the Aston DB5 and shaken martini. There is incredible acting talent, mind blowing action, gorgeous photography and an epic soundtrack. In the hands of a true auteur even cheesy can be made beautiful and involving- take a bow, Sam Mendes. There is camp to complement grit, intelligence and sensitivity to complement visual glory. Standing the test of time admirably then you are, Mr. Bond. Eagerly looking forward to your future adventures- 9/10"
"chris_trev53","9","1","13","1 November 2012"," Refreshing yet nostalgic...Bond returns
","A fantastic addition to the Bond franchise, Skyfall combines fresh storytelling and some classic bond moments to create one of the best Bond films to date. <br/><br/>The villain, Silva, will surely become one of Bonds more memorable enemies and the action set pieces themselves are impressive yet somewhat understated compared to previous films. However the star of Skyfall is not Daniel Craig but Judi Dench, who has more to do in this film than in her previous six outings as the British Bulldog that is 'M'. <br/><br/>And it is that word 'British' which really defines this particular film, as much of the story takes place back home, which has often been missing from other films in the franchise. Some may miss the exotic locations but visits to Istanbul and Shanghai in the first hour of the film is enough to satisfy these needs.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very solid bond film with much more character development providing a more mature and rich story. Many have suggested strong Nolan/Dark Knight links which are sound observations, but this is still a Bond film through and through and Bond fans will enjoy the nods to previous films which occur throughout Skyfall. Thoroughly enjoyable."

Sam Mendes hits a renaissance point by perfecting the impossible task of injecting a fresh lease of life into the character without compromising on the vintage element of nostalgia. The newly transformed Bond has skyrocketed Skyfall to an unscalable height of brilliance in the 50th year of the franchise. Thomas Newton's music is the soul of the film, right from the opening credits to the gripping finale. Javier Bardem is compelling as a psychotic avenger with a deliciously cold sinisterness, marveling at the prospects of accommodating controlled chaos and mayhem within his private designs of revenge. Daniel Craig strips Bond of his gaudiness, and looks meaner and sexier with restrained panache and wacky humour. The physicality of 007 is overwhelmed by the psychological moorings and vulnerabilities of the human Bond. Judi Dench, the incumbent faithful, is beautifully centre-pieced as the object of elegiac tribute."

","And the title holds by strong means. This is indeed a view for first day and a must watch. <br/><br/>Visually the movie is a treat in the non-CGI/special effects sense. Right from the beginning till the end the setting(s) is a fine fit. <br/><br/>The story is quite simple straight forward and very decent but most importantly an original plot which was much needed which makes the movie (series) fresh and enjoyable. A personal story combined with power house of action is what makes this great. It is also a standalone film meaning one would understand it without seeing the previous 2 films ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace"" while being a sequel of the new Bond film franchise, making it still a good opportunity for attracting new fans.<br/><br/>The performance by the case is brilliant. The movie continues to have a great villain and great performance by everyone else. Daniel Craig was brilliant as Bond and perhaps the best bond so far in the series 50 years history. Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw were great in their supporting roles. But the most brilliant and a true antagonist to Bond here was Javier Bardem for whom I immensely got respect for his role was immediately comparable to Heath Ledger's Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" <br/><br/>For fans of Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy, the director really meant it when he said Skyfall was inspired by ""The Dark Knight"" and you will understand once you see the film. <br/><br/>At times there bit cheesy lines but nothing that can be considered bad. Finally it serves as a great tribute to 50 years of the Bond movies franchise as it contains bits and references everywhere from the past movies. Bond fans will surely love the easter eggs. <br/><br/>The movie ends on a great game changing scale giving the series a sort of new direction. Sam Mendes changed the traditional Bond formula and has given the best tribute to 50 years of Bond by making the best Bond movie yet.<br/><br/>As I keep reviews minimum to no spoilers that is all you need to know. Once again the best entry in the series and a must watch"
"suzy_go10","9","1","16","31 October 2012"," Skyfall, a stepping stone for the Bond movies to come.
","I watched Skyfall two days ago and decided I wanted to know the rating the movie got on IMDb and read a couple of reviews.<br/><br/>I was disappointed to read a review that compared Skyfall with the latest Batman movies. I am an avid fan of both the Bond series and the Batman one and felt the review did not do Skyfall justice.<br/><br/>The new Skyfall is exponentially different from the original series because times have changed, action movies are more ""explosive"" and the means of achieving great graphics exist. I personally think Skyfall was a PERFECT third movie with Craig as Bond. The first instalment of Bond with Daniel Craig was a movie that displayed a ""rough"" bond, one at the beginning of being moulded into a great agent. This third one shows that he has reached the point of filling in the shoes of such an agent, an agent of our era. You cannot compare it to the old Sean Connery movies because of the time frame.<br/><br/>The best possible moves the directors made was to cast Ralph Finnes and Javier Bardem. Javier is absolutely amazing in his ""bad guy"" role, combining the extreme ""silly"" like qualities in the old villains of the old James Bond movies with the new idea of what evil is, something that has no reason but just takes pleasure in inflicting pain. At the same time the back story between Javier's character, Da Silva, and M is one that explains the motives of the antagonist.<br/><br/>The elements of the old Bond movies inserted in Skyfall are purely amazing and triggered fond memories of the Bond agents that came before Craig. This battle between ""the old"" and ""the new"" was very well thought out and I enjoyed it throughly.<br/><br/>All in all I thought it was a great film. Although the beginning of the movie seemed a bit ""staged"" to me. But after the tragedy that falls on Bond right at the beginning I felt the movie really picked up and did a great job in keeping me in suspense.<br/><br/>When you are an avid movie watcher it does come to the point where you can predict what will happen. If you happen to be like me try to view Skyfall as a stepping stone towards the future of the Bond movies. Let yourself think, ""why yes all the major plot lines were a tad predictable but the acting was top notch, the storyline pretty golden and the action was really amazing"" I really do hope people will like the movie!!!! Cheers everyone"
"ivanpantic82","6","1","17","3 February 2013"," On average, average.
","I'm going lower than the average here. Definitely not the best Bond movie; it's not even that great of a movie in general.<br/><br/>The script was the most problematic part. Many plot points, especially to do with computers, make no sense. The bad guy is a standard movie hacker, who can use his hacking magic to do anything he wants. They go out of their way to portray the UK government as an underdog against this one ""terrorist"" and his mercenaries (of course, the audience sympathies with the underdog, duh). It's ridiculous and makes no sense. They really need the Soviets back (retro/alternate history Bond, anyone?), or at least grow some balls and go after China. These lone terrorist plots are getting stale.<br/><br/>Even if we disregard that as plot convenience, the script still sucks. The whole plot supposedly revolves around some kind of ""NOC list"" (like in Mission Impossible), but this is forgotten halfway through the movie. It is hinted the bad guy is M's son, but not explained. Main contention between the two touched upon, but not fully developed. Bond's titular love interest features for about 20 minutes and is quickly disposed (no emotional reaction even hinted). What should have been the love interest is underdeveloped and ultimately pointless. Instead of her, for the culmination, we are introduced to a whole new character who hasn't even been hinted at and really serves no purpose. Outside of Bond and M, all side-characters are shallow and useless.<br/><br/>Good parts of the movie revolve around Craig as Bond. He's good, no doubt there. The theme of the movie (the old ways VS the new ways) is ambitious enough, if poorly executed. Action scenes are OK within their PG-13 confines.<br/><br/>Really, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this movie, if we take it as a simple action blockbuster. I guess it kept me engaged enough in its dumb inept way. Craig and the overall theme maybe pushes it a point further, but no more. Critics' accolades are totally undeserved in this case."

"waterink","9","1","21","4 November 2012"," 'Skyfall' is unique in its own way - part 1
","Back in 2008, shortly after the premiere of 'The Dark Knight', I was both thrilled ánd disappointed. Thrilled, because the movie was playing masterfully with the psyche of moviegoers. Heath Ledger's version of The Joker did do exactly that to me: I was both pleasantly entertained ánd disgusted by The Joker's twisted games. But I was disappointed because I truly believed that this kind of feeling should have been produced by a Bond-villain.<br/><br/>Memorable bad guy It's exactly this element that the last eight Bond films suffered from: A memorable antagonist. True, 'Casino Royale' was an almost perfect Bond film. And Le Chiffre indeed was an Ian Fleming antagonist, being both smart and vulnerable. But within the cinematic life of Bond, we keep referring to the Bond villains that were part of Connery's triumphant reign of Bond films. If it is Dr. No or Ernst Blofeld as head of SPECTRE or Fransisco Scaramanga and Emilio Largo with their twisted attitude towards women, I haven't seen such a villain during most recent Bond films.<br/><br/>With Javier Bardem, who portrays cyber terrorist Raoul Silva, the Bond films finally do exactly that what I was hoping for. Perhaps Bond producers, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and director Sam Mendes were inspired by British director Christopher Nolan. If there is a weakness of the recent Bond films, then it's maybe this minor glitch certain Bond-pessimists like to bring about. But with a franchise that is celebrating its 50 year golden jubilee, one should be careful pointing out certain cross-fertilization between movies. Because if there is one franchise that influenced 50 years of blockbuster cinema, than it's certainly Bond. Christopher Nolan got his inspiration from Bond and franchises like Jack Bauer and Jason Bourne surprisingly enough use Bond's initials <br/><br/>Fleming aspects Back to 'Skyfall'. Can this latest Bond thriller stand on its own? Can it entertain us in a Bond-ian, escapist way? And can it also make us think about current day politics? Yes, absolutely. And I dare to say that the late Bond creator, Ian Fleming, would be very happy with this one. Although the Bond producers stressed that this movie is by no means directly based on a Fleming novel, they certainly were heavily inspired by Ian Fleming. <br/><br/>'Skyfall' starts of like a typical good Bond-flick. Bond needs to recover a stolen hard drive containing detailed information about secret agents from NATO-countries. But as this mission goes terribly wrong, Bond needs to go into 'rehab', if he wants to return to Her Majesty's Secret Service. And indeed, Bond gets the full Shrublands-treatment at the new MI6 headquarters, an element we could have read in Ian Fleming's novel 'Thunderball' and which was repeated in the non-EON movie 'Never Say Never Again'.<br/><br/>But it is Bond's childhood that is one of the central focus points of this Bond film. For the ordinary cinema audience this might be a risky move. And risky it is to dig into Bond's past, just as it was risky back in 1969 to let Bond marry a girl in 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. Still, it works for 'Skyfall' and it makes the movie unique within the film franchise. Unique for us, but for Ian Fleming this was really a part of his novel 'You Only Live Twice'. From that novel we know that Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond, of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix, of the Canton de Vaud. And in 'Skyfall' it is Albert Finney's warm portrayal of Kincade that receives Bond at his ancestral home in Scotland.<br/><br/>Espionage in 2012 Besides these obvious links, it is really the overall theme of the movie that works: The rising importance of intelligence services in a post-9/11 modern day society. Judi Dench gets the opportunity in this movie to fully use her character 'M'. During a hearing of the parliamentary committee of intelligence affairs --after Silva's Wikileaks-like scandal exposes MI6-- 'M' explains us why today's secret agents need to fight more difficult forces, forces that do not necessarily belong to a specific country (Perhaps an idea to re-introduce SPECTRE?). Villains that operate in a grey zone, like Raoul Silva is doing, are the real danger for today's society. And trust me, spies are still among us in 2012. Perhaps the Cold War is ended, but recent news about China using cyber spies breaking into US websites from the federal government and the Polonium-scandal in the United Kingdom are just a few examples of why we should take espionage a bit more serious.<br/><br/>Typical Bond Besides the grittier realism that has encompassed Craig's outings as Bond --Craig's films remind me so much more of the early Connery films-- 'Skyfall' is still a worthy escapist, lush, Bond-film. Roger Deakins' breathtaking wide shots of Turkey, Shanghai, Macau, London and especially Scotland makes 'Skyfall' feel like Craig's biggest Bond of all. As mentioned earlier, we see the welcome return of the biggest Bond villain of our lifetime. And 'Skyfall' marks the slow but welcome return of some beloved characters in the Bond universe. Casting the new 'Q' could have resulted in a cheesy Desmond-rip-off. Instead actor Ben Whishaw skilfully revitalizes Q-branch. In an original way, he is bringing back some of the beloved Bond humor and he has some great interaction with agent 007. From a music perspective, Adele enhances the atmosphere with perhaps the best Bond themed song since 'A View To A Kill'. Combined with Kleinman's eerie main titles we're being prepared for a great Bond ride."

","Skyfall isn't really a movie at all, so much as about three or four movies loosely crunched together. On its own, any one of those movies might have been pretty good. Run together as a 'medley,' they make a pretty chaotic and frustrating experience.<br/><br/>There's the missing spy-list, Bond-is-dead thing. There's a really good one-on-one foot chase through downtown London (practically the only locale Bond hasn't previously visited). Plus another chase, with motorcycles on rooftops in Istanbul. There's the spooky abandoned-city sequence (culminating in the most abrupt departure of a significant character I can recall seeing in any Bond movie). And then there's the Straw Dogs finale, with a barely-armed Bond holed up in Scottish hovel.<br/><br/>Oddly, I didn't hate all this. Each of the segments had things in it that were entertaining, surprising, occasionally even clever. They don't add up to much, true enough. But what does *any* Bond movie add up to? Even the best of them consist of loosely strung-together action sequences. <br/><br/>That's not to say Skyfall is a good movie. But it's not without some entertainment value. The action sequences are pretty good. The range of locations is better than usual. The lack of gadgets is refreshing. The title song is good. The new Q is a huge improvement over the last few versions. Javier Bardem is a great over-the-top-villain, even if his character really doesn't make much sense. I also enjoyed seeing Daniel Craig once more as Bond, even though this third film does very little to cash in on his off-beat Bond persona.<br/><br/>Skyfall is not quite the least of the Bond films. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to a casual viewer... But I think Bond completists can find quite a bit in it to enjoy, if they can get over their entirely understandable sense of disappointment."

","This is the best Bond film to date, just about everything about it was excellent, the acting, direction, photography scenery, authentic locations and music, the title song by Adele is pretty good too.<br/><br/>No gadgets except the radio transmitter, return of the Aston Martin DB5, and a Bentley (in the Ian Fleming books he was supposed to have a Bentley) but that is M's car. There are a return of a few Bond themes too, a Casino scene and helicopters, Moneypenny is back, but not the original one, this character is called Eve Moneypenny, although it is not mentioned whether she is a relative of the old Moneypenny, she is played by the excellent Naomie Harris, and Q is back but in a younger form played by Ben Whishaw. Rory Kinnear plays Tanner again and to complete the MI6 crew, Judi Dench plays M again but her last time, she dies at the end, and the role of M is taken by Ralph Fiennes, a cracking actor. Albert Finney does a good cameo as Kincaid and Javier Bardem plays one of the creepiest villains as Silva.<br/><br/>The locations are almost all authentic, Turkey, Istanbul, London, Scotland, Shanghai and the Island, in the film it does not refer to which territory the Island belonged to or did previously, since they sailed from Shanghai to get to it, its implied that it is a Chinese Island, but the one they used was a real Island, with real derelict buildings, but is in Japan, but opposite the East China Sea from Shanghai so would represent accuracy in the film, the only faked locations were Macao and some of the Shanghai scenes, not enough to worry about, they do need to make some stuff in the studio anyway.
Henchmen :- there seemed to be a few, working for Silva, but no one really stood out, maybe the Chinese looking guy that got dragged off by a Komodo Dragon, oh and just in case you wondered about that, Komodo Dragons do eat humans in real life!, they are a bit slow, so easy to avoid but their saliva contains a paralysing agent, so if they bite you or even just get their mouth around any part of you, it will disable you and then the creature will drag you off for its lunch!<br/><br/>Bond Girls :- 3 in this, No.65 is a Turkish beauty in the intro, after he got shot by Moneypenny Bond has not returned and decided to go native in Turkey and she is the one he has been shagging whilst he had been away, played by Tonia Sotiropoulou (Greece), she is the most beautiful in the film. Next is the new Moneypenny, Eve Moneypenny (no.66) played by Naomie Harris, at last a Moneypenny got to shag bond, but not the original, the sex is supposed to have occurred after the shave scene, but he did not know her name at the time, she only reveals that to him at the end. No.67 is Severine played by French actor Berenice Marlohe, who had an odd looking face, she plays a baddie who meets Bond in the casino (where else) scene, and invites him back to her boat, if he survives, obviously he makes it, if Bond can kill all for Queen and Country, he can also do it if a shags in the offering, and he does her in the shower, after they get to the island Silva kills her.<br/><br/>This is supposed to be a standalone film, it does not have much to link it to the last 2 which were a part 1 & 2 in reality, however in the next film, it is revealed that the Quantum organisation in Casino Royale & Quantum of Solace are really part of SPECTRE in that film and Silva also worked for SPECTRE, making this film as a part 3 in the series, and SPECTRE being part 4. But until that was made it looked like it was on its own and all in all an excellent film, not much to complain about, so I won't, 10 out of 10."

","""Skyfall"" is a 2012 action thriller directed by Sam Mendes starring Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem. The Road To Bond 25 and the saga continues with an entry that's an obvious improvement to its dull predecessor. Whatever ""Quantum Of Solace"" tried to be in the first place, this feature learned from it's mistakes and steeped up again in terms of quality and intelligent entertainment. Not only does the title song performed by Adele sound magnificent, the whole concept works out pretty well again. Already the breathtaking train sequence is so much better than all the action of the previous film in total and that's only the beginning of what the film continues to offer. While the ""fake death"" aspect wasn't quite necessary for the film's development and was sorta abandoned in the matter of minutes, it definitely left a mark on the agent with the license to kill. While it has already been one of his most original character traits since they rebooted the franchise, it's even more palpable in this case that he's not immortal and can't take everything. He's not the cold-hearted and emotionless killer with cool one-liners anymore, he's shown more and more that he's vulnerable and on top of it all, a mortal human being. I think that's by far the most interesting character development of the saga. He's literally an unshaved Ikarus who tries to do his jobs that, in most cases, are almost impossible to master and that's what gave the whole story a new kind of thrill to it. In the past, I was always sure that he'd master his mission like it was no big deal, but from there on all of this security is all suddenly put in jeopardy. Furthermore, the film again combines what made the first feature so interesting - a perfect balance between heart racing action and intense thriller. In this case, the story is divided into three acts that basically feel like three different movies in one - and that's all but terrible. With the villain Silva, a mental performance by Javier Bardem, Bond has an antagonist again who really manages to stand his ground against Le Chiffre in terms of roguishness, as he's actually a threat as a former agent who knows the MI6 and all of its secrets oh too well. Also, not only does it finally flesh out Bond's employer M even more and gives her a special spotlight, it also finally introduces a few of the classic allies, such as Q and Eve Moneypenny. On top of it all, Mendes has hands down the best cinematographer on his side, Roger Deakins, and as I expected it from the luminary of cinematography, he captured the intensity of the film with some outstanding frames and an extreme amount of iconic eye candy moments. Additionally, I have to praise the stunt choreographies that literally gave everything to keep us on the edge of our seats. Learning that Craig did most of his stunts on his own deserves my deepest respect. Oh, and that final is also a masterful contribution of drama that once again has shown the emotional range of Daniel Craig. All in all, this film is more than solace for the debacle it's predecessor has been and again offers so much quality, in both action and thriller elements and creates such an ingenious and packing plot that hasn't bored me in the whole run time of almost two and half hours. It's almost perfect, like the first outing, and shows that you don't need mindless explosions to create an action/thriller hybrid. It's gritty, intelligent, ingeniously conceptualised and most importantly, unusually dark, as it shows the mortality and vulnerability of it's hero like never before. This is Bond at his best and although I can't really expect it, I deeply hope that the successor will at least be enjoyable. Til then, I'm gonna admire this piece of art."

"davidmvining","10","0","3","10 March 2020"," An expert desconstruction of the formula
","I hadn't seen Quantum of Solace since it was in theaters, and so I was actually rather shocked to discover that Skyfall is almost a reboot of the Craig Bond films. It feels like a least a decade has passed, maybe even two, since the last film. That Bond has gone from a new 00 agent on his first pair of missions in his early 30s to a well-worn veteran in his forties and maybe even early fifties. It almost feels like between Quantum and Skyfall, Bond went off and did all of the adventures we saw in the twenty films previously, giving him the grizzled look of a man who's been doing this spy thing for far too long. It's a bit subtle, but it's necessary based on the theme of the film.<br/><br/>The film is chock full of ideas on history and the past, especially as it relates to our sins and the sins of our parents. In a way, Skyfall is actually more M's story than Bond's. The villain, Silva, is concerned with M's treatment of him years back, and Bond is really just the tool that M uses to try and prevent that meeting. That doesn't mean that Bond has nothing to do, he does, it's just that the focus is very much on M, her sins, and her relationship to Silva. Where Bond comes in is as a parallel (or, as the opening credits shows, Silva is Bond's shadow) and brother to Silva with M as their mother.<br/><br/>You see, James Bond is old. He's a physical wreck and the opening sequence that sees him shot from the top of a moving train and falling into water hundreds of feet below made him lose a step. I mean, that would kill anyone else, but this is James Bond we're talking about. He has to deal with the fact that he left a fellow agent to die in the opening moments of the film, at the orders of M, in a chase that ultimately failed. M failed him, the agent, and Silva. He has every reason to be angry with M in the same way that Silva is, but he's not. He's not going to go rogue, he's going to go back to MI6 when England needs him. He'll be grumpy about it, but he's there because it's his duty. M is essentially his mother, and the British Secret Service is essentially his family.<br/><br/>Silva, though, takes his own betrayal much harder. Disfigured from the cyanide capsule he took upon being captured and tortured, he holds a preternatural obsession regarding M and his need to destroy her. Everything he's built, including an implied criminal organization, a base on an abandoned industrial island, and a reputation was built for the purpose of getting to M. He's also that kind of movie brilliant where he can devise a plan of such intricacy involving so many moving parts that will get him from MI6's secret alternate hideout (which he would know about being a former agent) through the tube system to where M is giving testimony to members of Parliament.<br/><br/>Bond's mission starts when Silva blows up MI6 and he comes back from hiding to report to M and receive orders in service of England. He needs to track down Silva and bring him in. What follows is a recognizable Bond globe-trotting adventure, but everything gets turned upside down. Instead of going further from home base, Bond ends up having to retreat all the way back to his ancestral home in Scotland. There is an attractive young woman, a henchwoman of Silva, who meets a typical henchwoman Bond girl end and dies, but the central Bond girl is actually M. The intricately built final lair doesn't belong to the antagonist, but to Bond himself. It's an inversion of the typical Bond adventure, and it's about Bond retreating into his past to find a way to fight for his future.<br/><br/>Bond pulls the original Aston Martin from Goldfinger out of MI6's storage. He rigs the house with explosives and traps while starting the fight with a pair of double barrel shotguns in the face of helicopters and automatic weapons. He's the sinewy muscle of the past up against the less physical and more brainy manifestation of one version of the future in Silva. Even Q only gives Bond a small radio transmitter and a gun. The year of the exploding pen is behind them, it's up to Bond to get out of his situations on his own.<br/><br/>The resolution of the plot that pits Silva against Bond with M as the target is probably the best a Bond movie has ever looked. The movie looks great from beginning to end, but the use of color and shadow by Roger Deakins is fantastic. I know it's kind of trendy to heap praise on Deakins, but the man deserves it. He can bring out color and contrast it with shadow like no one else. The confrontation between all three at the end is the resolution of the theme running through the film of how to deal with the sins of the past. Silva represents endless vengeance against the past while Bond represents moving on. There's nothing Bond can do about the sins M visited down upon him, so he has chosen to make the best of it by doing his duty. Silva couldn't accept that and Bond makes him pay.<br/><br/>This movie is really smart, inverting so many of the Bond conventions on their heads while providing some of the most beautiful looking action the franchise has ever seen. Acting is top notch all around with a special mention to Javier Bardem who plays Silva really well. Mendes came to this project as an obvious fan of the franchise, and he applied every narrative and cinematic trick he had learned in his time as a filmmaker to the series he loved, making one of the best entries in the entire franchise."
"Offworld_Colony","9","0","3","7 February 2020"," A brisk, broad, stuffed, slightly clever, sometimes stupid, post-Dark Knight psychological action thriller.
","Its brutal editing blasts through scenes, each one fun in a new and different way. There are some lovely, series-high dialogue scenes and some series-high creativity and set-pieces.<br/><br/>I'm troubled by some things; Thomas Newman does a good job but I miss David Arnold as his music was unnoticeable and scene-perfect, and Naomie Harris is insufferably bad; miscast likely in a blockbuster due to how excellent she usually is, but conversely, an en vogue Javiar Bardem chews the heck out of the scenery.<br/><br/>Lots of stupid stuff happens, plenty of holes and contrivances, but it's a heck of a lot of fun, a sort of reboot/rehash, retro-throwback and modernising update all at the same time, not as elegantly classic as Casino, and may age worse due to being influenced by the big films of the time, but it reinvented the franchise once again in Craig's tenure and the accomplishments of the film (action, cinematography, costume design, character arcs, introduction of series staples such as Q, etc.) far outweigh the flaws (like some of the jokes really not landing, and some tenuous leaps of faith and boring subplots).
Skyfall tries hard, sometimes too hard, but at the end of the day you notice, after seeing it countless times, moments like the sound of the glass cutter pitching up and down to match the music in the jellyfish scene, and you remember that it really is a film of quality.<br/><br/>I really think Daniel Craig, recognising that Bond spends a large percentage of his films in action, plays each iteration of Bond in the action sequences according to the kind of Bond he is supposed to be in the film. Casino saw him a smirking smug rookie, Quantum a dead-hearted laser focused grief stricken man and in Skyfall he's a grumpy, tired, ageing man whose mystique is slowly being destroyed. One imagines to an extent Craig sympathises with this Bond most. Not unlike Spectre where Bond is a burnt out, bored, uninspired husk.<br/><br/>The fit for work montage culminating in the word association is the first great sequence of the movie. I won't wax lyrical too much about this technical masterpiece of blockbuster filmmaking, suffice to say that for all it's flaws, the film builds its ancient franchise mythology sensitively and adds new breath to the franchise already pretty high off of Casino Royale. Bond had a beard, Ben Wishaw is a cracking addition and the focus on closing M's arc is a clever left field one.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is predictably joker-like and he ties well in to the central drama between Bond and M. But the real stars of the film are the locales and sets, gorgeously photographed by master Deakins and the action, the art house action, built and shot by someone trying to create the best sequences available.<br/><br/>It's long and stuffed and cheesy in places. But so was Casino. It excels in mood and manages to produce a balanced, broad, arty action blockbuster with flourishes of tender moments, tight dialogue and all the bravado and fistpumping beats an audience could desire."
"Magow-Intermean","10","0","3","24 March 2019"," Skyfall Review
","A hard-drive which lists all NATO operatives undercover in terrorist organisations is stolen, and used to make M - the head of British Intelligence - look bad. Though not in peak condition after a near-death experience, secret agent James Bond sets out to recover the drive, which leads him to mystery man Silva, who has a revenge scheme in mind.
The consensus on Daniel Craig's tenure as James Bond so far is that he started out impressively in Casino Royale but wavered in Quantum of Solace. Here, in a Bond specifically tailored for the 50th anniversary of the series, the dangling plot-threads of Casino and Quantum are left in the wind as a more experienced, more damaged hero deals with a villain from his boss's past. Having rebooted the franchise by depicting Bond's first days with a license to kill in Casino Royale, this picks him up later in his career - as if he's lived through all the films from Dr No to Die Another Day since we last saw him.<br/><br/>The pre-credits sequence, which coincidentally chases through a Turkish bazaar seen this year in Taken 2 and Argo, establishes that Sam Mendes - brought in to raise the tone a bit - can handle a fist-fight on top of a train as well as anyone. The boldest hire for this go-round is cinematographer Roger Deakins, who delivers the most impressive visuals this series has had since the 1960s. No one will ever mistake Skyfall for an introspective picture, though Bond's rarely-mentioned dead parents get trotted out in a Christopher Nolanesque way which aligns him with all other orphan heroes and superheroes of current cinema.<br/><br/>The challenge of delivering a series entry is to present the mandatory elements - the credits sequence, the girls, the cars, the locations, the stunts, the villains, the novelty pets, the gadgets - in fresh, surprising ways. Regular screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, augmented by John Logan, skate over their mcguffin with some computerspeak and politicking, then hit all the required notes - with sidebar-friendly anniversary nods to practically every previous Bond film, including the David Niven Casino Royale - while telling a story that doesn't strictly adhere to the umpteenth-remake-of-Dr-No format that wore thin during the Roger Moore-Pierce Brosnan eras. Among other innovations, this is the first Bond really to make use of spectacular British locations, in and out of London, as a plot hatched in exotic places comes home to burn down the Establishment.<br/><br/>Craig takes a fall into a surreal, macabre credits sequence accompanied by that Adele song, then spends a reel or so as an unshaven, washed-up wreck who can't shoot straight and shows signs of psychological trauma. It's a character stretch Craig manages better than Brosnan's bout with beardiness in Die Another Day, mostly because he gets his chops back - and his chops shaven, in a sexy sequence with fellow agent Eve (Naomie Harris) - with credible effort. It's a reading of the role that comes from the later Ian Fleming novels, the ones that had their titles used on films which otherwise threw away the material, and much of Skyfall feels like the kind of post-John Buchan/Bulldog Drummond thrillers Fleming wrote rather than the fantastical, science fictionish films which grew out of them.<br/><br/>Harris's peppy MI6 sniper and Berenice Marlohe's slinky woman of mystery have a few good scenes, but the main Bond girl here is Judi Dench - whose M is harried by bureaucrats and politicians who want her to retire, but has to stay in office to cope with her own nightmare legacy. Javier Bardem's villain makes a grand entrance, walking from the back of the frame to the foreground while delivering a parable about rats in a barrel, then gets deeper under the hero's skin than any official shrink, prodding him into reflections about his drink and pill dependency and sexual identity which would have made Sean Connery blench. Silva is a Flemingesque creation - a loathesome foreigner with a hidden (and gruesome) deformity - but Bardem adds in a little Hannibal Lecter vibe (especially in a sequence set under London) and even becomes a horror movie slasher for a surprisingly gothic, down-and-dirty climax.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes plays it ambiguously as M's political rival, but gets some good scenes late in the day, and there's a sharp reinvention of the role of Q from Ben Whishaw, who is now the spooks' computer whizz (with a nice line in jargon) as well as quartermaster. And Albert Finney brings warmth and gravitas to a key role in the home stretch.<br/><br/>Skyfall is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately. One thing's certain: James Bond will return..."
"anselmdaniel","9","0","3","9 March 2019"," A beautifully directed Bond
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Skyfall is a spy movie directed by Sam Mendes. The movie premiered in 2012 and is based on James Bond by Ian Fleming. The movie's screenplay is written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan. The movie stars Daniel Craig as James Bond. James Bond must deal with a threat to MI6 from a former MI6 agent.<br/><br/>Like the previous Daniel Craig James Bond movies, Skyfall is a movie that is trying to merge the older Bond movies into a modern spy movie. The plot centers around cyber terrorism, and the old spy methods being rendered irrelevant. The plot of this James Bond movie does stand out from the rest and it makes for a surprisingly unique experience. James Bond movies are criticized for always being the same. In this movie the plot is more relevant and it does cause the movie to feel more tense. The writing in this movie is one of the best parts of this movie and it is exemplified in the villain.<br/><br/>Raoul Silva, played by Javier Bardem, is the villain in Skyfall. Raoul Silva is one of the most memorable villains in a James Bond movie. The movie can feel like it is contriving his cyber terrorism abilities, but it does make up for this by actually providing believable motivation for the villain's actions. Raoul Silva is motivated by his betrayal and disfigurement that was inadvertently caused by M. This is a far cry to the from the over the top villains in many previous James Bond movies. The motivation is not a ridiculous wish to dominate the world through a clandestine organization. The motivation is instead purely on revenge. Javier Bardem does a great job in the role. Javier Bardem is able to show a full range of emotions that Raoul Silva experiences. He also still has that smug attitude of superiority when dealing with James Bond. Raoul Silva had control of much of the movie and it was a joy to watch him on the screen. The chemistry that Raoul and James Bond had made the movie exciting.<br/><br/>The directing by Sam Mendes and cinematography by Roger Deakins is impressive. This is an incredibly beautiful movie. This may be one of the most impressively shot and staged James Bond movies ever. There are so many great set-pieces such as a sequence in Shanghai and Macau. These set-pieces only get better with time and the ending in the Scottish highlands without any notable landmarks is still incredibly memorable in its presentation. I absolutely enjoyed all aspects of the production and it made a James Bond movie better on multiple viewings.<br/><br/>James Bond has an excellent movie in its franchise in Skyfall This is an excellent movie for both fans of James Bond and new viewers to James Bond. I highly recommend Skyfall.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","A Bond film for the modern era. This film was highly entertaining and had magnificent set pieces like the ""Home Alone""-esqe scene, opening scene and the chase scene in the London Underground. The opening scene was fast paced and intense with an awesome set piece of an Istanbul street, roof and train scene, escalating in danger throughout. It starts of tame as a simple car chase to a rooftop motorcycle chase and finally a fist fight on top of a moving train. This shows the audience what they are in for in this film. The London Underground scene is exciting and anticipating as the audience would be guessing where Silva is and how close Bond is. The ""Home Alone""-esqe scene would be nostalgic to those who had watched the films and this was the director's (Sam Mendes) way of paying tribute to this timeless classic.<br/><br/>Where Skyfall comes on leaps and bounds from its predecessors is in its gay politics. Scriptwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan are very daring in explicitly highlighting the sexual tension between Bond and his villain, Silva, played in a magnificently camp manner by Javier Bardem. The relationship is particularly unnerving and naughty, given Silva's repeated reference to the two of them as brothers to ""mother"" M, who he, naturally, wants to kill. This shows how Hollywood is maturing more as it is allowing for more sensitive issues to be raised whist still delivering high quality films. Bond's ""What makes you think this is my first time?"" leaves a lot of unanswered questions as we don't see all of Bond's escapades.<br/><br/>Various composers have placed their hat in the ring to try and surpass one another whilst including the iconic brass notes to signify the Bond theme. Skyfall is an excellent example of this as it starts as a minor chord which surprisingly transforms into the iconic theme. Instead of being a simple piece of music, this song turns into a collaborating element of the film and is treated as someone playing one last twist to a complex story, and is integrated to feel like a character.<br/><br/>A beautiful moment within Skyfall is where Bond is being carried by the river and it transitions from falling over a waterfall to the title card with Adele's 'Skyfall' theme playing over whilst Bond is sinking. This is especially beautiful as all you can see is Bond sinking which shows vulnerability and shows of gorgeous cinematography. This is also revisited after Silva's henchmen have blown up Bond's childhood home, which is also a magnificent spectacle in itself, and Bond is dragged down into the icy river by one of Silva's henchmen. This however, has Bond rising up to the occasion as he literally rises out of the river instead of sinking in defeat in the first scene. This shows how his character has evolved throughout the film and his arc has finished, for this film.<br/><br/>Once again Daniel Craig has proved why he is the best Bond for the modern era with an expertly crafted performance, in an already immersing spectacle of film. He is able to show both on and off mission Bond which are vastly different. On mission Bond is focused and hides emotions and ends up always getting the job done, eventually. Off mission Bond however mopes and is depressing. He is also a borderline alcoholic which could convey that what he does affects him so he drinks to cope with the pain. Javier Bardem was another stand out character in Skyfall as he was able to be a likeable villain, like Heath Ledger's Joker or Tom Hiddleston's Loki, and still be justified with his actions (like Syndrome from The Incredibles who was also shunned by his idol). This creates a unique feel for the villain as people are able to see that his motives aren't just the typical world domination, they're somewhat justifiable to the audience.<br/><br/>Overall Skyfall was an almost perfect film which deserves all the praise it has and will receive. This was not a disappointment as it was expertly crafted from the outstanding cast, to the director, writers and producers who worked on this film and they should feel proud of the achievements that this film has generated."

"classicsoncall","8","0","1","10 January 2019"," ""Some men are coming to kill us. But we're going to kill them first.""
","You know, I have to laugh. In the opening action sequence, James Bond (Daniel Craig) runs a motorcycle into a waist high abutment in order to catapult the bike away, and him onto the top of a moving train in order to get at the bad guy. He's shot by his partner, falls over a hundred feet into a river, and then goes over a waterfall. Given up for dead, you know as the viewer he's going to pop up again somehow, and when he does, he's shown panting for breath after doing some laps in a swimming pool! How does that make any kind of sense? I guess we aren't supposed to think about it.<br/><br/>But the thing is, if you put all the James Bond films into a list here on IMDb, then rank them in order of viewer ratings, it's ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"" that occupy the top two positions. I think that's more a reflection of the audience's need and desire for large scale action set pieces and impossible stunts than for the actor portraying Bond, although you do have to give Daniel Craig credit where credit's due. He's taken the character to a much darker place without an array of goofy gadgets, even if I question the manner in which he was able to smoke out 'Granborough Road' out of an impossible series of encrypted graphics. To my mind, it would help if Craig would crack a smile every now and then to show that he's human; I can't imagine anyone being so serious for any length of time without the need for some kind of emotional release.<br/><br/>However Bond does go in the opposite direction even more when at the finale, M (Judi Dench) dies, and Bond cries! That's something I thought I'd never see, and perhaps confirmation that Double 0-7 does have a reservoir of emotion somewhere inside. With the franchise getting ready to release another picture in 2020, It will be interesting to see how Daniel Craig performs in ""Bond 25"", almost a full decade after his character couldn't pass the MI6 physical or qualify on the shooting range."

"lucasversantvoort","7","0","3","6 May 2015"," A bold new step in the Bond franchise
","""Were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go in for that anymore."" —Q<br/><br/>Probably the most anticipated Bond-film ever, Skyfall opened to break all kinds of box office records, including passing both Titanic and Avatar at the U.K. box office (which can only be a good thing). It was also the first one to be directed by a Hollywood big shot: Sam Mendes, best known for American Beauty. This was highly unusual as Bond films were always shot by lesser-known directors. Combine this with the inclusions of DP Roger Deakins and composer Thomas Newman, the shift in tone in the more recent Bond films and the long production time and you can see how this film got everyone psyched. For meit was definitely a great movie-going experience, though I'm hesitant to call it a Bond experience<br/><br/>Bond (Daniel Craig) is shot during the mission in the opening scenes and, though MI6 thinks he's dead, recovers on some tropical island in typical Bond fashion: drinks and women. Meanwhile, MI6 is attacked. A bomb goes off in MI6 headquarters, seemingly to harm M (Judi Dench). Bond finds out and returns to MI6, but before he can head back into the field, he needs to recover his previous strength and skill at gunplay.<br/><br/>I like how typical Bond-elements are ridiculed. Many Bond-films from the past were so predictable and sometimes downright silly in their adherence to what a 'Bond movie' is 'supposed to be' that they degraded the entire franchise. Skyfall, however, firmly establishes itself as a modern Bond-film. See, for instance, the above quote from Q who responds to Bond's disappointment about the lack of 'toys' MI6 has provided him with.<br/><br/>There are some things that annoy me, however. The way the Big Bad, Silva (Javier Bardem), has planned everything (and I mean everything) in advance sometimes requires too much suspension of disbelief. This was most notable for me when Silva receives a package in the London Underground from two henchmen disguised as officers. I thought to myself: am I supposed to believe that he planned for those henchmen to be there at that exact time?<br/><br/>Another thing is Silva's homosexuality. I could have said 'implied', but there's nothing subtle about it here. Everything about Silva is sosensual: his accent, the way he walks, his mannerisms, etc. Now, I don't mind homosexuality whatsoever, but I didn't really see a reason for Silva to be gay. What does it matter? Sure, it definitely makes Silva more fun to watch, but I just didn't see the point It just takes me back to past films where the bad guys always tended to be gay (Silence of the Lambs, etc.).<br/><br/>Something else that bothered me – and this is a critical point – is the adherence to typical Bond-film characteristics, such as the Bond-girl. I've read a lot of comments that Skyfall isn't really a Bond-film, because it lacks certain of these elements. I hark back to what I said at the beginning, how I was hesitant to call it a Bond-experience. I didn't feel like I was watching a typical Bond-film, but a good (psychological) thriller with some social commentary on modern society. Bond's past was moderately explored, M has more to do than boss Bond around and there's an important theme dealing with the role of technology in modern life. Silva is able to do anything with the push of a button and the way Bond and M eventually defeat him is in a place where Silva is unable to utilize technology. In a film like this, the token Bond-elements, such as 'Bond-getting-girl' felt even more out of place and, for me, this was the main thing holding this film back from becoming the drama it seems to aspire to."

","Its good. It is good. Only because of the direction and cinematography. If u were to focus solely on the events of the film, it falls apart. This is one of those movies that is carried by direction cinematography and acting(besides Naomi Harris, she was severely miscast). Basically one major department is crap and that is the screenplay, and all others are solid. This is a testament to Sam Mendes as a director, because only a truly talented director can make a good movie out of a bad script. Any faults in this movie should be attributed to the writers. The overcompensation for the writing by all other departments is so staggering that this movie has been confused by critics for a cause for debate for the greatest bond movie ever. Whereas in reality, it should be up for debate for the worst script for a bond film. Seriously we r talking about a transformers level script here. Thats why they waited for Sam Mendez to direct the next bond film. Because he elevated a garbage script to million dollar blockbuster status. Hopefully the writers will give Sam Mendez a decent script for the next bond film so he can show his true potential!"

There's still some of the great action sequences characteristic of any JB film, but they're really more of an integral part to the story rather than just spectacular. I really like Daniel Craig's take on Bond...he's tough, physical and confident, but also shows a more humane side of the character. Dame Judi Dench is simply superb...as she's been in just about everything I've ever seen her in. The scenes at the end were very powerful and emotional, not something you typically see in a Bond film. All in all, this was an excellent departure from the Bond movies we've seen over the years.

But once I adjusted, he was actually quite good at the role, even if not as suave as Timothy Dalton or Sean Connery.<br/><br/>And having Javier Bardem as a villain was a stroke of genius.

","Daniel Craig is by far my second favorite Bond (after Sean Connery) so I was ready to like this film. A lot of Skyfall is fun to watch, including an opening chase scene that is on par with the best of the Bond films. Mendes takes full advantage of some stunning scenery, Judi Dench is perfectly cast as M and Craig is captivating and sexy as a ruthlessly efficient agent who is also finding it harder to keep up the pace. I also enjoyed a straightforward plot that was not a lot of work to keep track of, freeing my attention to enjoy the characters and action. On the other hand, Mendes made a chase scene that is thoroughly boring. The guy being chased runs through a room, next shot is Bond running through the same room. The lack of tension in this scene was beyond laughable, and had me rolling my eyes. And there were multiple events that left me scratching my head. A character bypasses a golden opportunity to finish someone off, or they stop the action to pontificate, instead of just getting on with it. A prisoner makes an escape but how they get out is not explained. A shootout consists of an assailant who defeats multiple officers while standing out in the open, seemingly impervious to bullets. Some of this bungling can be blamed on the writing, but it still could have been salvaged with some exciting action, and that was often missing. Please don't let Sam Mendes direct another Bond film."

","Love Daniel Craig's Bond. He is the best there has been. Mind you I love Connery, but love Dalton even better, so of course I dig the hard, tough killer that Craig displays here. <br/><br/>Skyfall is thin on story but the parts work. Bond is damaged. M is damaged. The villain is damaged. MI6 is damaged, there is a theme here. <br/><br/>But what is best about Skyfall is how small and intimate the film really is even dow to the villain's goal. His motivation sucks but once again if you toss logic out the window and enjoy the pieces of Skyfall you will enjoy the film. <br/><br/>I was very let down by Quantum after Casino Royal knocked it out of the park, but this is a return to form a complex character in a simple story with lots of action, the pieces work."

","James Bond has been part of cinema for years. These films contain classic aspects such as acting and dialog. in 'Skyfall' directed by Sam Mendes, we see Daniel Craig play 007 once again. James Bond is tested by determining his loyalty to M after being attacked. Bond get's involved in a bunch of other threats that make this a pretty typical Bond film. Javier Bardem plays the villain excellently. The plot isn't too unique. Basically you have James Bond fighting villains, getting help along the way, meeting women, being betrayed by his boss and shooting his gun. If your a fan of James Bond, you'll adore 'Skyfall.' What's kind of nice about this particular James Bond film is that you do not need to know a single thing about James Bond and you'll be able to pick up on the story immediately. Sam Mendes is one of the best directors out there these days. He gives great intensity to the film and will definitely please Bond fans. The editing and sound is superb of course, and Daniel Craig is pretty sweet as James Bond. Another thing I enjoyed was how 'Skyfall' had new themes of James Bond films, and was very modernized but yet kept some traditional aspects of older, classic Bond films. The reason i can only give this a 2.5/4 is because I'm not a James Bond fan. These films just are not for me. 'Skyfall' looked very entertaining, and it will be if you like James Bond, however I still wasn't intrigued. If your a Bond fan, go see this film. If not, see something else."

","I began watching Bond films with ""Dr. No."" I have been thrilled, disappointed, exhilarated, bored, and challenged. The best Bond movies are the ones that have a cohesion, despite the action sequences. There were times when I wondered if the producers packaged these by the pound. How many ridiculous chase scenes can you cram into a space. That's OK sometimes because these films have a sense of humor and an in-your-face craziness that is a hallmark. However, it's the space that may be a problem. The later films are just too long. When a confrontation takes twenty minutes to resolve, you need a program to try to remember the big picture. This one suffers from the same affliction. While things do eventually resolve themselves, we are led all over the place where distraction is the result. I must say that I stayed pretty interest throughout, but at times I began to look at my watch, wanting to cut to the chase. I like Daniel Craig. He seems to be a more complex Bond than some of the others, but the screenplays need editing and the action sequences more under control."

","Although I've never been a fan of the Bond series, I was anticipating Skyfall a lot. I knocked Casino Royale when it came out, having only seen the mediocre Brosnan films and writing off the whole series, but I gave it a chance before Quantum of Solace was released and to my surprise I enjoyed it greatly. Nothing perfect, but a cinematic film with a blockbuster kick. I was excited for Quantum. I wouldn't exactly call it a let down as I had no expectations but it was still quite the big mess. I like how Marc Forster dips his toes into different genres but I hope he crosses action off his list and works on more intimate and creative films again. So now we have Sam Mendes, another director with an interesting range though he is way more reliable. It wasn't until the stunning promotional photographs when I was finally excited for Skyfall. After the disappointing Summer this year, which climaxed early with The Avengers being the most enjoyable experience, I was hoping Skyfall would satisfy that hunger.<br/><br/>I'd love to say that it did, but I may have had unfair expectations. It is a great action film and it's great to see a film with patience to soak in the gravity of the situations without going too ridiculous but since it was so held back in that regard, it lacked a vital kick I was hoping it would have. The action scenes are quite exciting, but they're not of the same scale as The Dark Knight which I was hoping for. The biggest surprise though was Javier Bardem who I was afraid would be far too campy and look silly among a serious film and while he was quite a camp character, I underestimated Bardem's skills as an actor, and his character is almost up to a Joker or Hannibal Lector calibre. The strong points of the film are probably the introduction scenes of each of the new characters which is quite a shame as I wanted a balls to the walls action movie. Deakins' cinematography did pay off too, especially in the chilling/scorching third act. It's more English than the other Craig films but it feels like English for the world rather than English for the English. Skyfall is the gritty counterpart to Casino Royale and they're pretty much on a par. I guess this is as good as Bond gets. <br/><br/>7/10"
"l_rawjalaurence","7","0","2","18 June 2013"," Entertaining Entry to an Ever-Expanding Bond Canon
","Released in Bond's fiftieth year, SKYFALL contains all those elements you'd expect from a Bond film - car chases, really bad baddies, witty ripostes, the obligatory sex scene and exotic locations. To be honest, the locations are a little spurious in this film - Istanbul, Shanghai, Macau; the Istanbul scenes, in particular, seem orientalist in conception (after two decades of living in the Republic of Turkey), I've yet to find scenes of daily life with the continual strains of the muezzin in the background accompanied by arabesk music). However the film is redeemed by a close focus on characterization: we learn a lot about Bond's relationship to M (Judi Dench), and how the bad guy (Javier Bardem) finds that he has no choice other than to kill her. There's also some interesting material on the nature of family: M is considered a 'mother-figure' within the British Secret Service, suggesting that work and leisure are inextricable. Daniel Craig is a rugged Bond, making no secret of his advancing years: the film has an interesting side-line, as it speculates on whether spying these days is a young person's game. All in all, a very satisfying piece of entertainment."

","This is the first James bond films I have seen and I just loved it. Firstly I would like to say that Daniel Craig was the perfect actor for James bond and I just loved the action through out the film. Explosions, chase scenes and the death of one of the main characters M. At times I found it a bit slow and boring but I found it interesting and I love the idea of how they use one of the cars from the classic James bond films. Also this film was so good that I might go watch the classic James Bond films starting from 1963 Dr No. I also love the music in James bond by Adele and I just like listening to it when I am writing reviews. Overall I would recommend you seeing this film it has some cool actions scene and sometimes very dramatic overall I found the film good.

"Zazwaz","8","0","2","1 June 2013"," Great film but not really Bond
","The plot is pretty good, although there are some minor holes in it. To keep this review spoiler-free I won't go too much into the details. James Bond films have never been known for the quality of their plots, but it's obvious that in Skyfall they wanted to change that, so I think it is a shame that they took a few short cuts too many. Other then that it is a great, emotionally charged piece of writing. <br/><br/>The acting is first rate. Daniel Craig, while -as many people have remarked in the past- not looking the part, does a great job at playing an older, hardened Bond. Judi Dench is amazing as M, and she really gets to show her talent due to M having a much bigger role in this film than in it's predecessors. Javier Bardem makes for an interesting villain. A touch too flamboyant for my taste, but he gets the job done really well.<br/><br/>The Directing is really where Skyfall stands out. Sam Mendes has already proved himself to be a fantastic cinematic director in the past, and Skyfall only serves as more proof. It may have helped that he has worked with most of the stars in the past, but also the pacing and atmosphere in the film are expertly crafted.<br/><br/>As for the cinematography; Skyfall blew me away. Fantastic compositions and brilliant use of colors that even Ridley Scott could learn from make Skyfall a treat for the eyes.<br/><br/>So all in all Skyfall is a good film. But Skyfall isn't just any film, it's a Bond film and certain special standards apply to Bond films. When people hear James Bond they think mind boggling stunts, pretty girls, fast cars and crazy villains. Well Skyfall delivers on all of these fronts, however very briefly.<br/><br/>The stunts are mind boggling, yes, especially considering that, as opposed to the last few films, there was almost no CGI involved in creating them. However most of the stunts and action occur in the first 10 minutes, allowing the rest of the film to get on with the plot. While normally this would be a good thing, more avid Bond fans may be disappointed by the lack of action.<br/><br/>The same is true for the girls. There is a lot of eye-candy in the film, but Bond hardly gets to spend any time with them before he gets whisked away again by the plot. <br/><br/>As for the villain, he's just the right amount of crazy and having a Bond villain on a personal vendetta instead of just being out for money or power certainly makes for an interesting change.<br/><br/>It all comes down to this. Skyfall is definitely a fantastic film and definitely worth watching, but in my opinion it just isn't Bond. As stated earlier, all the classic Bond elements get drowned out by the plot and therefore may leave some fans mildly disappointed."

","Skyfall was so refreshing. Maybe it's because when I saw it, it was the first action I'd seen in a while, or maybe it's because I went alone (yes, you read that right) without anyone distracting me. But, whenever I finish a Bond film, I always feel so elegant; like I could be a Bond girl. And then reality sets in. No, but really though, those films are incredibly classy. The intro was amazing, representing Adele's 'Skyfall' (which is an amazing song, by the way), and the action was superb.<br/><br/>The one thing I thought they could have done better was made the movie a little shorter. Parts of it were very slow, and I don't think that the 143 minute run time was necessary.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig, who I think is one of the best James Bond's of all time, was, no surprise here, amazing; Javier Bardem, who played Silva was great too. I thought his performance was overdone, but it really worked well. Then we have Judi Dench as Agent M. Enough said. And of course, I can't forget the gorgeous Bond girls, Bérénice Marlohe and Naomie Harris."

","Skyfall was a solid movie in its own right but as a Bond movie, it was one of my all time favourites.

It makes me wonder if they might explore some of these themes in the next movie.<br/><br/>It's true that the last 1/3 of Skyfall didn't feel like a Bond movie at all and I think that's why I loved it. The Daniel Craig Bond movies have always taken a different look at James Bond and Skyfall was no exception.<br/><br/>Like I said, great movie. Execution on all accounts were solid like you'd expect.

","This is Bond without the full throttle. Quantum of Solace and Casino Royal show us a much fiercer and provocative Bond, even when he's struggling with his own issues in the aforementioned installments. In this film, we hear too much about Bond's back story to make him a man of mystery. So what's bad about that? Well, this franchise doesn't base itself on the ordinary, it prides itself on the extraordinary. Bond without his over-the-top cunning and super human feats isn't Bond. Knowing he's another human being makes him seem dull. The pacing in the movie deliberately slows down the action and intensity way too much to make him the Bond that we've known for years. This is intentional because he's supposed to be an old dog and what not, but why are we watching then? Bond is like a comic book; he's supposed to be ""present tense"", not ""has been"".<br/><br/>That said, Daniel Graig is his awesome self (even if he's exhausted in every scene), and shoo-in Javier Bardem is as evil as ever, something he seems to excel at. Ralph Fiennes easily fits in as Bond's new overseer, and is delightful in just about everything I've seen him in. His script is a little lacking in the movie, but again that's the movie, not the actor."

Bardem did a great job at being the Bond villain 'Silva' and made the character likable.

"amesmonde","Null","0","3","25 February 2013"," ""Stop touching your ear."" Overrated, yet outstanding Bond
","007 must dust himself down and return to duty when a face from M's past beings to terrorise MI5.<br/><br/>Having had time to digest it for the third time - Skyfall, is overrated, there is said it, yet it's an amazing Bond outing but it's overrated. The problem with it is that it returns to the old Bond that I fell in love with, but in doing so treads on Casino Royale re-imagined and Quantum's departure of the older instalments and the new foundation they laid out.<br/><br/>Another issue is that Bond was fresh learning and honing his skills, but writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan present an experienced, washed up spy, that seems four films too soon. Anyone certainly in the UK will be underwhelmed by the setting of the latter half but it's easy to see why an overseas audience my get a kick from the atmospheric closure but it's home from home and not very exotic for many of us.<br/><br/>These gripes aside Skyfall is a solid addition to the franchise, Javier Bardem as baddie Silva is outstanding. Naomie Harris (28 Days Later) is perfect as Eve, Judi Dench returns as M (Olivia Mansfield) in an expanded central role and the supporting cast include the likes of heavy weight actors Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney (in a role which may have been fitting for the sadly retired Sean Connery). Once again Daniel Craig is Mr. Bond, what he lacks in dialogue through no fault of his own he makes up for in screen presence, once again delivering the physicality and emotion that one would expect from todays James Bond. <br/><br/>Sam Mendes delivers some old school framing, while some stunts are underwhelming other are purely breathtaking. Mendes with Roger Deakins' cinematography presents a traditional style film with many modern touches you'd expect from filmmakers of their calibre. What's nice about Skyfall is that it captures London as London, dark and damp as oppose the makeover seen in The World is not Enough or Die Another Day. Mendes' eye mixed with Thomas Newman's exceptional score really cements this as one of the better more gritty Bonds.<br/><br/>However, oddly Skyfall takes you out of the moment at times with superfluous questions - how have these criminals got the same super-spy abilities as 007, did they go to a motorbike riding on a roof academy? Why is there a Hannibal Lecture style cell in the new MI5 HQ? Silva's impeccable underground timing and it's purpose? Underwater hideouts I bought, flying cars, hook armed and metal teeth henchmen, even Bond going into outer-space and all the outrageousness of the old Bonds but when something is this well made these little things are magnified and seem more distracting.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned and without giving much away there are plenty of surprises and nods to previous Bonds but in an emphasising encompassing fashion. There's a nice touch in the ensemble script which refers to a line in Craig's first outing and there is plenty of depth in the story and characters. <br/><br/>There are many highlights, notably Adele's Oscar winning 'wobbly' yet powerful theme song belting out over the wonderfully done opening credits and the above par acting. All in all its a great outing but shoehorns Daniel's Bond character skipping what was so skilfully established in Craig's previous outings."
"clarkejb","Null","0","2","23 February 2013"," Extraordinary yet flawed project
","Like all James Bond films, Skyfall provides great music, great acting, great international settings, and great action sequences. After so many of these films, it is a challenge for any writer to come up with something new. In Skyfall, I think the greatest aspect of the writing is the way in which the writers deal with the issue of age. M is old. Bond is middle-aged, and a new generation of the British Secret Service has risen to management and field positions. The issue of age was dealt with in earlier films like Thunderball and Never Say Never, but not to the same extent. In Skyfall, Bond is almost killed at the outset, and he looks beaten and exhausted through the rest of the film. There is a beautiful woman in Skyfall, but the 45 year old Bond character is no longer the aggressive stud we knew in earlier films. He also is full of physical and mental imperfections. In short, the writers let Bond become a middle-aged human being. Skyfall is different than all other Bond films because it is more of a survival story about two aging characters in a dangerous and unforgiving world. <br/><br/>This should be the last Bond film, but there is too much money to be made from additional sequels. Without any explanation, Bond is ""reborn"" with the death of M and once again fully capable of being the great spy."

I have said he is the best bond since Connery and that still holds true.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes, the talent behind the camera gives us an action packed edge of your seat ride that makes you want to hit the play button again and again. However, the scrip truly needed some work because while the storyline of MI6 losing sensitive data, and being smart enough to find the person responsible... they don't seem to be very intelligent in figuring out their ""supposedly dead"" secret agent is still alive. FAIL. Or the fact the get the man responsible, who is known to have hacked MI6 and just get into his PC without any caution to the wind.<br/><br/>Fix those element in the story and you would have a near perfect film, but that is my biggest gripe with it, for an agency whose sole job is intelligence they sure do not have any.<br/><br/>Otherwise check it out, worth the 2.5 hours of viewing."
"neerood","6","0","4","13 February 2013"," Enjoyable but ultimately very disappointing
","Really enjoyed it while watching and was surprised to learn the actual running time as it went by quickly for me. But starting near the end and certainly afterwards, I'm quite disappointed.<br/><br/>I'm not usually a stickler about plot holes, but they really degrade this effort overall.<br/><br/>The essential story here is a disgruntled agent comes back to harm M. MI6 and Bond condone a hundred needless deaths to protect a very old figurehead who dies anyway, and we're to be happy with the outcome? Even worse, she makes the point earlier that on multiple occasions she cheerfully sacrificed the lives of individual agents (Silva, Ronson, Bond) to save the lives of others. Why doesn't she or the plot disrespect that philosophy? The villain didn't pose much of a threat to the world. He wanted to get back at his mother figure, and all the mayhem was mostly caused by attempts to stop him.<br/><br/>The spectacular opening sequence aside, nothing actually happened, and there wasn't any jeopardy beyond what MI6 themselves provoked.<br/><br/>So much of the traditionally cleverness of a Bond film was seemingly overlooked. We see his hands are unsteady, so why doesn't that come into play later? He magically becomes a crack shot, rendering his age and growing infirmity pointless as the film moves along. Sure he has to use the duelling pistol and hang from the elevator, but these challenges are never used in any clever way.<br/><br/>Same with the gadgets. They brush it aside with an insulting comment that ""we don't go in for the exploding pens anymore"". Hey guess what, the audiences do. I'm not slavish about following the more hackneyed conventions of the Bond films, but admitting you have no clever gadgets by slighting the audience for expecting it is just weak.<br/><br/>The gadgets we do get are a bland homing beacon and a fingerprint gun which isn't new, isn't impressive, and both end up being utilized in banal fashion.<br/><br/>They used a corny 1980's level of digital espionage, where hacking always has some visually stunning and graphical representation, and defeating it is just a matter of wild guessing.<br/><br/>The only remotely clever bits are badly telegraphed, like Kincade throwing the dagger on the table and repeating the theme 'the old ways are best'. When a priest hole is mentioned, you know it's going to be used, and when Moneypenny discusses field work with Bond, you see that coming too. Everything just seemed so forced.<br/><br/>There was also so much rehashing. Rooftop motorcycles is cool, but it's a re-run. Same with the hall of mirrors in Shanghai, and the lusty Latino villain.<br/><br/>Once they were at the underground and it turned into a cop shootout movie I started to question what I was seeing.<br/><br/>The third act prolongs the senseless gunfight theme with Bond inexplicably going there to defend his old childhood cottage, which even he doesn't care about.<br/><br/>They also failed on the tradition of cleverly turning peril for Bond into enemy deaths. The komodo dragon was highly telegraphed, and was never really a threat to Bond. And while the internet can debate the finer points of choking someone's carotid versus holding them underwater, the drowning/choking enemy kill was an uninteresting waste of a situation. A race to a breathing hole big enough for only one to survive, a rope that becomes a tug of Bond versus henchman, maybe a shot of an enemy pressed up against the ice, so close to living but quite making it. Any would be more clever than a Where was the Bond wit? ""Did you kill Patrice?"" Fans wait to hear a Bond response: ""I dropped him off in Shanghai"" or ""We had to let him go."" Nope, he just says: ""Yes"" I'm not asking for stand-up routine, just some token realization of who the character is after 20+ movies.<br/><br/>I think why I'm most disappointed is this could have been so much better. A traditional Bond would have cleverly managed to save Severine on the Ghost Island, rather than passively allowing her murder. And why did he stand around and just wait for the sniper murder to occur? And what was the point or connection of the art heist sniper to Silva? I'm not insisting they slavishly adhere to formula, but give a little respect to what a Bond movie is about.<br/><br/>Yes M had to die off given how many years elapse between releases, but it didn't need to be the only event of the movie.<br/><br/>When I hear about millions spent on an underwater tank for no effect, I wonder if some of that budget could have gone into script review. Then I hear the script had 13 re-writes, yet nobody saw the big picture which is that after the opening sequence, nothing really happens, the world isn't in much jeopardy, there's just a disturbed former agent with a narrow vendetta followed by extended shootouts."

But I cannot really call this a Bond movie. When I watch a Bond movie, I want to see a movie which is about Bond. I should be rooting for Bond the entire time seated at the edge of my seat and wishing for bad things to happen to the villain in the hands of Bond. What I really look forward to is watching a movie that builds up with unexpected surprises and finally culminates in Bond totally outwitting the bad guy. I need to feel impressed by Bond. But this movie was a third about Bond, a third about M and a third about the villain. And was the villain really a villain? I didn't think so. I rooted for the villain towards the end of the movie. I felt all three were supporting characters that complimented each other and in the end I couldn't figure out if Bond was the ""hero"" of the movie. This is not like any of the Bond movies ever made. It totally stepped away from the Bond formula and presented itself as an action drama. Yes I enjoyed the movie but I missed Bond and the theme music."

","I really liked this Bond. I liked what the producers were trying to do with Quantum and thought that Casino was overrated. Been there seen that, albeit with different actors. QoS had style but was badly fragmented. Skyfall delivers on the potential that casting Daniel Craig offers. This is not Bourne reborn, this is Bond reborn. Hiring Sam Mendes was a very smart move and the film feels a little more grown up, a little more intelligent as a result. It's also visually very stylish in an understated way. Berenice Marlohe rather than Famke Jansen. It's by no means perfect. The last reel has ""let's keep within budget"" written all over it and that's a shame. Destroying an isolated house in the Scottish highlands smells of cheap and all the press-fed justification re Bond's childhood is bullshit. This was a budgetary decision and the film suffers as a result. That said, it's still one of the best. There are signs of too many cooks at work. Lines like ""I never did like the house"" belong to another Bond and point to a loss of nerve but Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig have finally laid the ghost of Connery."

","Like Cocoa Cola the James Bond franchise has run smoothly for nearly have a century with the same formula. Brash and predictable it still provides some hair raising moments in the traditional format of the instantly recognizable figure in silhouette, 60s electric guitar riffs a wild opening scene followed by a pop ditty the same as when I caught the Saturday matinée of Goldfinger back in the 60s. In Skyfall we are given the same adrenalin filled flawless start enhanced by today's evolving technology but we are also saddled by it's understandable intent to appeal to a larger audience in which Bond is a tad more touchy feely with major female players defraying action and pace in favor of tedious heart to hearts.<br/><br/>James Craig is probably the best Bond since Connery and Javier Bardem a worthy quirky villain but with the odd choice of the pretentious Sam Mendes directing and an Oscar winner (Judy Dench) playing M the film bogs down in tedious dialog and the film begins to drag. There's a wonderful nostalgic re-appearance by a classic Bond character (non-human) but an equally disappointing non-appearance in a role tailor made for Sean but played by Albert Finney instead.<br/><br/>There are some riveting action scenes but some sloppy ones as well and while it delivers much of the time it hangs around too long for its own good. Face it the first three Bonds in the early 60s will always be the gold standard no matter how advanced the technology."
"cpbadgeman","7","0","2","2 January 2013"," Good but too dark
","Daniel Craig's third outing as 007 takes the 50 year-old franchise in a new direction but makes some significant sacrifices along the way. In this outing, Mr Bond has to retrieve a hard drive listing the cover of every MI6 agent on active service. Things get off to a great start with a fabulous chase scene over the rooftops of Istanbul. The film maintains a great pace through plot segments in London, Shanghai, and Macau also. However the final hour-or-so, though suspenseful, feels grim and anticlimactic. Bond's age and vulnerability are perhaps over-emphasized, and the silliness factor is significantly reduced. Overall, this is a good film and a more mature, world-weary spin on the James Bond character. Unfortunately, it's just not quite as much fun. Worth seeing all the same though."
"AvidClimber","7","0","5","13 December 2012"," Skyfall — A much more personal James Bond
","Skyfall has the basic requirements of a Bond movie, hot women, action, soft intrigue, and easy dialogs, but it's missing many of the other clichés, such as at least one torrid sex scene (we barely have the beginning of one) one or more Bond girls (in the sense that he develops some kind of relationship), a world threat, the villain's second in command, and the gadgets.<br/><br/>The villain is there, but he's not interested in world domination, or some such, he's going after individuals, for personal revenge. How prosaic. I imagine it's on purpose, but that's not what I want from a James Bond. The new Q is annoying to say the least, and we're missing the iconic equipment, and they're excessive use.<br/><br/>All in all, it's an acceptable movie, and an easy entertainment.

","SkyFall<br/><br/>My Rating: 8/10 Rating: PG-13 Genre: Action, Adventure, Crime Cast: Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw Director: Sam Mendes Writers: Neal Purvis, Robert Wade Production Value: 200 Million length: 143 minutes Profit: 571,232,889<br/><br/>Sam Mendes has created one of those timeless James Bond films which unites all the charm, suaveness and nostalgia of the old films and the depth and realistic brutality of the Daniel Craig series. That first statement may sound like an exaggeration but it is actually true this movie really is that good, no great though even calling it great would be a understatement. Though this is not the best Bond film it is the best in the Daniel Craig series and one of the best James Bond movies of all time due to hard work, nostalgia, good acting and genuine effort on everyones part. <br/><br/>The plot is about James Bond (Daniel Craig) obviously, and Miss Moneypenny ( Naomie Harris) who I am glad is back in the films again, fighting off the ex- MI6 agent Silva (Javier Bardem) who has a personal vendetta against M (Judi Dench) for leaving him to die in an earlier mission. The way Silva enacts this plan is revealing 7 MI6 agents identity each week on youtube and blowing up M16 headquarters in order to create a sense of panic coupled with the fact that the world thinks MI6 has become corrupt ,obsolete, and unnecessary creates a perfect storm against MI6 which is Silva has planned to do thus at this exact time. The film ends with a final Battle at James Bond's old family manor featuring the Aston Martin from the original films.<br/><br/>Silva is a great villain delivering thousands of chills down the viewers spine and M is great as always, another great character who I wish I had mention is Q, now played by Ben Whishaw who lampshades the fact of how they don't make the gadgets as flashy but impractical as they used to be, but rather more boring yet useful, and though he may Ben Whishaw may seem too young for the role he fills in the role quite well. The entire Film is wonderful not just do to the action or even the nostalgia but to the interaction of characters, due to the challenges these people must overcome and to the brief moments of very potent humor that are dispersed throughout film randomly, this is what makes the Bond series greater than most if not all modern action/ crime series. <br/><br/>In the end I wish I could tell you more but that may spoil the fun, if you are a die hard fan of James Bond films as I am this is the film for you to the point where it has chance to be a classic like Goldfinger or Dr. No for you and even if you are a casual Bond watcher or a newcomer to the series you will still enjoy this film. I do agree with the rating because some of the scenes may be scary and disturbing for sensitive and younger viewers though there is less..... naughty scenes this time so if your child can handle the other films they are probably ready to see this."

","This installment does not make the impact that Casino Royale did, but it does better than Quantum. On the upside, the stunts are lovely, the scenery, too. Then the clichés take over, and struggle against an almost too ardent attempt to humanize these characters, to give them depth and dimension. Why? Even Severine, the disposable.woman in this film, is held in bondage to the villain by fear, we are told, as though this longstanding device needs explanation. Layers of insulating mystery are removed from M as her unquestioned power and backstory are examined and revealed. And the central mystery that seemingly brings us back to the theater each time, Bond's own backstory, is laid out in far too specific detail and comicbook psychological rationalization. I had no idea Bond had once resided in Wayne Manor, EC, nor that Alfred was still the caretaker there. Did Fleming really write any of that? Finally, we see that what drives the film is not really internal story logic, but a convergence of seemingly smart career moves, and really, an abandonment of innovation. The film drives inexorably toward an integration with the Connery era films. Smart recasting is done before our eyes - good for you, Lord Voldemort, Lady Calypso! Nothing pays the bills like a serial. But with the Bond backstory so well documented, will Bond intrigue us enough to justify a fourth film? Will Craig be up for another, or will Bond have to have facial reconstruction?"

"The-Sarkologist","7","0","6","3 December 2012"," Another Bond film, will he ever retire?
","The latest edition to the James Bond franchise sometimes makes me wonder how old James Bond is to the rest of the world, and whether he is aging slower than the real world. Considering that he is a commander in the Royal Navy, it seems that he had been in the military prior to joining Her Majesty's Secret Service (though now they are beginning to refer to it as MI6). However I seem to remember from Casino Royal that there was a suggestion that James Bond was simply a name that certain agents earned when the previous agent retired, however in Skyfall there is a suggestion that Bond is the same Bond through all the movies.<br/><br/>It seems that after about 24 movies and fifty years we wonder if the James Bond franchise will ever die, and I suspect not. Despite some rather dull and boring entries in the nineties James Bond still manages to draw the crowds, and despite people shaking their heads at some of the movies, studios still seem to want to produce them. In a way James Bond, and the franchise, is likely to continue to go on and pretty much leave many other movie sequels lying in their dust. Star Wars only managed six movies (though it seems that Disney wants to turn it into a franchise) and even some of the bad eighties movies (such as Nightmare on Elm Street and Police Academy among many other movies in the similar vein) only manage to produce around six to eight movies.<br/><br/>In a way Bond is growing old, but even though he is growing old, and tired, he still seems to be able to pack a punch and save the day. I guess this is one of those themes that flows through this Bond movie, and that is the question of whether he is tired and whether it is time of him to retire, though we know that will not be the case because before the credits close, the barrel of the gun drops onto the screen, and we are told that Bond will return, but not when, were, or the name of the movie. Mind you, after watching this one, it gives me the desire to then go and watch the other twenty three (this time in order, if that is possible) because I feel that I should at least try to write a commentary on each of them, considering that I, myself, enjoyed these movies to no end."

"btorun-368-612496","6","0","5","23 November 2012"," Great but not what I expected from Sam Mendes
","First of all, I have to say that I expected a lot from this movie since the director was Sam Mendes, an academy awarded director. I thought Skyfall would be better than even Casino Royale but it's unfortunately not.<br/><br/>The best things about this movie are the cinematography by St. Deakins and the intro music by Adele. Art direction, costume design, visual effects, lighting were also great. Casting was amazing as well. I really loved Ben Whishaw playing young Q, Ralph Fiennes as Mallory and Bond girls Berenice Marlohe, Naomie Harris. Javier Bardem was good too but I wouldn't consider him to be the best Bond villain. Best Bond villain is Le Chiffre.<br/><br/>This film has nothing to do with the legacy of Bond. Casino Royale was very Bond-like. Because James Bond in novels is a coldblooded murderer, womanizer and alcoholic. He is a caricature. In Skyfall Mendes tried to make it more realistic and ruined that part. He misses the target, suffers from wounds etc. He is shown pathetic. He even can't pass the field agent test! The villain is also too similar to Joker. As for M, I couldn't imagine a worse ending. Mendes ruined the whole movie just for the sake of creating a drama. I didn't even feel moved by it. Vesper's death in Casino Royale was much more believable. As stated by Mendes, that scene was deliberately done to get Oscar nomination for Bardem. The scene is too theatrical and has nothing to do with reality.<br/><br/>There are also some parts of the movie which are done for the sake of action and offensively stupid. Why does Bond take M to a cabin in the woods and absolutely with NO WEAPON? MI6's system is hacked at the beginning of the movie and they relocate after the explosion. And they are hacked AGAIN! And because the computer GENIUS connects Silva's computer to their server. Then Silva goes to kill M with two thugs. There is less than 10 cops protecting government officials, intelligence officers. That's spectacularly stupid.<br/><br/>Basically everything is great in this film. Cinematography, editing, art direction, production design, VFX & SFX, , casting, acting, costume design, stunts. But script is so awful that it ruins almost everything."
"craigtuttondrum","8","0","6","23 November 2012"," A very well direted film
","Saw this movie on Monday night and I really enjoyed it. Here's some reasons why:<br/><br/><ul><li>Daniel Craig - In my opinion, the best Bond yet. He embodies everything that Bond means to me (tuff, smart, suave &amp; cocky). Yet I find that Craig has brought much more to Bond than previous actors: and that is soul. Emotion is what makes this Bond so much tuffer than the rest, and this film hints at reasons why he may be the way he is.</li></ul><br/><br/>-Sam Mendes - What a choice for Director. One of the best out there at the moment, and although there were some 'Dark Knight-esque' moments (to be expected) he did a damn good job at making a true Bond film. The film was confident, and it wasn't on such an epically ridiculous scale as some Bond films. In fact, the climax was quite brilliantly underplaying the importance of Bond in today's world. And at the same time, showing us how useful he can be. <br/><br/>-Thomas Newman - I'm a bit of a soundtrack geek. Near enough every Thomas Newman soundtrack is incredible, yet, quite similar (ie very obviously Newman). This however wasn't, but it was still brilliant, particularly the introduction of the old Bond Themes throughout the film.<br/><br/>-The Story - I thought the story was very well written and quite conceivable. It completely questioned the use for a James Bond type figure in today's society. I liked that the introduction of the main antagonist was left until an hour into the movie. I wasn't overly keen on his entrance, but I guess there's only one of 2 ways of doing it.<br/><br/>-The ending - Bloody brilliant. The location was perfect, the idea was perfect and the whole notion of Bond having to rely on weapons and creative thinking, from an old house, was brilliant. This would of been a great ending for any movie, just that much better because it's Bond.<br/><br/>Overall, for me it's the most authentic and well rounded Bond film to date. I've never liked the sheer gravity of Bond films before, in terms of gadgets and world threatening missiles etc. This was just the right balance between smart gadget wizardry and old school fist-fighting."

Decent script, good action (especially the opening sequence), beautiful title song by Adele.<br/><br/>Skyfall introduces new actors in the roles of M, Q and Moneypenny.

"BharatSamra","8","0","6","22 November 2012"," JaMes Bond
","Despite at times being convinced I was consuming a prolonged commercial for Sony electronics, the 23rd Bond instalment exceeds the expectations in almost every way possible. Rather than tick off everything the film did well and express Minor negative criticism, I will instead proceed to articulate the most intriguing aspects of this thoroughly enjoyable addition to the James Bond collection.<br/><br/>At this point, the almost tired description of Skyfall as an unconventional exploration of the character is certainly still worth noting. Take the usual narrative formula of an international threat, which requires prevention from MI6. Does this film consist of this remedy? To a certain degree, one could argue yes, but for the Most part, Skyfall perpetuates unknown personality to both 007 and M, Meaning we discover the history of these characters, resulting in our narrative as having a relatable persona, as opposed to the conservative Manner of previous films in the franchise. We see an alternative representation of the heroes, as broken in their strive for righteousness, and this film does not deal with opposing principles of good vs. evil in the generic sense. Neither our protagonist nor villain, convey the standard characteristics of their roles. The antagonist most notably, sensationally portrayed by Javier Barden, is not one of complete Malevolence in that we as the audience express a particular empathy towards his character, due to the corruption at the hands of the supposed good in the British Secret Service. This makes for a compelling yet simple plot for revenge.<br/><br/>It could possibly prove more complementary to derive comparisons between Skyfall and Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. This is due to the overwhelming similarities between Bond 23 and Nolan's take on the comic- book hero. Both suffer severe Mental and physical trauma and are in both respects broken to the extent of becoming incapable of reaching the valiant level they once attained. We also see a darker tone in usually upbeat franchises, making the audience revise exactly what these characters stand for. There are many other resemblances between the two, such as Musical score, narrative structure and villainous authority; though to entrench those into this review may dilute my appreciation for Skyfall as an individual film. <br/><br/>While previous contemporary Bond instalments May have been lacking in the vintage substance from the perspective of older audiences, Skyfall imbeds Many new and classical conventions of a Bond picture to accommodate to almost any audience. For instance, we see the introduction of various, previously absent characters that play a fundamental role to the achievements of James Bond's objective, with a Modern twist that accomplishes both a humorous and relevant contribution to the film's success. Furthermore, the notorious accompaniment of a 'Bond Girl' has received its criticism in light of more accepting feminist ideologies throughout the fifty-year history of 007. Considering this, Skyfall and arguably all three of Daniel Craig's Bond films, have assimilated for of a significant female association with the projects, without of course forgetting the unnecessary sexual scenes with highly attractive exotic women.<br/><br/>Having not been fortunate to view all 23 films based on the internationally recognised character, I May only regard this as a great Bond picture, relative to the few others I have seen. It does not quite elevate above Casino Royale (2006) in terms of overall enjoyment, but Makes a sensational attempt at becoming a refreshing embodiment for a new style of narrative and tone that will likely not only be remembered for being one of 2012s Most Memorable cinematic triumph, but perhaps even the decade. This latest feature of the franchise embarks on a great deal of wondrous engagement and consistency, as it never leaks a dull taste even throughout the fairly long 143 Minute time period.<br/><br/>Favourite sequence: The most outstanding segment is oddly the opening title sequence, whereby we acquire brief narrative explanation, excellent fluidity in CG (computer graphics) as well as the accompaniment of the title song by Adele, which if you are not classically conditioned to after taking in the establishing credits, then perhaps I am not 'Someone Like You'."
"uskifia777","6","0","3","22 November 2012"," Retribution
","New continuation of the old. Retribution for the death needs living. The strength of a single agent for the trip to the ruins of past. The film consists even poetry - before fighting with extinguishers. Life goes faster than some people change. The mood of the agent as always inversely proportional to the height of agent's location - as always dull on the roofs of skyscrapers and trains Bond becomes active man under ground and under ruins. Death is moving in a different direction and strength of bullet smashes anger. A movie about the attitude to death must be serious. Heroes can show their attitude to death. Be a snob before death. Unshakable credibility of the agent."

","This is one of the movie I was really looking forward to seeing on 2012. In fact I saw it during opening night and it turned out to be a good movie. It shows more of the essence of the past Bond movies where Bond is less raw and more smooth in carrying out his tasks. Even the action sequences you can see more of the classic Bond movements and even gadgets that are not so far-fetched. I was hyped for this movie and although it didn't meet my expectations it was far from being a disappointment like ""Quantum of Solace"". This movie kinda shows the process of how Bond became the Bond he is with the build up and Same Mendes did a decent job with that. And Daniel Craig take this prominent role and again he is James Bond. Also Sam is known for making character driven and psychologically driven movies and that plays a part in this movie as well. Especially when it came to Javier Bardem's character Silva. Would have been better if the characters were a bit more fleshed out more since the movie is almost 2 and a half hours long. Some character are nice to look at but is hardly relevant to the story much at all. If this movie was a bit more tightly compacted with a bit more good action sequences it would have been a better film. The beginning chase scene is cool and entertaining to watch but after that the movie slows down a bit. After reading about the premise of this movie I was expecting a back and forth fight where James Bond and Silva duke it out and one up on each other. Because of their backgrounds. But unfortunately that didn't happen. In fact 006 played by Sean Bean made a better rival for Bond in ""GoldenEye"". Judi Dench is great as M as always and Ben Whishaw is believable as Q with his smart but calm way of talking. His character seemed like someone you could trust to have your back. ""Skyfall"" is a good balance of classic Bond and the gritty narratives that make Daniel Craig Bond films really stand out.<br/><br/>8.7/10"
"imdbrian","7","0","8","21 November 2012"," Stronger After 50 Years
","The James Bond film franchise has officially been operational for 50 years, and that's quite an amazing accomplishment. The series has sputtered on plenty of occasions, and with so many big blockbusters hitting theaters thanks to a nationwide super hero obsession, reinvention was virtually necessary when Daniel Craig took over as 007 a little over a half-decade ago. Fortunately, Craig's interpretation of Bond has been refreshingly beaten down; this is a guy whose years of espionage, betrayal, and severe ass kickings have gotten to him even if he isn't going to say it out loud. Craig doesn't have to, though, and he's made this role his own while keeping to tradition just enough.<br/><br/>While Casino Royale represented a fresh start, Quantum of Solace stalled Bond's development and gave us a villain whose idea of evil was largely related to messing with the utility bills of millions. I can proudly report that Skyfall, which was helmed by American Beauty director Sam Mendes, rights all of Quantum's wrongs effectively. The movie is exciting, gives long-time Bond fans plenty to work with, and approaches the material with more intelligence than we're used to seeing.Skyfall opens with James Bond's world in disarray. After an admittedly cool chase scene--and I hate chase scenes--Bond finds himself in a compromising situation that involves him using a backhoe to meet an enemy on top of a train. He accidentally gets shot by a fellow MI6 agent and is thought dead by virtually everyone. By the time Bond makes his way back to England, and more specifically inside the apartment of Judi Dench's M, things with his agency are in terrible shape. A hard drive containing the identities of several covert agents is missing and terrorist acts that seem specifically designed to bring MI6 to its knees are becoming fashionable. After completing necessary training following his absence, it's up to Bond to help figure out who wants the agency to fall.<br/><br/>Once Bond finds a way to encounter the villain he seeks, the game is far from over. That has to be a pretty big bummer for a man who was recently shot and had to use komodo dragons to get out of a close shave with a few bad guys in a Chinese casino. It turns out that the villain in question is a man named Silva, and he has the past connections to the MI6 that M had suspected all along. Silva, as played by Javier Bardem, is a man who blends frightening menace with a dash of nonchalance and more than enough insanity. Silva comes across as a man who honestly feels wronged, and Bardem's performance is very good. Between this role and his chilling effort in No Country for Old Men, Bardem has to be one of the better bad guys in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Craig continues to prove himself as the best James Bond to grace the screen since Sean Connery and the most complex Bond ever. Sure, he's plenty full of himself and still exudes badassery and confidence that crosses the border of logical into pure delusion. But in between those lines we see Bond ache both physically and emotionally. We get a better sense of where he came from and we don't always see him act entirely out of selfishness. Craig's increasingly high-dimensional James Bond is a lot more interesting than the caricatures we've often been treated to in the past.<br/><br/>A James Bond movie wouldn't really work without plenty of action, and Skyfall comes loaded with it. The important thing to remember is that the action isn't nonstop or pointless by any means; everything presented here is set up extensively. The verses are quiet and ponderous, but that's because they need to be in order to best frame the explosive choruses. Skyfall is not just good within the context of the 007 canon, it's about as well done as any action movie I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>One recurring theme throughout Skyfall is the juxtaposition between the new and the old, and that's pretty clever for a franchise that has been around since the era Don Draper fictionally occupies. It's constantly brought to our attention that the British government may find the ways of the MI6 to be outdated, and the complete anarchy caused by our anonymous terrorist isn't helping matters. Q is back as a computer expert in his twenties instead of an old butler, and the difference isn't lost on James Bond. Even the style of the film, which hearkens back to older Bond material while pushing forward at the same time, suggests that the old and the new should not be at war but rather should join hands for the better of us all.<br/><br/>Given what Skyfall is going for, it makes plenty of sense for the movie to reach its climax at the place where James Bond's future was ultimately decided. It also makes sense to keep the visually arresting opening sequence complete with a title track and dancin' ladies. Along with all the nostalgia, we also get plenty of new items to work with. Moneypenny is back in the fold as a new actress, Q (as we mentioned earlier) is now half Bond's age, and some interesting changes happen for M along the way. Skyfall expertly weaves around between what we expect to see and what we don't. As a result, I find myself excited about the franchise more than I ever have been as an adult, and I'd really like to see Mendes get to do more of these.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews on film, music, books, and TV, check out IMDbrian.com"

","I always click the ""may contain spoilers"" option in case I let something slip, but I try not to do so. Skyfall was a great action flick. Well put together, extremely well-filmed. The director was a little too crazy about using lots and lots of glass for my taste, but that's okay. But it was not a good Bond film. There was a tremendous lack of gadgets from Q. There were no great Bond-style lines. The Bond chicks were very few and far between, and their roles in the movie were minimal at best. There were a number of familiar themes taken from other movies, but I'd rather not list them here. And certain aspects of the storyline just kind of got dropped off for no apparent reason. Change the name ""James Bond"" and any other names (or letters, like M, Q, MI-6) that associate Skyfall with the Bond franchise, and the flick is pretty solid. As a Bond film, though--bleah."
"kunalkhandwala","7","0","4","15 November 2012"," Bond is colder, unfortunately not cooler
","In the history of 'reboots' of a franchise, 'Casino Royale' ranks high in the echelons, with director Martin Campbell guiding Bond through his origins in MI6. That film also launched a new, brute Bond. While Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan were like Martinis and Cocktails, Daniel Craig was more like a cold bottle of Guiness. The first two films with him set the tone for Bond as he got used to his job as MI6's top secret agent while sacrificing all that he loved. He became a cold bastard and we loved him for that. Now, Director Sam Mendes ('American Beauty', 'Road to Perdition', 'Revolutionary Road') makes him even colder but not cooler. That perhaps, is the single big issue with 'Skyfall'. You can only detach Bond from women, gadgets, car chases, guns and saving the world missions up to a certain point. That point is 'Skyfall'. <br/><br/>There is however, one aspect of Sam Mendes' direction which brings cheers to avid Bond fans. Through numerous scenes, he takes Bond back to the basics and to the good old times when certain rules of the game were established. This, of course, begins with the exhilarating opening sequence which doesn't even give you time to pass around the popcorn. Motorbikes jumping over the rooftops of Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, a car chase through crowded streets and a train-top fist fight with the villain's henchman that leads to Adele's exemplary title song. But soon we discover that agent 007 isn't in good shape. Not only is his physical state short of MI6's standards, he has a drug and alcohol addiction that wears him down as well. MI6 on the other hand, has its own issues with its former agent, Silva (Javier Bardem), wreaking havoc in the cyberspace by exposing MI6 agents who have infiltrated terrorist organizations. With his directorial degree in middle-age drama, Sam Mendes shifts focus to M as she struggles to convince the British Government that operatives are necessary in this age when the enemy is not a country, organization or a renowned individual. They live in shadows and therefore, only the agents who operate as shadows, can bring them to justice. Throughout this ordeal, Bond is looking up to M as a motherly figure and strives to protect her from the wily Silva, whose wicked smile only reveals a malignant apathy for his former colleagues. Among those back-to-old times scenes, we are delighted to watch the villain tease Bond when he's tied to a chair, Bond getting into his girl's shower unannounced, jumping into the back of the train after it is detached and immediately fixing up his suit, getting his martini well shaken and of course, the introduction of MoneyPenny, 'M' and the young Quartermaster. The one that is a definitive James Bond movie scene is when the camera focuses on him standing atop a boat that is on its way to a casino in Macau. It's just Daniel Craig in all his confident 007 aura, as sharp as ever. <br/><br/>But the film is devoid of action in most of its 2hr23min duration. Apart from the opening sequence, there is a London tube sequence with the train crashing in through the ceiling (Epic!) and the cool neon-plasma lit scene with the assassin in one of Shanghai's high rises that make up for the action in the film. Then of course, we have Bond and M, reduced as MI6's remnants, bracing for the last stand against Silva, confined in the 'Wayne Manor' that is 'Skyfall'. Seriously? We expected something more in the climax of a James Bond movie. Not a barrell gun shoot out where instead of Bond saving the world from the inevitable doom, he is struggling to save himself from a villain who is accompanied by 4 henchmen who are simply armed (by Bond movie standards) with machine guns. We could pass that off as a climax in a Jason Bourne series but not when you have the world's best secret agent, equipped with the top secret service's tools, facing an evil nemesis who is better than him. It seems as though the producers fell short in their budget and had to make do with a Scottish mansion to bring a damp end. Prior to its release, Adele's song built up a whole lot of curiosity when she sang, ""At the Skyfall, when it crumbles, we will stand tall and face it all, together""..... who knew it would all be about a House?<br/><br/>Judi Dench has a role so significant in a Bond movie, that it could pose as an Oscar contendor. She has done very well but we can now look forward to the brilliant Ralph Fiennes as he takes the new role in the series. The Bond girl deserves no mention since she was hardly on screen. MoneyPenny is cheeky with her humor but we would be more satisfied if she were a better eye candy than Naomie Harris. Javier Bardem was better than Silva, his character. He is among the finest actors who can enact any well written character especially in the negative role ('No Counry for Old Men') but Mendes failed at making Silva the best Bond villain ever when he had all the opportunity to do so. Daniel Craig is on his way to claiming the title of the Best Bond ever. Not only is he exemplary in the action sequences but he calmly portrays the sharpness, wit and commitment that makes 007 the best agent. <br/><br/>We've seen him get all serious for his love, for his parents, his mansion and his boss. We really don't want to see how good a father he can be. All the rebooting is done. Let's get the funness back in James Bond. Let Jon Favreau direct Bond #24. Bond isn't a common man. He is actually the uncommon one, the exceptional, the prodigy and Favreau knows such people very well. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.007 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"RoboDan","8","0","5","10 November 2012"," Bond for Sale!
","Now far be if from me to judge how the owners of a franchise - beloved or not - handle their product, however I am entitled to right to my own opinion. If you disagree, fine. I respect your right to.<br/><br/>We open with the can of worms that is product placement. While it was always somewhat present in the Bond films, it has never been so blatant or counter-Bond as it has become, especially in Skyfall. James Bond drinking beer? Driving a Mercedes? Using a freaking Sony Vaio and Xperia S (some of the worst junk in tech today bears the name Sony). I have never cringed so hard while watching a beloved movie character whose mystique was built over 50 years be sold off to the highest bidder. No self respecting government agency would use Sony Vaio laptops (did anyone else notice the wobbly-to-hell screen when Bond tapped it with ""that's the guy""). No secret agent would likely have a smartphone or iPhone without an OS that has the proper encryption. Bond would not shill for Heineken - a beer that is sold to the US by Holland which Dutch people will not drink because it is really that awful in comparison to European beer. <br/><br/>Bond once represented that which is refined - Vodka Martinis, Fine automobiles, a knowledge of Champagnes and Wines, Art and History, and even Science and technology. Now he really has been transformed into a skilled thug with a club. <br/><br/>While I like Daniel Craig in the role of secret agent, he never has been ""Bond"" and may never be. If things continue as they have, we might see him drive a Lexus, eat at Dominos Pizza or a street hot dog cart, and shotgun Jager with... well the women are still beautiful. At least that hasn't changed.<br/><br/>To borrow from the a prominent cliché in the film: It's a brave new world. It's Bond to the highest bidder."
"seta315","8","0","8","10 November 2012"," The ""New"" James Bond
","Sam Mendes's first shot as a Bond movie director was a huge success. Not only from the box office perspective (probably, since we do not have the definite numbers) but also in finishing the transition process between the (extremely and at times unnecessarily) cool, suave and somewhat dull Connery-style Bond, and the one we see in Skyfall.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig has showed us a much darker and colder Bond, with a lot more personality than its predecessors. This may be source of debate, but from my point of view this was a very positive change which allowed Craig's Bond to be more in touch with the audience. Audience that's not seeing a good-looking actor inside an expensive tuxedo drinking shaken but not stirred Martinis anymore, it is now seeing a much more human and vulnerable Bond.<br/><br/>Timothy Dalton started this transition. It is important to point out that he managed to give us a great movie (The Living Daylights), despite the usual, somewhat ridiculous scenes Bond had us used to at the time, such as the mountain chase on top of a cello or Joe Don Baker as the villain, Brad Whitaker (probably one of the dullest and less-evil villains in the 007 franchise ever).<br/><br/>Then of course came Pierce Brosnan, who I think is the one who built the road Daniel Craig is walking on today. The path of less martinis and more action, without leaving elegance and fortitude behind.<br/><br/>Coming back to Skyfall, it is a movie that traps you from the very first second. It is also a film that has an almost perfect mix of comedy, suspense, sadness and also a sensation that (cleverly attached to the movie title) makes you feel the sky is falling down. We get to see in this movie that the invincible James Bond, is not invincible anymore. We get to see a lonely Bond that has to complete his mission with little or no backup at all. There is no ""Plan B"", there's only a Bond trapped on a dead end.<br/><br/>All these features make of Skyfall a unique movie and a film that, without forgetting the old Bond we all like to see, gives us the first Bond that could be (please note I said ""could"", I am not a fortune- teller) in the folder that contains the names of the Academy Awards Nominees.<br/><br/>To end this review I have to say one more thing. This is a must-see. No fan of the 007 franchise that respects himself can let this movie disappear from the cinemas without watching it. 100% recommended."

","This is the third James Bond movie with Daniel Craig as Bond, and i must saw wow, this movie delivers action from the first scene to the last. But with that said, i must say that after my opinion, neither Skyfall or Quantum of solace could live up to the first one Casino Royal! Yes, they are pretty good, but Casino Royal was after my opinion fantastic, the best Bond movie ever made.. It's very cool that they got the original Bond car in this one, and many old Bond characteristics are used in Skyfall as well, so that's great! I love Daniel Craig, he's a wonderful actor, he delivers in every movie he's in, defiantly the best Bond ever, according to me! So if you haven't seen this movie yet, you got something to do on your list, you will not be disappointed! I will give this movie 8-10 stars!"
"jadepietro","9","0","8","10 November 2012"," Double A-Bond Rated
","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Bond, James Bond, may like his martinis shaken not stirred, but this latest installment of this popular movie franchise is far from shaky and quite a stirring example of how to make a perfectly synchronized action thriller. <br/><br/>Let us count the reasons that Skyfall, the 23rd Bond film in this series, is the best Bond movie since Goldfinger:<br/><br/>1. The foremost reason for the film's success is Daniel Craig as Mr. Bond, either fully clothed or the preferable shirtless variety. Craig may have the face of a longshoreman, but his tight sculpted body is probably the film's best visual effect ( and there are many from which to choose ). The actor has the physicality of a brutish daredevil one moment and a sophisticated playboy the next. His is the perfect combination in a perfect suited ( or unsuited ) role. Craig has become the strongest Bond since Connery and this is due to his common man status in playing this super-spy. He plays this role as a flawed loner, an anti-hero who loyalty to country and service are more important than his own self-being. It's all personal to him and that makes his interpretation even more exciting.<br/><br/>2. The film's screenplay by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan, keeps its ties to reality, unlike most of the previous installments. Though darker in mood and more somber in its focus, Skyfall achieves its goal as a suspenseful action-packed thriller with a more serious message of cyber-terrorism. Even if the script stretches the limits of logic with its dangerous action stunts at times, its central plot builds its tension from its well-written characters and their volatile situations. One scene realistically impacts on the next. <br/><br/>3. Skyfall is filled with action. The stunt work continues to amaze with its thrilling showmanship and staging. From its riveting opening fight scenes on various means of transportation to a chase in and under London's subway tunnels, the film easily delivers. In fact, the final action sequence is a bit of a letdown when compared to the other set pieces before it. ( Most effective: The Shanghai fight scene, well-choreographed and gorgeously lit, as silhouetted figures contrast against the bold neon-colored backdrops. Truly dynamic filmmaking. ) <br/><br/>4. A diabolical villain is yet another ingredient in the mix and Javier Bardem fills that role as Silva nicely. Although he doesn't make his appearance until an hour or so into the proceedings, the actor more than makes up for his elapsed screen time with his memorable performance. With his stark white mane and sinister laugh, Bardem uses all of his character's eccentricities to his fullest advantage. He even has some shared human moments to soften his villain before maiming and destroying anyone in his way. <br/><br/>5. The supporting cast adds greater interest to the story. Judi Dench brings her signature no- nonsense attitude to her continuing role as M, Bond's superior. She is the consummate actress in any role, large or small. New additions to the series are the beautiful Naomie Harris as Eve, Ben Whislaw as Q, the cyber and weapons geek, and Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, the overseer of the secret service division.<br/><br/>6. Sam Mendes is the director. Known more for his straight dramatic films like American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, Mendes acquits himself well in his first real action film. He stages his scenes well and keeps the action moving at a quick pace. He also doesn't neglect the dramatic storyline and the character's inter-relationships, making those elements as important to the film as the adrenaline rush of chases and explosions. One has to admire Mendes as he makes sure that the over-the-top temptation to focus more on gadgetry and super stunts are kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>7. The gadgets are still there. No, they are not as lavish as before, but they make logical sense and are used sparingly whenever possible. Why even the Aston Martin of yore is brought back to the plot, amid some applause from the movie-going audience! ( This film likes to relish in the mythology of its own series' history. )<br/><br/>8. Skyfall may have fewer Bond Ladies this time around, but they make their presences known and the actresses are more than merely shapely decorations and sexual objects on view. Both Bérénice Marlohe as Severin and the previously mentioned Ms. Harris add depth to their somewhat sketchy roles. <br/><br/>9. The exotic locations are back. Shanghai, Macao, Istanbul, Turkey, and Scotland are some of the backdrops for the many action sequences in Skyfall, adding to the fun and authenticity of the film.<br/><br/>10. Finally, the top-notch production values are absolutely stunning. The production design by Dennis Gassner is detailed and rich with atmosphere. Thomas Newman's score mixes John Barry's theme with Newman's own innovative music. The film editing by Stuart Baird is concise and edgy. Foremost is the sumptuous photography by the ever-talented Roger Deakins who creates such sweeping visual splendor in every scene, making Skyfall the kind of rousing big-budget entertainment needed to be seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>These ten reasons are reason enough to see Skyfall. Granted, so far this has been a lackluster year for films, but it is not faint praise to say that this is one of the better movies of 2012 or any year. No doubt about it, Skyfall is a real crowd-pleaser that will make a windfall for the studio. It just might be the first Bond film to earn a Best Picture nod too.

","Why yes the new Bond movie does feature James Bond as well as most of the trappings we associate with him – casinos, shootouts, chases, beautiful women and of course, a villain. This is the third Bond film feature Daniel Craig as James Bond (Casino Royale 2006, Quantum of Solace 2008) and once again features Judi Dench as M and introduces Naomi Harris as the lovely Eve Moneypenny and Ben Whishaw as the new Q.<br/><br/>What this film doesn't have is the misogynistic attitudes so prevalent in the early bond films, nor the suggestively named female sidekick/opponent. To make up for it they added plot. In fact this movie had more plot that I have ever seen in a Bond film, but it still starts out with an amazing car/motorcycle/train chase.<br/><br/>Bond has been sent to retrieve a hard drive with a list of agents planted in terrorist cells around the world. Arriving too late, he and Eve give chase. The chase ends when Eve is given the order to shoot the thief. She doesn't have a clear shot had ends up shooting Bond instead.<br/><br/>With Bond falling to his death 15 minutes into the film and the villain getting away, it makes you wonder where the story is going to go. The names of the agents are being released (5 per week), M is called in to answer to parliament, the MI6 building is bombed, everything is falling apart and there is no Bond is sight to save the day.<br/><br/>Okay, it's a Bond movie. No one expects that he is really dead, but he was trying to stay that way. Once he sees a news report he feels obligated to resurrect himself and return to M and Country. With him he brings the crucial clue to tracking down the man who had stolen the list of names. Despite his injuries, Bond returns to active duty to hunt him down and find the person behind the theft and bombing of their headquarters.<br/><br/>We are now about 30 minutes into the movie, like I said, they added plot, a lot of plot. This movie is all about the past, M's and Bonds. We learn a lot about the character's background, but none of it is filler. Everything has a point from M's time at the Hong Kong Branch to Skyfall. And there is no shortage of butt kicking action in any of the scenes. If someone isn't being chased, hit or shot they are being hacked by a computer genius.<br/><br/>From the beautifully choreographed opening credits to the dramatic end scene, this movie is all Bond all the way. If you are a fan you will enjoy this movie, if you like well done thriller/action movies, you will like this movie, if you are just watching for the naked chicks, you might try something else."
"axsun19","7","0","5","9 November 2012"," An old agent of M's comes back for revenge and his chase forces James Bond to use his old past to protect M.
","This movie is unlike any James Bond I have ever seen.<br/><br/>That is both a good and bad quality for this film.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a bang like any other typical Bond film, but then it slows down quite a bit. One can clearly tell that its director is from a darker, drama background rather than a high-octane Michael Bay resume. This is great news because it gives James Bond a much more human character than any previous movie. Bond actually feels like a man that can bleed, be scarred, be drunk, and get feeble. <br/><br/>But this darker, more in-depth look at Bond and M comes at a price, and that price is pacing. This movie doesn't so much sprint and stops to catch its breath, but rather, it gently trots along and sprints every now and then. Most of the action is in the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes. The entire middle section has sporadic action, but don't expect the usual Bond spectacle that we've all gotten used to. This is good in a way because it also doesn't get as ridiculous with the typical I-have-an-antimatter-satellite-in-space-made-out-of-gold Bond villain.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem plays a fantastic villain with a very simple goal: kill M. His character required him to play a man that's bitter but also eccentric and genius. He gets it perfect. He makes playing the character effortless. Daniel Craig also plays a less secure Bond than he did in first two. He was confident and arrogant, which made him seem naive. His Bond in this film is much more mindful that he's a bit more frail than he lets others see. He is more vulnerable this time around, and Craig carries that over seamlessly. But lets not forget Judi Dench in this movie because this is the most we have ever seen M. The story is actually from her point of view, and she has the most screen time out of any Bond film. It's nice to finally see M show more emotion and depth past handing out briefings. She comes off as a flawed boss who is more callous than Bond originally thought, but he is loyal to her nonetheless.<br/><br/>As a final note, the visuals in this movie are amazing. The colors and the compositions are of a true master director. Scaling landscape shots, saturated colors, silhouettes of fight scenes, and framing techniques make this film a treat for the eyes. The composition of shots stand out as startlingly interesting, and the color palette has a darker but saturated mood. This is a beautiful movie to watch. It is also physically darker than the rest, but I think that was a conscious choice by the Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes.<br/><br/>The script slowed down the action and excitement quite a bit to explore more depth and drama within Bond characters that we've never gotten a chance to see, but that drags the movie down at parts and you will definitely notice it. Don't go into this movie expecting the same kind of exciting action adventure Casino Royale brought to the table, but be prepared to have a slower feast that will probably leave you feeling more full at the end.<br/><br/>I recommend you see it for the fantastic acting, amazing visuals, and character depth. Just remember to see it with an open mind for change in the Bond formula, and don't go for just pure action or a super engaging script."
"scout121","8","0","7","9 November 2012"," A Dark Knight Tailored in a Tux
","I couldn't help but notice how similar this film felt to the dark knight, which I think is a very strong film. Skyfall runs on a parallel track evident in it's direction, plot, villain, and play between leads. And you know what? I don't care if it did, it worked.<br/><br/>Skyfall falls easily into Bond's top 5, if not top 3 go-arounds. The film holds it's own with the likes of Goldfinger, Goldeneye, and Craig's predecessor Casino Royale. I'm debating exactly where it will settle and having just viewed it, time will decide.<br/><br/>The best way to describe Skyfall is as almost a combination of those three Bond films mentioned. It pulls aspects from each: Goldfinger's strong antagonist, the villain's close relationship to MI6 as in Goldeneye, and Royale's/Craig's take on the franchise.<br/><br/>It subtlety hearkens back to the days of distinguished bond villains and memorable moments as with the pistol contest all while adhering to the new Bond feel. Later there are apparent calls to the originals with the inclusions of a classic car, familiar characters and drinks.<br/><br/>In fact, this film seems to actually bridge Craig's and Connery's world in a way with the set up of the new MI6, Q, and the transition of M and her secretary.<br/><br/>Skyfall not only succeeds as a great film and a strong performance for Craig but also acts as a farewell, thank you, and nod to Judi Dench and her M. Judi gets ample screen time and acts as an integral part of the film. Needless to say, as usual, Judi did not disappoint in her increased role. She was on point and delivered. Her performance is even more impressive given her unfortunate health condition. This film took a long time to get done and I'm sure Judi's health and age factored into the plot direction.<br/><br/>I believe the poor use and abundance of speed in Quantum of Solace was correctly noted because Skyfall makes sure to slow it down and does so in the right spots. I'm pretty sure Bardem isn't even revealed until the second half. The studio sure didn't shy away from Bardem's character either as his villain included an aspect most producers avoid. They made the right choice for more than one reason.<br/><br/>Not only is the movie done right but Adele provides a fitting, powerful theme as well.<br/><br/>And as for the film's faults, well, my main quip of the film is actually the little Bond horn snippets at the very beginning. I think it would have worked much better if they kept to only the natural scene sounds. Once he lands in the train cab than cue the full horns and theme. That's what I would have done anyway, but I know that's ticky-tacky.<br/><br/>Anyway, I would highly recommend Skyfall not just to Bond fans new and old, but also to the everyday popcorn lover."

","Bond is back in the most spectacular fashion imaginable. In his 3rd outing as Bond, Daniel Craig now owns the role and is likely to have it for as long as he wants it. Director Sam Mendes, an Oscar winner for ""American Beauty"" has given us the best Bond film since ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". Bond has never been so human. Mendes's background as a theater director serves his especially well here with the spectacular entrance of the best Bond villain ever, Silva, played brilliantly by Javier Bardem. He also reintroduces the classic Aston Martin DB5 in another brilliant entrance. Judi Dench as M does her best work in the role and her final scene is one of the most poignant in the series history. Lest we forget this is a Bond film and as such has its share of great action sequences, the highlight being the best precredit sequence in series history. Ben Whishaw makes a delightfully droll ""Q"" and the final scene is utter perfection.

","After seeing Skyfall, I have to confess that I have mixed feelings, so I'll make a list of the things I liked about the movie, and things I did not like, and then I shall reach my conclusions. Things I liked 1. after 17 long years the producers finally decided to remove that old lady good for nothing Judi Dench (who have the bright idea of making an old lady, neurotic, and bipolar, M?) 2. After 50 years and 23 films, we finally have a look (very shallow) about Bond's life before joining the British Secret Service, In GoldenEye we knew that his parents died in a car accident, but now we know that his father was called Andrew Bond and an his mother Monique and that he was born and raised in Scotland, and we knew one, of his babysitters, Kingcade, and of course that he hated his parents' old house. 3. After 10 years of absence we see again Q and Moneypenny, and I think they did not disappoint, nor the new M disappoints. 4. Subtle references to the 22 previous films of the franchise and others not so subtle, a gay assassin, (The Diamonds are Forever), Aston Martin ASD5 (Goldfinger, Thunderball and Casino Royale) the ""death"" of Bond at the beginning of the movie (You Only Live Twice), the gun with sensors that respond to Bond's touch (License to kill), the murderer who uses bullets rare, expensive and difficult to find (the Man with the Golden gun), a renegade MI6 agent (GoldenEye), an explosion at the headquarters of MI6 (The World is not Enough), Q giving Bond a Walter PPK (Dr No) Bond chase by a helicopter (From Russia with Love), Bond on a frozen lake (The Living Daylights), Bond throwing a knife with deadly force (For Your Eyes Only), Bond fighting on the roof of a train (Octopussy) Bond bearded (Die Another Day), mention the ancestors of Bond (on Her Majesty's Secret Service), a motorcycle chase on rooftops (Tomorrow Never Dies) Bond looking for a microchip at the beginning of the movie (A View to a Kill), Bond with a not very clever black female companion (Live and let die), and Bond killing a guy who could provide a vital clue to the whereabouts of the villain (Quantum of Solace) Things I did not like:<br/><br/>Two things i don't like it first, it's to believe for a normal human being survive a shot by a high powered rifle, dropped from a height of over 50 meters into the water, drop by a waterfall and still barely survive without sequels! that's it! , even for those who are hardcore, James Bond fans, that's too much to believe! second, why in the name of heaven, they didn't put the bloody gun barrel sequence at the beginning of the movie!!!!

","Elegantly made action, with stunning and sexy Daniel Craig, who is unfortunately is getting older for the role of James Bond, and it's not his fault, frankly, for his age he looks better than young men in their 25th or 30th, but in our time of HD quality and screens, all hi bones and birth-scars are so palpable on his face. Anyway, I'm happy that all James Bond's films are made with it's special touch that lives through generations: super expensive cars, exotic locations, best watches, stylish suites in which he is capable to do all stunts, minimum two gorgeous models, romantic scenes, outstanding weapons, and of course great soundtracks! By all these we can say YES, it's about 007 Agent, that's Bond. James Bond. First thing that grabbed my attention was precast sequence. They were doing it around 3 months, along with Adele's soundtrack ""Skyfall"", and it looks amazing with all special effects and fantastic scenes. Second thing I loved, was almost last scene, where Bond faced his villain (Javier Bardem) and he didn't use his usual modern weapon, instead he took his father's old hunter's gun, it was quite impressive. But finally Bond made it with simple knife... That was also new to his style. Story-line was very predictable and it was used in many other action movies,and you will not see anything special in this one, but still all fans of Bond's Films should watch it just for mark and for respect of the Filmmaking Team. They did it really well."

","When I walked in to see this movie, I had a firm expectation that this will be sure a fiery one and bingo it did from the start!!!. Daniel Craig reprises his role as 007 and has portrayed it extremely well. Of the 3 he has done so far as 007, I would rank this as his 2nd best (after Casino Royale). I feel that Craig portrays the 'human' blend of the super spy stunningly well. He brings out the darker side of the character by way of his emotions. Kudos to him for his excellent portrayal of the character. Dame Dench puts in a superb performance as well as 'M'. It was a bit sad to see her character being handed over to Ralph Fiennes. However, the lady packs punch when it comes to acting. Ben Wishaw as the new 'Q' also impresses. We get to see that the new actors are getting blended into their (future) characters very well. Naomie as Eve &/ Moneypenny is impressive too. Bernice did not had much to do in the movie. Special mention to Javier Bardem for his good portrayal of the villain character. The one I really enjoyed in the movie was the humor throughout.<br/><br/>Kudos to Sam Mendes for his great directorial work. Cinematography by Deakins is great as well. The interest on the story holds on because of the cinematography by Deakins and excellent editing by Baird. However, the director could have kept the show a bit crisp towards the end although it still musters through because of the action sequence in the climax.<br/><br/>Special kudos to the producers from my end for keeping the interest in the 007 series alive and kicking. I feel that Craig is one of the best Bond selections to have been ever made (if not the best!). Looking forward to see Craig in action for couple more of 007.<br/><br/>My rating would be a 8 out of 10. I would have voted more if not for the dragging towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Regards, Ganesh."

","After Casino Royal and Quantum of Solace I had very low expectations for this movie. Yeah, those two were average (or just above) action movies, but not really Bond-movies. MI6 was totally out of the picture, Bond was only killing but had nothing left of his charm. It had just nothing to do with 007. <br/><br/>So with expectations at a very low point I went to see Skyfall in the local cinema. And boy, how wrong were my expectations! <br/><br/>All what was wrong in the last two movies has been undone. MI6 is back in the picture, Bond operates in the name of Britain instead for personal vendettas and there are moments in the movie were the charms of Bond are back. I loved it."

","The name is Bond .... 'James Bond' of course!!<br/><br/>James Bond – everybody needs a hobby Villain – so what's yours? James Bond – (cryptic and sardonic as ever) resurrection<br/><br/>Yes the man with the most famous alpha male sir name is back and is he is on a resurrection drive. The movie starts with an elaborately mounted action sequence starting from a non descript marketplace in the latest low cost location for shoots (a busy marketplace in turkey) staged on all man –made machines – mini truck, motorbike, train , JCB machine culminating in a man to man fist fight with Mr Bond and a random villain fighting it out till death do us apart and then James Bond is shot by one of the MI6 Agents accompanying him on the wild goose chase.<br/><br/>James Bond is pronounced dead and his obituary is written in an appalling manner by Madame M . The security of the MI 6 agents are compromised as there is a creepy villain- Silvia who has an old axe to grind with Madame M and he hacks into the security system of MI 6 containing classified information causing mayhem by revealing lucid details of the Agents to all the terrorist organizations of the world Bond does come back from the dead with a day old stubble and crinkly eyes to save the Madame M from the ignominy of a fast looming retirement and save the world at large from the menacing villain. As per his job requirements (would love to have a look at his job description ) he criss crosses across Shanghai and Macau bedding the mole to get to the elusive villain . There is quite a bit of intrigue build around Silvia and the way his devilish mind work ( He's all blonde hair and matching eyebrows and can build a story out of rats – inspiration from the pied piper story gone bland ) Bond does need a villain who is more substance than style and Silvia does pack a mean punch. Silvia does get caught by the MI6 and there is a certain element of suspicion on how such a crafty villain is captured so easily a few frames later one understands the bigger reason for his capture and how he benefits from it. The film in a nutshell is a revenge drama between a deranged person ( ex agent gone hostile) and the indestructible Madame M with James Bond caught in the crossfire.<br/><br/>The film makes James Bond appear very vulnerable, an irresistible potion of no nonsense and old fashioned stubbornness( yes he does have a thing for objects which are sharp – complementary for the morning ablutions and killing the villain in the end) and senor does fill into the suits well minus the accompanying belt. One just feels he likes to get on with job and has the gambling instincts of a street fighter- raw and visceral Judi Dench as Madame M is solid as ever and carries her reputation as a no nonsense hard taskmaster with elan .There are a few additions to the supporting cast ( we will be seeing more of Ralph Fiennes in future installments, Q has a younger , nerdy avatar and there is a back story on the introduction of Eve Money Penny). Javier Bardem as Silvia is creepy and and creates the aura of a wily villain ( read – Joker from Dark Night minus the clownish makeup) and this is one villain who has bad dentures and a smooth face The film has quite a few stand out moments. Primarily – the electric introduction scene between James Bond and Silvia ( a hint of homoerotic happiness here) , the brilliantly shot action sequences which speak a language and have a color of its own ranging from the gun fight in the minister's office to the pre climax action sequence which incidentally is brilliantly shot against the dull ,dreary climate of Scotland . Hell there's even trivia on James Bond's parents and where he spent his formative years.<br/><br/>The film looks beautiful and the color as well as the tenor changes as the story develops from the busy market place of turkey to the myriad dragons of Macau and the skyscrapers of shanghai City. The villain fittingly is killed in an old run down church (resurrection remember)<br/><br/>The Film has everything for James Bonds Aficionados in plenty and there's one more coming soon to a theater near you."

","An incredible cast brings Bond...'back to the future' in this 50th anniversary masterpiece. Daniel Craig certainly is the best Bond since the legendary Sean Connery , and there 's no skimping on action. Showing the frailties of age and a more human side to 007 makes one uncomfortable at first as one is not used to such 'mortal consequences' when watching a Bond film, however as the movie progresses confidence is quickly restored as the real action kicks in and one can't help but think, 'Bond is back!' The references to the long history of Bond are many but when the twang of the guitar from the original theme kicks in as the Master Spy's comeback materializes is probably the most energizing one of all, especially for those old enough to have lived through a good number of original releases.<br/><br/>I would have loved to give the film a ten, but cannot as it does have a few shortcomings, but none that significantly impacts the film. A definite must see!"
"akash_sebastian","8","0","10","4 November 2012"," A True Resurrection indeed (after the 'Quantum of Solace' debacle)
","One of the best Bond films in the 50-year old franchise; it's a thrilling and gripping ride. Sam Mendes may have implemented a few key moments from his inspiration (Dark Knight Trilogy), but they work out for the best; the movie is smart, emotionally deep and thematically resonant. Mendes' love for character depth is clearly seen as he weaves such well-knit relationships and interactions among the characters.Roger Deakins' cinematography really stands out and adds to the storytelling.<br/><br/>Mendes' makes Silva one the most well-defined, scarred and intriguing Bond villains. With a different hairstyle and a different villainous character ('No Country for Old Men' being the other one), Javier Bardem plays the role with such alluring brilliance, it's impossible to take your eyes off him. <br/><br/>From 'Casino Royale' to 'Skyfall', Daniel Craig, with the help of his directors, has taken the character to it's third dimension. James Bond no longer looks like a playboy secret-agent solving missions with his cool gadgets, but there's a side of him which is emotionally-scarred, faithful and ruthless. Craig's cavalier attitude, and his comic timing are truly impeccable; he delivers his dialogues with such ease and charisma. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes seems like an appropriate addition to the 007 cast. Judi Dench's role as Madame M is remarkable as always. And this time, we get to see more of her due to the masterstroke idea of exploring the subtle, and usually overlooked, relationship between M and Bond. The Bond Series' resurrection, after the 'Quantum of Solace' debacle, can be well put in the verses recited by M from Tennyson's 'Ulysses': 'We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.'"

It's not spoiling anything telling he does so this time too.<br/><br/>No, they don't just hit each other or shoot each other or go to bed with each other. The people are since a couple of films ago more complicated and the action is not so much computer animation here. And if it is, it's much better made.<br/><br/>OK, the world is saved again, like it has for 50 years and we can certainly look forward to another 50 years as long as audiences don't lose interest.

","http://reviewpoint-trendz.blogspot.in/ Bond's loyalty to M is tested as her past comes back to haunt her. As MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost. The Name's Bond.....James Bond. Its been 50 Years of Bond. One of the largest Movie Franchisee and a Name that doesn't need any introduction. Daniel Craig's third film as Bond, Skyfall. After five years of wait and one of the most publicized movie of this year, Skyfall was surely anticipated by many Action Movie fans especially the Bond Fans. Well Daniel Craig portrays his role with pure perfection as Bond, His Mid Life crisis is portrayed with great detail and it seems as we know him from years. The Cinematography and Direction by Sam Mendes was great and doesn't disappoint at all. Where all the action scenes from the starting of Istanbul to Scotland's Climax are engaging and Awesome. They keep you wanting for more. This Film shows less of Bond's Girl and more of his own problems. Larger than life ideas and unexpected turns are regular. though the movie in between gets slaggy and slow loosing its pace. where the audience gets bored and demands Bond back in action. Even the Soundtrack of the movie is average. Skyfall is a must see for every bond fan out there as it surely wont disappoint them. Other action fans can get disappointed as we have seen better flicks past in the year where Skyfall doesn't even compete. Action and Daniel Craig are the highs of the movie where as the pace can be considered a low point. Overall the direction and Daniel Craig's performance keeps the movie's standards up and can be seen by any Action hungry fan out there. 007 is Back and with a Bang."
"aaduthoma","6","0","6","4 November 2012"," Resurrection of James Bond? Not really.
","I watched Skyfall on the third day it got released. I had read many reviews prior to watching it, many of it calling it the best Bond movie ever, a fitting tribute to coincide with its 50 year history. Also many compared the Daniel Craig-James Bond trilogy to the Batman trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan. Personally, the movie failed to impress me. The starting action sequence was good (but not as good as that of Casino Royale).The story as a whole was average without any high point or twists. Daniel Craig's performance as James Bond is again awesome. To me, he is the best Bond till date. Judy Dench as M and Ben Whishaw as the young Q are excellent. Javier Bardem as the cold and calculating villain is also good. At many instances, I couldn't stop comparing him to Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. This does not imply that Bardem was extraordinarily great as Silva, but I occasionally felt Bardem's character and some of the scenes he was in having a close resemblance to that of Joker's from The Dark Knight. The first encounter scene between Bond and the young Q is worth watching again. I think the movie tries to highlight the human aspects of the characters (read loyalty, trust, patriotism, belief, sentimentality etc).Midway through the movie, Silva asks Bond what his hobby is, to which he replies resurrection. May be the makers wanted to reinvent the Bond franchise by doing something different like the emotional aspects of James Bond, the absence of super duper gadgets and use of raw action and scenes of bleeding or crying Bond. Casino Royale has covered it all and that too even better.<br/><br/>Verdict 1 Skyfall is just an average Bond flick. It feels different may be because deviates a lot from the usual Bond formula. I personally feel that Casino Royale is the best Bond film till date. Skyfall comes no way near to Casino Royale. 2 Comparing Craig-James Bond trilogy to the Batman-Christopher Nolan one is a huge joke. 3 Is it the resurrection of the James Bond franchise? Not really.<br/><br/>PS 1 It seems Istanbul is the flavor of Hollywood. The last 3 movies I have seen in the past 3 weeks all feature Istanbul. Taken 2 was shot almost entirely in Istanbul, Argo has some shots of Istanbul and Skyfall's opening action is in Istanbul. Way to go. 2 Bonds standing posture in many scenes has a striking similarity to the trademark posture of Cristiano Ronaldo before he takes his free kicks. 3 James Bond will return!!!"
"ragingbull_2005","8","0","8","3 November 2012"," Totally awesome. Bond at his very best
","This is the Bond movie which the fans have been waiting for. After the very disappointing Quantum of Solace, Skyfall brings the series back on track and it does that splendidly well. Right from the adrenaline boosting opening action/chase sequence to the development of characters, this is among the top 5 entries in the series which recently celebrated 50 years. There are references to Bond's past which hasn't been touched in any of the other movies. Daniel Craig again essays the intense Bond to perfection. Judi Dench gets extended screen time here as M and she is as old and as good as usual. Ralph Fiennes as her boss is competent. But the real show stopper is Javier Bardem. With hair reminiscent of Christopher Walken in one of the Roger Moore flicks, he is evil personified as he destroys everything in his path of vengeance. The background score is haunting with Adele performing a terrific ""Skyfall"". The direction is terrific with Sam Mendes shooting some really great scenes in some of the most scenic locales of the world. The second half of the movie belongs to him and will keep you on the edge of your seats.Overall, this is Bond at his very best and should not be missed by any fan of Bond or good thrillers. 4 out of 5."

"Rome723","Null","0","6","3 November 2012"," Bond is back!
","I went to the cinema with big expectations and I have to admit I, it was really great. The opening sequence contained much of the material of the first minutes; much suspense was taken away. After a few minutes there was the usual sequence, where the main actors and responsible persons are showed. This part was very well animated, but unfortunately this part gives you many hints what is going to happen later on, they are not in the right order, but even so I did not really like it. After this scene there is a part where there is neither suspense nor some really good story, this is probably the worst part, but on a very good level of course. About the first half of the film I would say it was good, but if the trailer would not show us some key points to would have been even better. The second part of the movie was even better than the first, much action, suspense, but never overdone as it was in A Quantum Of Solace. At the end there is one totally surprising turnaround, therefore I absolutely do not recommend the read any text/review which tells you the end, especially the very end, it would be such a pity.<br/><br/>Overall I have to say: The old Bond is back with his sarcastic jokes, Daniel Craig did a really good job. Q and another important character have returned to screen. There is a good mixture of shooting locations; the setting is always appropriate and well done. The camera work and the cutting were also very good; it sometimes took you right into the middle of the action. The guys from the VFX division did a good job and luckily did not overdo it. A negative point is the trailer, which took away much suspense in the first half of the film. The story was good and always made you wanting to know what is going to happen next, but the story is not like the old Bond stories by Ian Fleming and this kind of story can only be used once, you will know why when you have seen the end. Last but not least the score was very nice, not only Adele's title song, the whole score was good."

"yannigk","8","0","6","1 November 2012"," Best Bond movie yet
","This is by far the best Bond movie yet. <br/><br/>I don't even like Daniel Craig to start with, but he delivers so well. The script is very well written, delving into Bond's past, his insecurities & fears. There's not a moment where I felt bored in the movie.<br/><br/>Characters were great: Judi Dench's M is impeccable, as always. Ben Whishaw & Finnes were also top-notch. Javier Bardem is going to be one of the best villains in movie history. He's creepy and annoying and cruel and unpredictable. I also have to applaud Berenice Marlohe, one of the Bond girls in the film. Her subtle but emotional performance is way beyond any other Bond girls before her. I would love to see her films more! This is the only Bond movie where I actually felt that all the characters had depth and purpose, and made me feel attached to each of them.<br/><br/>Action-wise is definitely nice too. Unlike previous Bond movies (I'm referring to pre-Daniel Craig films) I always thought Mission Impossible's Ethan Hawke was the better spy, but now James Bond is just badass.<br/><br/>What I love the most is the cinematography. It is beautifully crafted, with many scenes involving silhouettes. You'd have to see it to understand just how beautiful the colors are when projected on screen.<br/><br/>Adele's theme music is also great, combined with again the best opening titles as of yet. Just the opening titles itself was worth the ticket (probably also because i'm an animator)! It's a fascinating combination of 3D and 2D, story symbols, and classic Bond colors/themes."
"eatfirst","8","0","5","1 November 2012"," Successful blend of Bond old and new, and looking great.
","When, just a few years ago, Bond was stunningly re-invented with Casino Royale (new Bond, new grittier, leaner style, and starting over with his career chronology from year dot), there was but one element carried over from the bloated tail-end of the Brosnan era: Dame Judi Dench's powerful, acerbic, matriarchal ""M"". How Sam Mendes and his team behind this latest adventure must be thanking their lucky stars for that decision, for without her there could be no Skyfall. This is a story, more than any other Bond before in all its 50 years, that doesn't revolve around 007. He is the hurricane of action that revolves around her, the eye at the centre of the storm.<br/><br/>After the unmemorable and confusing mess that was Quantum Of Solace, it takes about two seconds to establish that we are back in safe, familiar Bond territory, with a blistering opening chase, leavened by touches of sly wit. What then follows is a confident, pacey, well handled thriller, that front- loads most of the big set-pieces and espionage shenanigans in the first hour, before stripping down in a surprising but effective change of mood to something simpler, starker and emotionally more engaged.<br/><br/>Worthy of high praise indeed is Roger Deakins' beautiful cinematography. This is almost certainly the most stunningly photographed of any Bond movie. Segments set in Shanghai (or sound-stages purporting to be Shanghai) are bathed in a rich, noirish black and orange glow and framed with gobsmacking detail and poise. One particular standout fight, brief and brutal, is viewed entirely in silhouette against a languorously drifting illuminated backdrop from a single near-motionless viewpoint. His camera moves with such effortless elegance it's almost mocking the post-Bourne shaky-cam intensity that all other action movies now feel they somehow have to ape.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig seems less of a revelation this time round, but this is no bad thing. He's utterly comfortable in the role now, and we are comfortable with him. It's astounding to remember now the controversy and vitriol that accompanied his casting in the role not so long ago. The supporting cast is about the strongest a Bond movie has ever been blessed with, so much so that it's occasionally a tad disappointing that some of these characters don't get more time to shine (The wonderful Naomie Harris in particular gets relegated to the background far too soon), but hopefully this sets up one or two for good use another day.<br/><br/>But performance wise, it is Dench's ""M"" that anchors Skyfall. She's central to the most significant scenes and gets the meatiest and most touching dialogue. Hard-edged, bold and feisty, but with subtly evinced layers of regret and vulnerability, she gives this movie its beating heart.<br/><br/>Less successful perhaps are the machinations of Javier Bardem's full-tilt baddie. He can of course play unhinged, disturbing full-on wrongness better than just about anyone alive, as No Country For Old Men easily attests, and is great fun in the role. But the motivations and logic behind the events leading to the third act feel unfocused and ill-conceived, making the stakes seem perhaps a touch less perilous than in the best Bonds of yore.<br/><br/>Overall though, none of these minor misgivings really surfaced until sometime after leaving the cinema. For a near two-and-a-half hour movie, Skyfall barrels along just fine, delivering thrills and cool in equal, well-balanced measure, and booting you out at the end with a big smile on your face. Job done."
"npoddar05","8","0","6","1 November 2012"," Craig sets highest standards for Bond !!.. Truly a Masterpiece !
","Skyfall brings a very good news for old Bond lovers who missed Moneypenny, Q and cool gadgets in previous two movies. Daniel has proved once again himself to be the best Bond ever. Javier was just perfect as Bond villain. Skyfall is more about personal vengeance than any security threat to England. The movie is bit lengthy but works fine with Sam Mendes's cutting edge direction. Daniel has once again showed how physically fit he is with another great chase scene.It's all about things happened between Casino Royale and Dr.No. Skyfall standouts as the perfect homage to 50 years of Bond franchise. The movie feels like classic 60's Bond movie. Highly recommended !!"
